{"date": "19 Nov 2016", "body": "\n I read  this article  earlier and it and the response to it on twitter has greatly disturbed me.  \n *Content warning for the article- parent literally calling her disabled adult daughter \"damaged goods\" and discussion of adult woman's personal care needs.* \n \n I am saddened and angry at how this story has been framed. There are multiple human rights abuses described in the article. The article itself adds a new breach of Siobhan's rights- the right to privacy by discussing her intimate personal care needs in public. I am frankly disgusted by how her mother describes her:  \n \n \n \u201cSorry. I\u2019m going to be very straight about it: she\u2019s not special. She\u2019s damaged goods. I wanted the child that I thought I was going to have. The one that was going to have two children by now, and have finished university studies, and be having a life for herself, in a home where I could visit and babysit my grandchildren. I wanted to have that child.\u201d \n That's not how being a parent works. You bring a child into the world and you do your best for them but you can't plan a life for them that fits around your fantasy. \n \n On twitter this is being heralded as brave honesty- that finally a parent is breaking the taboo of how hard caring is. That's bullshit. There's an article every day about how hard parenting disabled kids is. There's no end of parents sharing their innermost thoughts about the child they wished they'd had instead of the damaged one they got. Seriously type \"care disabled son or daughter\" into Google or twitter to see how mainstream and non-taboo this narrative is.  \n \n There are stories each year of parents who go so far as to murder their disabled offspring (both adults and children) and every single time, there is a flurry of voices talking of how caring and loving the murderous parent is and how they ended life out of love and mercy. Anyone who objects to this despicable narrative is asked to \"walk a mile in the killer's shoes\" as though those asking that people don't murder disabled people are the cruel ones. In the light of this common narrative, I think Rosita Boland who wrote this article and the Irish Times which published it have to think again about the way they framed this story and their duty to Siobhan herself.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I am even more disgusted by the callous dereliction of duty by the Irish state. There appears to be no moves to investigate what Siobhan wants or what is in her best interests. She needs access to an independent disability advocate trained in non-instructed  advocacy  as soon as possible to work out what she is entitled to and how to achieve it. Her parents are being dumped on by a system that has abandoned people with high support needs, treating them as second class citizens. If Siobhan's human rights are respected, her parents will benefit.  \n \n So much for a country in which those in power seek praise for their so called pro-life laws.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/minding-my-disabled-daughter-i-don-t-want-to-do-this-anymore-1.2872341", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tGY9kZL31gw/WDBK4BMAldI/AAAAAAAABlg/E2IGsqzmbGkN5X1y6S6zSMdq9zFEGkkOACLcB/s1600/disability-rights.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2016/11/disability-caring-and-rights.html", "title": "\nDisability, Caring and Rights\n"},
{"date": "21 Apr 2015", "body": "\n \n In 2013 I submitted as assignment on autistic people's writings as part of my Masters in Autism (Adults) for the University of Birmingham. The title of the topic as set by the university and my essay follows:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n There\nis an ever-increasing body of literature from people diagnosed with\nautism who are willing to share their experiences. Discuss and\nevaluate the potential impact of this body of literature upon other\npeople on the autistic spectrum, upon autism researchers and upon\nproviders of support and services. \n \n \n \n This\nessay will describe the growing body of writing by autistic writers,\nparticularly that which has flourished with the general increase in\ninternet availability. It will show evidence of the significant\nimpact these authors have had on research, on support and service\nprovision and on the lives and experiences of other autistic people\nand their families, including the author\u2019s own. Finally it will\nexamine how autistic writings could impact even further in these\nareas in the future. \n \n \n \n The\nessay follows the convention as in Sinclair (1999) of employing the\nterm \u2018autistic person\u2019 rather than \u2018person with autism\u2019. In\nthe author\u2019s experience, the majority of autistic people, including\nautistic writers, have expressed a preference for this terminology. \n \n \n \n Before\nexamining the literature, I shall provide some illustration of the\nimpact of autistic writings from a personal perspective. \n My\nson was diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Condition when he was two\nyears old and I read widely to determine how best to support and help\nhim. All the books I read were written by autism professionals and\nwhile they were extremely helpful, I still had more questions than\nanswers so I sought help online. The first websites I perused\npredicted dire outcomes for my (at the time) non-verbal son unless I\nengaged him immediately in biomedical or intensive behavioural\ntherapy and they presented autism as a facet of the person that could\nbe removed with just the right type and level of intervention. These\nwebsites encouraged me to aim to make him \u2018indistinguishable from\nhis peers\u2019 but investigation of the techniques promising to\nnormalise my autistic son established that their claims were based on\nlittle to no conclusive evidence. Instead I enrolled him in a\nspecialist nursery school and he received speech and language\ntherapy, the primary benefit of which was teaching me better ways to\nengage him and promote his communication. \n \n \n \n In\ntime I took part in a National Autistic Society (NAS) EarlyBird\nprogramme which aims to support parents of pre-school autistic\nchildren by \u2018empowering and helping them facilitate their child's\nsocial communication and appropriate behaviour in their natural\nenvironment.\u2019 (National Autistic Society, n.d.). I also joined a\nsupport email list with a membership comprising autistic adults and\nthe parents of autistic children and young people. Via these I\ndiscovered the books of well known autistic authors like Temple\nGrandin and Donna Williams and for the first time read personal\naccounts of autistic lives and experiences. \n \n \n \n Around\nthe same time I found the site \u2018Ooops...Wrong Planet!\u2019 run by a\nCanadian autistic woman (Norman-Bain, n.d.) which at the time\ncontained articles about all aspects of autism, most written by\nautistic people. One of the most challenging and ultimately\ntransformative articles I read then was \u2018Don\u2019t Mourn For Us\u2019\n(Sinclair, 1993) in which parents are invited to join autistic adults\n\u2018in strength and determination, in hope and in joy\u2019 to teach,\ncare and advocate for autistic children. These writings helped me\nchange my goals for my son; from then I wished to accept and embrace\nhis autism, to maximise his potential, to increase his opportunities\nand to work towards making the world a better place for people like\nhim. \n \n \n \n In\n2006 I started to blog about my children, their education and autism\n(McDaid, 2006) and I joined other parents of autistic children,\nautism professionals and autistic adults in a blogging collective;\nThe Autism Hub. This led to the steepest part of my learning curve on\nautism and disability mainly due to the interactive nature of\nblogging. The articles and blog posts I read by autistic authors and\nthe discussions we had, challenged my thinking and assumptions on the\nmost fundamental aspects of our shared humanity. Some of the autistic\nwriters I connected with over the years became good friends, many\nwere able to advise me on issues I faced raising my autistic son and\nall helped to deepen my understanding of disability and autism. \n \n \n \n According\nto Baggs (2006) the first published autistic author was David Eastham\nwhose book of poetry was published in 1985 (Eastham et al., 1985).\nSince then dozens of books and book chapters have been written by\nautistic writers, many of whom have gained recognition among the\ngeneral public. One such writer is Daniel Tammet whose memoir \u2018Born\non a Blue Day\u2019 was a best-seller (Tammet, 2006) and who appears\nfrequently on television and radio shows. Also well known is Temple\nGrandin who has written 8 books, the first of which was published in\n1986 (Grandin and Scariano, 1986) and who was the subject of the\nsemi-autobiographical TV movie, \u2018Temple Grandin\u2019 (2010). \n \n \n \n But\nthe real revolution started when autistic people began to congregate\nonline in increasing numbers to self-advocate, offer support, share\ninformation, socialise, educate and entertain. They wrote about the\nrepresentation of autism in the media. They reached out to parents\ntelling us how we could better understand and support our children\n(Grantham, 2011) and encouraging us to become more informed allies\n(Schwarz, 2004). They have written on how we must work towards real\nand meaningful inclusion (Evil Autie, 2013). They expressed\njustifiable anger for the abuses, vilification, silencing and neglect\nthey have endured. They proved their resilience and strength, their\nbravery and compassion in the way they supported each other and\ncontinued to fight for their rights. \n \n They\nfound common ground with the general disability rights movements,\nrejected the prevailing medical model of autism, promoted social\nmodel ideas based on the concept \u2018nothing about us without us\u2019\nand clarified that they are the real experts on autism. They faced\ntremendous barriers in their efforts to instigate a rights-based\nmodel of autism advocacy. Their ideas have been misrepresented and\nthey have even been accused of lying about their diagnoses  (Lutz,\n2013) .\nBut they forge on and via their writings, autistic people proved that\nbeing unable to talk is not synonymous with having nothing to say.  \n \n \n \n \n Autistic\nwriters introduced the concept of \u2018neurodiversity\u2019: \n \n \n \n \u2018\u2026  a\nword that has been around since autistic people started putting sites\non the internet. It has since been expanded to include not just\npeople who are known as \"autistics and cousins\", but to\nexpress the idea that a diversity of ways of human thinking is a good\nthing, and dyslexic, autistic, ADHD, dyspraxic and tourettes people\nto name but a few all have some element in common not being\nneurotypical in the way our brains work.\u2019 \n \n (Arnold,\nn.d.) \n \n \n \n The\ncrux of neurodiversity is that it is \u2018part of the general idea that\ndisabled people should have human rights\u2019 (Dawson, 2007). \n \n \n \n Clearly\nautistic people don\u2019t comprise a homogenous community. As in any\ndisparate collection of people, disagreements are common but people\nspeaking their mind and sharing their perspectives leads to positive\nchange. \n \n \n \n Autistic\npeople diagnosed with different categories of autism, from disparate\nbackgrounds and possessing a variety of skills have contributed to\nthis growing body of work. They may be university educated or living\nin a group home or have experienced homelessness. Some communicate\nusing forms of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC),\nothers have high levels of verbal acuity. A number of them require\nhelp with many aspects of everyday life, others are raising families\nor running large companies. There are autistic writers who share\ntheir desire to cure their condition. Many have co-existing medical\nconditions or write about the intersection of autism with other\naspects of their lives. There are people who fit all the previous\ndescriptions in some ways or at some times and more yet who defy\ncategorisation but all share characteristics that define autism. \n \n \n \n The\ndemocratisation of writing via the internet has meant that people no\nlonger must find a publisher before their ideas can be shared with\nthe public. Moreover, comments sections and social media sites like\nTumblr, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter encourage interaction so there\nare fewer passive readers but a growing group of participating\nreaders and writers. The tools for communicating online continue to\nchange in pace with technological advances and autistic writers are\nadept at using every means available to share their messages. \n \n \n \n This\nbody of literature by autistic writers has demonstrably impacted\nsignificantly on other autistic people. My understanding of my own\nautistic son has been enhanced by all the articles and books by\nautistic writers I have read over the years and our interactions.\nThey helped me reach acceptance of his condition faster than I\notherwise would have and raised my expectations for his future\nhappiness. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Autistic\nwriters have been successful in getting their messages across on\ntheir own blogs and forums but also via mainstream media. Although\nthe typical depiction of autism in the mainstream media is still of a\nyoung child and the negative impact on the family of the child\u2019s\ndisability, articles based on interviews with autistic self-advocates\nare also reaching wide audiences. Saner (2007) reported in The\nGuardian on autistic self-advocates and allies. More recently, The\nGuardian had an article about businesses seeking out autistic\nemployees and the autistic young people making a success in their\ncareers (Hill, 2013) which will impact on and encourage other\nautistic people. \n \n \n \n Hacking\n(2009) writes about \u2018autism narratives\u2019 which \u2018are creating the\nlanguage in which to describe the experience of autism, and hence\nhelping to forge the concepts in which to think autism.\u2019 He\nconsiders four published autistic authors and suggests that autism\nfiction and autobiographies will influence future generations of\nautistic writers \u2018who will give accounts that are textured by the\nearly exposure to role models.\u2019 He also explores the tendency for\npublishers to insist that these autobiographies provide otherwise\nimpossible glimpses \u2018inside the [autistic] mind\u2019 a claim, he says\nis lacking in their promotion of non-autistic biographies. \n \n \n \n McGeer\n(2009) writing about Hacking (2009) suggests that autistic peoples\u2019\nwritings have an immense impact on other autistic people: \n \n \n \n \u2018 As\ntheir external environment changes\u2014as it becomes more enriched from\nthe perspective of offering more informed, and hence more suitable,\nkinds of emotional and physical support, teaching and therapy\u2014so\ntoo will their own developmental prospects be transformed. (\u2026) \n \n If\nautistic self-narratives have the power to change those conditions\nfor the better, then autistic self- narratives have the power to\ntransform what it is to be autistic.\u2019 \n \n \n \n The\nLoud Hands Project is a community based, multimedia publishing and\ncreative effort by the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. It has already\nsourced funding via donations from the online autistic community for\nan anthology of autistic writing which was published last year\n(Bascom, 2012). This book collates previously published material\nalongside new articles and each author is autistic. Julia Bascom,\nproject founder and editor of the book writes in its foreword about\nthe how important autistic writing is to other autistic people.\nWithout exposure to such literature autistic people can grow up\nfeeling adrift and isolated : \n \n \n \n \u2018 One\nof the cruellest tricks our culture plays on autistic people is that\nit makes us strangers to ourselves. We grow up knowing we\u2019re\ndifferent, but that difference is defined for us in terms of an\nabsence of neurotypicality, not as the presence of another equally\nvalid way of being. We wind up internalizing a lot of hateful,\ndamaging and inaccurate things about ourselves, and that makes it\nharder to know who we really are or what we really can and cannot\ndo.\u2019 \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  (Bascom,\n2012, p.7) \n \n \n \n Autistic\npeople have described the sense of community they feel from the\nincreasing prevalence of fellow autistics\u2019 writings. They are\ncollaborating with an increased sense of power and strength in\nnumbers. They challenge the rhetoric of their lives as \u2018less than\u2019.\nThey worked together to change Google\u2019s auto-complete options\nfollowing a search of the words \u2018autistic people should\u2026\u2019\n(Heasley, 2013). They wrote and campaigned to expedite the cessation\nof damaging and inaccurate advertising campaigns relating to autism\n(Kras, 2009) (McDaid, 2009). \n \n \n \n Autistic\npeople writing and connecting have instigated changes that impact on\nother autistic people by challenging current autism awareness\ncampaigns (Durbin-Westby, 2012). They have clamoured for a greater\nsay in organisations that claim to speak on their behalf, gaining\nroles such as National Councillor of the NAS (Arnold, 2002) and in\nthe USA, council membership of the National Council on Disability\n(NCD, n.d.). \n \n \n \n The\nincreasing body of autistic writing is also having an escalating\nimpact on autism research. Breakey (2006) writes that \u2018autistic\npeople have been viewed as contributing useful \u201cinsights\u201d and\n\u201cexperiences\u201d into the academic arena, but they have not been\nsufficiently recognized in the intellectual discussions and\nexploration of the condition\u2019 but that this is changing as more\nautistic people speak out. She says that only autistic people\nthemselves can understand what it is to be autistic and that\nresearchers would make more gains if they stopped focusing on the\n\u2018outside of the condition\u2019 (the behaviour) and instead \u2018focussed\non what autistic people are\u2019. \n \n \n \n The\nvast majority of autism research focuses on neurobiology,\nenvironmental effects, potential causation and genetics. According to\nSingh et al. (2009) basic science research accounts for 65% of grants\nfunded in the US from 1997 to 2006, clinical research for 15% and\ntranslational research for the remaining 20%. A very small fraction\nof studies focussed on epidemiology or family function and services\navailable to autistic people. Singh et al. counted 308 new,\npublically-funded autism projects between 2002 and 2006, only 9 of\nwhich looked at family and services. \n \n \n \n However\nwhen the opinions of autistic people are sought, they say they want\nresearch to focus on improving their outcomes and quality of life.\nSilberman (2012) asked some autistic writers their views on \u2018what\ncould be done to make the world a more comfortable, respectful, and\nnurturing place for millions of autistic kids and adults\u2019. One\nrespondent, Paula C. Durbin-Westby, said that \u2018Research priorities\nand dollars should refocus on communication needs\u2019 and Ari Ne\u2019eman\nsaid: \n \n \n \n \u2018 Research\nand science have always played a large role in disability\npolicymaking, in large part due to a history of disability being\nviewed mainly as a public health issue. But while science can tell us\nmuch about how the world is, it falls to values to tell us how the\nworld should be. When assessing the quality of different forms of\nservice-provision, we should think about both efficacy and ethics.\u2019 \n \n \n \n AASPIRE\n(Academic Autistic Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education,\n2013) is a community-based participatory research partnership\ncomposed of health services and disability researchers, autistic\nself-advocates, health care providers, disability service\nprofessionals and family members. It was formed to challenge the: \n \n \n \n \u2018 misalignment\nbetween [autism] researchers\u2019 priorities and those of the autistic\ncommunity; a lack of inclusion of autistic individuals in the\nresearch process; use of demeaning or derogatory language and\nconcepts; threats to study validity derived from miscommunication\nbetween researchers and participants; and the use of findings to\nadvance agendas that opposed community values.\u2019 \n \n (Nicolaidis\net al., 2011) \n \n \n \n Autistic\npeople by writing and sharing their ideas are influencing the\ndirection of autism research in other ways too. Autistic person\nMichelle Dawson was asked to join an autism research group after\nimpressing principal investigator Laurent Mottron with her interest\nin the science and detailed knowledge of the literature (Mottron,\n2011). Mottron explains that Dawson \u2018has helped the research team\nquestion many of our assumptions about and approaches to autism \u2014\nincluding the perception that it is always a problem to be solved.\u2019 \n \n \n \n Donnellan\net al. (2013) quote several autistic authors in their paper\nchallenging the definition of autism as a triad of impairments (Wing\nand Gould, 1979) and call for increased recognition of the\nneurologically-based sensory and movement differences autistic people\nexperience: \n \n \n \n \u2018 Any\nview of autism at this time needs to reflect the experience of\nself-advocates with autism and others who describe sensory and\nmovement differences, as well as the latest in the neuroscience and\nchild development literature. We need a research agenda that focuses\non understanding and supporting autistic people and others in more\nrespectful, personalized, and successful ways.\u2019 \n \n \n \n Autistic\nwriters are increasingly likely to critique research studies,\nespecially those of interest to the mainstream media. This was\ndemonstrated after a paper was published recently describing people\nwho had been diagnosed with autism as children but who lost their\ndiagnoses as they grew up (Fein et al., 2013). The study authors\nlabel these as an \u2018optimal outcomes\u2019 defined such \u2018that the\nindividual be without any significant autism symptoms and function\nwithin the normal intellectual range; however, other difficulties,\nsuch as weaknesses in executive functioning or vulnerability to\nanxiety and depression may still exist.\u2019  \n \n \n \n \n Media\nreports presented this as a people \u2018recovering from\u2019 or \u2018growing\nout of autism\u2019 and autistic people took issue with the definition\nof optimal lives as being those without autism. Dawson (2009) wrote\n(on presentation of Fein\u2019s data at a conference): \n \n \n \n \u2018 Dr\nFein and her colleagues have determined the criteria for optimal\noutcomes in autism, and these criteria assume that autistics who\nremain autistic are suboptimal. Remaining autistic is an undesired,\nunsatisfactory, inferior, suboptimal result.\u2019 \n \n \n \n Many\nresearchers make value judgements about autistic people\u2019s lives\nthat do not correspond with how they themselves describe their\nexperiences. It seems plausible that if more academics were to study\nthe ever-growing body of literature created by autistic writers,\nthere would be fewer misunderstandings and more progress on improving\nlives and outcomes. Even a slight shift in the priorities and funding\nof autism research away from causation and possible prevention of\nautism onto finding more effective ways to educate and support\nautistic people throughout  the course of their lives, would lead to\noutcomes that could be described as truly optimal. \n \n \n \n The\nincreasing body of literature from autistic people willing to share\ntheir experiences will have a positive impact on service providers\nwho base their practise on the best available evidence in supporting\nautistic people. In their writing autistic people promote the social\nmodel of disability and personalised approaches to support services,\nwhich influences policy and legislation and hence impacts on service\nproviders. \n \n \n \n Valuing\nPeople (Department of Health, 2001), a UK government White Paper on\nlearning disability, makes proposals based on four key principles:\ncivil rights, independence, choice and inclusion, all ideas promoted\nby autistic authors. The Independent Review of Autism Services in\nNorthern Ireland (Maginnis, 2008) proposed that each Health Trust\ndevelop ASD Family Support services within their ASD specialist teams\nto provide \u2018person centred\u2019 advice and support to\nchildren/families and autistic individuals.  Person-centred\nplanning is based on social model principles of inclusion advocated\nby autistic writers. \n \n \n \n Autistic\npeople have been consulted at all stages of the development of the\nDraft Northern Ireland Autism Strategy (DHSSPS, 2012) (open to public\nconsultation until early March 2013) and were among the membership of\nthe Project Board established to manage and direct the development of\nthe Strategy and Action Plan. The vision of the Autism Strategy\ncorresponds with that in the United Nations Convention on the Rights\nof Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD, 2008) and includes\nparticipation, inclusion, respect for difference, equality of\nopportunity and accessibility.  \n \n \n \n \n The\nNorthern Ireland Autism Adult Care Pathway (RASDN, 2012) advocates a\nperson centred approach in which: \n \n \n \n \n \u2018 intervention,\ncare and support \u2013as well as the diagnostic process - will take\ninto account individuals\u2019 needs and preferences. Individuals with\nautism should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about\ntheir care and identified support needs, in partnership with their\nhealthcare\nprofessionals.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n RASDN\nacknowledge that their Care Pathway cannot be fully implemented\nwithout significant investment and there are financial deficits\nwithin HSC Trusts. They intend to reconfigure service provision to\nbetter support autistic adults and say they will \u2018endeavour to\nsecure new resources where possible.\u2019 Autistic people and their\nallies have lead the way in changing policy from a medical or charity\nbased model to one of rights, participation, respect and equality and\nthey will continue to work to ensure funding is in place to allow\npeople to access appropriate services to make this vision a reality. \n \n \n \n Autistic\nwriters have challenged providers of support and services directly on\nhow they can most effectively work with autistic clients. Lawson\n(2012) emphasises the importance of communication among all the\nagencies involved in working with an autistic individual. But as\nautism involves\u00a0problems with communication, service providers\ndo not always involve the autistic person when deciding what is best\nfor them. She explains that these barriers can be overcome by using\ncommunicative technology. Finally Lawson asks that agencies encourage\ntheir staff to read and explore autism from the perspective of\nautistic people. \n \n \n \n Autistic\npeople have written about their experiences with providers of\nservices. Many of them have shared their desire to be listened to, to\nhave their concerns acknowledged and to be treated as individuals.\nThey have discussed the labels often used by professionals to\ncategorise people. \u2018I Am Joe's Functioning Label\u2019 (Harp, 2008) is\na blog post eloquently demonstrating the challenges and needs that\ncan be overlooked when a person is labelled as \u2018high functioning\u2019.\nIn \u2018Just Me\u2019 (Sequenzia, 2012) the author describes how she can\nbe thought of as \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 functioning depending on\ncircumstances. She writes, \u2018Functioning boxes are not definitions\nof who we are. They are simply a very narrow view of our\ncomplexities.\u2019  \n \n \n \n \n These\nautistic writers ask that service providers and others interacting\nwith them, avoid either minimising their talents or denying their\nvery real impairments. \n \n \n \n Amanda\nBaggs is an autistic woman with multiple chronic medical conditions\nwho communicates via an AAC device. She is a talented and prolific\nwriter who has covered many aspects of autism and disability such as\nethics, representation and communication. She has written about the\ntimes she spent in institutions and the abuses she suffered and\nwitnessed there. She has also written about personal care services\nshe received in her home and the staff who provided these, detailing\nindividual and systemic failings in her care. She describes the many\nways in which support staff have used their position of privilege and\npower over her and others to perpetrate different types of abuse,\nfrom threatening to withdraw necessary services, infantilising\nadults, making decisions without consulting the person in receipt of\nservices, disrespecting bodily autonomy and privacy to physical\nintimidation  (Baggs,\n2012) .\nBaggs lives in the USA but the comments on her blog posts from\nreaders all over the world attest to the universality of her\nexperiences. \n \n \n \n Agencies\nand staff members who read these accounts of how it feels to be an\nautistic person receiving services are likely to have a greater\ninsight as to how they can impact on a person\u2019s life and to have\nmore understanding of how to use the power they hold as care\nproviders, in ways that are respectful and enabling. \n \n \n \n One\nof the most crucial services any person requires is adequate and\nappropriate healthcare. According to Article 25 of the UNCRPD (2008),\n\u2018 States\nParties recognize that persons with disabilities have the right to\nthe enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. \u2019\nAccordingly, a utistic\npeople should receive the medical care they require just like anyone\nelse.  \n \n \n \n \n However,\nas recently as March 2013, Amanda Baggs has faced intense and\nsustained pressure from members of her medical team to eschew the\nlife-saving treatment she required  (Cohen-Rottenberg,\n2013) .\nAmanda wrote about these incidents on her personal blog and her story\nwas quickly shared by people in the online autistic community, many\nof whom contacted the hospital to seek assurances that she would\nreceive appropriate medical care. She has since had the necessary\ntreatment but many other autistic people without her outreach face\nsimilar discrimination in healthcare services. This incident\ndemonstrates how crucial autistic writers are in highlighting these\nsituations and how much progression is still needed before autistic\npeople are treated as equals. \n \n \n \n As\nthe diagnostic criteria for autism have been widened and more people\nare diagnosed with the condition and with the near ubiquity of the\ninternet, there has in recent years been a surge in the numbers of\nautistic people writing about their lives. The body of literature\nthese people create continues to grow each year and the scope of its\ninfluence increases correspondingly. Without this writing we would\nknow far less about many aspects of life as an autistic person. Other\nautistic people would not have the sense of community and belonging\nthese writings have provided. Many of the achievements the writers\nhave worked for would have been forfeited. Autism researchers and\nservice providers in particular still have much to learn from the\nwritings of autistic people.  \n \n \n \n \n As\nthe dominant narrative shifts from the impact of autism on parents to\nthose who are the real experts on the autistic experience, the focus\nwill shift into greater acceptance, understanding and ways to support\nand enable autistic people. Autistic peoples\u2019 writings will\ncontinue to transform and impact on all those in the autism\ncommunity.  \n \n \n \n \n References \n \n \n \n \n Academic\nAutistic Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education \n(2013).

{"date": "6 Oct 2016", "body": "\nWe watched the documentary prenatal screening and the reduction in people being born with Down Syndrome presented by Sally Phillips. \nIt's on BBC iplayer  here \u00a0and below is a short clip. \n \n \n\n \n \nThe best article on this that I have read is by  Francis Ryan in the Guardian . \nI have however some points that I want to make about the programme. I tweeted these this morning and am bringing those thoughts together now. \n \nFirst principle is that individual women must have full bodily autonomy. Nothing in #worldwithoutdowns negates the need to legalise safe, free abortion in Ireland/elsewhere. It is still essential that Irish people #repealthe8th and that women in the north are also afforded rights over their own bodies. \n \nIt's good that a programme like A World Without Down\u2019s Syndrome? was created and screened. It's right to raise these questions and challenge assumptions about the value of disabled lives. \n \nSally Phillips was open about her bias as mother of a child with DS. The scientists however were at pains to dissociate their work from any consideration of ethics. Lyn Chitty who developed non-invasive prenatal test was out of line when she said to Sally \"Well your son is likely to outlive you,\" as though that was a bad thing. Children tend to outlive parents, that's a good thing. I want my 3 kids to live at least as long after my death as I lived before their births. And the Californian dude who sequenced his unborn son's DNA said, science just tells you what you can do. Morality is something else. \n \nGeneticist George Church in Harvard asserted, \"It's all about education. It's not the technology that's the problem. It's the societal pressures and the market forces that are at work.\" He said it's the job of parents to change society's perception of the value of disabled people. As usual the work of disabled self-advocates who should be at the centre of this, is ignored. \n \nSociety doesn't value and accommodate disabled people. The rhetoric around disability is deficit and bigotry laden. Politicians and the media depict disabled people as scroungers who burden our education, health and social care services.In this climate of course people opt for prenatal tests, in which case it's better that safer tests are developed \n \nHowever prenatal testing puts pressure on mothers to reject a  specific  child which is different from women who  do not want to be pregnant at all.\u00a0 Fatal foetal abnormality is different again- it is appalling that pro-forced birth folk conflate FFA and disability. Little angers me more. \n \nThe show attempted to highlight the humanity of people with Down Syndrome. It partially succeeded. It emphasised, as usual, the benefits that they bring to others, how loving and \"predisposed to happiness\" they are and how they make families better. I dispute this; those with DS are as variable in their personalities and temperaments as all of us. They have innate value. They don't need to be cute or clever or exceptional. \n \nI disliked the section with the woman crying on stage about the way midwives told of the diagnosis. The show centred the experiences of mothers of kids with DS. I disliked the way Sally hugged the woman with DS in Iceland and called her a lovely girl. That was infantilising  \n \nIt was just wrong to interview a woman who'd had an abortion and have her explain her choices on camera. This issue is about society not individual choices. \n \nI've read complaints that only \"high functioning\" (yuk) people with DS were shown. Rubbish. There's more than enough out there about how haaaard it is to raise disabled kids. I'm happy to see people with DS old and young shown just getting on with life for once. \n \nIt's irrelevant whether people with DS or other disabilities have special talents that benefit society. If everyone had to prove their usefulness to society to be allowed to exist, the world's population would take a big drop. \n \nI worry that the information given to women following screening, belittles the value of disabled lives, and inordinately emphasises difficulties they face. It's not as though all non-disabled people enjoy a charmed, perfect, blissful existence. \n \nIs there a test to see if the child you're pregnant with will grow up to be an abuser, thug, manipulator, murderer or Tory? Is DS so much more deserving of eradication than all these? \n \nThe problem is that women are getting the message that they would be irresponsible to chose to give birth to a child they know to be disabled. These children are seen as 'drains on society' leading 'empty and pain-filled lives'. They are said to 'cost the state too much to care for them'. \n \nThe rhetoric that disabled people are drains on society leading empty and pain-filled lives is eugenics and anti-feminist.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07ycbj5/a-world-without-downs-syndrome", "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/downs-syndrome-baby-disabled-child-aborting-foetus-abnormalities"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2016/10/thoughts-on-world-without-downs-syndrome.html", "title": "\nThoughts on A World Without Down\u2019s Syndrome?\n"},
{"date": "9 Nov 2015", "body": "\nI attended a relationships and sexuality education (RSE) training day hosted by Unison in Belfast and provided by Middletown Centre for Autism. It was free to attend as the Centre is fully funded by the education departments of Northern Ireland and the Republic. Most of those attending today were teachers though parents accounted for a large portion of delegates also. As usual at these types of events, the trainer proceeded as though the idea that any of the delegates might themselves be autistic was utterly unthinkable. \n \nI have researched RSE and autism in detail for both my post graduate course and to equip my autistic son with the right information and skills. I also did some voluntary work for the NAS on an RSE program for autistic adults and completed a course on sexual health education. I wanted to attend today's training to see if I could pick up some more practical tips and ideas. I always gained something from any previous Middletown training even if it was on a topic I already had some knowledge of. \n \nThe trainer started off by defining and explaining autism using the pathology paradigm. I was concerned that she felt the need to spend some effort telling the teachers attending that autism is a real condition diagnosed only after careful observation and not an excuse for bad parenting or bold children. Are we really still at this point? \n \nIt quickly became clear that her speaking style was to make sweeping generalisations and to refer to autistic people as \"they\". She never said the word autistic once but used person first language throughout despite the well established preference of autistic people themselves for identity first language.  Jim Sinclair wrote about this in 1999 - it's high time the message got through. \n \nThe day started with a quiz for delegates. One question asked \"how long can puberty last for a young person with autism?\" \nI'd written- same as for everyone else, around 4 years. When we went through the answers the trainer said that it can last longer for autistic people- even as late as 22. \nI've never heard this before and a quick search hasn't turned anything up but I welcome any insight on this. \n \nOne slide said \"autism is not curable but treatable with interventions.\" \nI disagree, it's neither curable nor treatable. \n \nShe said that \"Asperger's is autism with high IQ.\" \nOh really? \n \n \nShe said that  they  have a visual learning style. (What all of *them*?) \n \nShe said that while *we* (non-autistics) learn by osmosis, \"our [autistic] children do not pick things up.\" \n \nShe told a story about a boy who was upset while playing football and said it was because of theory of mind and that \"he had no understanding that other people have differing opinions.\" \n \nShe said that if a child with autism\u00a0goes to brush his teeth and there's no toothpaste left, he will stand still because  they  can't problem solve. \n \nShe shared a slide of the ways in which most people learn about RSE. She said that autistic kids don't read magazines (unless it's Super Mario or similar) and they don't go to events like the school disco or weddings or naming ceremonies. \nOh really? \n(And what about autistic girls, many of whom devour magazines aimed at teen girls?) \n \nThere was a video shown with 4 office workers in a canteen. One woman is crying as she's just split from her boyfriend while the other woman makes sympathetic comments. The sad woman asked \"why did he dump me\" and the autistic character pipes up that maybe he thought she was ugly. Silly literal autistic man- that got a big laugh. I sneered- I've seen this sniggering at autistic characteristics before and it's unacceptable. \n \nShe said that \"children with autism\" don't like it when people look through their school bags for notes or whatever but they lack the skills to say stop. \nTHEN TEACH THEM!! \n \nAt one stage she asked us to call out what we think RSE for children with autism should contain. \nI said \"how to say no.\" \n \nShe quoted Wenn Lawson and told the group that Wenn is now gender neutral and repeatedly referred to him as she. \n \nShe said that girls internalise behaviours and symptoms but boys externalise. \n \nShe said that you should keep electronic devices out of children's bedrooms at night due to \"neurons coming off the phone.\" I hope I misheard- but dear lord! \n \nAt this stage I made up my mind to leave at the lunch break. I had not gained anything from this except how not to provide RSE for autism training. \n \nThere was some useful information shared that could help parents and teachers. She talked about the importance of respecting the values of the family and emphasised that the parent is the main teacher. She talked about emotions, safety, respect, and starting this process early. She talked about the need to be aware of sensory issues. I'm sure there was more useful and well informed information provided in the 2nd part of the training that I missed. \n \nHowever I will be writing to Middletown Autism Centre about the issues outlined above.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20090210190652/http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/person_first.htm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2015/11/problems-with-relationship-and.html", "title": "\nTroubled by Autism Training\n"},

Read this at your peril as it is truly vile. \n \nWith just a few deviations, this letter follows the tried and tested\u00a0 Assembly Manual for Autism Articles   TM\u00a0 \u00a0which I created in 2008. \n \nGuardian Dad starts off describing Autistic Kid's arrival into the world, how he felt \"total, unconditional love\" and envisaged watching Autistic Kid \"grow up, go to university, find love, then maybe settle down and have his own family.\" The thought that Autistic Kid might not want to follow such a path doesn't seem to have occurred to him. \n \nHe then weirdly complains about his own parents choice to leave Autistic Kid \"half of everything\" in their wills. Is this because Guardian Dad wanted it all for himself? \n \nThen, following stage 4 of the autism article template, \"the parents realise the child is somehow different, something is not quite right\" Guardian Dad describes how Autistic Kid \"didn't play very well [...] flitting from toy to toy, with no concern for the people around you and ignoring any child who engaged with you.\" \n \nI would speculate that Autistic Kid was playing\u00a0 differently \u00a0not badly and it's impossible to say he lacked concern for other people. Autistic Kid's other kiddie crime was to \"only talk to adults when [he] wanted them to do something\" so we know he communicated via speech. Anyway it turned out that Autistic Kid is autistic. \n \nThen Guardian Dad for the second time in a 700 word article, expresses how he hates himself for being right. Despite his professed aversion, he sure wants us to know about his rightness record. \n \nThe next section is outrageous and warrants a content warning. Remember this is aimed at a six year old child: \n \n \n\"You love your mother, which is good \u2013 because  you make her life hell . Without your outward signs of affection towards her I don\u2019t know if she could maintain  the abuse you put her through . I've watched a loving, kind woman become a  tired, hard, uncaring, dispassionate bitch . But all this is aimed at me, with you only getting the occasional frustrated tone, or at worst a sigh of irritation.\u00a0 \n \nShe loves you with all her heart, but that means  there is no room for anything else . She will fight for you until her last breath. But  any type of intimacy between the two of us has vanished . In six years  she\u2019s aged 20  while  I\u2019ve put on 30lb  and have become more isolated than ever. I hold back as much as I can, but  sometimes I snap . I\u2019m sorry. I know  it distresses you when we argue , and I hate myself for doing it.\"\u00a0\n[My bold] \n \nThere is so much wrong with this. Guardian Dad ignores the power relationship between small child and adult couple. The child is not abusive- he isn't using coercive behaviors to maintain power and control over the parents. He has a developmental disability that affects how he perceives and interacts with the world. He may well have multiple sensory sensitivities. And believe me, Autistic Kid is picking up on how Guardian Dad feels about him and his mother. \n \nI am disturbed by Guardian Dad's venomous depiction of his wife and the revelation that he sometimes snaps and argues with his wife though he knows it distresses Autistic Kid. \n \nGuardian Dad feels \"bereaved \u2013 for the family I should have had. I am a good person and this should not be happening to me.\" He talks about how he thinks about leaving. Poor Guardian Dad, my heart bleeds for him. He was owed a more perfect life than this with a faulty child and a tired, hard, uncaring, dispassionate bitch for a wife. And he got fat. None of this is his fault, oh no he's a \"good person\". We know this because he says it though he doesn't share anything that shows it. \n \n \n\"But we love you more than ever. You\u2019re not responsible for any of this \u2013 it\u2019s your disability. We know that you try your best, but you become confused and anxious about everything that is going on around you. \u00a0Neither your mother nor I know what the future will hold, but we still feel the same way about you today as that first time we saw you.\" \n \nGuardian Dad  is  blaming Autistic Kid even though he knows that the world is a scary place for him. Writing this letter to a public forum is not a loving act. It adds to the mountain of anti-autism rhetoric that will only serve to make life harder for Autistic Kid, my own son, and all other autistic people. \n \nGuardian Dad absolves himself from all responsibility. He resents the time his wife spends with his son. He directly places the blame for life not turning out how he wanted it to on the shoulders of a disabled child. \n \nIf he had written this to his therapist that would be ok. If he had written an article expressing how he finds it difficult to father his autistic child, and described some of the problems they had faced, that would also be fine- so long as he didn't blame the kid. If he had described how social security cuts are impacting on his family and how he has to fight for support I would applaud him. If he had come to me in my work and shared these thoughts with me I would have encouraged him to figure out what he could do to make things better and helped him get appropriate support from various agencies. But Guardian Dad wrote a very public letter even if it is anonymous. His sense of entitlement and self-absorption shine through every paragraph. The Guardian would never have published a letter from a father blaming their small non-disabled child for all their problems. \n \nAutistic Kid didn't get the father he should have. I would like him to know: you keep on being your own awesome autistic self and I hope that one day you will know there is a community out there who will welcome, understand and embrace you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HMDOfKXo-_4/VVhiV0VCv3I/AAAAAAAABi0/Y-tdDVN3Yyk/s1600/cryin-men.jpg", "http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/a-letter-to-my-son-who-has-autism-for-whom-ill-always-do-my-best?CMP=fb_gu", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2008/09/how-to-write-book-about-your-autitic.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2015/05/a-post-to-guardian-dad-for-autistic-kid.html", "title": "\nA Post to Guardian Dad For Autistic Kid\n"},
{"date": "1 Mar 2015", "body": "\nI haven't seen one of these for a while- a newspaper article on a parent's view of autism that adheres rigorously to the  the template I wrote in 2008 . Today offering is titled\u00a0 Autism and ABA: 'My beautiful, fun little boy was slipping away from me' . In this we learn how wealthy, beautiful and accomplished Tanja Gullestrup uses tough-love therapy to \"stop her losing [her three year old son] to this isolating condition\". \n \n \n \n \n \nSo here's Step 1-4 of the Autism Article TM Template (Step 5 is optional and refers to vaccination-bashing autism articles) : \n 1: Baby is born 2: Everyone rejoices 3: Baby grows 4: Mum realises baby is somehow different, something is not quite right, \n \n \nAnd lo! the template it doth predict the story most accurately as we learn that the \"usually smiley and playful\" child \"wasn't making eye contact with anyone and didn't appear to be taking in anything going on around him. It was like someone had flicked a switch in his head\" and he \"had begun to withdraw into his own, self-contained universe\". \n \n Step 6: Mum struggles to get anyone to take her concerns seriously. Her husband might think she's worrying about nothing and that no child of his could possibly be anything less than perfect. All the doctors she encounters are callous and all the other professionals are harsh and unhelpful. Eventually one special therapist or teacher (but not a medic) comes along who understands and for the first time, really listens. \n \n Step 7: After much effort and heartache, Mum is devastated to learn that the explanation for all the child's problems is this terrible curse known as  Autism . \n \n The NHS would fail him: \n \n \" \u00a0 Left in the hands of the NHS, she points out, Konstantin would so far have had little more than speech and music therapy, \u2018neither of which would be giving him the skills that he needs to survive and have a life of dignity. Children on the autistic spectrum need to be taught how to fit into society, and the real cruelty comes from neglecting to do that.\u2019\" \n My autistic son has never had any form of ABA(TM) and yet he is living a life of dignity. Nor is it cruel to ask that society accepts neurological diversity.\u00a0 \n And here comes the devastation:\u00a0 \n \n \"a developmental paediatrician confirmed what she had not wanted to admit, even silently to herself \u2013 her son was indeed on the autistic spectrum. \u2018I felt as though my heart was being ripped out,\u2019 Tanja recalls. \u2018My mother was with me, thank goodness, and as we left the hospital, I was physically sick. I am a fighter by nature but in those darkest hours I definitely became unhinged.'\" \n Step 8: Just so we know how hard their lives are, how terrible this Autism thing is, several examples of the child's terrible behaviour are described, the tantrums and self-harm, the strange humming and abnormal interest in trains. This makes the book \"gritty\" and \"unflinching\" in the newspaper book reviews and is generally thought of as a good thing. \n \nThis child is so very young that Step 9 detailing tales of violence is missing but his strange otherworldly behaviours are outlined: \n \n \" his speech regressed and he no longer responded readily to his name\", and \" in the weeks leading up to [the child's] diagnosis he had begun to walk on tiptoe and repeatedly pull his hair. He also opened and closed doors incessantly and became obsessed by pushing buttons on electronic toys.\" \n \nSomeone cure that child stat! \n \n Step 10: The warrior phase commences. Mum finds out stuff the doctors don't know, or didn't want her to know. She arms herself with superior knowledge, garnered from a motley crew of brave mavericks or comes up with some self directed plan, and goes medieval on the autism. \n \n Step 11:\u00a0Mum is a lone crusader, challenging authority and staying strong and calm in the face of what to ordinary mortals would be insurmountable obstacles. But Mum reveals the real terror she felt, the depression and anxiety, the tears and sleepless nights, all due to the autism which has seized her child and holds him or her hostage. \n \n \n \"[Mum's] quiet confidence is centred on the conviction that, while there is no \u2018cure\u2019 for autism, she is providing the next best thing for Konstantin \u2013 a radical, tough-love therapy known as Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \"However as she began to seek help, Tanja also realised that she was facing an uphill struggle. In the US, ABA is tried and tested \u2013 successive studies have shown that half of children given full-time ABA tuition early enough start school \u00a0and many need no further therapy at all. The other half make significant progress, too, reducing their need for special needs support. ABA is endorsed by the American Medical Association and in the majority of US states health insurance companies are mandated to cover ABA therapy. But in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has yet to provide ABA as an option for the treatment of autism. Its official line is that it cannot recommend ABA because a review has found no evidence to support it.\" \nIt is true that NICE, after a thorough investigation of the claims and the actual evidence decided not to recommend ABA. But another claim in this paragraph needs to be countered: there is NO evidence whatsoever that 50% of children who receive early and intense ABA ever become \" indistinguishable from their peers\" (whatever that means). That is an utter fabrication based on\u00a0 a poorly written study from way back in * 1987* \u00a0which combined 40 hours of intense therapy with harsh punishments. Do ethics matter? As I have written before, why are standards so very low when it comes to autism? \n \nAnd another point to make, when lauding Lovaas as a pioneer, bear in mind that he first trialled his ABA as a  gay/trans conversion therapy . \n \n \n Step 12:\u00a0 The intervention phase commences. The child gets older and matures, hopefully with lots of love and good education as well. But the intervention is credited with effecting a miraculous cure. \n \n Step 13: The story ends by recalling just how far they have all come and how it would never have been possible without x,y or z (ABA, the companionship of a Golden Retriever or certain biomedical treatments). The child is said to be normal or recovered, as measured by a place in the Valhalla of this type of autism parent - mainstream school. \n \nSo this child, aged just three years old, is undergoing \u00a0seven hours of ABA tuition, five days a week. Instead of calling social services the Daily Mail asks that we donate to her charity so that yet more little autistic kids will be subjected to the same. \" \u2018He is using every ounce of his brain to do the work and, by the end of the day, he is exhausted,\u2019 says Tanja.\" \nI do not admire or condone this. \n \n But lets see how if the template still holds: \n \n \n \n \"'... the transformation has been astounding.\u2019 Before starting ABA, Konstantin had become so unsettled, he was incapable of sitting still to eat, read or watch TV. \u2018If you took a toy away from him, he\u2019d scream for an hour, and when he woke at night, he howled the house down,\u2019 says Tanja. \u2018Within a week of starting therapy, he was making eye contact and engaging again, and within a couple of weeks he was toilet trained, which I had begun to think would never happen.\u2019 Eighteen months on, he is content and compliant and plays happily with his sister\" \nThe child is only three years old! How much of this can be attributed to ABA and how much to natural progression? My son is 14 and can do all sorts of things he couldn't manage when he was 2! Also, I strongly oppose any treatment that has \"compliance\" as a goal. Too many disabled people have  suffered as a consequence of early compliance training . \n \nI have decided though that my template though needs another step: \n \n Step 14:\u00a0pay now or pay later! \n \nThis step is exemplified in the following horrible paragraph: \n \n \"ABA is undeniably expensive. A full programme, whether carried out at home or in one of the handful of ABA schools in the UK, requires intensive teaching for up to 40 hours a week, 49 weeks of the year, and costs \u00a345,000 annually, \u2018which sounds a lot, but it is less than the \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000 a year costs of residential care for young autistic adults once they become too big and aggressive to live at home,\u2019 Tanja points out. (A recent study by the London School of Economics and Political Science estimated that autism costs Britain \u00a332 billion a year, more than heart disease, strokes and cancer combined \u2013 making it the nation\u2019s costliest medical condition.)\" \n\"Too\u00a0 big and aggressive to live at home\"! What a revolting statement. This sort of argument is\u00a0particularly\u00a0galling. There will be a high cost to provide appropriate lifetime support structures for some autistic people, and so what? Early ABA for all will not change that. People are entitled to the help they need as citizens whether they have a disability or not. The  UN\u00a0 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \u00a0points of the problems of \u00a0 \" putting a price tag on the basic human rights for a significant segment of the population\". \nFurthermore, \"it is actually good economics to ensure that disabled persons are able to live up to their potential. When there are no obstacles in their way, disabled persons are employees, entrepreneurs, consumers and taxpayers, along with everybody else.\" \n \nThe article ends: \n \n\"For Tanja, life may no longer be whimsical and carefree, but it has resounding purpose. \u2018I believe there is a reason why Konstantin was given to me,\u2019 she says. \u2018He is the most sweet-natured and loving boy and he is living proof of what can be achieved. If he can deal with the challenges of autism, then so can I. So every day, we carry on and we count our blessings.\u2019\" \nLife has purpose for all of us. Being mother of a disabled kid makes you no more special or worthy than anyone else. I count my blessings everyday too. I just wish that the sort of autism-mum story exemplified by this article would no longer be given a platform. It's beyond time to amplify the voices of the real autism experts, the people who are themselves autistic.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2008/09/how-to-write-book-about-your-autitic.html", "http://www.donotlink.com/dwmu", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4e4MstXTQLQ/VPMJtaw9xmI/AAAAAAAABg4/y-D2wm9oJfk/s1600/assembly_man_350x175.gif", "http://t.co/NOof2t8qrL", "https://unstrangemind.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/no-you-dont/", "http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/questions.shtml#eleven"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2015/03/assembly-manual-for-autism-articles.html", "title": "\nAssembly Manual for Autism Articles\n"},
{"date": "18 Apr 2015", "body": "\nI've just written about  our wedding \u00a0on April 9 and described what a beautiful and perfect day it was. I had married before, 19 years ago. It was an unhappy marriage that I tried for many years to fix before coming to accept, with the support of many people around me and the help of Women's Aid, that  staying married would destroy my life  and likely those of my children. The separation happened four years ago and the horrendous task of divorcing took a few years more. \n \nI am forever grateful to the people who helped the children and me through that time. I am indebted to all those who over the years, campaigned to change the definition of marriage and make divorce legal. They ensured that children receive the protections they deserve and their efforts meant that I could be free from a terrible situation and, as a person who'd had to stop paid work to mind the children, was not left destitute. \n \nFor years after the separation I was a single mother of three. For one of those years, my sister lived with us and for all of them, all members of my family and our friends, have been there for us providing practical and emotional support when we needed it. We never stopped being a family even though we did not fit the proscribed model of a nuclear family. I've often heard campaigners against equal marriage bang on about how children deserve a mother and a father. What children need, as I have discovered, is to be free from abusive situations and to have access to people around them who love them and on whom they can rely. The precise set-up is not important. \n \nI had never expected to find love, yet in July 2012 I met a man who I am now married to. He and I are perfect for each other; as I said on our wedding day, his weirdnesses and mine match! It was important for us as a couple to marry. We wanted to make our union legally binding, to demonstrate to the children that we are both there for them for the long haul. We wanted a party and a chance to show our friends and family just how much we mean to each other. We wanted to be husband and wife. \n \nEveryone is entitled to arrange their relationships in whatever way works best for them. My relationship is no better than that of my friends who opted not to marry. I don't think that anyone  needs  to marry to be committed to their partner. Many people oppose the institution of marriage for perfectly valid reasons. But what all people deserve is to have that  choice . I have heard the reasons people have given for opposing equal marriage and none stand up to scrutiny. There is no reason why marriage need be between a man and a women only. \n \nThe joy we had on being able to marry, the ability to make that decision is something all people ought in a civilised and caring society to share. The only reason why anyone would deny that to other couple is because they think those relationships are less important and that is an opinion based on bigotry. Our children are listening, we need to let them know that they are all valued and that we oppose the dreadful bigotry that LGBT folk of my generation endured growing up. We need to end this ridiculous inequality in all corners of Ireland and let them ALL grow up with the choice to marry or not marry as they see fit. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/our-wedding.html", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/why-she-stayed.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TMgXaapAmlY/VTIkbRLgZxI/AAAAAAAABic/XL3LYjgscCQ/s1600/10941873_10153781460492575_4496329657453009994_n.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2015/04/yes-to-marriage-equality.html", "title": "\nYes to Marriage Equality\n"},
{"date": "17 Nov 2014", "body": "\n Before reading this post read\u00a0\u00a0 Paula C. Durbin-Westby's recent blog post  on media framing of autism stories and the real harm this is causing to autistic people.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Jerry Seinfeld by David Shankbone via Wikipedia\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnd once again, the parent of an autistic person is given space in a newspaper or magazine to spout off about how awful their lives are, what \"real\" autism is like and crucially, how dare Jerry Seinfeld claim he has anything in common with their lost and damaged offspring. \n \nFirst out of the blocks on November 10 it was teacher of creative writing,\u00a0 Marie Myung-Ok Lee in Salon  telling us all that \"Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s not helping: Celebrity autism claims distract from reality and research.\" Two days later we had\u00a0 Peter Holley writing for The Washington Post :\u00a0\"For some parents of autistic children, Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s self-diagnosis was \u2018a slap in the face.\" Holley hilariously depicts the awful, anti-vaccine organisation Age of Autism as an autism news site! He quotes infamous extremist Kim Stagliano and Theresa Cianciolo, another mum of an autistic child who are both vexed with Seinfeld. \n \nYou may think that two articles on this matter would be enough. You'd be wrong. This morning I encountered a third which follows exactly the same formula. This time it's  Roger Alpher in Haaretz : \"My son has autism, Jerry Seinfeld does not.\" All these articles follow aspects of the\u00a0 Autism ArticleTM template . \n \n \nIn all three articles Seinfeld is accused of diminishing their version of the reality of autism: \n \nFrom Salon: \n \n \n \n\"To veer to the other end of the spectrum, the sporadic \u2014 but steady \u2014 news of overwhelmed parents killing their own children warns of a crisis building in our own homes. Many of these cases have been mothers, but before we explain it away, as it has been, with gendered suggestions of mental illness, attention seeking, etc., let\u2019s also remember this story about a father \u2014 and high-ranking former Bush official \u2014 who shot his autistic 12-year-old son in a murder-suicide inside their suburban McLean home.\" \n \n \n\"Our own family\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses of raising a child with autism average $20,000 to $30,000 a year \u2014 as it has, very consistently in the last 10 years \u2014 including schooling, legal fees, therapies, childcare, which puts us exactly in the CDC\u2019s estimate of $21,000. If the high rate of autism isn\u2019t disturbing to you, consider that the cost to care for and house a severely autistic adult for life easily exceeds a million dollars, not to mention forgoing the tax revenue, etc., if the person could participate fully in society. Taken in aggregate, the CDC tells us, \u201cthe societal costs of caring for children with ASD were over $9 billion in 2011. And I haven\u2019t even begun to address the emotional costs, of having a child who can\u2019t speak, connect, one that might be a danger to himself and others.\" \n \n \n\"these public faces of autism will allow society, and more important, policymakers, mentally off the hook. You can have autism and get a Ph.D.! It helps you write jokes! Your charming quirks and aggravating behaviors are now explainable. \nand: \n \n \"It\u2019s only a matter of time before another child is killed, and we won\u2019t even remember their names. We need to call autism what it is: a public health emergency, no less deadly and devastating than Ebola.\" \nPhew! So to summarise, real autism makes parents kills their children, it's an emotional and financial burden, and it's worse than Ebola. Now that's a hell of an attitude. Ebola has killed  over 5000 people \u00a0in West Africa   so far and the WHO estimates that over 20000 cases are likely by the end of this month. But hey,\u00a0that's away over there in Africa so it hardly matters. Also murder apologism is not something that Salon should give space to. \n \nAnd on to the Washington Post and their view of real autism, as opposed to the quirky fun and fashionable autism Seinfeld has diagnosed himself with: \n \n \n\u201cMy kids\u2019 lives are irrevocably altered by autism and not in a good way,\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n\u201cAutism is a neurological condition that requires a clinical diagnosis based on serious behaviors and issues and challenges. It\u2019s a medical diagnosis, not a personality or a gift.\u201d \n \n \n\u201cJerry, if you think you have autism, come over to my house for a night, and we\u2019ll show you what it\u2019s all about.\u201d \n \n \n\u201cWhen your child gets an autism diagnosis, it\u2019s devastating. Your life is now over. Your life is your child\u2019s life, and you are forever bound by that diagnosis.\u201d \n \n \n\u201cIt is generally a slap in the face to thousands of parents who have to deal with a child who is non-verbal or severely impacted by autism to compare those children to Bill Gates or any other famous individuals, even of those individuals display some of the minor characteristics of a major condition,\u201d \n \nWhile Holley ought to have sought out an alternative parental view to those of\u00a0Stagliano\u00a0and her ilk, he did\u00a0interview 2 autistic adults who provided a bit of balance to the piece though the views of the \"autism sucks\" subsection of parents were given prominence. \nOne thing that is especially troubling is the assertion that the diagnosis means your life and that of your child is over- that's an appalling claim especially after the recent high number of murders by parents of autistic children. And that's something that ought to have been challenged by the journalist. \n \n \nFinally, let's look at what they say in Haaretz: \n \n \n\"When Seinfeld is interviewed, he maintains eye contact, distinguishes the important from the trivial, ignores distractions, and speaks to the point. He doesn't lick his hand or interrupt the interviewer with a question that reflects a level of understanding like that of a 5-year-old.What can one say? On the spectrum, a great life.\" \n \n\"But Seinfeld\u2019s nonchalant self-diagnosis is a joke of sorts at the expense of my son, Yotam. While Seinfeld preened with a little autism on television, I sat with Yotam in our living room, together with a social worker. Yotam is 19, but incapable of being responsible for himself. \" \n \n \n\"For parents, the diagnosis of their child as autistic is a terrible blow. For him and them, lifelong. Parents of autistic children suffer from high levels of tension and anxiety. And that\u2019s in the best cases, where the children are high-functioning.\" \n \nMy son is autistic. That a famous man has stated that he thinks he shares some characteristics with people diagnosed with autism affects us not a jot. Autism comes in different flavours in different people. While it is often difficult to adapt to the idea of parenting a disabled child, the diagnosis of autism does not have to be devastating or a terrible blow. It can be the first step to knowing how best to support your child. I also reject functioning terminology as it can ignore talents and skills as well as diminishing difficulties and needs.\u00a0These parents do not speak for me or my son. \n \n \nDear mainstream media, we've heard enough now about how it's unfair for Seinfeld to be in anyway linked to autism. Can you now start to change the dialogue, open it up to more autistic people, let them tell you what they need to thrive and listen when they point out harmful practices and narratives.

{"date": "3 Mar 2015", "body": "\nIn Saturday's Guardian was an short piece called \" What I'm really thinking: the grandmother of an autistic child \" in which a woman describes an outing with her 7 year old grandson Jimmy. Obviously we need to have some insight into the difficulties this causes her because that's the standard narrative for any and all articles on autism which centre on a family member and not autistic people themselves. So Grandma describes how \"the red-faced Jimmy who is almost out of control\" is \"screaming and lunging violently at the locked doors\" of some public toilets.  \n \nLater when Jimmy has settled Grandma discloses that she \"like[s] to imagine\" that they look normal and admits that few of her friends know that she has an autistic grandson in case they offer what she describes as \"well-meaning but inappropriate advice\" such as a book recommendation by an autistic author. \"It breaks my heart because I know that Jimmy, even with the best help in the world, will never be able to read or write or lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life.\" \n \nI have not bothered to comment on a Guardian article for a few years but I wanted to reach out to this woman. I swallowed my distaste for the assumptions and probably unexamined attitudes regarding disabled lives and the potential to learn and develop. So doing my best to be considerate and temperate, I left a  comment : \n \n\"If your friend's advice is to read books by autistic authors, then it is both well meaning and appropriate. Also, you cannot possibly know that Jimmy, aged only 7, will never be able to read or what kind of life he will lead. Your love and the time you spend with him coupled with good education and natural progression will help him live up to his potential. Take heart!\"\u00a0 \nThe most helpful thing to me in knowing how best to help my son has been listening to people who know what it's like to be autistic. Dismissing advice to read autistic writers is to my mind, ill-considered. Also it bothers me to read comments of the \"my child will never\" variety and we've all seen them numerous times in autism discussions. Sparrow Rose Jones  wrote \u00a0about the damage such statements can do: \n \n\"So . . . what is it that you are actually saying when you look at my life and say that I am not like your child? \n\nIn a very real sense, you are saying that you don't believe in your child. You are saying that your child cannot grow to be what I am, do what I have done. You are signing off on a package that has not been delivered yet. You are dismissing your child's potential for amazing growth and change.\" \nMy autistic son will be 15 this year. I can't possibly list all the skills and knowledge he has amassed since he was 7 and like all of us, he will continue to learn and progress throughout his life. \n \n(A couple of detractors took issue with my comment, but they showed so little insight and understanding that their views are beneath my regard.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/28/what-really-thinking-grandmother-autistic-child?CMP=share_btn_tw", "http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/48237309", "http://wearelikeyourchild.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/do-you-believe-in-your-children.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2015/03/never-say-never.html", "title": "\nNever Say Never\n"},

It was a vicious physical and verbal attack. I shake with anger when I think of what two grown men did that night to people who are only ever kind, helpful, supportive and loving to their family and neighbours. It shakes you to the core when something like this invades your family. I want to do the impossible; turn back time and stop it from ever having happened.

{"date": "18 Apr 2015", "body": "\nThursday April 9th was the best and happiest day of my life so far. My three children, our closest friends and beloved family members\u00a0gathered with me and the man I love, to witness our marriage. We had the ceremony in Belfast City Hall with a registrar who did everything she could to make it special and personal while also accommodating Ryan's needs. We and the children walked in together and Ryan read out his own words: \n \n\"I am happy today because my mum and Miche\u00e1l are getting married. That is great and loving and \nwonderful. \nMiche\u00e1l is my friend. He is funny and sometimes silly. We go to Tesco and he buys me the right \ncookies and DVDs. I like taking him to the cinema. \nMy mum is beautiful and kind. We go to the Transport Museum and W5 and the funfair. \nOur family will always be friends and love will win the day.\" \n \n \n \n By\u00a0 Neil Arthurs Photography \n \n \n \nWe exchanged our vows including some we'd written ourselves: \n \nIn all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. \nIn all the world, there is no love for you like mine. \nI promise to be your sidekick and your best friend,\nto keep laughing with you,\nto mind you when you need it and lean on you when I need it. \n(To love these 3 children as I officially become your partner in their lives) \nTo share all my joys and sorrows with you, \nTo love and support you through sunshine and rain for the rest of my days.\u00a0 \n \n \n By\u00a0 Neil Arthurs Photography \n \n \nMy two boys in the photo above are dealing with events in their own way; Michael, like every other man in my family, was in bits crying and Ryan was perfectly at ease listening to his music. \n \nI had been able to find a poem to read out, The Present by Michael Donaghy, that expresses beautifully what this means to me and which fits with both my nerdy and sentimental sides: \n \nFor the present there is just one moon, \nthough every level pond gives back another. \nBut the bright disc shining in the black lagoon, \nperceived by astrophysicist and lover, \nis milliseconds old. And even that light\u2019s \nseven minutes older than its source. \nAnd the stars we think we see on moonless nights \nare long extinguished. And, of course, \nthis very moment, as you read this line, \nis literally gone before you know it. \nForget the here-and-now. We have no time \nbut this device of wantonness and wit. \nMake me this present then: your hand in mine, \nand we\u2019ll live out our lives in it. \nAnd Mich\u00e9al read The Sailor's Vow by Alan Jenkins: \n \nThe life I spent so lavishly \nBefore we met \nSeems one long night, in memory, \nOf sea-fever and sea-fret \u2013 \nWhich led me here, to you, to this: \nOur haven below decks. \nYou anchor me, I you, with a kiss \n(Though the coast is strewn with wrecks). \nOfficial documents were signed and we were officially and legally married and it was time to celebrate. \n \n \n \n By\u00a0 Neil Arthurs Photography \n \n \n \nEveryone was gorgeous and looks beautiful in the photos. \nOur reception was in the  Harlem Cafe Belfast \u00a0just round the corner from City Hall so we just walked over and enjoyed a few glasses of prosecco to get the party started. And boy did we party. \n \n \n Photo by  Red Mum \u00a0 \n \n \nBefore we had our meal, Miche\u00e1l and I, his uncle and my dad all gave short speeches. Dad told everyone how Miche\u00e1l had brought happiness to our home. I managed to gulp-weep just twice and since I usually cry st the least wee emotional boost, that was pretty good going. When we'd finished, my daughter Tara stood up and in her very own way, said how much she and the boys love us both and are so happy to see us marry. \n \nThe food was gorgeous and plentiful, the staff were fantastically friendly and helpful, and everyone I spoke to said it was the best wedding meal they'd ever had. Then the music kicked in and shoes were kicked off as my gang and his took to the floor to see who had the best moves- the Dubs or the Nordies. There were no winners, but what we lacked in grace and ability we made up for in joyful exuberance! And what made my heart sing was how obvious it was that all our guests were having a fantastic time. Best of all though, was how delighted my three children were with the marriage and the day itself. We had prepared a chill-out zone for Ryan and had plans in place to take him away early if the crowd and noise became too much for him. But he was in his element hanging out with his cousins, yapping and dancing. At one stage he was even swinging around to the Pogues with Miche\u00e1l's aunties! No one could have predicted that. \n \nIt was a day filled with love, laughter, music, wine and good food. We were floating on the wave of warm feelings and enthusiasm from all around us, both our guests and from people who couldn't be there but sent messages filled with love and kind wishes. People got to see why we wanted to marry, to understand how Miche\u00e1l, me and the kids are family. It was the most perfect day imaginable and if I'm ever stressed or low in the years to come, I will close my eyes and recall the moment when I was serenaded by 3 Smiths to  this \u00a0and all will be brighter. \n \n(I've written a follow up post on why\u00a0 everyone should be able to have their day .)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uYx8AWWbgN8/VTDTKHwVg-I/AAAAAAAABho/4EmWc36ogqY/s1600/10636937_348363432029292_2656921628670664349_o.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/neilarthursphotography?fref=ts", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G3kKqEU6CT8/VTDTKOJc-xI/AAAAAAAABh4/LIWjAgnimFk/s1600/1962474_348363215362647_1693046673720964151_o.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/neilarthursphotography?fref=ts", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ru2dsESFA78/VTDTJyVSPXI/AAAAAAAABh8/noie9KIwN0U/s1600/885741_348361715362797_1766672116699784443_o.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/neilarthursphotography?fref=ts", "http://harlembelfast.co.uk/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rWBw4vhXY_4/VTIPRT7LhGI/AAAAAAAABiM/dMqWC1Y1RZ8/s1600/11144579_10153232125542329_823785182_o.jpg", "https://instagram.com/redmum/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CMlYVu9J4g", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/yes-to-marriage-equality.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2015/04/our-wedding.html", "title": "\nOur Wedding\n"},
{"date": "29 Apr 2014", "body": "\n \n \nI asked Ryan if I could write a blog post about him and as long as he didn't have to write anything himself he was happy enough. So I'm going to try to tell you about my boy and think the best way is to share some of his creations. \n \nHe has always loved films and PC games and has been fascinated by all the different characters. He has learnt so much from wanting to find out more about his favourite characters from Disney films, Thomas the Tank Engine and even Kinder egg toys. He learned to type, read and write because he wanted to be able to Google their names, he learned colours and numbers from Thomas and his Friends. In the past few years he's become fascinated by cinema and is working on a few feature films of his own that he's convinced will be shown in our local cinemas at some stage. We go see a film together at least once a week (and thank the stars for the\u00a0 Cinema Exhibitors Card  allowing his carer free entry) and he knows and is known by almost all the staff. In one cinema they even arranged for him to visit the projection room a couple of times. He takes photos of each screen after the movie ends and knows in which screen of which cinema on which date and with whom he saw every film he's ever seen. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ticket for Ryan's forthcoming Minecraft movie \n \n \n \n \nHe's also kindly detailed running order of ads and trailers for the benefit of the cinemas and has a poster letting us know who else is involved in this work of creative genius: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMost recently he's been animating a Minecraft movie in association with Pixar. The boy thinks big! He's even  adapted the Pixar logo  to fit. \n \nHe has also invented a load of new characters and has been making films about their trials for a while too. My favourite thing about these folk is the \"wiki\" style character breakdowns he created (click each picture to read): \n \n \n \n All about King Elton \n \n \n \n \n \n \n All about Malcurtis Eves \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n All about Zunarmny- best bit of this is his dislikes ;-) \n \n \nHe definitely prefers the bad guys, I mean look at those lists of personality attributes! I've had to explain what they all mean lately so we've had lots of talks about character and how people think, feel and behave. It's all very high concept stuff but when he asks the questions, he's ready to learn. \n \nHe spends hours working on these and I am quite happy to let him indulge in his hobby. I love how he draws the characters and then creates their Minecraft version: \n \n \n \nI enjoy the detail he inserts in his images, most of which seem to focus on sword fights and desperate battles!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n That's Robin Hood 3D (Ryan's alter ego) fighting the evil Zunarnmy- IN HELL!!! \n \n \n \n \nI'm sharing just 2 of his more recent creations. First we'll see Merida battling the evil Lord Elton: \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd let's end with the grisly demise of one of the bad guys:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo that's a snippet of what Ryan has been at when he's working away on his laptop.

{"date": "2 May 2014", "body": "\n Trigger warning for discussion of child murder. Please call your emergency services or local crisis support number if you need immediate and urgent help. \n \n Samaritans UK 08457 909090 \n Samaritans Ireland 116 123 \n \n \nThis is a post for  Blogging\u00a0Against\u00a0Disablism Day 2014 . \n \n \n \n \n \nDisablism means discriminating against people due to their disability. It's unjust and unfair. Disablist attitudes abound in our society and worsened in the past few years as a result of robust campaigning by certain political parties and media outlets depicting disabled people as lazy, scrounging cheats. \n \nDisabled lives are accorded less value than the lives of people not currently disabled. This even applies to children. I've been appalled over the years by the steady stream of news stories about parents killing or attempting to kill their disabled children. And each time the tragedy of a life lost is portrayed as understandable because, after all, the dead disabled person was such a burden. The parent who killed the child is described as devoted, loving and most of all, long-suffering. \n \nLast week it happened again. In England,  4 year-old Olivia Clarence and her 3 year-old twin brothers, Max and Ben were found dead in their home and their mother Tania has been charged with their murder. The 3 young children were killed while their father was abroad with their older sister. \n \nI first read about this awful crime via an article in The Independent with a headline describing the woman subsequently accused of murder as a \" devoted mother \". On social media outlets, people rushed to defend and explain Tania Clarence's actions. The justification as far as they are concerned, is that the dead children all had type II spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic condition that can cause fatal respiratory problems and shorten life expectancy. This is just a small selection of tweets about the case. Try to imagine how they would read if the murdered children did not have a medical condition or disability: \n \nSo sad. You can't judge unless you are in that life, don't try - just have some compassion  http://t.co/HEVcDj9hzA \n\u2014 Hannah Cock (@drhannahrc)  April 26, 2014 \n \n\n \n \nThoughts are with Tania Clarence who must be going through hell. It's awful what she has done but equally horrific for her and her husband. \n\u2014 Dava Roopchand (@Dava73)  April 29, 2014 \n \n\n \n \nPity  @SantoshVKalyan  received abuse for tweet re. Tania Clarence euthanising her kids.

A few days after posting it she deleted the tweet and apologised for having offended people saying she didn't mean it and that she's a  nice person . I'm glad she apologised but that doesn't make up for an MP thinking it was correct to share that awful opinion in the first place. \n \nThere's a\u00a0 Mumsent thread  in which the mother accused of murder is accorded nothing but pity with posts on the \"terrible\" and \"intolerable\" burden she had faced, and in which she's referred to as a \u00a0\"Poor, poor lady...hope she's getting the support she needs.\" \n \nOn a post on\u00a0 Irish site The Journal \u00a0some\u00a0are attempting to justify the murder of 3 children aged 3 and 4 years old with comments such as, \"The children all had genetic life limited conditions . Maybe she wanted to end their suffering. No one knows what it is like to watch your children dying.\" and \"Unless you can walk in the shoes of a mum with a sick child, let alone three sick children, you cannot possibly judge her actions.\" \n \nI do not need to walk in anyone's shoes to know that murder is wrong. These children had their most basic human right taken from them. What happened to them is cruel and despicable. It is no less wrong than if they were typically developing little kids. When people explain the murder of disabled children as resulting from caregiver burnout or limited service provision, they are putting blame on the victim. Many if not most crimes are committed by people in desperate situations and those criminals don't have countless supporters asking us \"to walk in their shoes\" and \"not to judge\". As  Paula C. Durbin-Westby wrote  (on the all too frequent murder of autistic children by their caregivers), \n \n\"No one finds it necessary to defend people who murder because they are poor, stoned, broke, or in other difficult situations. And they certainly don't blame the victim. And they don't ask you to walk in the murderer's shoes. And they don't tell you to shut up if you won't.\" \n \nSo I will continue to judge and to work towards a society in which disabled people are respected not treated as burdens and disability is recognised as part of the human spectrum of experience. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2014.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-izEAmIcI7Wc/U2OhIYUgE0I/AAAAAAAABec/JT7udOKl8zs/s1600/badd02.gif", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/tragedy-in-new-malden-devoted-mother-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murdering-her-three-disabled-children-9278425.html", "http://t.co/HEVcDj9hzA", "https://twitter.com/drhannahrc/statuses/460161847652401152", "https://twitter.com/Dava73/statuses/461139039933186050", "https://twitter.com/SantoshVKalyan", "https://twitter.com/JacquesR/statuses/461135669403074560", "https://twitter.com/margiedgander", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TaniaClarence&src=hash", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23motherslove&src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Al_Zoya/statuses/460703051054325760", "https://twitter.com/catsatwork/statuses/460427799871094784", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-36aK92Lxg0w/U2OlmqFlmjI/AAAAAAAABes/zvSs_NwVSNw/s1600/mp+tweet.PNG", "https://twitter.com/sharonf/status/460677654258417664", "https://twitter.com/SantoshVKalyan/status/460891192730091520", "http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/_chat/a2062383-Tania-Clarence", "http://www.thejournal.ie/children-bodies-1428223-Apr2014/", "http://paulacdurbinwestbyautisticblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/walk-in-their-shoes-attempted-murder-of.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2014/05/post-for-badd-stop-excusing-murder.html", "title": "\nPost for #BADD: Stop Excusing Murder\n"},
{"date": "2 Apr 2014", "body": "\nIt's World Autism Awareness Day and autism is all over the papers and radio. Some of the stories are great such as  this by Fiona O'Leary , an Irish self-advocate explaining why she opposes the Light it Up Blue campaign and seeking an end to negative rhetoric: \n \n\"Any research that will bring positive benefits to people on the autistic spectrum is welcome. However, the propaganda used by Autism Speaks is instilling fear and hatred about a condition that is struggling to find acceptance in society.\" \nSome stories attempt to tug at the heartstrings such as the story of a 9 year old girl who wrote in school about her dearest wish- that\u00a0 her 4 year old brother be cured of his autism . In her letter she describes her brother's sensory issues as well as the efforts those who care for him are making at improving his communication skills using  Grace App . The little girl\u00a0comes across as very insightful and caring.\u00a0It seems to me that she uses the words \"cured\" and \"healed\" as shorthand for educated and parented so as to help him to have the best life possible. It's just a shame that the media have jumped on her story as though autistic kids' lives are a tragedy and the only way to help them is to seek a cure. \n \nAccording to a local autism charity,  every council in Northern Ireland is Lighting Up Blue \u00a0as is  Channel 4 News  (belying their reputation for thorough research and a good understanding of the background to the stories they report). Have we lost the battle to separate autism activism from the corporate blue of the despicable Autism Speaks? \n \nThen last night BBC aired Horizon, \" Living with Autism \" presented by Uta Frith, which gave more insights into  how autism researchers interpret their findings \u00a0than on how autistic people perform in their Sally Anne and dancing triangle tests. In every instance the autistic way was coded as impaired, less-than. The language of the programme was inherently pathologising. It worked best when autistic people themselves had the chance to talk- though even then their words and actions were put into context by Uta as to how they differ from \"ordinary\" people. I liked it a lot less than I expected to. \n \nHowever a nice thing happened as the show started, my son, my darling Ryan (aka Duncan) came in to say goodnight. I told him I was watching a programme about autism and he said, \"Oh autism! I love autism. I'm the autistic boy!\"  \n \n \n \n Ryan with his beloved Granda.\u00a0 \n \n \nAnd that's what matters most to me. My child is autistic. He's here to stay and I need to work to make the world a safer and better place for people like him. That's why I want ACTION not bloody awareness for autism. Yesterday on twitter someone called for a cure for autism as he has seen autistic people locked up for decades in hospital, wiped out on anti-psychotic meds and unable to care for themselves. This doesn't motivate me to find a cure- but to act on behalf of the people who are being treated inhumanely. These people need freedom, they need action to help them communicate better, people who listen to them, and support to experience more of life. Autistic people need better education that doesn't stop when they turn 18 or 19. They need decent paid jobs, places to live with only as much interference from service providers as they need. They need the right benefits to get by, opportunities to engage in sports and hobbies. My boy will be moving into the adult care system in a few years. I'm just starting to look into what options exist and it's heart sinking. I'll do what I can to shake the system and every time we make progress,  then  call on the media to aware the heck out of whatever has been achieved. \nThis is what I will battle for and I'm not going to be fighting alone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/why-im-not-feeling-blue-on-autism-day-263914.html#.UzuCKyBbhRw.facebook", "http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/i-wish-i-wish-i-wish-my-brother-could-be-healed-of-autism-1.1745836", "http://www.graceapp.com/", "https://twitter.com/AutismNIPAPA/statuses/450736451689648128", "https://twitter.com/Channel4/status/451236788464812032", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0404861", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mvfaQygo-cU/UzvuxdAqPRI/AAAAAAAABZs/QZgxKv5rxyk/s1600/IMG_4242b.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-227yZ6z1v0o/UzvzhC5j_6I/AAAAAAAABZ8/BVZvpx_9sQ0/s1600/IMG_4379.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2014/04/action-not-awareness-for-autism.html", "title": "\nAction not Awareness for Autism \n"},

{"date": "24 Mar 2014", "body": "\nI didn't expect that the promoters of uncontrolled and unethical experimentation on autistic children would be allowed to sell their services on  RTE TV. Thanks to  Suzy  (who alerted me to all this stuff) I was able to catch the  Morning Edition show of 21 March  (segment starts at 57 minutes) when USA-based Great Plains \nLaboratory boss William Shaw was interviewed as an \"expert in biomedical interventions\" along with  Karen O'Connor,  boss of home-grown organisation  The Child Development Centre . Shaw wasn't challenged despite claiming that they had \"reversed\" \nautism in many children with their treatments. The RTE reporter provided no balance or probing of \nthese claims- just bovine acceptance. William Shaw's lab is one of those places where quacks send samples of urine and blood to be tested for the terrifying toxins that proper doctors and real hospitals can't find because they aren't using  dodgy testing systems . The Child Development Centre provides some proper therapies like speech and language therapy and occupational therapy as well as rubbish like biomedical and craniosacral therapy and its shiny website contains a page full of jolly testimonials. There's no price list but I bet it all comes with a high price tag.\u00a0 \n \n The TV show, as always with these things, showed a mum telling the miraculous story of her son's escape from the clutches of autism (tendencies) via music, biomedical therapy and craniosacral therapy. \"Two years later,\" claims the reporter, \"he's really reaching his true potential.\" Two years is a long time, and autism is developmental delay not developmental stasis. The Child Development Centre is being credited with all that slow, natural progress the child made in this lovely  infomercial  courtesy of RTE.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n The RTE-plugged conference- Quacktastic. \n \n Today FM  also promoted the Child Development Centre and their conference in an interview as bland as that on RTE. A mother describes how her perfect son was all of a sudden diagnosed with autism and \"turned to a stone\" but then they went to a herbalist and the Child Development Centre and were able to \"bring him back\" and now   \"he's not lost any more.\" He never was lost. \n \n Hey Irish media, how about when you have a story on autism or some other condition, you seek out a  person who has that condition . If you want an expert on autism,  talk to an autistic .  \n \nNeither was I expecting to read a circa 2007 article on  quack autism cures in the Irish Times  a few days ago. Dear Maud this one is truly terrible. It (again) features the mother of an autistic kid who claims that following a particular regime rid her child of teh autisms. This time it's the services of Natasha Campbell McBride's and her GAPS diet that are being promoted and  Geoff has written a wonderful post  detailing just a few of her outrageous claims and dubious and potentially dangerous practices.  \n \nThis article follows the tried and tested Autism Article TM  template as described below. \n \n \n \n Don't stray from the template- sure who wants to know about the reality of life with autism! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt really astonishes me just how closely Adrienne Murphy  sticks to the template I wrote in 2008 ! \n \nBut it's 2014 and we should not have to keep having these discussions. I'm tired of dismantling specious claims by unscrupulous hacks. Autism is nothing like that described by Murphy in the Irish Times.  Autism is a genetically-based human neurological variant  and NOT \"the result of a complex intermeshing of degenerative diseases and \ncomorbidities, largely created and exacerbated by environmental factors.\" \n \nAutistic children are NOT \"fully recovering\" after biomedical treatment. Autism is not a disease though some people may have medical conditions as well as autism for which they must obviously receive proper medical treatment.  \n \nMurphy describes herself as \"a lay expert\" in autism yet fails to understand the most basic explanation for rising diagnoses. \n \nYet there's a final insult in the closing lines of the article: \"Adrienne Murphy will be joking about autism as one of the performers in \n         \n         \n            \n                Stand Up For Humanity!

{"date": "18 Nov 2013", "body": "\n \n[Warning-\u00a0\u00a0in this post, written in support of the This is Autism flash blog, I've quoted some of the dehumanising language used by Suzanne Wright.] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI don't get to say what autism is. I'm not autistic though my thirteen year old son is. In learning how to parent him, I've met other autistic people, read their words and I've listened. I'm qualified to say what my son is like, how his awesomeness and autism intersect. I'm also authorised to say that the  wretched \"Call for action\" edict  by\u00a0 Suzanne Wright,\u00a0 co-founder \u00a0of\u00a0 enormously wealthy and powerful, USA organisation Autism Speaks, is revolting, damaging and does not represent my son or my family. Nor does it tally with anything I have learned about autism in the past 11 years. \n \n \n \n \n Autism Speaks Co-founder Suzanne Wright after some\u00a0fantastical\u00a0Photoshopping \u00a0 \n \n \n\" This is autism \" Suzanne claims three times in a piece filled with falsehoods, bigotry, hate and a total negation of the existence of autistic adults. She does not represent my family when she says that we are \"not living\" but are merely \"existing\". Such hubris! She honestly thinks she can speak for all of us. She invents statistics; \"2.3 million [US] dollars to care for one person with autism for their lifetime\" and \"Imagine three million of our own \u2013 unable to dress, or eat independently, unable to use the toilet, unable to cross the street, unable to judge danger or the temperature, unable to pick up the phone and call for help.\" \n \nI'm offended and contemptuous. My son's existence isn't adding to a crisis, he's no national emergency. He's a disabled young person with his own challenges and talents and it's my job to raise him. Autism is part of the naturally occurring diversity of human experience. Unlike Autism Speaks, I don't want a world in which we \" make autism a word that we only see in the history books .\" \n \nSure I am often worn out and I worry about and struggle to understand my children- all three of them, autistic and non-autistic, just as most parents do. Autism brings more challenges to the mix and I have had to battle with service providers and education departments to have my son's needs met. I've weathered the stares and comments of judgemental strangers. What hurts and exasperates me most of all though, is dealing with the  perpetual dehumanising  of people like my autistic son. He's  a great kid - if you are ever lucky enough to meet him you'd see that. He doesn't deserve to have his very humanity constantly called into question. \n \n \n \n Living, not just existing \n \n I will do all in my power to prevent Autism Speaks from gaining a foothold in Ireland and the UK. I request that anyone who has ever contributed to that organisation now withdraw their support and that academic departments think very hard about whether to accept funding from them. An organisation that spreads this rhetoric of fear and hate ought to be shunned. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tD6TF0o5bw0/UooY7Ag2WpI/AAAAAAAABXI/9OXU8dgfDpI/s1600/TIA-2+copy.jpg", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-washington-call-action", "http://autismspeaksblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/suzanne_wright_0611.jpg?w=595", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/museum-tv-radio-honors-bob-wright", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disablism", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/this-is-my-child.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KUa6cvFc4_4/Uoou9Iso32I/AAAAAAAABXU/8udb7QKEKjo/s1600/family.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2013/11/is-this-autism.html", "title": "\nIs This Autism?\n"},

Over time and with lots of help and teaching optimised to his way of learning he learnt to communicate more effectively.  \n \n \n \n \nRyan aged 4 in a play centre- he was speaking in 2 to 3 word sentences then. \n \nOver the years, just about every single time we have been out and about together, people have taken a second look at him. Often it's because of what he's wearing. Ryan loves videos and stories. Most of his language comes from chopping up film scripts and slotting the pieces into place appropriately. He makes films of his own, He likes to dress up as his favourite characters. He's eccentric and catches eyes as he strides along with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders.  \n \n \n \n Ryan aged 6, Robin Hood/Cowboy mash-up \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ryan aged 12 as Curtis the evil raccoon-sheep from Minecraft \n \nPeople look because Ryan can be loud. He comes out with unexpected expressions. Sometimes he's angry and lashes out though it's very rarely physical and he holds back from hurting as best he can. Often he talks to himself and he moves in non-typical ways. He often livens up walking with a perfectly executed pirouette.  \n \n \nMost people look instinctively then go on about their day when they see that it's just a boy out living his life as he's entitled to. Rarely do people progress from simple curiosity to outright rudeness and the stares of strangers don't affect me. Over the years I've developed a force field that surrounds me and my boy and the people who try to catch my eye so they can register their disapproval are rarely successful. Some still try but I notice it much less than when he was younger. His disability is more apparent as he grows. He's not like typically developing teenagers. \n \nMost people are lovely- they smile at Ryan, they show us kindness when we need it. Ryan abounds with kindness and concern for others. He deserves to have his place in the world, to be accepted and to have the few accommodations he requires to participate.

Wowee positive outcomes! That sounds like a good if rather vague achievement. And you're subsidising a trial? Does that mean people are actually being asked to pay to take part in a research project? Ethics fail. \n \n \n    \n    I have attached a couple of pdf's for you to look at and look forward to hearing back from you when you have a moment. \n \n    \u00a0 \n \n    Best Regards, \n    Jeremy Jones \n \n    Double Helix Water (UK) Limited \n \n    Company Number 8482978 \n \n    Distributors of Double Helix Water for United Kingdom and Ireland\" \n \n(Double Helix Water-it's like DNA and water combined and doesn't that sound just awesome!) \n\n  Jeremy's email included a link to a science-y video all about the mysteries of water. Also attached was a slick marketing PDF which is what really piqued my ire.  I can't find a link (will forward PDF to anyone interested)   I uploaded it to Google Drive  and here's the opening page: \n\n   \n   \u00a0 \n \n    \n \n      \n       \n     \n \n      \n      Autism- ripping jeans and upsetting little kids since 1943 \n     \n \n   \n \n   \u00a0 \n \n   \u00a0 \n \n   They're selling hope, the most marketable of all products. But they need first of all to frighten potential customers who, if they knew that autism is part of the naturally occurring diversity of human experience, wouldn't be hoodwinked by their pitch. \n \n   \u00a0 \n \n   This document which I'm calling  A New Hope  goes on to proclaim that we're in the midst of a Global Epidemic, autism is a \"medical and social issue that we can no longer afford to ignore. It has to be dealt with, and real solutions need to be \n   found.\"\u00a0 \n \n   \u00a0 \n \n   This is followed up with an unreferenced \"study\" concluding that biomedical treatments are 81% safer and 60% more effective at \"producing improvement\" than drug treatments for autism, all based on parent consultations and the Autism Research Institute.\u00a0 \n \n   \u00a0 \n \n   So much fail. To start: \n \n    \n \n     who was \"improved\" and how? \n \n     drugs don't count as \"biomedical treatments\"?! \n \n     how was relative safety defined and measured \n \n     parental opinion is hardly objective. \n \n     the Autism Research Institute is a key player in the axis of autism-vaccine nonsense, it is a disreputable organisation promoting pseudo-scientific and potentially dangerous treatments for autism. \n \n     what exactly are the drug treatments referred to? \n \nOn to page 11 and more misinformation: \n    \n    \"Genetics Does Not Explain Autism \n    A Stanford University study of twins published last year found that genetics accounts for just 38 percent of the risk.\" \nThat's not what  the study  found- its authors say that the role of environmental factors has been underestimated. However an  alternative analysis of their data  concludes that it supports the findings of all previous twin studies and provides further evidence of the heritability of autism. \n    \n   There is certainly no evidence for  A New Hope's  next claim, \"The Majority Of Autism Is Caused By Environmental Factors.\" \n   After the usual autism-snake-oil pitch about gastrointestinal disorders and chemicals and toxins (oh my!) we're shown the solution- our saviour is so highly qualified the page is crammed with accolades: \n    \n    \n     \n \n       \n        \n      \n \n       \n       Our hero \n      \n \n    \n \n   And this genius discovered something remarkable- stable water clusters. I think he means ice crystals. But anyway these,  A New Hope  claims, \"have a remarkable effect on the Human Immune system.\" \n    \n   What is it with quacks and non-standard word capitalisation? \n    \n   On page 21 we learn that they use \"Completely Safe thermal imaging\" not harmful x-rays to examine the patient. But why would anyone even suggest using x-rays to discover anything about autism?! \n    \n    \n     \n \n       \n        \n      \n \n       \n       Pink bad green good \n      \n \n    \n \n   So the magic water is administered and as the \"startling\" thermal image above of an autistic 7 year old shows, after only 20 minutes the child's temperature has dropped. Perhaps the heating was broken. \n    \n    A New Hope  ends with a pair of testimonials about how the magic water made a little boy and autistic teens smarter and healthier. \n    \n   OK I'm convinced- where can I sign up to get the boy known as Duncan a supply of water clusters to make him more green and less autistic? Thankfully there's a  FAQ on the website  telling all. There's also the small detail of cost, they ask \"participants to contribute $800 for this research project for three months\". And they have the cheek to ask people to fork out that kind of money for water with a  disclaimer  that comprehensively states that participants can and should expect nothing for their money: \"Nothing in this material is presented here as an effort to offer or render medical advice or opinions or otherwise engage in any type of medical practice.\" \n    \n   This is a ridiculous con but some parents of autistic children will fall for it. It disgusts me that the people behind these companies are so lacking in standards, morals and ethics that they prey on people at a vulnerable point in their lives. \n    \n    Mike  directed me to a site  dedicated to water quackery  which other than homoeopathy, was to me, an undiscovered ocean of woo. Dr Lo and his Double Helix water gets  a special mention . \n    \n   And  Allan  sent me a link to an inadvertently funny video about emotional water- with ice crystal formation supposedly dependant on exposure to words. \n    \n   What would happen if the water was exposed to these words? \n    \n    \n     \n \n    \n     \n \n   \u00a0 \n\n\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2U9qZqxqkPSYkV6Q0dMU293cVE/edit?usp=sharing", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BOeplL99Wbg/UcwhbpeBJNI/AAAAAAAABTM/0Nvy8gdOaC8/s855/autism+a+new+hope.png", "http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1107328", "http://www.wiringthebrain.com/2011/07/environmental-influences-on-autism.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6Drc4sKx8-o/Ucw6QyGiFxI/AAAAAAAABTc/J4HksjUycQo/s816/our+hero.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xxHlEFMyxEA/Ucw9iOJrbKI/AAAAAAAABTs/JCdYeL8Bx-E/s412/pink+bad+blue+green+good.png", "http://www.joinautismstudy.net/autism-study-q-a/", "http://www.joinautismstudy.net/disclaimer/", "http://penumbrage.com/", "http://www.chem1.com/CQ/", "http://www.chem1.com/CQ/clusqk.html#IES", "http://www.caricatures-ireland.com/blog", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yyMkbIIF5hw/UcxVMS_ua2I/AAAAAAAABT8/Tl6-AIlP69g/s488/huckster.png"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2013/06/double-helix-water-autism-quackery.html", "title": "\nDouble Helix Water Autism Quackery\n"},
{"date": "18 Jun 2013", "body": "\nI posted on Facebook about the photos of Nigella Lawson having her neck squeezed by Charles Saatchi and called him a typical abusive creep for making a statement minimising his behaviour by describing it as merely a \"playful tiff\". One of my friends said \"I just cannot understand why such a smart, beautiful and independently successful woman would have stayed with him throughout torment like this!\" \n \nI thought about this and decided to respond here instead of on Facebook. \n I don't know why she stayed, only she can answer. But I would be very surprised if at least some of the reasons I shall list don't apply.\u00a0 \n \n So here is why she and people like her may stay: \n \n It started out so slowly and insidiously that she didn't realise it was abuse until she was married or much later. \n She thinks that she doesn't deserve better. \n She's afraid, confused, guilty and burdened by obligation. \n He's hurting and needs her love. She can heal him, it's her duty to just keep giving. \n She thinks she's to blame for most of what goes wrong- if she could stop being so emotional and weak things might improve. \n She sees him behave properly in every other situation except with her- it's her fault. \n She minimises incidents, explosions, hurts and humiliations as soon as things get on a more even keel.\u00a0 \n She feels embarrassed, thinks she overreacts, knows she's not perfect, thinks of herself as too argumentative and combatative.\u00a0 \n She finds it hard to keep track of what happens. \n She still feels love for her partner- it may turn out that the emotion could more accurately described as pity. \n She's frightened of change, of things getting even worse if she tries to end the relationship. \n She can't imagine how things would be if the marriage ended. \n She's afraid of being alone.\u00a0 \n She's concerned about the impact on her children. \n She's afraid of what a man with wealth and power could do to her if she tries to leave him, how he could affect her reputation or career. Will he start telling people that she's mentally ill or unstable? \n Sometimes it's fun being with him, she remembers good times they shared, sometimes he acts as though he might actually love her. \n He might apologise, promise that he loves her, he'll change and do whatever it takes to make things ok, but that he can't do it without her.\u00a0 \n Stockholm syndrome is real- the person causing the hurt may then take care of her, increasing the confusion, making her dependent on him and feeling like she couldn't possibly cope without him. \n His promises keep lighting the hope that things will improve. Hope takes a long time to die. \n Ending a marriage goes against all her values and principles, she thinks that she must fight harder to make it work, give it one more go, try to accept things or be more understanding. \n Ending a marriage means admitting defeat- she must accept that she failed to either pick the right partner or to make a marriage work. She might feel shame especially if\u00a0she's the only person this has happened to in her family. She might feel shame that people will blame other difficulties in her life for making marriage impossible. \n \n \nAll kinds of women and men can be in abusive relationships. Thankfully sometimes she recognises what's been happening, fights the denial, crushes false hope and with a heck of a lot of help, she gets out of it and makes a far better life without the abusive jerk.

{"date": "1 Apr 2012", "body": "\n \nThey've never heard of the social mode of disability down at the Vatican. This is a breathtakingly backwards view of autism. Archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski, get in touch and I'll set you straight on a few things. \nHere's  his take on autism : \n \n\"On the occasion of the Fifth World Autism Day, the Church intends to express her nearness to those who are  burdened by the weight of this profound suffering . In large measure still to be explored, autistic spectrum disorders constitute, indeed, for those who are affected by them, a  grave alteration  of behaviour, of verbal and non-verbal communication, and of social integration, with a wide-ranging effect on the  normal development and evolution of the personality .\" \n(Emphasis mine)  \nWHAT!? Such disdainful, othering language. The problem, Zimowski thinks, are the disordered, abnormal \"gravely altered\" autistic people.  \n \nI wonder if he ever knowingly met an autistic person or did he just ask Tony Humphreys what they're like? If he spent any time connecting with a few autistic people himself, he might realise how wrong he is when he says:  \n \n\"In this pathological movement of self-envelopment and closure to the other and the external world, the Church sees as impelling the task of placing herself at the side of these people \u2013 children and young people in particular \u2013 and their families, if not to breakdown these barriers of silence then at least to share in solidarity and prayer in their journey of suffering. Indeed, this suffering, at times, also acquires features of frustration and resignation, not least because of the still scarce therapeutic results. These frustrations are to be seen, in particular, in families which, although they look after these children with loving care, experience repercussions as regards the quality of their own lives, and are often, in their turn, led to be closed up in an isolation that marginalises and wounds.\" \nSuch florid nonsense.  \nThis is a 45 year old Bettelheim-era and utterly discredited vision of autism. Autism doesn't mean closure to the outside world. And what barriers of silence is he talking about? I know some autistic people who don't speak but none who are silent. Not all autistic people are children. Not all families with autistic members are closed up, marginalised and wounded. \nZimowski continues:  \n \n\"The Church and all people of good will thus feel committed to being \u2018travelling companions\u2019 with those who live this eloquent silence, which calls upon our sensitivity towards the suffering of others, following the emblematic example portrayed in the gospel parable of the Good Samaritan.\" \n\"Eloquent silence\". Oh wow. \n \nIt's too awful to go through this line by line but here's a selection of words this pillar of the Catholic Church uses to talk about autistic people like my wonderful son. To the archbishop they have:  \n \n \"a pathology which affects more people in numerical terms than could have been imagined only a few years ago\" \n \"the gravest and most devastating disability\" \n \"a grave psychological disturbance\" \n \n \nAnd they are: \n \n \"people with autistic disturbances\" \n \"enveloped in the mystery of silence\" \n \"a living and transparent sign of the presence of the Resurrected Christ in the world.\"\u00a0 \n \nNo Archbishop, they are people living with a disability in the same real and right-now world as everyone else. They deserve, like all people to be treated with kindness, respect and decency. They do not require your pity or your depction of them as disturbed and mysterious ciphers. They need to be listened to, understood and accepted.

{"date": "25 Mar 2012", "body": "\n Soaring autism; I envision loads of autistic children running down a grassy slope, arms outstretched, pretending to be aeroplanes. A few who enjoy a good spinning session could be helicopters instead. But sadly that's not what this post is about.  \nLast week, several newspapers published articles on increasing numbers of children in schools having diagnoses of autism. Among these were:  \n  Daily Telegraph:  Number of children with autism soars by more than 50 per cent in five years  \n Daily Mail:  Number of schoolchildren classified as being autistic soars by 56% in five years \n Irish Independent:  Number of children with autism soars by more than 50pc in five years \n Parentdish:  Some parents claim their kids are autistic to gain advantage at school, claims expert \n I assume these identical articles, all laden with wailing and the gnashing of teeth due to the  burden of the dread autism , were based on press releases from either the group featured prominently in each,  The Centre for Real Education  (CRE) or the contrary academic Frank Furedi who's personal views on autism are accorded much more weight than they deserve.  \n \nThe  NAS has a useful, detailed and well referenced article  about autism numbers and concludes \"it appears that a prevalence rate of around 1 in 100 is a best estimate of the prevalence [of autism] in children\". \n \nHowever these articles all open with a discussion of how the number of children in schools diagnosed with autism has doubled in the past and with current figures of approximately 1 in every 125 pupils. I fail to see the problem. Autism is a common condition. It was under-diagnosed for years, the criteria were much stricter so that many people who have a disability were not getting enough support. Now the criteria have been widened, there is better recognition of the condition and more children are getting accurate diagnoses.  \n \nFuredi is quoted in each of the articles as saying, \n \"It is unlikely to be a genuine unprecedented increase in autism, rather  an institutional use of this condition to allow people to get easier  access to resources. This activity ends up trivialising what is a very serious condition for some children.\" That's the opinion of a man with zero expertise in autism. He presents no facts to back up his claims and he can quite easily be ignored.  \n \nThe CRE spokesperson says, \n \"Obviously children with autism need special treatment. But the rapid increase does suggest that perhaps the figures should be looked at again.  \nChildren should not be classified as having special needs too easily. The rise should be examined closely because it has a knock-on effect for teachers, schools and the pupils themselves.\" All children need special treatment. Children with a disability require accommodations to give them access to a good individualised education adapted to maximise their learning. This happens for some people but most autistic children in schools are not getting the support they deserve.  \n The CRE philosophy on education is set out here in their  manifesto for common sense .  That title alone tells me much about how this group sees the world. They favour selective education, \"meaningful punishment\" for bad behaviour, traditional values, parental choice (for the kind of parents they approve of) and demand that lots of current progressive practices \"should be halted.\" They want more emphasis on facts and knowledge and less on skills. They demand that art, music and literature lessons concentrate on approved classics.  \n They have a section on \"Special Needs\"\u00a0 When the proportion of pupils with genuine special needs is probably  only around 5%,\u00a0the educational establishment's acceptance of 20% or  more is intolerable.[5]  Recommendation: Immediate steps should be taken to reduce the  artificially high percentage of 'special needs' by ensuring that only  those that are genuine are specified \u2013 and properly catered for. The  widespread practice of exaggerating special needs to gain additional  funding should be halted.\u00a0  Clearly I checked out reference [5] to see where those numbers come from- and was baffled to find that it was an old article by Minette  Marrin in the Daily Telegraph.  For real!  This is what counts as reference-worthy to the CRE.  \n \nMinette Marin is one of those click-baiting troll columnists and  I've discussed her before  after her vicious and hateful piece calling babies with Down Syndrome and their families \"damaged babies\" and \"damaged families\". The only other person in the CRE list of references with whom I'm familiar is Melanie Phillips.  \n \nThis is speculation presented with no evidence that the needs of disabled children are being exaggerated. The CRE are not worth listening to. \n \nThe NAS spokesperson makes a typically sensible contribution to the discussion: \n \"We know that with accurate diagnosis the right support can be put in place so that children with autism can reach their full potential. It\u2019s very likely that all teachers and school staff will come into contact with children with autism at some stage during their teaching career, so it\u2019s vital that they receive quality training and strategies to support these children in the classroom.\" As usual the comment sections on these articles descend into a mire of anti-scientific, disablist nonsense.  \n \nI can't imagine why the CRE and Frank Furedi were considered worth quoting on these matters. I wish the papers would look more closely at the people sending them stories and examine their agendas.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9160322/Number-of-children-with-autism-soars-by-more-than-50-per-cent-in-five-years.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2118804/Autism-Number-schoolchildren-classified-autistic-soars-56-years.html#ixzz1q7xmJXs7", "http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/parenting/number-of-children-with-autism-soars-by-more-than-50pc-in-five-years-3059040.html", "http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2012/03/23/some-parents-claim-their-kids-are-autistic-to-gain-advantage-at-school-claims-frank-furedi/", "http://www.cre.org.uk/", "http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/some-facts-and-statistics/statistics-how-many-people-have-autism-spectrum-disorders.aspx", "http://www.cre.org.uk/docs/what_should_be_done.html", "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/prenatal-testing-and-disability.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/03/soaring-autism-children.html", "title": "\nSoaring Autism Children\n"},

I messed up the html somewhere and am unable to edit that post- even to add a title and there was another part of the interview I wanted to write about so I shall do so here. \n \nTony Humphreys said something that can't be left unopposed. This is what he claimed was his  good news message . He told the interviewer, Claire Byrne:  \n \"when I wrote that article, Claire, I thought this was good news. I thought that I was going to ... that  parents would be relieved ... \"I haven't passed any neurobiological defect on to my children, or any genetic defect .\" The news now is that there are creative possibilities if we examine everything in our own lives and our children's lives, we may now discover, \"Oh My God, this is what may help my child and myself to have a deeper relationship.\"\" (Emphasis mine.) \nThis is not good news. This is an outrageously disablist, callous and immoral position to hold. Tony Humphreys thinks we will be relieved at not having passed on our children's conditions genetically. The corollary is that he thinks we out to feel shame if our children are born with a genetic condition (or  defect , to use his term) like Fragile X, or Huntingdon's Disease, or Sickle Cell, or Down Syndrome -or autism. He has this bizarre idea that we will be pleased to know that our genes lack any of those icky, troublesome defects and it was just the way we failed to raise our children properly that caused all the trouble. But hey, here comes Tony with a solution- creative examinations to build deeper relationships- or something. \n \n What Tony doesn't understand is that I am proud of my children, pleased that my genes go towards making each of them who they are. I delight in my one perfectly autistic son. He is not defective. Many people who have autistic children are themselves autistic to some degree. More of us share some Broader Autism Phenotypes. Why would this man expect me to feel shame of something I am only proud of? \n \n    \n   \nSome of the genetic conditions I listed result in illness or shortened life-span. In those cases also, guilt or shame have no place in effective parenting. Parents can be proud of their children and do their best for them while supporting proper research efforts to improve the lives of their children.  \n \nFor that reason we do well to avoid the quacks and snake-oil salespeople who promise creative possibilities for problems we don't actually agree that we have.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/thevoyage/90172145/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/thevoyage/90172145/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/thevoyage/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/good-news-according-to-tony.html", "title": "\nThe Good News According to Tony\n"},
{"date": "14 Feb 2012", "body": "\nOn Saturday I listened to Claire Byrne interview Tony Humphreys on the  Marian Finucane  show. It was the first media appearance the disgraced psychologist has made since publishing his vile column in the Irish Examiner, apart from some quotes in that paper in which he reiterated his notions while claiming he never intended to hurt anyone. \n \n(A transcript of the show has been made available on the  Irish Autism Action Facebook  page. I have used this but altered a few words to fit what I heard TH saying.) \n \n \nHe was introduced as \"consultant clinical psychologist Dr Tony Humphreys\" though I have yet to see evidence that this title accurately describes his experience and training. When asked what he though of the reaction to his piece he replied: \n \n \n\"I was absolutely overwhelmed, because my intention was to bring good news to people but that somehow what I said was very much misinterpreted as my blaming parents and if anybody knows my work over the last 20 years I have always said parents always do their best. Parents never deliberately neglect their children. But we all come into our roles whether as parents or teachers or childminders, other adults [unclear] with our own hurts and our own unresolved issues and these operate at an unconscious level and what's been hugely missing from the whole controversy is that we operate unconsciously we never consciously want to hurt anybody, right, or neglect our children and not love our children.\" \nThis cracks me up. Like a missionary, he sought to bring \"good news\" to the unenlightened. I can't wait to find out quite what this is. He then claims that all his many critics are at fault as we have \"very much misinterpreted\" his words. Nope, the problem isn't that we have poor reading comprehension, but that he wrote a terrible, parent-blaming, diagnoses-denying, inaccurate and illogical article. He says what is \"hugely missing\" is that we, the parents whom he reckons have the magical ability to train our children to be autistic, are doing this without being aware of our actions. Poor Tony, he seems to think we object to his twisted thesis because it hurts our feelings. Well it does, but that's not the point. We object because it is bollocks.  \n \nWhen asked if he thinks parents can cause autism by being heartless he said:  \n \n \n\"No because I don't ... I mean, I've ... see I don't believe in autism and I concur with Dr Timimi that autism has not been established as a neurobiological fact, right. What I do believe, right, what, if anybody responds to you or me in a heartless way then we do react, right, and we find a way to protect ourselves and defend ourselves against that heartless reaction. But we do that unconsciously as well. It is not that we want to hurt the person that treats us unkindly, it is that we have a need within ourselves to be kindly met that now becomes unmet, so we retreat into a defence and what happens then is that defence meets defence and the whole thing escalates.\" \n\"I DON'T BELIEVE IN AUTISM\"!!!!!! This is a position of faith, for this man evidence is irrelevant and facts don't count.  \n \n \n\"I think one of the other things I want to say Claire, is that you know, eh, in my work over the last thirty years, ehm, my work has always been about compassion and understanding and empowerment of people and I was shocked, right, absolutely shocked at the level of hurt out there and, um, in my experience a huge sadness around that because I would never, never wanted to create that in any human being, right and so ... and also I have suffered my own hurt in, you know, in being seen as somebody who would want to cause hurt because actually it's light years away from what I would want to do.\" \nAgain with the self pity and the refusal to accept responsibility and the consequences for the harm and hurt he has caused. Instead he is sad at how  he  has been portrayed- such a consciously selfish and immature reaction. He continued to try to justify his self-serving behaviour as \"opening a debate\". No he isn't, he is disagreeing with well established explanations of autism, that are backed up with proper research and evidence.  \n \nThe interviewer played a tape of Dr Timimi saying that he absolutely does not take the position Tony Humphreys does on autism. Humphreys was unrepentant, and when asked about how, unlike Timimi, he is \"pointing the finger at parents\" he said:  \n \n \n\"Um no, well not only at the parents right, but it's not pointing the finger, in other words ... I've worked with many parents over the years, children ... parents with children. Labelling them with ASD, ADHD and the other labels that children get, right, and when parents come to me, I hold ... that I ... if they are in troubled places, my first response is to where they are at, right, and to look at what they are carrying and the hurts they're carrying and to resolve those hurts. As those hurts are resolved, they automatically change in their relationship with their children. Now it's not just parents who are in relationships with children. Every one of us is in a relationship with children and that old village, that old African saying, \"it takes a village to raise a child\" is so accurate because it takes a whole society to raise a child and child minders and teachers and peer groups all affect children's' concepts of themselves.\" \nSo he accepts that he blames parents and all adults involved in raising children but somehow thinks this is not pointing the finger because, presumably, all these errant adults are failing their children unconsciously. The thing that Tony doesn't seem to get, is that neglecting children will harm them, but it  won't make them autistic ! People who are autistic were not made that way by how their parents raised them. He reiterated his notion that we, the parents of autistic people, need to get over ourselves and sort our own issues:  \n \n \n\"But we all carry baggage, we all have major defences and unless we get the holding in relationships, we don't examine our defences, and to examine our defences is very challenging in a judgemental culture.\" \nAfter more waffle he passed judgement on how we fail to respond to our children's communication.  \n \nUnderstanding and enabling our children's ability to communicate more effectively is one of the most important thing parents and teachers of autistic children can do. But we learn how to do that by talking to people who understand autism- autistic people being the most important teachers of all. We can also learn from experienced speech and language therapists, teachers and other professionals.  \n \nTony Humphreys pontificated at some length on his own quaint notions about autism and developmental disability. He shared an anecdote about a woman who \"realised that she hadn't been making eye contact with her child.\" He claimed that babies \"make the most amazing eye contact with us, right, because they need us first to see them and to respond to them.\"  \n \nMy autistic son never made eye contact with me as a baby. His non-autistic siblings both did. All three were breast fed for over a year and I gazed adoringly at each one as I held them. Duncan was uninterested in looking back. It was innate in him even as an infant. Tony Humphreys denies that is possible.  \n \nTony Humphreys named a few people whom he claims agree with him but ignores the proper peer-reviewed scientific research, then he said: \n \n \n\"there's a whole huge body of research out there. But I can understand, right, that people who have believed a certain thing for many years, it's very difficult now to have that suddenly challenged, right, and I have no trouble with sitting with these people and hearing where they are coming from once they also give me the freedom to also to say where I am coming from\" \nI doubt that Tony Humphreys would really want to sit with me and hear where I'm coming from. He pulls a freedom of speech defence too, asking us to allow him to say his piece. Sure, he can hold whatever bizarre notions he wants, he can think that autism is caused by extraterrestrials if he wants, he just shouldn't teach that at a reputable university, to influence people who may well work with these disabled children, or to be held up as an expert and given a column in a national newspaper. My dog knows more about autism than Tony Humphreys. \n \nThe best bit of the interview occurred when he had a quote from his article read back to him and he said it was \"a total misinterpretation of what [he] said\" and that he wasn't \"playing word games with anybody!\" Classic!  \n \nHe ended with his line about opening debate and the interview ended so the good people of Ireland could worship some bells. \n \nToday the Irish Minister for Health, James Reilly, who has an autistic son,  publicly condemned Tony Humphreys  (link opens video). So now the Health Minister, all the Irish autism charities, huge numbers of parents and autistic people, the Psychological Society of Ireland, a raft of experienced and respected autism professionals and researchers, the two men named in the original article- all stand united in their criticism of Tony Humphreys. \n \nHilariously, in the video linked to above, we learn that Tony Humphreys encourages the Minister and all parents of autistic children to read the up-to-date literature on autism. The bare-faced cheek of the scoundrel! He doesn't regret speaking out on what he BELIEVES is the truth. Again with the faith Tony! \n \nI'd ask Tony Humphreys to do the same. I'm much better informed than he is and very much wish he would heed his own words. Then he needs to apologise and retire from making public pronouncements on autism and all medical conditions.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rte.ie/radio1/marianfinucane/2012-02-11.html", "http://www.facebook.com/Irishautism/posts/366224463390852", "http://www.tv3.ie/3player/show/2/45359/1/News-Updates"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/on-saturday-i-listened-to-claire-byrne.html", "title": "\nClaire Byrne Interviews Tony Humphreys\n"},

They have been criticised both by fellow experts and parents of children who have the condition. \n \n\"It is grossly inaccurate and demonstrated a clear ignorance of the most basic understanding of autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD),\" said Brigid Sinnott, manager of ABA and Autism Services in St Catherine\u2019s Association. \n \nDr Humphreys has since said parents were \"never to blame\" for autism and his intention was simply \"to inform and enlighten\". \n \nPSI president Michael Drumm said: \"Tony Humphreys\u2019 assertions are not supported by the vast body of published research in the field of ASDs and are unhelpful and likely to cause upset.\" ENOUGH of the guff about what Tony Humphreys intentions were- lots of people do harm unintentionally but they should still be held to account.  \n \nHere comes the apology bit: \n Irish Examiner editor Tim Vaughan, in an editorial earlier this week, apologised for the hurt caused by Dr Humphreys\u2019 comments. \n \n\"His comments have caused enormous upset for many parents and relatives of children with autism and I very much regret and am sorry for this,\" said Mr Vaughan last night. This is a classic non-apology. Tim Vaughan is sorry, not for the actions of his paper, but for the reactions we have had to it and I do not need Tim Vaughan to apologise for me.  \n \nI think it is the best we can hope to get from this newspaper. I think they have a very skewed sense of decency and ethics. Tony Humphreys is back writing his pcychobabble column in today's Irish Examiner Feelgood section. And again his topic of choice is \"love.\" I have not had a chance to read it yet but have it good authority that it adheres to the man's usual standards of expression, logic and accuracy. \n \n Let us not forget that this is not all about autism. A bit of searching has shown that this man has pontificated on all sorts of serious conditions:  asthma, IBS ,  cancer ,  schizophrenia ,  tonsillitis . The Irish Examiner have taken his columns on IBS and asthma down from their site. Yet they still employ him to write as an expert in their health supplement. I find this astonishing. \n \nThe Irish Examiner have a very skewed sense of journalistic integrity and ethics. However I read that Alan Crosbie, chair of the group which publishes the paper, at a recent conference on media diversity in Dublin,  called on the governmant  to: \n \"address the threat to humanity posed by the tsunami of unverifiable data, opinion, libel and vulgar abuse in new media.\u201d  Isn't it ironic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/comments-likely-to-cause-upset-183321.html", "https://p.twimg.com/AlSO5uLCMAEea7J.jpg", "http://www.tonyhumphreys.ie/news/previous/034ministersview.html", "http://www.tonyhumphreys.ie/news/previous/027cure.html", "http://www.tonyhumphreys.ie/news/previous/049lump.html", "http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0207/1224311401153.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/half-hearted-apology-from-irish.html", "title": "\nHalf Hearted Apology from Irish Examiner\n"},
{"date": "9 Feb 2012", "body": "\n The saga continues. The Irish Examiner  today have Tony Humphreys' words in their paper , as both the paper and the disgraced \"psychologist\" attempt once again to excuse the damaging and error-laden autism article. Unfortunately they do not offer an apology or a retraction. In direct opposition to the what they published on Friday, today's piece has the title, \"Parents \u2018never to blame\u2019 for autism.\" and is by Conall \u00d3 F\u00e1tharta. Well Conall, that's been known for about 50 years, but nice of the Examiner to finally catch up. Dr  Tony Humphreys  said parents were \"never to blame\" for  autism and his  intention was simply \"to inform and enlighten\" the public of research in  the area.  Tony Humphreys needs to be clearer- he needs to say, \"On Friday I had an article published in which I directly and unequivocally claimed that bad parenting causes autism.I was wrong and I apologise.\" \nBecause that is what happened. This is just more bullshit spin. He was not attempting to \"inform and enlighten\" he was making a claim he had zero evidence for.  \n He has been severely criticised for his article in  last Friday\u2019s Irish Examiner which gave the impression  parents were to  blame for their child\u2019s condition. Yesterday, he said he never intended  \"to hurt anybody\".  The article did more than \"[give] the impression  parents were to  blame for their child\u2019s condition\" in the article he made his opinion perfectly clear- parents are to blame for their child's condition. \n \nTony Humphreys is quoted: \n \"My intentions were honourable. I wanted to  inform the public of up-to-date research that is there. It was never my  intention to hurt anybody.  \n\"I have the greatest compassion  for parenting. It is the most important profession we have in society  and one which we get the least preparation for. We don\u2019t prepare parents  for the complexity of what is involved.\"  I care not what his intentions were, I'm interested in the facts and the very real effects. If he hadn't intended to hurt anyone he should not have written his toxic, damaging article. He did  not  inform the public of up-to-date research, he was rehashing a theory comprehensibly discredited  50 years ago .  \n Dr Humphreys said he  simply wished to show research that had proposed a broader examination  of autism rather than focusing on it as simply a genetic neurobiological  disorder.  \n \n\"There are complexities and intricacies of family life that didn\u2019t come through in what has been said.  \n\"What I wanted to inform people of is that we need to look at children  in a broader sense and look at every aspect of their lives, every  relationship they have, at their social and economic experiences, rather  than just focusing on a  hypothetical, neurobiological defect.  \n\"I wanted to point out that we should look at every aspect of a  child\u2019s life in order to truly understand why children behave a certain  way,\" he said. Tony Humphreys informed people of nothing but his own prejudice and ignorance. He may have seen this going differently in his imagination but thankfully, I don't live in Tony Humphreys' head and the reality is, he hasn't a clue what current research says. His buff about looking into the families of children with autism counts for nothing. Is he going to have someone poke into the \"complexities and intricacies\" of everyone's family life? We know from his other writings that he thinks parents cause all sorts of conditions  from IBS to asthma , so Tony Humphreys would probably say yes, lets examine the dynamics of every family in the country and check they adhere to some state mandated level of love and support. That's bound to work.  \n At a public meeting in Cork last night, a  mother of a five-year-old boy with autism confronted him but he refused  to elaborate on what he had written in the Irish Examiner, and said he  had already given his response to criticism. Well done that mum. He has given a response, but it is totally inadequate. \n Dr Tony Humphreys responded to  comments on blogs and social media  websites which questioned his professional background. He pointed out he  had  a BA (hons) and MA (hons) in applied psychology from UCC and a PhD  in clinical psychology from the University of Birmingham.  \n \nDr  Humphreys worked for eight years with Mid-Western Health Board  psychiatric services and for two years in Staffordshire Health Authority  in Britain. He also has 20 years\u2019 experience as a courses director and  lecturer in UCC.  His qualifications do not protect him from justifiable criticism. Parents of autistic children, autistic people themselves and professionals with a real knowledge and understanding of the condition are united in their criticism of his piece. Knowledgeable, experienced and skilled psychologists, both educational and clinical, have expertise on autism and can be incredibly helpful to families. I have had valuable input from these professionals at various stages. Tony Humphreys is bringing the profession into disrepute. Parents may be put off using their services in fear of finding others with stone age views like Humphreys. \n \nI also am very concerned that a man with his views is allowed to teach anyone and the reputation of UCC is damaged by its connection with this man.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/parents-never-to-blame-for-autism-183181.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/sage-continues.html", "title": "\n"},
{"date": "8 Feb 2012", "body": "\nI wondered why the Irish Examiner editorial was so keen to protect Tony Humphreys and to continue to promote him as a \"highly experienced and well-regarded clinical psychologist, successful author, and broadcaster.\" Then I discovered he is a regular columnist in their Feel Good heath supplement. I read a few more of his column, they usually say the same thing- parents don't love their children unconditionally, indeed bad parenting abounds and causes all ills. Here is  his take on irritable bowel syndrome  (IBS). The PDF file linked to may not open, but I have saved a copy. \n As regards IBS, when exploring the psycho-social aspects of the dis-ease (word reads more accurately when hyphenated), it is important to understand that the psycho-social intentions of the dis-ease will be different for each person who has the condition and that for a particular person the intentions will differ each time the symptoms reoccur.  For instance, the unmet needs of a sufferer of IBS when a child or a teenager will be very different to those the person has when adult.  Unmet needs \u2014 physical, emotional, social, sexual, intellectual, behavioural \u2014 are the sources of most problems in living, lack of loving being the most common.  (Emphasis mine.) He also pontificates on asthma. Asthma is a serious and potentially fatal condition. According to  Asthma UK , on average, 3 people per day or 1 person every 8 hours dies from asthma. Only experienced and properly qualified people ought to write as experts on such a condition. But here is non-expert Tony Humphreys writing in the  Irish Examiner and giving his unique \"perspective\" on asthma : \n The causes of asthma are not known and the suggestion of a genetic link is too remote to be seriously considered. Certainly, environmental causes have been posited \u2014 dust mites, pollution, over-heated homes \u2014 but these don\u2019t ring true because most people who are exposed to these same physical environmental threats do not develop asthma.  The environmental threats that are far more prevalent for children are emotional and social. The home is the most dangerous place for children to be \u2014 the threats they may daily encounter are physical, sexual, emotional, intellectual, behavioural and social \u2014 the greatest of all being the absence of unconditional love. Again the PDF link I give isn't working for everyone but I have copied the article and taken screengrabs. \n \n \n \n \n This is so dangerous and wrong. Tony Humphreys is a menace and the Irish Examiner has even more explaining to do.\u00a0  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.irishexaminer.com/feelgood/archive/2010-06-25.pdf", "http://www.asthma.org.uk/news_media/media_resources/for_journalists_key.html", "http://www.irishexaminer.com/feelgood/archive/2010-05-21.pdf", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ADM7vZu0gv0/TzJInWVnFrI/AAAAAAAABNE/QijnYfBoQWA/s1600/asthma3.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8zolDtjGIZ8/TzJIs_LN-wI/AAAAAAAABNU/tlzl5rguhMI/s1600/humphreys+asthma1.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p2nOLYAg75c/TzJIqHynmnI/AAAAAAAABNM/cr8XXGCfYwk/s1600/asthma2.png", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ADM7vZu0gv0/TzJInWVnFrI/AAAAAAAABNE/QijnYfBoQWA/s1600/asthma3.png"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/tony-humphreys-in-irish-examiner.html", "title": "\nTony Humphreys in Irish Examiner- Parents to Blame for Asthma\n"},
{"date": "6 Feb 2012", "body": "\nTony Humphreys' awful article has been criticised in several places.  Lisa wrote  how reading it made her feel she had: \n stepped into a time warp that has taken us back to the 1950's when  Autism was blamed on so-called \"refrigerator mothers\" whose coldness  towards their children caused them to be developmentally delayed and  socially withdrawn. \nShe also makes an important point about Humphreys' academic pursuits: \n Disturbingly I found out today that he lectures on \" interpersonal communications \" and \" parent mentoring \" at University College Cork. So potentially there is a student being indoctrinated with these ideas right now. \nI have emailed the  Vice President for Teaching and Learning at University College Cork and  The Centre for Adult Continuing Education, asking them to investigate this matter, writing: \n Dr Humphreys even goes so far as to assert in his article that the very  existence  of  autism is not a scientific fact, an utterly ridiculous assertion. These  are toxic, false and damaging ideas. It is very worrying that a  university of such repute would allow someone holding these views to  teach particularly on courses taken by parents and those training to  work as Special Needs Assistants.  I look forward to hearing their response. \n \n \nI had emailed Professor Simon Baron-Cohen yesterday to alert him to the misrepresentation of his research in Tony Humphreys' article. He was kind enough to reply that he was going to tweet a public response; \n \n \n \nHe wrote, \"Offensive Irish article blames autism on unemotional parenting and turns the clock back 50 years  http://tiny.cc/ffxg8 \" \n \nIt doesn't look good for Tony Humphreys when the researcher he quoted in support of his theory is willing to condemn his article publicly.  \n \nWhere I focussed on the  inaccuracies of his article  and the  harm they will do to parents , especially of newly diagnosed children,  Siobhan O\u2019Neill wrote  about growing up with her autistic twin brother, demonstrating clearly how nonsensical Humphreys' notion that a parent can make their child autistic really is.  \n \nAnother post at  Three Mile Limit  took issue with factual errors in Humphreys article and offered to give him a name for his\u00a0 hypothesis, \" Refrigerator Cousin. \" \n \nMike Stanton examined more closely Humphreys' claim that the \"Myth of Autism\" book he referenced backs up his notions and found that not even this was true:\u00a0  \n \n Skip to page page 293 when the authors clearly state  \n We are NOT saying any of the following: 1. Autism is a condition caused by poor parenting. That is concurring with Humphreys attack on parents who possess few  or no heart qualities? It seems only right that ill-written books should  be ill-read. But, bad as it is, The Myth of Autism does not deserve to  be as badly read as it was by Tony Humphreys, if he read it at all. Bock the Robber writes  about Humphreys former role as a cleric: \n the denunciation of parents in the article of Tony Humphreys has a smell  of clericalism about it. \u00a0This article sounds a lot like the sort of  judgemental nonsense we heard from priests and bishops over many years. After listing the errors in the Examiner article he makes a valid point: \n \n If you're a scientist, present your research. \u00a0Publish your research  papers. \u00a0List the peer-reviewed publications you've produced. \nIf you're not a scientist, don't presume to talk about things you don't understand. If only we lived in a world where it worked like this. \n \n \nThe last post I have noticed is by  Magnumlady  who writes: \n We are  living in a world where it\u2019s hard to get by if you have a disability  (especially an unseen one) and are trying to get people to understand  about autism. It\u2019s not helped by articles like this. I quite agree. \n \nMany people have expressed their hurt and shock at the  Irish Autism Action Facebook  page where the article was transcribed.\u00a0  \n \nEventually The Irish Examiner made a response, of sorts. This afternoon they released the following on twitter:  \n \"We will be publishing a full range of reaction in tomorrow's edition relating to Tony Humphrey's column in Friday's Feelgood.\"  link \n \n \"While giving a platform to  diverse opinions is central to our journalism the views of TH on autism  should not be mistaken as our own.\"  link \n(The irony that a piece which made so many feel so rotten was published in a section entitled \"Feelgood\" is not lost on me.) \n \nI find it astonishing that the Irish Examiner feels this is an appropriate response. No one who has complained that the article is damaging and toxic believed that it was an editorial. It was not clearly marked as an opinion piece.\u00a0 Even if it was, it was irresponible and unethical to give a platform to such a piece, lacking as it did all veracity and which has caused real harm.  \n \nAlready I have witnessed the people who argue that there must be something to Humphreys' arguments- that there are too many children labelled, that diagnoses are made too quickly, that perhaps parents need to look at themselves- as if we don't! None of this is based on fact- but newspaper articles like this one make it harder for families to convince people that their children's disabilities are real and that they require adaptations and support.  \n\u00a0  \nThe Examiner have contacted some people who emailed them (not me) and asked permission to publish their letters. It appears they will be hosting a vox-pop, as though there is any doubt that Humphreys wrote an article entirely lacking merit. He was mistaken, the paper should apologise and retract the piece. \n \n\u00a0 Please let me know in the comments if there are any other posts I may not have noticed yet so I can add them to the list.

{"date": "7 Feb 2012", "body": "\nAfter all our letter writing, tweeting and blogging, the Irish Examiner today published their response. It is wholly inadequate. They have published an editorial basically saying that they were correct to publish the article because, they say, in a democratic society, everyone has the right to their opinion. It's nice of them to offer us all a civics lesson. I shall however, examine their editorial in detail.  \n \nThey published wonderful letters from parents and people critical of the article. There was also a letter from Waterford music therapist,  Jim Cosgrove in agreement with Humphreys . I wonder is he has any autistic children as clients. I wonder if he still will after today. \n \nThere is an  excellent article by Kevin Whelan , the  chief executive of Irish Autism Action, refuting the article and describing the reality of parents and families struggling and coping as best they can with unbounded love and determination. Lastly, Tony Humphreys is once again given a platform for his opinion in a piece entitled, \"Research is crucial to care debate.\" Research is, conjecture ain't. \n IN  ALL my work over the years in supporting families with their very real  difficulties it has been clear to me that parents always do their best;  it would be an act of neglect on my part to withhold information,  because information is a very important source of support.  It is now clear to him that  parents always do their best , a far cry from the defamatory statements he made on Friday about how parents seek help for their children only to avoid looking into their \"own  emotional and social struggles\" and that we \"often need more help than [our autistic children] do.\" \n \nBut what is this information he has such a duty to impart? \n \n My  intention in last Friday\u2019s article was to give people information that  has emerged in recent times in relation to troubling behaviours in  children that are commonly called autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). This ASD perspective has dominated and has been presented as fact. My   goal was to show there is another perspective on this and that what has   been presented as fact is not fact; it is simply a perspective. It is   very important we hold an open mind and keep ourselves informed.  Aw here, why are all of us who have autistic family members getting so stressed, he's only wanting to offer a new perspective. We may have struggled for years to have our concerns about our children taken seriously, and may have navigated the complex diagnostic system and sat with our children through many difficult multidisciplinary assessments before they received the diagnosis. But we shouldn't be so damned closed minded, we ought to listen to Dr Tony- there are no facts, there are only  perspectives ! Duh, it must be those broader autistic phenotyoes some of us have that limit us to black and white thinking. We probably believe in gravity and the germ theory of disease, dismissing all alternative perspectives! \nThis is preposterous, Tony Humphreys is rejecting reality. \n \n The seminal work in 2011 The Myth of Autism by Dr Sami Timimi,  consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, and his two colleagues  provides very important findings from rigorous research and scientific  enquiry. Incidentally, Dr Timimi and one of his co-authors had been  diagnosed with ASD when they were children. In the interest of  responding effectively and caringly to both children and their parents  and teachers, it is crucial this research-based information be taken  into account.  Oh it's a seminal work! Can I argue with that. Well, yes.\u00a0  \nThe authors he places so much faith in disagree with his assertions, saying \"We are NOT saying any of the following: 1. Autism is a condition caused by poor parenting.\" Moreover, real scientists refer to peer reviewed scientific publications from respected journals when citing research, not popular science books.  Mike Stanton has explained , the book was only \"a mixture of reviews of certain areas and detailed analysis of particular papers.\" \n \nHumphreys concludes; \n There are very important policy and care  decisions involved here. If we can stay open to different perspectives  and engage in mature debate, our chances of coming up with the best  solutions for what are very real difficulties in family and school  holding worlds increase enormously.  Basically, he has taken lots of words to say very little. Why should policy and care decisions be influenced in any way by the discredited model of autism Humphreys promotes? You may as well have astrologers running the judiciary. Nonsensical. \nWorse yet is the editorial from the Irish Examiner: \" The right to an opinion .\" \n They acknowledge that people were hurt and angered by the article, and mention the criticism they faced then go on to make much of Tony Humphreys credentials as an expert:  Dr Humphreys is a highly experienced and well-regarded clinical psychologist, successful author, and broadcaster.  They mention their \"record of campaigning for the rights and services for people with an intellectual disability\" and finish: \n While we regret and are sorry for the obvious hurt caused by Dr  Humphreys\u2019 comments, we stand by his right to freedom of expression in a  democratic society, just as we would support the rights of others to  disagree with and criticise his views and criticise us for having  published them. So basically, we're sorry you lot took offence and complained because we were only doing our democratic duty to give this dude a platform to express his views. \n \nWhat I'd like to know is, given that they have mentioned his expert status, and that his article was published in a health supplement, why are they now portraying it as just one man's opinion? \nSo which was it, expert reportage or opinion?  \nThe piece was ridden with errors, not one bit of it stands up to any kind of scrutiny. Even the Cambridge researcher mentioned by name has called the piece \"offensive\" and said it \"turns the clock back 50 years\". Tony Humphreys does not have the right to create a loads of \"facts\" that are harmful to so many people. Clearly despite the credentials the Irish Examiner is so in awe of, Humphreys is no expert on autism. In fact if that is the level of journalistic standards they adhere to, why don't they get me to write farming reports, or as my friend Lisa suggested, David Irving on foreign policy. \n \nIf it is just opinion, and the Examiner feels it is their democratic duty to publish any opinion no matter how factually incorrect, toxic, damaging and hurtful, can I expect to see a parade of bigots getting their chance to have their views aired in a major newspaper? Because after all, we have the right to disagree and criticise them for publishing.  \n \nThis editorial has made a bad situation worse. This is not over. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://t.co/HUvkmv7h", "http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/we-dont-need-to-defrost-an-assumption-over-70-years-old-182912.html#.TzDr4sVn8Ls.twitter", "http://penumbrage.com/2012/02/05/the-myth-of-autism-part-3/", "http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/editorial/autism-controversy--the-right-to-an-opinion-182909.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/irish-examiner-responds-to-autism.html", "title": "\nIrish Examiner Responds to \"Autism Controvery\"\n"},
{"date": "5 Feb 2012", "body": "\nI was asked- why bother asking for a retraction and an apology for the  vile Irish Examiner article  by Tony Humphreys. I agree that any apology the disgraced psychologist gives would most likely be insincere. I still think it is important to contact the newspaper that opted to actually publish his outrageous and damaging piece. I want to draw attention to what this man has said, to explain clearly all the things he got wrong in his article. That his words were published in a newspaper will give them a veneer of truth and respectability to many people. \n \nI have been in touch with a few people whose children have only recently been diagnosed with autism and who were particularly upset by the article. In those early days you are dealing with so much; coming to terms with changed expectations, the knowledge that your child faces difficulties typically developing children don't, learning about disability and your child's rights and how to navigate the complex worlds of benefits and special education. Currently it is harder than ever as cuts and reduced services make everything such a battle and people are struggling to adapt and survive. These parents have not yet developed a thick skin like those of us well accustomed to the charlatans who use autism to advance their agendas. The quacks have no regard for how they will affect people living with autism or those who love them. It can come as a shock at first when you read about how awful your life is, how damaged your children, how they are to blame for all your problems- or, with retrogrades like Tony Humphreys, how you are to blame for all their problems.  \n \nThis article was so bad though it even hurt many of us hardened old-timers. It hurt to hear a so-called professional get it so very wrong about our families, to slander us by claiming that instead of doing our best for our child/children with a neurological condition causing developmental delay, we caused it. And we caused it by failing at the one thing that matters most to us- our parenting. He tells the world that we are cold and unloving, that we seek help for our children to avoid our own issues. \nWhat tosh. \n \nNow having a disabled child certainly doesn't make anyone a perfect parent. I've witnessed some bad behaviour from the parents of autistic children in my time among the online autism communities. But we're just like any other set of people, we're fallible, some good some bad and most trying our best to be good enough.  \n \nBy issuing an apology, The Irish Examiner could go some way towards making ammends to all the people they have hurt. \n \nI wrote the following to the editor:  \n \n I wish to respond to the article \"Core Connection\" by Tony Humphreys and published on 3 February 2012.  \n \nThis  article author propagates damaging and discredited ideas of autism  causation. It is accepted by all professionals of repute that autism is a  neurological condition associated with developmental delay. It is not,  despite what Tony Humphreys professes without evidence, the result of  children \"defending themselves against the absence of expressed love and  affection and emotional receptivity.\" Blaming parents causes pain to  people already struggling to raise their children in a time of cut-backs  and reduced services. Parents of newly diagnosed children will be especially vulnerable to these outrageous and contemptuous accusations  against them.  \n \nTony Humphreys even goes so far as to assert that the very existence  of autism is not a scientific fact, an utterly ridiculous assertion. He  is no brave maverick going against the tide of received wisdom, he is a  mere crank. The author is either courting controversy to sell books and  gain more media exposure and is using your paper to promote himself, or  he is setting himself up in a new career as a provocateur columnist.  Either way, he and your paper, are trampling all over the families of  autistic children.  \n \nI shall expect you to publish an apology and a full retraction of  this article, and to give space to a proper autism professional to  explain just how wrong Tony Humphreys was. I shall also expect to see the parents of autistic people given space to explain just how loving and  close their families are. I have also contacted Professor Baron-Cohen to alert him to how his work has been twisted to fit Humphrey's notions. \n \nI now think that Humphreys is hoping to not just promote himself and his book at the expense of autistic children, he is hoping to gain customers seeking to redress their failures as parents and fix their children. The biomedical quackery industry have seen parents willing to subject their children to all sorts of unproven and dangerous \"therapies\" when told it would lead to a cure. The psychoanalysts want some of that action. In order to sell their services, they have to convince enough parents that the cause of their children's autism is known and fixable. \n \nWhat I fear now is seeing Tony Humphreys making a tour of TV and radio stations, promoting himself, his book and his ability to cure the children currently \"misdiagnosed\" as autistic. I hope the media will do the right thing and refrain from giving this man further publicity.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/autism-ordure-in-irish-examiner-why.html", "title": "\nAutism Ordure in Irish Examiner- Why Worry?\n"},

{"date": "2 Jul 2011", "body": "\nI'm copying the recent article here as I don't expect it will stay on the newspaper's website for long.  Sharon Fennell and her son Ryan on a flight to Orlando last year Published on Thursday 30 June 2011 09:12 A local mum and member of the National Autistic Society Northern Ireland wants to help other parents/carers of autistic children get the most out of the school holidays and increase people\u2019s understanding of autism. HELEN MCGURK finds out more SCHOOL summer holidays can present a real challenge for parents of children with autism in Northern Ireland. People with autism often encounter significant barriers in communication, social situations and making sense of the world around them. Co Down mum Sharon Fennell whose 11-year-old son Ryan has autism explained: \u201cThe schools here close for two months in the summer. While we can use this time to meet new people, and enjoy new experiences, many children with autism rely heavily on a routine and the change can be disorientating. Some children and young people find coping without their normal routine frightening and upsetting and for many, the sensory overload can sometimes be tough for a child with autism. \u201cParents of a child with autism want them to have a fantastic summer but when days don\u2019t go so well you can feel isolated and even a bit of a failure. I\u2019d like parents of a child with autism to know that there are at least 35,000 mums and dads in Northern Ireland who have similar experiences and great advice to share. Many of them are members of the local Northern Ireland branches of the NAS.\u201d Sharon has a request for people who may not be aware of the condition. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re out and about in the holidays and your child is confronted with the unexpected or when they are overloaded with sensory information, they can panic and react in quite a dramatic way. It can be difficult when it happens in a public place. Autism isn\u2019t readily visible, so to an outside observer it can look like your child is just being naughty when they are actually struggling hard to understand what\u2019s going on around them. \u201cSome people stop and stare and even make thoughtless comments while you are busy and doing your best to support and calm your child. Their disapproval only adds to what can be an already difficult situation. When we\u2019re sharing public spaces it would be lovely for people to understand that people of all kinds have a right to exist and be out and about.\u2019\u2019 Sharon added: \u201cIf more people understood and knew about autism, they would recognise what is really going on when my child is struggling, they would see that he is not merely \u201cbold\u201d and appreciate that he and I are doing our absolute best in tricky circumstances. That would so much more helpful than judging me or my son. It would be lovely if people could show a little more kindness, smile, and maybe even ask, \u201cis there anything I can do to help?\u201d That would be truly heroic!\u201d Sharon has some simple advice that can help families get the most out of the summer break. \u201cMy top tip is to create some type of structure for the holidays. \u201cIt helps my son to have an idea of what to expect each day. We write all our big events like holidays, birthdays, summer scheme days and when school starts back on the family calendar and he likes to look ahead and get an overall picture of what will be happening. His father lives in a different house and it helps him to know in advance when we will be staying there so all this information is marked on the calendar so he can access it. \u201cEach evening, we talk about what will happen the next day. When he was younger and had less verbal ability, I would draw pictures describing the day ahead in comic strip form. I\u2019d sometimes also use picture cards and photos attached to a board with velcro or blue tac. As he got older I was able to write a list of the day\u2019s tasks and events. It still helps him to have this list to focus on.\u2019\u2019 Sharon said when going places it pays to prepare and plan ahead as much as possible. \u2018\u2018It helps to make sure I will be able to get my son food he enjoys or to bring some with me. I like to know possible problematic areas; when he was younger it was difficult to go anywhere that sold pic\u2019n\u2019mix sweets and he thought those plastic jars and scoops were an open invitation to small sticky hands and keeping him away was difficult. \u201cSome places allow carers to enter free when accompanying a disabled person; it\u2019s always worth asking what discounts are available. When we go somewhere busy like a theme park, I tend to dress Ryan in a distinctive top that I would recognise from afar. I made a few t-shirts with slogans that inform people of his autism in a positive and funny way, or he may wear a lanyard around his neck with his NAS membership card on one side and my phone number and a slogan like \u201cawesome autistic dude!\u201d on the other. These help people to recognise that this child has a disability and I find the vast majority of people are more considerate and sensitive when they are aware.\u2019\u2019 Shirelle Stewart, co-director of National Autistic Society Northern Ireland said: \u201cChildren with autism want to have friends, go on outings and have fun in the summer holidays, just like any other child. Acceptance and understanding from the public can make holiday times less stressful for children with autism and their families and help them get the most out of their summer break.\u201d The National Autistic Society Northern Ireland provides a wide range of advice, information, support and specialist services to people with autism and their families.

{"date": "4 Feb 2012", "body": "\nI've been justifiably angry often lately. First there is the Welfare Reform Bill that will  cause real harm to disabled people  and those already poor and vulnerable. Much of the media and many politicians have been busy spinning the truth about people's lives and impairments to portray people who require support as scroungers and layabouts, out to milk the system. Then there was the  quack clinic, purporting to prevent and cure autism in infants  showing \"pre-autistic traits\" and which received uncritical publicity in the media because celebrity Melanie Sykes gives it support.  \n \nBut with this my ire boils over and if I don't blog a bit to release the pressure, I fear I may blow. \nA man called Tony Humphreys has written an article available in the print edition of The Irish Examiner on February 3 2012. The article has been  reproduced in full here . Humphreys  describes himself  as  \"Ireland\u2019s most influential psychologist\" and he runs courses at University College Cork and All Hallows College, Dublin. To read his article however, you would be forgiven for thinking he has absolutely zero knowledge or experience of autism. It ranks as one of the worst and most detestable diatribes relating to autism I have had the misfortune to read and given that I have been examining the world of autism quackery and myth for 10 years, that's really something special.  \n \nHe starts by referring to the work of\u00a0 Professor Simon  Baron-Cohen and the Cambridge  Autism Research Centre  saying that \"the children and  grandchildren of engineers were more likely to be autistic.\" But then Humphreys expresses  shock   that these researchers are \" assuming that autism is a scientific fact \". \nYes really, we can stop right here and know that Ireland's most  self-regarding  \"influential\" psychologist has the gall to call into question that  the very existence of autism . The latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is currently being produced. Perhaps Humphreys should contact them and inform them to leave autism out since he clearly knows something all the other professionals don't.  \n \nThough he has already shown himself to be ignorant of autism science, I shall soldier on because Humphreys decides now to slander all parents of autistic children but also all engineers and scientists by claiming that as we all \"live  predominanently in [our] heads and possess few or no heart qualities, [our] children will need to find some way of defending themselves  against the absence of expressed love and affection and emotional  receptivity\". \n \nOuch. \n \nThe Irish Examiner has thought it right to publish an article in which the author denies the existence of autism  and  claims that the children currently diagnosed as such are merely reacting to their cold and loveless upbringings. \n \nHe continues: \n After all, the deepest need of every child is  to be unconditionally loved and the absence of it results in children  shutting down emotionally themselves because to continue to  spontaneously reach out for love would be far too painful. \n \nChildren's  wellbeing mostly depends on emotional security - a daily diet of  nurture, love, affection, patience, warmth, tenderness, kindness and  calm responses to their expressed welfare and emergency feelings. To say  that these children have a genetic and/or neurobiological disorder  called autism or ASD (autistic spectrum disorder) only adds further to  their misery and condemns them to a relationship history where their  every thought and action is interpreted as arising from their autism. This is a rehash of the comprehensibly discredited \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis of autism. The truth is that autism is  lifelong developmental disability that affects how a  person communicates with, and relates to, other people.\u00a0 \n \n Humphreys next asserts that parents seek help for their autistic children to avoid examining their  \"own  emotional and social struggles. \n... \nit is  their adult carers who often need more help than they do.\" \n \nHumphreys further exposes his ignorance by distinguishing incorrectly between \"the autism described by psychiatrist Leo Kanner in 1943 and  the much more recently described ASD (autistic spectrum disorder, often  referred to as Asperger's syndrome).\" \n \n \nThese two are the same thing. He next spins the gender differences in autism diagnoses to fit his notion of autism as caused by cold, unloving parents.  \n \n Mike Stanton blogged  about the Sami Timimi book Humphreys refers to next. Read Mike's post for a thorough assessment of Timmini's assertion that the autism \"label should  be abolished\". \n \nHumphreys concludes:\u00a0  \n \n The authors are not saying that the  children are not emotionally and socially troubled. What they are saying  is - and I concur with them - that focus needs to be on the  relationship contexts of these children's livews, and to take each child  for the individual he or she is and to examine closely the family and  community narratives and discover creative possibilities for change and  for more dynamic and hopeful stories to emerge for both the children and  their carers.  Dr Tony Humphreys is a consultant  clinical psychologist, author and national and international speaker.  His book 'All About Children\" is relevant to todays article.\u00a0 Humpreys decries the autism industry, though he clearly wants a bit of that action for himself. He has a book out that is \"relevant to today's article\" and it sounds like he reckons we need people like him to examine our narratives. Nought like a spot of old fashioned psychoanalysis to sort out our selfish ways, eh Tony?  \n \nOr perhaps Tony Humphreys is just looking for a spot of provacateur columnist work like Kevin Myers, Rod Liddle, Jan Moir and Liz Jones. Either way both he and the Irish Examiner should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. I shall expect a retraction and an apology.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://wheresthebenefit.blogspot.com/", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2012/02/ipan-preautistic-children.html", "http://www.facebook.com/notes/irish-autism-action/core-connection-an-article-in-printed-edition-of-irish-examiner-3rd-feb/359928427353789", "http://www.tonyhumphreys.ie/", "http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/", "http://penumbrage.com/2012/01/03/the-myth-of-autism-part-2/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2012/02/irish-exainer-and-tony-humphreys-newold.html", "title": "\nIrish Examiner and Tony Humphreys- A New/Old Theory of Autism\n"},
{"date": "31 Mar 2011", "body": "\nHi Johnny, old friend. You've been leading those poor gullible journalists a merry dance, haven't you, you old rogue?! Perhaps you never expected them to be so lazy that they wouldn't check what you claimed and learn for themselves that it was much ado about nothing? But what can we say, they're probably humanities graduates, can't be doing with all that old  evidence  nonsense eh! How did you come to find my blog post anyway? A Google search of your name didn't link here in the 1st 4 pages and I gave up after that, you must have gone deep to get to  that post ! I admire your stamina. But somehow, you came upon my (as it was) retired blog. It would be obvious to anyone that it's hardy influential; presidents and popes don't hang on my every word. Well you dug deeper than any journalist and found it. But if your quotes to journalists or the content of your own blog on what it contained are anything to go by, you didn't  read  the post. If this was an English comprehension test, you'd have failed. See, on the post, a  commentor  wrote that you are \"not a man who should go anywhere near children  with [your] ideas. [You are] not a man of reason and evidence but a ranting old  lunatic.\" Now I don't fully agree with that, but a I tolerate a certain amount of dissenting opinion on my blog. The person who wrote it is entitled to think that if s/he wishes and it wasn't so extreme an opinion that I was unwilling to host it on my space. That person thinks your ideas on climate are so unscientific and extreme that you should not be given a platform to express them to children. I dislike the disablism of the \"lunatic\" slur. It's inaccurate and unfortunate but that's anonymous commentors for you. No doubt it bugged you to be described as such. Perhaps you were offended at my characterisation of you as a \"silly old duffer\" and \"cranky in [your] old age\"? You've been in the public eye for decades, I'm sure you know celebrities and those in the public eye are subject to criticism. It's not all fawning admiration all the time. But unlike me, you have the ear of the mass media and you jolly well milked it. On Feb9 2011 you wrote on your  blog : on a Northern Ireland Blog, The Family Voyage, which  prides itself on winning some Blog Award,  flagged JohnnyBall and  featured the statement, \u201cJohnny Ball should not be allowed near  children.\u201d Being near to children has been my career for over 50 years.  As yet I cannot contact them, as their site is only open to known  members?? (Their flagged Johnny Ball link has now miraculously  disappeared)        Their beef is that I dared suggest in 2009 on NI  Radio that Sammy Wilson as Energy Minister was right when he refused to  air \u201cCarbon Trust\u201d TV commercials, one of which showed a very young  child being told a story of a drowning world through climate change.  Following complaints to the Advertising Authorities, these ads were  found \u201cguilty of exaggeration and alarmism over climate change\u201d and were  ordered to be dropped. So that would indicate that I was totally  justified in condemning them?          Anyone who knows me and my career, must know that I have never done anything that in any way would harm a single child.         I defy anyone to find anything that I have done in my career that, were it publicly known, would harm my reputation. You lied about the content on my blog and you lied saying the link had disappeared. You went on to lie to the newspapers; the TES, the Daily Mail, the Guardian, the Daily Express, the Daily Telegraph- all quoted you making similar slurs about the blogger who supposedly implied that you're a paedophile. You mislead these poor precious journalists into thinking it was part of a blogger campaign against you, carried out by some climate change lobby. You lied also when you implied that my post was removed after a police investigation. I was never contacted by the police and the post was never removed. So Johnny, are you going to go public again and make this right? Or stick to the lies?

Then he said a single word, \"autism.\" I said nothing, just waited. He said it again. I said, \"yes, autism...What is autism?\" His response; \"charming and delightful.\" I've often mentioned in passing when talking with him, that he is autistic, is a boy with autism. It's another facet of him like his curly hair, blue eyes and love of animated films. I've also told him over and over how wonderful he is, how he's perfect to me, funny, sweet, and yes delightful. I can't remember ever calling him charming but he just worked that out for himself. I love how he is thinking about these parts of his identity- where he lives, who his family and friends are, where he belongs, and now also- he's figuring out that there's autism in there too. And he's embracing it. I'm proud of him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2011/03/identity.html", "title": "\nIdentity\n"},
{"date": "24 Mar 2011", "body": "\nSo how about a charming anecdote? Today, Duncan's school held a sod cutting ceremony to mark the start of the new school building project. This is a really big deal- the building was approved 9 whole years ago but finalising funding was held up time and again. The current school buildings are totally inadequate- most classes are in flimsy, temporary buildings and the whole site is on a steep hill- and since many of the pupils are wheelchair users, that's just not good enough. So everyone in the school is really pleased that finally, the school the students need and deserve is to be built. Duncan and I were invited to join the staff, other parents and pupils and some invited special guests for the event. Duncan ate a few sweets and was happy to see some of his friends and teachers, but then got a bit overwhelmed by the crowds in his hall and was bored waiting. He entertained himself for a while looking at photo displayed- even pointing out a girl whom he says is his girlfriend and will be his wife. I wonder what her opinion on all this is?! He then entertained himself taking photos using my phone- stick a bit of technology in that boy's hands and he happy. He showed me a picture he'd painted depicting his version of what the new school should contain. He reckons there should be an oboe room (he's big into oboes atm), a \"sweety\" room, a pool (hot and with bubbles) a studio (where he could make animated films) and a cinema (in which to screen them). Eventually I took him out and we waited in the car. The people all moved on to the building site. Not knowing what parking would be like and since it was a lovely day, Duncan and I walked- rather he ran \"Gru style\" (Despicable Me) and I just about managed to keep up. In the site, pupils and teachers gathered for photos with the mayor and other dignitaries. Not Duncan- how could he when there was a huge and fascinating green digger to look at. He ran about the field for a bit and I dashed after him. Then he was given a blue balloon which after a while he let go of accidentally- and was momentarily crushed when it rose into the clear sky. He looked at me, seriously scared and asked \"the world will not end?\" I assured him the world would not end, and he decided that the balloon would either turn into a fairy or go to the fairies. When I heard there was to be a mass release of the remaining balloons I thought it was best to just go home. So it was nice but knackering- as time out and about with Duncan so often is. What I enjoyed most was the obvious affection with which he was greeted by so many staff and other pupils and how he clearly adores them in return. There's a lot of heart in that place.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tc5HwgqC2E4/TYuahMYLseI/AAAAAAAABAQ/AK94q-CPGcc/s1600/2011-03-24%2B14.58.56.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wYHNrudhw_w/TYua2vz8e-I/AAAAAAAABAY/_wL4QTVnaOM/s1600/2011-03-24%2B15.38.40.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2011/03/celebrate-new-school.html", "title": "\nCelebrate the New School\n"},
{"date": "22 Mar 2011", "body": "\nI thought I might get back into blogging some time but didn't know it would happen like this. I wrote this small scale blog for a few years before taking a long break. In that time I deleted most of my sidebar, especially links to other blogs I am no longer regularly reading, leaving static links like a 3 year old blog awards badge and the link to sense about science's libel campaign. A working email address was still displayed on my Blogger profile, but I rarely checked it. All new comments go to my main email so I see those right away. Oh and I haven't checked my stats for at least a year- why bother?! Recently I checked that little used email address and had a message alerting me to a  Science Blogs post  on  Deltoid , a blog by Tim Lambert. This was the first notice I had that Johnny Ball was going around telling credulous journalists that a nasty blogger was mounting a campaign against him. In an interview with the TES he complains that: his bookings have dropped by 90 per cent over the past year and  the 72-year-old has blamed this on harassment by extreme  environmentalists who object to his dismissal of climate change as  \u201calarmist nonsense\u201d. He continued to complain about some blogger saying he \u201cshould not be  allowed near children\u201d. He then claimed: This was clearly a criminal act aimed directly to damage me and my  career business,\u201d he said. \u201cSince notifying the police of these acts  aimed at damaging my name and reputation, the offensive web links have  quite amazingly disappeared. So who is this mysterious blogger who removed one of the \"offensive\" links after he complained to the police- it's all revealed on his own (horrible looking, badly formatted)  blog .  He writes [scroll down to the terrifying sounding headline: \"VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT. Wednesday 9/2/2011\"] My thoughts are in red: It is with horror and disgust that I find that I am the victim of some kind of Internet Smear Campaign. Oh really? Tell us more.         I have had to complain to the police and my problem is now logged as a harrassment (sic) case and is being investigated.  Wow, sounds serious. Someone better look out or the fuzz'll be onto their bad self.         This morning, an early phone call asked if the  voice mail saying I could not attend a Teacher Training event on 1st  March was true. Luckily the recipient knew that I make all my own  telephone calls. We have the recording which we will hand to the police.  The event was posted on my News and Apperances (sic) listing.  How awful, Johnny is loosing bookings over all this! Just who could have so much power in the life of the famous man?   Anyone Googling \u201cJOHNNYBALL\u201d (without the gap) may have  found a sponsored direct link to \u201cJohnny Ball/Paul Raymond\u201d which when  clicked on immediately opens up on a collection of explicit nude  pictures of females. I had obviously opened this link and contacted the  Paul Raymond organisation. Before they could act, the link had been  removed, - 9/2/11 - so it is clear that I am being monitored.  Someone please explain the internet to Johnny- meta tags, other people in the world sharing his name- there are many non-conspiracy reasons why this could have happened.    Also on a Northern Ireland Blog, The Family Voyage,   you tell 'em Johnny...wait a minute, that's me! WTF?  which prides itself on winning some Blog Award ( yay! big up my blog award...oh, he's being snarky, I'm hurt now)    flagged JohnnyBall and  featured the statement, \u201cJohnny Ball should not be allowed near  children.\u201d  This is a lie- neither the blog post nor the comments contained that statement.  Being near to children has been my career for over 50 years.  As yet I cannot contact them, as their site is only open to known  members?? (Their flagged Johnny Ball link has now miraculously  disappeared)  It's easy to contact me. Also, the post has not and never had disappeared- no idea why he claims this.         Their beef is that I dared suggest in 2009 on NI  Radio that Sammy Wilson as Energy Minister was right when he refused to  air \u201cCarbon Trust\u201d TV commercials, one of which showed a very young  child being told a story of a drowning world through climate change.

I so enjoy working  to kids and making them laugh, before I add material that should  hopefully give them confidence in their own abailities (sic) and their future  as adults. Whatever is wrong with our society I see nothing wrong with  the vast majority of the kids I aim to inspire.          Johnny Ball - Wednesday 9/2/2011 - updated 14/2/11 Note the lack of links in this piece- perhaps he doesn't know how to hyperlink? So far, so daft. But this sparked off a furor among mainstream journalists and climate change \"skeptics\" all outraged at the evil \"climate change zealot\" who defamed their Johnny.  The Telegraph:  Johnny Ball 'abused by environmentalists' over climate change denial  by Graeme Paton In an interview, he told how websites had been set up in his name featuring    pornographic images and a blogger wrote that he should \u201cnot be allowed near    children\u201d. The Daily Mail:  Climate zealots made my life hell for being a sceptic says Johnny Ball, who was victim of porn and blog smears  by  Kate Loveys Yesterday he revealed he has become the victim of a vicious hate campaign by environmentalist \u2018zealots\u2019.Mr  Ball \u2013 father of Radio Two DJ Zoe Ball \u2013 popularised maths and science  for millions of youngsters in the 1970s and 1980s with his eccentric TV  shows. More recently he has carved out a career giving talks in schools and at science festivals and teachers\u2019 conferences. This will make the right-on brigade hot and bothered But he says zealots are trying to sabotage his career because he has described climate change as \u2018alarmist nonsense\u2019. He claims the internet has been used to try to discredit his opinions. Bloggers have run campaigns stating Mr Ball \u2018should not be allowed near children\u2019.  Notice that my one lowly blog has metamorphosised into a whole host of campaigning zealot  blogger s  out to get poor Johnny. Wow. Via the Deltoid post, I hear of a bloke writing in something called the Herald Sun who got really hot and bothered about all this:  \u201cPedophile!\u201d, the warmists argued \"It\u2019s that totalitarian mindset outing itself again. The savagery and intolerance are unmistakable giveaways.\" Writing on the Guardian Environment Blog, Leo Hickman wrote:  Let's join Johnny Ball in condemning extremists in the climate debate Ball says he was forced to call the police last week after a website featuring a pornographic image was posted online bearing his name. In a separate incident, he says a blogger stated that \"he should not be allowed near children\". He says that both sites have since been taken down and South Thames police says it is investigating his complaints.  No links to the blog in question on any of these so readers can assess the claims for themselves. Nor does it look like any of these esteemed journalists spent the 2 minutes or so it would have taken them to find the post Ball referred to and realise he was spouting bollox! I am only grateful that my name was not mentioned on any of articles as the climate change deniers are a scary bunch and I wouldn't want to have to deal with their attacks. You might think given all the references to the police taking action against the perpetrators of these dastardly crimes, they might have been in touch, but no. The PSNI have not bashed my door down in a quest for justice. My blog has sat there utterly unchanged, uncontested and mostly unread for ages. If you want to read the post in question, it's this:  Johnny Ball, what happened to you? In the comments, one person  wrote :  I just went on Johnny Ball's site to send him an email asking him not to  damage himself in this way. I then read his blog and it's all come  clear. He's a religious nut. Should of been clear before. That's why he  tied scientists to eugenics. Something religious people do. Suggesting  that science caused the holocaust. Heard it before, again and again from  these people.  Johnny is not a man who should go anywhere near children  with his ideas.  He is not a man of reason and evidence but a ranting old  lunatic. Guess the reason he disappeared from our screens is a mystery  no more. Sad. Note the quote in red. It is very different from what Ball claims I wrote. At least Leo Hickman posted an update when commentors on his initial article on the matter posted a bit more information; things that he should have investigated himself. Johnny Ball denies 'climate zealots are ruining my career' claims For example, one of Ball's central claims was that a blogger had stated  that he \"should not be allowed near children\". The word \"paedophile\" was  not used, but the implication was clear. But soon the  original blog posting   was isolated and it turned out that the full statement used \u2013 by a  reader on a blog run by a woman with an autistic son \u2013 was that Ball, as  a climate sceptic, \"should [not] go anywhere near children with his  ideas\". A very different message. Speculation mounted in the comments  beneath my article \u2013 and  elsewhere  \u2013 that Ball was wrongly maligning and blaming environmentalists with this pointedly edited sentence. Well quite! But in this article Hickman quotes a conversation he had with Ball, asking for clarification. Ball just isn't ready to let go of his rancour with me: The other [link which was removed] appeared on a Northern Ireland blog that prided itself  in winning a blog award.  Sheesh Johnny, enough praise for my blog award already! It was years ago!  Googled items usually have two lines of  introductory text. This one said, 'Johnny Ball should not be allowed  near children.' This appeared on the listing and was very alarming.  More lies. Their  issue was in my support on BBC Radio Northern Ireland of Sammy Wilson  as Energy Minister who had said he would not allow a Carbon Trust  commercial which showed a child of around 5 being read a bedtime story  in which the world was drowning. On that show, I lost my temper as two  other NI MPs were banging on about who had the largest carbon footprint  over the mileage they each did in a week. After many complaints,  the Advertising Standards Authority declared the ads alarmist, or  whatever - the point is they did feel they might be damaging and  worrying for children and they were withdrawn \u2013 so, whatever the beef  was, my stance was in line with the authorities and so I was justified.  But for whatever reason, for that blog to make such derogatory  statements about me, was totally out of order. The two blogs disappeared  a few days later.  The most derogatory statement I made about him was to call him a silly old duffer- a comment I stand by. Also, once again- the post never has disappeared! Wow- boggles! So there you go, my reintroduction to blogging- not with a charming anecdote about my beautiful son, but in order to defend myself against ridiculous and frankly defamatory statements about me which were (though thankfully without including my name) propagated by the mainstream media. These articles gave rise to over 1000 comments, many of which were directed against the evil blogger attacking dear sweet Johnny. Frankly I'm amazed. And rather pissed off.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2011/02/was_johnny_ball_really_victimi.php", "http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid", "http://www.johnnyball.co.uk/html/johnnysblog.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8330836/Johnny-Ball-abused-by-environmentalists-over-climate-change-denial.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1358139/Climate-zealots-life-hell-sceptic-says-Johnny-Ball-victim-porn-blog-smears.html#ixzz1HL9gUDgC", "http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/pedophile_the_warmists_argued/", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/feb/18/johnny-ball-climate-change-attack", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/feb/21/johnny-ball-climate-smear-challenged", "http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2011/02/was_johnny_ball_really_victimi.php"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2011/03/obscure-blogger-vilifies-johnny-ball-no.html", "title": "\nObscure Blogger Vilifies Johnny Ball?

{"date": "11 Oct 2010", "body": "\nThis post might be a one off. Time will tell. Each of the children are now attending school full time. Lady (now 12) started secondary school in September. It is going well for her. She had been concerned that she would find the work too difficult and didn't fully believe my assertions that she would cope well with everything expected of her. She lacked confidence in her abilities and thought my judgement of her worth wasn't objective enough to trust. She now knows  for herself  that she is smart, a good learner, flexible, social and far more organised that even I thought she'd be and this has boosted her self esteem. There are aspects of school life that she dislikes and many that exasperate me but the current system means that if you chose the school option, you get these things along with it. Lady is happy and the advantages for her and all of us outweigh the disadvantages so to school she goes. Thomas (now 8) is in the same primary school he started just after Easter. He is happy too. He is so dedicated and conscientious, he works hard and still loves PE best. Like Lady he had made new friends. His school is across the road from a country train station just one stop away from the station 10 minutes walk from our house so he takes the train to and from school on his own every day. He enjoys the feeling of independence and personal responsibility. Both of them are still in the gymnastics squad. Thomas left the men's artistic team and like Lady he now does acro gymnastics and tumbling. Lady is also in the cheerleading team and competes in an all-Ireland competition later this month. They are thriving. Duncan (10) is also at school- one for children with severe learning disabilities so he gets the right level of adult support. I could not be more pleased with the school, his teacher and the other classroom staff. Duncan adores it and talks about it all the time. He tells me about his friends in the class and what they do each day. He is having a total blast. Today he will have gone horse riding for the 2nd time. The report back in his home-school diary last week was that he is a natural and loved the whole experience. He thinks he's Cowboy Woody so here's hoping he doesn't try to gallop off!  Not just yet anyway. Every Friday they go swimming. They have had a magician and the Ulster Orchestra to perform for them. They've been on outings to the airport, to sheepdog trials, to the wetland centre and aquarium. Duncan loves going places. I was prompted to write today to record the meeting myself and his dad had this morning with Duncan's teacher about his individual education plan. His teacher is obviously a perceptive person as she is utterly enchanted by Duncan. She realises he is very capable academically and is keen to encourage and enable him to be the best he can be. She thinks his little animations are so clever-she says that she is convinced that one day he'll be famous! - and that he is such a loving, happy and kind boy. She talked about all the ways they are helping him to progress in his self control, communication and understanding. It was a most positive and helpful meeting. I only just realised that neither of us mentioned the word autism once- we didn't need to. We both know that Duncan's autism is just part of all the amazing, astonishing, at times infuriating and always awesome way that he is so we only needed to talk about him and his environment and how to reduce the barriers he faces to be well. Here's his latest video. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/10/blog-resurrection.html", "title": "\nBlog Update\n"},

Now really, how long would it take to read the blog Ball talked about, search it to find the post in question, and check that he hadn't been making it up as he went along. In Hickman's 2nd Guardian article he wrote: Personally, I don't really want to get drawn into the nitty-gritty of  how Google works, the intentions of those who build porn sites, or  whether certain blogs have been deleted or not. I asked Ball to respond  on these points and he did so. Why not? Hickman gave credence and lots of publicity to Ball's claims regarding these very issues. He is a respected Guardian journalist and author on environmental issues, and not some seedy hack bent on muck raking. His contribution to the propagation of these claims is substantial. I do appreciate that he made a link available in his update article, and explained the nature of this personal blog- it's hardly capable of changing a celebrity's career. However I didn't notice an apology anywhere there for the initial oversight; just saying he took other's words in good faith and checking up is too taxing, sounds all wrong to me.  The whole point of his 1st article was to condemn the claimed mistreatment of Ball.  And Ball still was given a platform to repeat his lies about my blog, repeating his claim that the line \"Johnny Ball should not be allowed near children\" comes up on Google links and that the post was removed- all untrue.\n \n ", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "26 May 2010", "body": "\nI just listened to an interview on Radio Ulster with Nelson McCausland, the minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL). The minister has  written to the trustees of National Museums Northern Ireland  saying he believed they and his department both \"share a common desire to ensure that museums are reflective of  the views, beliefs and cultural traditions that make up society in  Northern Ireland.\" On today's radio interview he spoke with Richard Dawkins who phoned up to predictably assert that creationism is bunkum and doesn't belong in the museum, and while I agree with his first point I'm not so sure about his second. The Ulster Museum is a great place to visit and there's loads to see and learn from, especially their exhibits on natural history, art and local history. I think a temporary exhibit on the ideas held by the people of this region would be an interesting addition provided all the main displays continue to reflect the facts of evolution and what we have been able to discover about how the earth and universe were formed via the scientific method. A display on the mythology of the people might be fun, if not absolutely hilarious. It could reflect research on just what beliefs on our origins are actually held here, where they have come from, how many people hold them, how these ideas have themselves evolved and why. Then have the notions of creationism/intelligent design clearly laid out for all to see. Since the minister is keen to uphold the human rights of the people he represents by having their beliefs and opinions displayed, then go ahead. Alongside the views of the \" Cdesign Proponentsists \" the human rights of the 70% or so of people here who do not believe in this theory must also be protected, so have a display on all the  proofs for evolution  and refuting all the claims of creationism/intelligent design. \" The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It  may be counter intuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It  may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our  preferences do not determine what's true. \"  Carl Sagan .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/10159667.stm", "http://ncse.com/creationism/legal/cdesign-proponentsists", "http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/home.php", "http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/saganws.htm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/05/yes-to-creationism-in-ulster-museum.html", "title": "\nCreationism in the Ulster Museum?\n"},

I didn't win the best blog post award, but had zero (well not zero since that would be mathematically illogical since I was nominated) expectation of getting in and the winning post (and winning blogger) was a stunner. Best part of the experience as ever was spending time with a load of intriguing, articulate, provocative and funny people. Myself a selection of other lovely ladies meet in the presidential suite of the well posh g hotel for the Ladies Tea Party, organised by the force of nature that is Sabrina Dent. We had lovely pink wine and delicate snacks and there was nail painting and nail polish remover and it was all fabulous. The women I met with, some I knew already but most of them I hadn't, were without exception amazing, friendly and warm. I had my nails painted a vampy deep red, most unlike me it was. But I have to admit, they looked good with my blue dress. The didn't even get too damaged as the night progressed, and neither did I(!) The awards were distributed efficiently and I was especially pleased by 3 wins; Red Mum for photoblog, Irish Autism Action for group blog and Xbox for personal. The best part of the evening followed with all the chatting and a little bit more drinking (mostly tea) into the morning. The clocks went back depriving us of an hour of either sleep or fun. I chose less sleep. Eventually I made it to my bed for a few hours sleep. Today I joined a few more bloggy types for brunch in a pub and now, knackered, I'm facing the long trip home.

{"date": "26 Mar 2010", "body": "\nDuncan had another appointment with the dentist this morning. Lady and Thomas have both started school now (more on that later- but it's going well) so it was just the two of us. The 1st time we were at that dentist it was a huge struggle to get him in the building. He stood outside crying for ages while I tried to reason with him. We made it into the waiting room where  The Tweenies  was  playing  on a  tv , henceforth that room was known as \"The  Tweenies  Room.\" Duncan utterly refused to leave the room so the dentist came to him and after Thomas modelled the procedure, Duncan consented to allow the dentist a brief glimpse inside his mouth right there. On the next visit he made it to the examination room but not onto the chair, though he did enjoy moving the stuffed dinosaur with the big teeth up and down on the chair. Then the dentist got another kick look but didn't see much. Today however Duncan was an absolute star. We entered the  Tweenies Room and he dashed about a bit checking out the books and wall posters, seemed pleased that there was no smoking allowed, then got ready to leave again. An old woman and a younger man, probably her son, arrived. The man might well have been autistic himself. Duncan was restless and I said several times, \"we will wait.\" \"I can't wait!\" \"Look at the door, read the sign. This is a waiting room.\" He read it and seemed a bit happier to do what the sign said, for a while at least. He got ready to move again and I said, \"wait for a little while. The dentist will be ready soon.\" Duncan replied softly, \"I don't want to wait. Listen to me, pal!\" I just asked him about the book he had picked up. The woman most have had very acute hearing as she snorted a bit then said, \"oh, that's a strange thing to say.\" Now  was thinking that her sticking her nose in was strange, but reasoned that she might not have known better and said, \"it's a phrase he picked up from a video. He doesn't know what it means.\" (I regret saying that with him right beside me now.) \"Well one thing I will say, in my day we respected our parents.\" \"That's nice. He respects me and I respect him too.\" We were called to the dentist then. I suppose I should be glad she only felt it was her right to comment on my son's words and wasn't tempted to stick a pen into his or my eye unlike the wish expressed by a   \"home-schooling\" mother I read about on Liz's blog . This \"christian\" (I won't capitalise the word, this woman doesn't deserve it) clearly hasn't heard about \"suffer the little children.\" It's hard to believe she could possibly be so ignorant about autism as she obviously is for unless she's living as part of an able-bodied people only cult, she surely knows of other non-school educated families with autistic children; there's loads of us out there! But forget her, my boy did well today, Lady and Thomas are settling and happy in their new school, I'm off to Galway for the weekend.

Later when I was downstairs I noticed a new gymnastics trophy on the shelf. \"Oh that,\" he said easily,\"I won it today for getting my back-flip.\" I was really happy to see he had taken more pride in sharing the accomplishment of the move instead of the reward, relished the intrinsic satisfaction and not the extrinsic prize. Just getting his back-flip was all the reward he needed.

{"date": "21 Mar 2010", "body": "\nLady and Thomas were taken by their dad to visit the local Integrated primary school last Tuesday and both liked it so much that they decided they would go to try it out. So after I spoke on the phone with the school principal, we've arranged that they will start this Thursday so they go for a couple of days before the Easter break. I'll be visiting the school myself tomorrow morning to look around and meet with the P4 and P7 teachers to talk about what they do and to tell them about my children.\r \r Lady's decision came as a complete shock; she announced a few days ago she wanted to visit the school with the others. She had previously always been adamant when questioned that she was not at all interested in going back to school for the foreseeable future. But she just realised that she wants to try out primary school again before she's too old. So, fair enough, off she goes.\r \r Thomas has been thinking  for a while about going to school for the first time in his life. He'd originally said he'd start next autumn term so we could all enjoy the summer together instead of being stuck in a classroom for the few months we have a year when the weather is half decent. But after seeing the school he changed his mind and wants to go right away.\r \r We're trying to decide how best to arrange how to travel to and from school. It's one stop away from here on the train and they could easily manage to travel there and back together but I have a notion that wouldn't be allowed by the train company; unaccompanied minors etc. They could walk, cycle or use a scooter and go along the coastal path. Or I could copy almost all the other parents and drive them there.\r \r I hope they enjoy this experience. I still think home education is a better way for children to learn; school is so very inefficient and takes up such a huge portion of children's lives, especially when you consider that even after they have spent almost all day in school, they then have homework to do. I don't know how the children will manage all their activities; Tuesday - Thomas has gymnastics then jujitsu, Wednesday - they both do gymnastics, Thursday - Lady has 2 gymnastics classes and Thomas goes to Beavers, Friday - Lady goes to the local youth club and the gymnastics coach told me yesterday she wants Thomas to start a class on Fridays soon, Saturday - Thomas does jujitsu and hurling and Lady has cheer leading, Sunday - Thomas does gymnastics. How are they going to have time to spend with their family, go to school, do homework, continue their sports and activities, play and hang out with friends, chill out and read/watch tv/learn an instrument/master a computer game/draw a picture/write a letter or blog post? How does everyone manage without bursting from the pressure?\r \r I  do  want them to enjoy it and to gain from the experience. They are free to remain at school if they so choose, but if, having given it a good couple of months, they decide they want to be home educated again then they will be deregistered. This is not now the most straightforward of manoeuvres as some of the education boards are trying to fool parents wanting to home educate that legislation exists (it doesn't) to prevent the deregistration process.\r \r I am keen to know exactly what they make of the whole thing, and think that for Thomas especially, he'll either love it or hate it. I don't expect him to merely tolerate it. Lady only wants to go for one term but she may discover that she wants to go on to secondary school too in which case I will have to try to find a place for her in one of the schools not requiring a pass on the transfer test.\r \r I'll be here for them no matter what and boost them and help them know what they need and how to get it. Duncan and I will have more time together and that's always nice, though he may be going to school some time soon himself. Until he does (if he does) he's going to miss his siblings terribly.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/03/trying-school.html", "title": "\nTrying School\n"},
{"date": "27 Feb 2010", "body": "\n The film was released here just after we left for our holiday and it had been out for so long in the US that it was no longer shown in most cinemas. So keen as were (me and Lady anyway!) to see this, we just had to wait until we got home again. So a few days ago we headed off the local cinema for a bit of old fashioned Disney animated goodness. Now I am aware that Disney films are not all peachy and contain heaps of  patriarchy pushing  and much  outright racism  but I like, even love most of them, flaws and all. OK so Ariel has some twisted ambitions, Cinderella is so wet and pathetic and Belle falls for a creature who locks up first her dad and then her and shouts and is cruel, but I'll overlook these things, they can happen to any of us. As usual in the cinema I sat by Duncan. He took a while to get involved in the story but I fell for it right away. It looks beautiful and Tiana is such an engaging, feisty character. I didn't care much for the prince, even after he'd been improved (as is always the case in these films) by his association with our smart wee waiter woman. Having watched a few of the preview trailers last year (and following some of the controversy about how race was depicted in the film) I was dreading the appearance of the firefly Ray but he was lovely and his love of the star was sweet and his role at the movie's end really touching. The bad guy, who uses the spirits to advance himself and whom we know will meet a sticky end before the credits role, was well realised too, and the spirits were bloody spooky and menacing. We all enjoyed it. I liked the music and Duncan definitely favoured Ray. So much so that when an unfortunate event occurs near the end, he was really saddened and even angered and said very loudly, \"Where is Ray?\" He was properly concerned. I tried to comfort him with some theory or other about where Ray had gone but he saw right through me. Then he declared, \"Ray is not a star, get Ray back NOW!\" Thankfully the cinema was almost empty, but even if it hadn't been, I hardy think his expressing deep feelings about the action would have bothered anyone. He cried for a while later that night and I talked to him about it all. Then he said he wasn't sad any more and that was that. I was predisposed to like this film. I have to admit I did want to see a beautiful black woman become a Disney Princess in a classic tale and moreover, for my brown-skinned daughter to see someone other than the typical Disney gal depicted. On our last morning at Disney World we happened across the Tiana and Naveen characters meeting people. There was a short line so see them so I approached to wait too but was told they had closed the line and asked to return an hour later. Too bad I thought. But then the staff member (cast member they're called over there!) decided to allow us on in. So a few minutes later the children were meeting Tiana and Naveen who were absolutely lovely and chatted with them for ages. Lady did OK with handsome Naveen's arm on her shoulder all along while Duncan had the pretty lady (and he likes the pretty ones!) hold his hand all the time. We big people joined the children for a photo next and I positioned myself next to the prince. When we'd finished they walked off regally, the Tiana character waving and smiling at all the gobsmacked little girls. It was sweet and I am not so cynical that I didn't get a warm feeling when a little girl of 4 or so stopped to stare at the princess who looked like her.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/S4mqnw-ArWI/AAAAAAAAA84/REzV6J-OGwQ/s1600-h/The-Princess-and-the-Frog-UK-Poster.jpg", "http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/25/disney-princesses-deconstructed/", "http://www.cracked.com/article_15677_the-9-most-racist-disney-characters.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/S4mqosHSftI/AAAAAAAAA9A/Nk4jN8naBE4/s1600-h/princess+and+frog1.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/S4mqo5tfOWI/AAAAAAAAA9I/3MMuyh8_woM/s1600-h/princess+and+frog2.png"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/02/princess-and-frog.html", "title": "\nThe Princess and the Frog\n"},
{"date": "25 Feb 2010", "body": "\nWe rose early on Tuesday morning and piled cases, wheelchairs and bodies into the car bound for Dublin airport. Once parked and in the airport, we'd only a short wait to drop of our bags then through security. So far, so fantastic. Duncan used his wheelchair (occasionally recreationally- see video!) though he did jump out every so often before sprinting after whatever took his fancy. No doubt folk observing were wondering what we were about, but sure, we're used to that! We were delighted to spot my sister at the departure gate. Now we had the full crew the holiday really was on course. When the plane was ready we were allowed to board early. Duncan sat at the window, me to his right, his dad and Thomas in front (in case he kicked the seat!) and Lady and my sister across the aisle from me. It was just right. Best of all each passenger had a personal entertainment system in the seat back. Duncan started to watch Disney films straight off, with his ear defenders over the ear phones.  The Aer Lingus crew were fantastic. After take off we were told that the empty bulkhead seats were ours for the taking if we wanted them. We decided to stay put, even though they had more leg room, since it wasn't worth disrupting what was working so far. Before long Duncan opted to simply listen to children's TV theme tunes and soon after that he set his screen to show the route map which he followed for hours! The journey took over 9 hours and in all that time he was just as perfect as I could possibly have hoped for. As always, Thomas and Lady were helpful and relaxed, and enjoyed the films and games on offer. Just one incident marred the experience. Sitting behind me were 2 elderly men whom I presume from their accents were from the USA. They both slept for a few hours. Unfortunately I was assaulted at regular intervals by the most foul stench of someone's intestinal gases escaping and the pungency and direction of the attack strongly suggested one or both of these dudes was the culprit. But hey, when you're on an aeroplane you have to put up with whatever you're next to so I set the air blower things in my row to maximum and tried to breathe through my mouth. Then a couple of hours before landing Duncan started to move the window shutter next to him. He put it up, then a minute later shut it, and for a while he played at opening and closing it. He wasn't making much noise and the shutter wasn't shared with another row. He wasn't causing any harm and I was keeping a close eye to see if I needed to move him on to something else. Then I heard the men behind us talking and they were complaining to each other about the shutter thing, saying they wished he'd make up his mind and leave it alone. I was a bit surprised and caught my sister's eye. She sighed and rolled her eyes at the cranky old guys. Then I heard something I couldn't ignore. The one behind Duncan said (and I didn't catch it all exactly) \"...I'd choke him...\" and I knew he was referring to Duncan. I said to my sister who looked outraged, \"did I just hear that right?!\" She said that yes, she'd heard him too. I turned around and looked him in the eye, \"excuse me, what was that you just said about my son?\" He wasn't so forthright when he was challenged; \" oh, nothing...I was just talking about the light. It's OK .\" \"You were talking about my son. He is disabled, he is autistic and he is doing the best he can. In fact, he is being bloody fantastic.\" \" Yes, yes. It's OK .\" I wanted to say something to the crew but since I wasn't sure what else he's said, besides  I'd choke him  which I'd heard loud and clear, I left it. But I was a bit shaken. It was extra nice when a few minutes later another old Irish man who was queuing next to our seat for the sandwich sale, started chatting and asked about Duncan saying what a great boy he was. Better yet, 2 of the crew approached me to chat and commended Duncan in the most complimentary way saying he had been just wonderful and he was such a credit to us and what a lovely, happy child he is and it was a pleasure having us on board. Mr Nasty can't help but have heard. My sister told me later that she'd heard the whole thing clearly. He'd said, \"if he was my son I'd have choked him by now.\" Cruel sod. I pity the children he may have had and hope karma bites him hard on the ass. But onwards. The descent was hard on Duncan. His ears hurt and despite our best efforts (together with kind offers of sweets and olbas oil drops from the crew and other, nicer passengers sitting close) he couldn't or wouldn't take anything. I just held him and whispered comforting words and he cried until he were almost down. But this too passed. We disembarked and were able to go follow airport staff through the disabled passengers' line at immigration. We even had a friendly immigration officer! We were all tired out but managed to keep it together until we'd got our cases (both times) and picked up the hire car. We'd more than survived the journey, we'd enjoyed it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/02/orlando-holiday-part-1-flight.html", "title": "\nOrlando Holiday: Part 1 The Flight\n"},
{"date": "3 Mar 2010", "body": "\n There's a campaign to encourage people to rethink the words they choose to write and say.  Today, March 3 2010 , has been chosen as a day to focus on these issues. Words matter, language matters. When people decide to use as slurs and insults, words that originated as diagnostic labels for various disabilities and/or for various categories of mental illness, real and manufactured (\" hysteria \") then they contribute to a culture that marginalises people. Disabled people are dehumanised by these words. A society that tolerates the use of slurs like r*t*rd and sp*st*c as equivalent to stupid, useless, pathetic, hateful or annoying, legitimises the hatred that leads to the abuse, murder, forced drugging and sterilisation and discarding of so many disabled people in this country and all around the world. Some people whine about the \"language police,\" \"PC gone mad,\" their \"right to free speech\" and how \"no one has a right not to be offended.\" They make a case to keep insulting, belittling, minimising and dehumanising people like my son who have developmental disabilities just so they can slag off their mates or sound hip and cool on someone's blog or YouTube comments. But if someone wants to keep acting like an entitled and callous arse, that's their call. There's a fantastic series on  Ableist Language  at the  FWD/Forward blog  discussing specific words, their origin, the damage they can do and suggesting alternatives. As expected, the usual arguments in favour of the right to  offend and destroy and display your laziness and lack of consideration  say whatever the hell you want are raised. These are  deconstructed in this great post . There's one argument the non-creative who prefer to keep right on insulting and degrading developmentally disabled people use that isn't in the list. It's the \"euphemism treadmill\" argument, and it's explained in this  blog comment ; This sort of process (words becoming offensive and being replaced by new  terms that end up becoming pejorative over time only to be replaced by  more and more cumbersome and ridiculous expressions and so on and so  forth ad infinitum) is known as the euphemism treadmill.  And people who  keep insisting on keeping this treadmill going are fucking retards (I  hope the actual innocent retards forgive me for using this innocent word  pejoratively). The Blog owner responded to this inanity with, \"Fucking right!\" Can I have a facepalm? OK, that's me shut up then. I wouldn't want to contribute to the \"euphemism treadmill.\" Keeping all hip and raging against the PC police is far more important than listening to the people whose lives are directly negatively affected by your words and committing to making a few simple substitutions. My understanding of what this commenter calls the \"euphemism treadmill\" is the positive effect of disability activists who have influenced the language used to describe people with their attributes. \"Wheelchair bound\" is out because people who use wheelchairs find the term fucking ridiculous and limiting. If people who are blind prefer not to be referred to as a \"the blind\" and people who have epilepsy quite reasonably don't want to be called \"epileptics\" then should those of us who are not in these groups get all bothered by their \"disgraceful assault on our right to speak as we see fit\"? Should we return to a more paternalistic era (as if this one's not bad enough) when we allowed doctors, psychologists educators and others with power-over to dictate the terms used to describe people, or might it be seen as fairer that, as people gain more agency over their lives, they and only they have the moral authority to dictate the language used to describe these lives. There's more about this on  Here Be Dragons  post;  Ban the R-Treatment : A lot of people think that The R-Word campaign is just about a disablist  slur, but it\u2019s the medicalization of atypical learning and social  behaviour that\u2019s dehumanizing, hence the basis of all slurs for people  considered inferior are medical terms which caused the  euphemism treadmill  in the first place. Another thing about the previous comment is the distinction made between the \"fucking r*t*rds\" behind this drive to substitute language that demeans with the language of their choice and the \"actual innocent r*t*rds\" whom s/he hopes will forgive such pejorative use of this \"innocent\" word. FAIL! They're the same people , these \"innocents\" and the ones who annoy you (and confuse you?) so much with their attempt to improve they way they're discussed and to stop people using using their discarded diagnoses as the epitome of the put down. And what makes them \"innocent\" anyway? They're almost all adults so in all likelihood, they're as much of a sinner as you or I! I hate this trope that developmentally disabled people are seen as innocent and child-like even when they're full grown men and women. It's another way in which they're dehumanised. If you want to, go ahead and use r*t*rd and similar terms as insults. I reserve the right to think of you who do as arrogant, rude, insensitive twerps. To the rest of you who might decide that on reflection, it might be decent to chose other words that don't have such power to hurt and harm, please  pledge your support  to eliminate the demeaning use of the r-word.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/S44_8UrTlMI/AAAAAAAAA9Q/KMa5EvoPkRY/s1600-h/stw.png", "http://www.r-word.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria", "http://disabledfeminists.com/category/ableist-word-profile/", "http://disabledfeminists.com/", "http://disabledfeminists.com/2009/11/23/o-language-again/", "http://bocktherobber.com/2008/08/cripples-retards-and-politically-correct-euphemism#comment-86557", "http://turnerandkowalski.wordpress.com/", "http://turnerandkowalski.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/ban-the-r-treatment-whatever-the-politically-correct-term-is/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism#Euphemism_treadmill", "http://www.r-word.org/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/03/words-language-attitudes-and-actions.html", "title": "\nWords, language, attitudes and actions\n"},
{"date": "28 Jan 2010", "body": "\n Guilty     The  General Medical Council  has ruled that Andrew Wakefield, one of autism's most notorious  False Prophets  and quintessential  brave maverick doctor  is guilty of having \"showed a callous disregard\" for the suffering of children and has \"abused his position of trust.\"  According to  The Guardian's report : Wakefield also acted dishonestly and was misleading and irresponsible in the way he described research that was later published in the Lancet medical journal, the GMC said. He had gone against the interests of children in his care, and his conduct brought the medical profession \"into disrepute\" after he took blood samples from youngsters at his son's birthday party in return for payments of \u00a35. The doctor, who was absent from today's GMC hearing, faces being struck off the medical register. The panel decided the allegations against him could amount to serious professional misconduct, an issue to be decided at a later date. It's a damning verdict. This man should be  ashamed of how terribly he has used autistic children  to make a name for himself. He cares more for the adoration of the deluded and confused who flock around him at the autism quack conferences like he's Jo Jonas or something thinking his use of their children means he cares or can help. No one should let this man anywhere near their children, autistic or not. He has caused a shit storm of harm to autistic people by leading the troops describing the condition as vaccination damage, with all the negative rhetoric they propagate. Thousands of parents were confused by the reporting of his crappy paper and his lack of dignity and honesty in refusing to admit that it was a fair cop even when it came out in public that  he'd totally fixed his results . He is responsible for so many people choosing to avoid vaccinating their children; the subsequent rise in measles cases caused death and disability in children when it could have been avoided.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:LhHT_7XbHHdVQM:http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_02/andrewWakefield2G_228x438.jpg", "http://www.gmc-uk.org/index.asp", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Autisms-False-Prophets-Science-Medicine/dp/0231146361", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=106", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/jan/28/mmr-doctor-fail-children-gmc"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/01/andrew-wakefield-verdict-guilty.html", "title": "\nAndrew Wakefield Verdict- Guilty\n"},

{"date": "26 Jan 2010", "body": "\nSo you've all booked a flight from Dublin to Orlando and luckily, you've chosen to go at the same time as me and my family. Some of you will, like us, be heading off for a bit of a holiday and hoping for sun, heat, roller coasters and perhaps some time at the home of the world's most famous rodent. It's likely that some of you will be travelling for work and others may be visiting family or returning home. Whatever the reason, I hope it's all good for you. I'm sure you understand that this route attracts many families with young children who are incredibly excited to be going on holiday to Disney World, and for whom the long flight can be quite a trial. I suggest that if you don't wish to be disturbed by their chatter and the hopefully infrequent but inevitable tears and tantrums, that you pack ear plugs or invest in some noise cancelling headphones or even upgrade to business class. I hope your flight will be as pleasant as possible but young children and older people with disabilities exist and must be at least tolerated and hopefully even respected. It's likely that I will board before you. Most airlines allow these small accommodations to reduce the stress on people like my son, caused by lots of waiting about. So when you're walking down the aisle and see the skinny boy who might just be kicking up a fuss about something, you can  feel  relief that you're not sitting next to him if you want but please, don't stop to  tell  me so like one heartless git did last time we flew. If you do find yourself sitting in our vicinity, well sorry. I promise you that all of the people in my party will be doing our very best to distract, entertain and if needed, reassure my disabled son. Know too that the child himself will be doing his best to cope with what to him can be a difficult situation. You may think that people like him shouldn't fly if it's so difficult for him. I disagree. Flying is not an activity reserved only for adults and non-disabled people. We're all at liberty to travel so long as we abide by the legal requirements. It's important that we try to be as respectful and polite as possible to those around us but if my son shouts at times, that doesn't mean he can't fly. Last year there were a few stories about parents and autistic children being removed from planes before take off. I read  and was disgusted by some of the vitriolic commentary about these incidents. There were those who advocated bashing the kids against seat backs and throwing them out in mid-air. Apart from these extremists, there were many who just whinged about how their right to peace and quiet was disturbed by children and \"mothers\" (rarely fathers) who expected to be treated as saintly just because they'd given birth. I don't think that's the case. I'm sorry to say that when you're in a public space you have no right to peace and quiet, especially not when you're trapped in a moving can in the air. You have a right to travel in security and safety and as much comfort as is possible. But people of all kinds exist and they have to get about too. So instead of judging, rolling your eyes and tutting (like one couple did last time) or staring (again, we had this last time) or getting pissed off at me for putting my son's seat back when he finally fell asleep (as the man behind him did last time- he actually pushed the seat back up! I let him, I was too worn out by then to protest) I have a radical idea- why don't you try a smile, and ask, \"is there anything I can do to help?\" That would be truly heroic. Know also it could be worse. I flew to Portugal with my sister last August. There were a few children in front of us, one of whom cried a little as we landed. That was fine: children sometimes cry and the parents were doing their best to comfort the little one. Behind us though were a group of people travelling together who yapped loudly the whole time, their braying voices forcing all around them to hear all about their exploits, and it was Too Much Information! Worse yet, someone kept farting and I was tempted to pull out the oxygen mask to have some clean air to breath. I was so relived to step off  that  plane. Enjoy your flight!

{"date": "27 Jan 2010", "body": "\nWe took a walk through the forest. Duncan elected to ride in his wheelchair. It's just the right size for him and he's pretty comfortable in it, thank goodness. It's not really designed for forest tracks but as long as we kept on the bigger and smoother paths we were fine. He got out and ran about now and then too, and they all had a good splash about in the burn. Lady told me stories about all the forest residents; fairies, sprites and goddesses in the trees and water and the two warring werewolf tribes, the protectors and the flesh eaters. Apparently ivy and holly repel the flesh-eaters and the few scraps of cloth we spotted caught in the bushes were left over when the wolves transform. She and her cousin A. thought all this up, with the help no doubt of Harry Potter, Twilight and I think, some Enid Blyton stuff thrown into the mix. Duncan trying out his wheelchair. Though he looks kind of worried, he was very content! Duncan was wearing an old pair of Lady's glasses. They have blue frames so help him look more like his hero Chuckie Finster Lady and Thomas test their wellies and prove that so long as the water doesn't rise above the rim, your socks stay dry. Duncan finds that chucking stones into water can be a most satisfying pursuit.  The dog was in heaven dashing about sniffing out the holes and burrows and avoiding the water as much as she could. I panicked a bit when 3 sheep ran out on the other bank close to her: they must have got out of their field. Thankfully she came to heel and I was able to clip her lead back on without her running after them. Poor Duncan was a bit stressed but soon cheered up when we set of in the direction of the Spar and he got his hands on the first Creme Egg of the season. Later Thomas had gymnastics for 2 hours; squad training. He came out with yet another trophy. We joked about how all this winning was just getting boring now. Then I took him off to his 2nd Tuesday class, an hour of jujitsu. Lady has dropped this one but Thomas still loves it. He's a green belt now. I can see him sticking with it all the way to black.

{"date": "22 Jan 2010", "body": "\nWe've done this before so I have a better idea of what I need to improve to make this flight across the Atlantic as painless as it can be for everyone. Last time we flew via London and Duncan was fine on the first short flight from Belfast but very distressed on the second leg of the journey. He had it in mind that once we arrived in London, Disney World would be just a taxi drive away. (This was a reasonable assumption since it's what had happened when we'd gone to Disneyland Paris.) The flight was delayed at London and we had paid to wait in a lounge (Virgin V Room) with good facilities for families. I'd hoped that as Duncan played about loads in the soft play room, he'd be tired and fall asleep on the plane. But he didn't even want to board the cavernous and to him, scary Virgin plane. I'd opted to sit in the bulkhead seats with him thinking that we'd have slightly more space and no one in front to be bothered by his kicking their seatback. These seats are sought after and were allocated to us because of Duncan's disability. However they were a bad choice. We were sitting next to a baby who cried which upset Duncan. The little girl sitting next to me had a packet of sweets of higher value to Duncan than the hard lollies I'd packed for him to suck. We were also exposed to the rude and contemptuous stares of strangers all around. Duncan fussed and whined and occasionally wailed for HOURS and the poor child was so unhappy. I was worn out and the attitude of other passengers near us added to his distress and my stress. Before boarding the return flight, I had him sit in his stroller and I pushed him about the airport for ages until the plane was ready. It was an evening flight and I tried to keep stimulation to a minimum. We opted for seats in a row of 3 alongside the galley which reduced the number of other people near us. Duncan sat between me and his dad and the other 2 children had to sit alone beside a stranger behind us. I knew that I had to have Duncan surrounded by people who cared and protected from the looks and tuts of paediaphobes/disabled people haters. It was an evening flight and he'd had plenty to eat and been active all day, but was chilled out and relaxed from being pushed about in the stroller. I'd changed him into comfortable clothes and brushed his teeth. When we sat on the plane, I cuddled him and his dad stroked his feet and he fell asleep before we'd left the runway. Success! This time I have planned like a general. I've booked a flight from Dublin direct to Orlando so no transfer worries. I plan to take some of his absolute favourite sweets and snacks. There are times to worry about healthy eating but when you're in a metal box hurtling along 12km up in the air, that's not the time. Just do what it takes to get by. I will have DS games and his Gameboy. I will fill my Ipod with his favourite movies in case the in flight entertainment is inadequate. I am making him a book showing exactly what will happen at each stage of the journey from leaving our home to arriving at the villa. He will have a travel bag with some favourite small toys and books as well as colouring pens and a notebook in case I need to write out or draw further instructions. We have arranged to sit so as to have Duncan as sheltered from strangers as possible. He will have ear defenders and a neck cushion. Duncan has outgrown his stroller but he still needs a safe place to retreat to and I need a way of reducing his tendency to run off. I have just received his new and long awaited wheelchair. It's just the right size and will enable us to have a much more relaxed and enjoyable holiday. I've informed the airline of his needs and that he'll be using a wheelchair until we get to the plane. It will make navigating the airports that much easier. I will also use his autism alert card to show any officials who can help us get through the potentially tricky security and immigration rituals. Best of all my sister is coming with us this time so there'll be 3 adults and 3 children so everyone will be well cared for. I want this to be fun for him and the others, so I will try to be alert but not stressed. Hopefully all this planning will help me strike the right balance.

{"date": "23 Nov 2009", "body": "\nDuncan continues to take great pleasure in producing various pictures of Chuckie from the Rugrats. Is it perseveration? Do I care? Each picture is different in at least some small way. I think they're cute and funny and witty. Thomas doesn't like to draw. He'd rather do maths or count the money in his Tardis money box. (I don't mean it's bigger on the inside, it's just shaped like a Tardis.) We've been doing some P4 stuff on  Education City  (free trial) and he's acing it all. Lady has used that site too and they both quite like it so I might subscribe. Does anyone have a code they want to share? He's also decided he wants to try school after we return from our holiday in February (2 weeks in Orlando!) He says that everyone else in the family has been to school at some stage but he never went to nursery or school so he wants to see what it's like. I've been reading the prospectus for various schools and quizzing our friends and neighbours about what they think of the school they/their children go to. Graham Badman and Ed Balls , do you see what I'm doing here? I'm listening to my child, I'm gathering information to help us both make the best decision about his education. It's not a matter of my rights clashing with his, despite the mistaken way in which you think about parenting and the  duty  on parents to ensure their child receives an education. If he's happy to go to school and it works out for him, then fine, he goes to school. But if he doesn't like it, he will be deregistered and his education will continue to happen at home and in the community as it has so far with great success. So what else- we watched the latest Doctor Who,  The Waters of Mars  which was terrific, and taught that the homeopaths were wrong; water has patience not memory (via  @ jackofkent ) . Also, Gordon was in the US for a week but the children were still able to see him thanks to the magic of technology. Here's a screen grab he took from his hotel room in Boston as he spoke to Duncan and I via Google video; Nice and clear eh! What wasn't so nice was the cuckoo clock falling off the wall (where  I  had fixed it-guilt!) somehow and onto Thomas' head. He was sore and bleeding so I called a friend and neighbour who kindly rushed around with her little girl to stay with Duncan and Lady while I took Thomas to get checked out. The bleeding stopped quickly but you don't take chances with bashes to the head. I went to our GP 1st as it's very close and told the receptionist what had happened, her question floored me (not really) -\"Does he have an appointment?\" Yes really! She advised me to take him to the Minor Injury clinic in town so I did and he was seen and sorted very quickly. Thankfully there was no evidence of serious harm and he didn't even need a stitch. The following morning my neighbour minded my children again while I met with a psychologist to discuss Duncan and to seek advice on issues I wish could help him deal better with, like his impulses and angst driven shouting. I don't know how useful it will be. She used the word \"behaviours\" which I dislike intensely. I've been given an assessment form to fill in; ABAS II for those familiar with such things. It's interesting, but leaves no space to detail many of the skills and abilities he does possess, but I suppose they are deemed \"non-functional\" or something. Lady continues to work hard at gymnastics. She trains for over 15 hours a week and loves it. I watched her at cheer-leading on Saturday and was so proud of her strength and poise. Her acro partner and sister are visiting today, no doubt they'll be showing off to me on the trampoline. I took Lady and her close friend (who lives next door) to see  New Moon , that Twilight film yesterday. Oh my, what hokum. The girls enjoyed it even as they were laughing at how silly so much of it is. That Bella Swan girl is so pathetic, glum and wan. She never does anything but mope and have nightmares.  Has she no hobbies? Her face would break if she cracked a smile. The girls can easily see she's taken all that first and fiery love thing too far- jumping off cliffs and riding motor bikes with no helmet just to produce ghostly ticking-offs from Mr Chalky. They both thought Jacob the were-boy was the better bet, if forced to choose and I think they're right. Both have acknowledged the inherent ridiculousness of getting involved with anyone who could either claw or bite you to death at any moment and do not think it's romantic, just that it makes (for them) for an engaging  fantasy . I say this as some of the chatter on the Twilight series warns of the danger to girls of thinking that bad boys are best; but I have much more respect for girls' ability to see it for what it is, a rollicking bit of escapist nonsense. I laughed a lot, and was elbowed fiercely by Lady. It's not supposed to be funny when Edward with his LOW slung trousers starts to unbutton his shirt in the sunshine, but it really was. He has such big hair too, I wonder what product he uses, something specially developed for the dead? Michael Sheen was great fun as an evil vampire overlord. It was extra delicious since I think of Tony Blair whenever he's on as he's played our previous beloved leader twice in film and will do so again soon I've read. So I was watching and thinking that the evil leader of the vampire council is Tony Blair.

{"date": "26 Jan 2010", "body": "\nDuncan has been a bit anxious about flying to Orlando. He's been asking that we fly with Flybe and Virgin, the 2 airlines we used last time when we flew via London. He kept saying, \"no Aer Lingus!\" and I didn't push it. A few nights ago I was lying beside him in bed and looking at pictures on my laptop. He was looking on. I started looking at Aer Lingus aeroplanes and he asked to have a closer look. Then he wanted to watch videos about Aer Lingus so we YouTubed for a while; ended up watching  a cheesy ad  I remember from my childhood, showing the cabin crew as comely maidens clad all in green and the pilots as dudes of a certain age; abounding in wisdom and reliability. In fact as soon as you got on board, you were as good as home. Duncan enjoyed it anyway. He'll probably be asking me to download the soundtrack for  The Mission  next. Yesterday I asked him if he would help me make a film about going to Orlando. He agreed so I powered up Windows Movie Maker and sat by him. He immediately suggested the appropriate music, \"Here comes the sun\" by The Beatles. He's used that song before! I thought it was an excellent choice so we went on from there, adding text and pictures. He insisted on including the train picture at the end! (I've already ordered the train from ebay so will slip it into our luggage and take it with us to save the stress of trying to find it out there. I only hope it's enough to distract him from his original idea of buying a cuckoo clock at Epcot- so expensive and delicate!) \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_i3iX6ozvI", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091530/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/01/social-story-video-for-flying-with.html", "title": "\nSocial Story Video for Flying with Duncan\n"},
{"date": "15 Jan 2010", "body": "\nI've been thinking for years about how to deal with some difficulties I face. This has taken so much of my time and energy, it's drained me. I've had no desire to blog while this was foremost in my mind. But thankfully now I have reached a decision I can be...well not happy about, but confident that it's the right one. It's a huge relief to know for certain and to start now making plans to move on with a new phase in my life. I have missed blogging. I enjoyed keeping this record of my children's development and the silly stuff we get up to as well as sharing my opinions on autism/disability/home education issues with anyone who chooses to read them. It's been an important outlet; writing posts here has often concentrated my mind, forcing me to research issues to be able to write with some knowledge and understanding. It's been a way of making contacts around the world with people with similar interests and of connecting with others writing about their own lives and areas of expertise. I love reading blogs and even when I wasn't writing my own I have continued to read the blogs I've subscribed to, though I've very rarely commented on any. I have stopped reading a few that were just starting to piss me off with their lazy stereotyping, especially those with sexist and (all too often) disablist writing. I just don't have the energy to witness that stuff. It means I stay away from many mainstream comment sites like CiF on the Guardian and the BBC websites- shudder. Today I will meet with an education psychologist from the local education board. I want to investigate schooling options for Duncan. I'm not sure whether or not I will enroll him in a  school again but will think about it seriously and figure out what he prefers. Thomas too is thinking of starting at school for the 1st time in his life. Lady has no desire to be schooled. I will support their choices. I'm tired but getting by. I can be proud of how the children are thriving; obviously I am more than coping, despite the fact that my home is only rarely tidy and there's a long list of home repairs needing to be dealt with. Also, the whole family is lucky enough to be going to Disney World for a fortnight in February. I'll be sure to see that the children have a fabulous time.

{"date": "17 Jan 2010", "body": "\nI spoke with an educational psychologist on Friday about school options for Duncan. She thought one of the schools for children with severe learning difficulties (SLD) would be best for him so he would get the highest level of support. These schools are not autism-specific but contain pupils with any condition, physical, sensory, emotional or neurological that impedes the child's ability to learn. I admit I was surprised for a minute or two since Duncan is well able to learn but on reflection I agree that if he was to go to a school, he would need a high adult to child ratio with well trained and experienced teaching staff. She said that although he is able in many ways he is \"very autistic\" and that his behavioural problems would make it difficult for him to \"access the curriculum.\" She knows other autistic children who are like Duncan in many ways, who have the same problems with impulse control but who are bright and curious and who have done well at one of these schools. Duncan has done well at home having had a lot of individual attention and when we go out he has virtually one-to-one attention from me so to give him the best chance of succeeding in a school, the transition needs to be as easy as possible with the highest levels of care and support that would only be available in a SLD school. I will go and visit the schools and speaks to the principals and teachers. I need to find out how the approach problem behaviour, check they don't use restraints and discover as much as I can about how they operate and whether I would be happy enough for my son to go there.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2010/01/school-options-sld.html", "title": "\nSchool options - SLD\n"},

It's such a delight to hear him burping or, to use the terminology of my childhood,  rifting , when we're in the car together. I suspect that if I stay stoic and blandly keep telling him to be polite he'll get tired of this soon enough. Like many nine year old boys, he's discovered the power of cursing. It could be worse. He knows that I don't want him shouting rude words (at least until he can determine when it's not going to upset people to hear him).

My boy Duncan is doing really well. He is happy, settled, more focussed, talks loads, understands speech more and can carry out more complex instructions. His reading ability continues to improve. He has played lots of computer games and uses YouTube instruction videos (which have occasionally increased his vocabulary in less than optimal ways) when he gets stuck since he knows I'm no help.

{"date": "1 Sep 2009", "body": "\nThe summer holidays have ended and for a few hours each day, my lot are just about the only children around not in school or nursery. We needed new wellies; walks through the forest and down to the beach tend to leave one's footwear rather mucky from September onwards. So we went to the shops and noticed for the first time in months how we stuck out, even more than usual. But since so many of their friends are in school and not tearing up and down the streets on bikes, my children were content to settle to some reading, writing and 'rithmetic (or Mathematics, as Thomas says gravely) and that sort of thing. As usual though the best part of their learning comes through conversation, asking questions, playing their games, reading, watching TV and whatever takes their fancy at any particular time. Duncan has discovered Mr Men so has started collecting the books, watching the films, playing games on the PC and making pictures. He's quite taken with Sonic the Hedgehog too, and he and Thomas take turns to play a PC demo game he downloaded. Duncan gets Thomas to help him with the trickier parts. Sometimes he gets distressed when it's not going well. He's been distressed a lot about something or other these past few months. It's been hard for him and I lost a bit of my coping mojo for a while there (hence the lack of blogdom). So he was sad, and I was grouchy, making him sad and screamy making me tired and head-achy and so on. But I discovered a great cure for these feelings of stress and inadequacy on the internet; a 3 night holiday in Portugal. Actually my sister found it for us. In an astonishing coincidence, she needed a bit of respite from life's arrows just now too! We both went to stay in a posh hotel where we lazed in the shade from a hot sun by the pool/beach, swam a couple of times, dined well, drank a bit and strolled a little and I read 3.5 mostly lowbrow books. It was the laziest most relaxing holiday I have ever had and it was marvellous. On our last visit to the beach we thought it wise to get off our backsides and go parasailing. But there were no slots left for us, so we stupidly handed over money to have some youngsters pull us behind the boat as we sat side by side on an inflatable dingy thing. I was not 100% sure I wasn't going to die while out there, gripping the handles and bracing with my legs as I fought to stop myself from crashing into the sea as we bashed and bumped our way through the surf. It was nice enough when they slowed down and went straight but mostly, it was hellish. Afterwards our arms ached and shook and even now, there's pain in many parts as I recover from that self inflicted ordeal. At least, I forgot my troubles utterly while it was happening as I focused only on the path of sea in front of me. I returned to my family, a bit sorer, more freckled, but relaxed and ready to work. They'd all had a lovely time without me. They'd been for long bike ride on one of the days and Gordon enjoyed spending more time with the children than usual. I'll be happy to get back into our normal life groove and hope to do more blog reading and writing again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/09/summer-ends.html", "title": "\nSummer Ends\n"},

{"date": "9 Sep 2009", "body": "\nWe had a sporty weekend. Thomas and Lady had their jujitsu class after which Lady tried out to join the new competition squad set up by her cheerleading group. Thomas and I watched and she was great. Afterwards one of the coaches I didn't know asked if she'd like to join 2 other squad classes, in tumbling and acrobatics. Hell yeah! She is so keen on her gymnastics and has for ages been hoping that a time may come when she could join a squad. She is very happy and I am proud of her. She will be doing over 7 hours a week of gymnastics and would happily do twice that. Flipping ace! Gordon got bike racks for the car so we can fit all 5 bikes on and head off to various cycle start points. After lunch we drove to Comber and rode the  Greenway into Belfast . It was a beautiful day and there were plenty of other people using the path, causing me to repeat the instruction \"keep left\" many times, along with old favourites like \"slow down Duncan!\" and \"be careful, don't bump into the people/dog/child\" as needed. There are few spots where the cycle path crosses a road so I had to be aware and make sure the boy didn't just ride on out without looking. It went well though. We did have to divert off the path to buy drinks for thirsty children as I'd left our own bottles in the car. But we made it all the way to Belfast. Our final destination was McD's in a shopping centre. Duncan made another diversion into an electronics shop where he'd previously spied a Sonic PC game. The child never forgets. I allowed him to buy it and then we had to get to the (ahem) restaurant. Gordon and Thomas had gone on ahead (loo emergency) and I couldn't see where to go. Thankfully the curly haired sat nav that is Duncan took the lead. There was a hairy moment when he rode in front of a car pulling out of the carpark, thankfully it was going very slowly but it made me scared for a while and I stuck even closer to him. We all went in, ordered and ate. Duncan sat and had burger and chips, interspersed with mouth fulls of ice-cream. It was, to use behaviourist speak, very good sitting. Clearly getting him well tired out is the key to family dining in public. He got a bit fed up by the end and shouted a little about something or other, certainly nothing too unusual given the generally high screaming child background noise of our location, but two girls in the booth next to us seemed to find it, to use Thomas's favourite word, fascinating and stared constantly. The journey back was even easier as there were fewer people on the path. Lady and Thomas were marvellous as always, just got on and had fun. Duncan and I were last back. He was very pleased with himself, telling me that he was the fastest, the strongest and the proudest boy on the bike path! It was all very nice, but my backend hurt! Next day I was lackadaisically lolling around as is my right on a Sunday when I remembered Lady's acrobatics class. We dashed off in the car, as fast as possible when the car was laden with bikes, and drove to the gymnastics hall. Sadly silly me hadn't looked at the timetable properly and I was at the wrong place. Lady was nervous about the new class and stressed at being so late. We got to the right place and she didn't want to go in at first but thankfully she changed her mind and really enjoyed the more advanced class. I am delighted that she has such a strong interest in a sport and that her persistence and effort is paying off. As I write, Thomas is practising the splits on my bed wearing his band new leotard and shorts combo and he looks so adorable. He had a haircut on Saturday, had to be done since he'd tried the DIY approach and now it's really short. It suits him though. His gymnastics class is on this afternoon, and after that, Lady's first tumbling class. I'm going to be doing even more mum-taxi jobs than before. It's a good job I don't have the school runs to cope with also or I'd have to move into the car full time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sustrans-near-you/northern-ireland-and-the-republic-of-ireland/current-projects-in-northern-ireland-and-the-republic-of-ireland/the-comber-greenway"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/09/flipping-and-cycling.html", "title": "\nFlipping and cycling\n"},

We celebrated with a party, friends, a clown boucy castle, copious quantities of junk food, party poppers and two home made cakes. Best of all, her BFF (best friend forever for those who don't speak Girl) and her sister came over from London for a few days with their mum. It's been 2 years since they last visited so we were very happy to have them over again. The girls had a few hours to reconnect, then the rest of the party people arrived. It turned out to be a grand day, fine weather, great company, lovely gifts (thanks all!) and a bunch of happy sweet children running about keeping themselves busy. Some of us went for a walk to the beach that evening. The girls played on the beach taking a heck of a long time to leave when I was ready to go home. Eventually they appeared, muck to the eyeballs, having climbed about the rock pools and grass and fallen into what Lady dramatically called \"a trench.\" The following day, I drove Lady, her friends and their mum to Delamont Park, a favourite of ours. The children went on the miniature railway then did their thing in the adventure playground while we mums drank a warm, brown drink we'd been told was coffee. Then we walked about a bit, enjoyed the scenery, took photos by the lake then watched as the clouds lowered to eclipse the view and we went back to the car, damp and hungry. Then off to Downpatrick where we had lunch in the St Patrick's Visitor centre. The girls ran about the garden for a while then browsed the shop but we didn't bother with the exhibits. I'd never taken the  ferry from Strangford to Portaferry  so took a detour that way. Then, not altogether on purpose, I drove up the east side of the Ards Peninsula, where the nice views were sadly spoiled by a glut of flags in many of the villages. These places could be so much more welcoming to visitors like my friends, places we'd want to stop off in, if more of the residents could see themselves as outsiders might. Our visitors had to go home the next morning. It had been just lovely to have them over.

{"date": "10 Aug 2009", "body": "\nThe questionnaire on autism blogs  I wrote about earlier  (and if you can, offer to complete one yourself) made me think about something I take entirely for granted in my life, the many and varied autism blogs I read. I was asked to rate how helpful I have found such blogs as a source of information and support in raising an autistic child. I had to answer truthfully that the blogs I  read have made a tremendous difference to my life and my knowledge of autism and how to best raise my son. I have never thanked all of you who write these blogs. You write fantastically well, thoughtful and thought provokingly. You explain, challenge, advise, illustrate, unearth, advocate and amuse. I have had many of my thought processes utterly revolutionised by your words. The changes didn't stop with my attitude to autism and disability, I began to think and learn more about all sorts of societal privileges and assumptions on the value of life. By following your work on promoting good standards of science and the ways in which quackery has become embedded in autism discourse, both in causation theories and in the treatments offered, I have thought more about evidence, ethics, and the scientific process than I did in 6 years of formal scientific education at universities. The first autism blog I remember reading was  Left Brain/Right Brain . It was started by Kevin Leitch and was an amazing resource. It still is, and now it has evolved to a group blog with several excellent writers offering up regular posts on autism research, the rise in dangerous autism quackery, the legal tussles and advocating for rights and accommodations. I soon came across Amanda Baggs awesome writings on  Ballastexistenz  and the sparkling wit and elegant prose of the much missed  Autism Diva . She might not be writing these days, but her blog is still a fantastic resource to dig into. Obviously I can't discuss fantastic autism blogging without mentioning the women who share an enviable ability to dissect mountains of data and writings and do a great job of keeping in check the people who claim to know what they're talking about when they really demonstrably don't, autism researcher  Michelle Dawson  and super librarian and  \"mere  mother ... and housewife\"  Kathleen Seidel . I could go on for pages but will limit this to just a few more of the people who have made the biggest difference to my own life. Bev who blogs at  Asperger Square 8  is someone I have praised many times for her pictures that say so much so clearly and simply, and who has recently added a few wonderful  videos  to her site. Kristina Chew has been blogging for years about her son and regularly offers her educated and insightful assessment the latest autism story in the media. She now blogs at  change.org with Dora Raymaker . Orac from  Respectful Insolence  often blogs about autism quackery, in particular the vaccine causation nonsense and the dangerous quack treatments sold to vulnerable parents by charlatans only interested in the profit margin. I think however, Orac would much prefer it if he never had to write another autism post ever again. My new favourite blog is  The Gonzolog  which combines all the things that make blogs great; intelligence, passion, humour and well argued opinions. Finally, 3 men writing blogs I love to read; Ed at  The Standard Review , Mike Stanton's  Action for Autism  and Steve's  One Dad's Opinion . Heck, all the autism blogs listed on my sidebar are bloody brilliant and I can't eulogise all of them. I wrote on the questionnaire that one of my aims for my blog and that of my blogging friends who have autism and/or parent autistic people, is to confront the ignorance and misinformation that is so prevalent abut autism. This is discriminatory and unfair on people like my son so I hope to show that having a child with autism does not mean the end of a happy family life, and that he can learn and grow without any bogus therapy. I am also intent on challenging the spread of quackery that abounds in autism. I said that blogging is  useful publishing platform that anyone with an internet connection can access, so it's a great way of reading the thoughts of ordinary people around the world, and of connecting with professionals. Once you figure out who talks sense and who is full of hot air and worse, then it's a great way to connect. However, I forgot to mention the toxic posts of the people who promote the quackery whole heartedly, the damage they do to individual children whose parents follow their advice and inflict the unproven treatments on them as well as the negative and skewed portrayal of autism they promote.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/07/autistic-awareness-empathy.html", "http://autism.change.org/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/", "http://gonzogalore.blogspot.com/", "http://diversityrules.typepad.com/my_weblog/", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/awesome-autism-blogs.html", "title": "\nAwesome Autism Blogs\n"},
{"date": "4 Aug 2009", "body": "\nOne of the most prevalent unsubstantiated claims about autism (after the \"lack of empathy\" myth) is the idea that autistic children have more gut problems than non-autistic children. This notion was fed by the now debunked 1998 article by Andrew Wakefield who claimed to have discovered a new disorder he called  autistic enterocolitis , a condition  not recognised by scientists . I have read countless times, parental tales of woe about their autistic children's constipation. yeasty poos, diarrhoea, and all sorts of bowel problems. No doubt, many of these are real, but reporting is rather self selecting. Most parents whose autistic children have no gut issues don't make as much noise. Moreover, constipation etc is  common in all children . In the past week, 2 scientific studies have been published that cast doubt on the validity of the autism gut connection. These are  ably discussed on LB/RB . The first study  compared the stool patterns of autistic children and non-autistic children   and concluded,  \"During the first 42 months of life,  ASD  children had a stool pattern that was very similar to that of other children, apart from a slight increase in stool frequency at 30 and 42 months. There were no symptoms to support the hypothesis that  ASD  children had enterocolitis.\" The second study examined the incidence of gastrointestinal problems in autistic children. It concluded,  \"No significant associations were found between autism case status and overall incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms or any other gastrointestinal symptom category.\"  and  \"As constipation and feeding issues/food selectivity often have a behavioral etiology, data suggest that a neurobehavioral rather than a primary organic gastrointestinal etiology may account for the higher incidence of these gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism.\" So, according to this, autistic children are only as likely as non-autistic children to have gut problems. The doctor who led the second study,  Dr Samar H. Ibrahim, a pediatric gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic, has also  criticised the common wheat-free/dairy-free diets  autistic children are placed on despite having had no appropriate diagnostic tests.  \"There is actually no trial that has proven so far that a gluten-free and casein-free diet improves autism. The diets are not easy to follow and can sometimes cause nutritional deficiencies.\" She also made an astonishing, welcome yet sadly uncommon  call  for standards and ethics in autism . \"Patients with autism should be investigated the same way as normal patients when they have GI symptoms. And doctors should do a thorough investigation before labeling them with any GI disorder because the overall incidence of any GI disorder did not differ from that of the overall population.\" Dr. Patricia Manning-Courtney (medical director of a Center for Autism Spectrum Disorder in Cincinnati) said,  \"For me, this study lends support to the recommendation I make to a lot of families that there is no evidence to support restricted diets. They're dangerous and risky. You have to think long and hard before you, as a parent, make that choice.\" When Duncan was diagnosed, talk of the GF/CF diet was all the rage on the autism lists and websites I perused. Most of the UK sites referenced Paul Shattock, a pharmacist who over 17 years ago, claimed that opioid peptides were associated with autism. However he has never published his evidence for this idea. Other studies have disputed his findings, like  this paper  which shows no correlation between IAG and autism. For some children, restrictive diets may help, but I agree with the doctors quoted above, get some real medical advice first. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_enterocolitis", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17257133", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/constipation-in-children/DS01138", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2652", "http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/94/7/497?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=autism&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=date&resourcetype=HWCIT", "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/health/28autism.html?_r=1", "http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/07/27/with-autism-diet-restrictions-may-do-more-harm.html?PageNr=2", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15739724&ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/autism-gut-question.html", "title": "\nThe Autism Gut Question\n"},
{"date": "6 Aug 2009", "body": "\nDuncan and I took his brother and sister to summer scheme. He asked to look in the charity shop and being in no hurry, I parked the car and off we went. Well talk about hitting pay dirt. Someone must have cleared their book shelves and dropped the boxes off very recently. There were a good few children's book spilling out so I asked if I could dig through the lot and the man working there, a good guy as I've learned from previous visits, said to work away. So we plonked ourselves on the floor and shifted through the boxes. Duncan made a little pile of those he was interested in and I made a huge pile of my own. Then ecstasy, we found 3 Thomas the Tank Buzz books, Duncan's absolute favourites. I hauled the booty to the pay desk and told the man I'd probably need to nip over to the ATM as I didn't think the \u00a310 note in my purse would cover it. He asked me for a fiver. No way, I said, take a tenner for all those. Nah, said he, give me \u00a35 and tell all your friends to come over and look through our stuff. So off you go to to your local  Action Cancer  shop. They are the  best . Here's what I bought: 2 Mister Men books 3 Thomas the Tank Buzz books 2 children's videos Winnie the Pooh Ladybird book Alexandre Dumas- The Three Musketeers The Usborne Internet Linked Science Encyclopedia (beautiful colour hardback) James Joyce - 3 novel hardback Robert Graves- Greek Myths Anthony Burgess- A Clockwork Orange Teach Yourself Irish Marcel Proust -Remembrance of Things Past Anita Shreve- The Pilot's Wife Ian Rankin - A Question of Blood (I love me some Rebus.) Minette Walters- Fox Evil Kazuo Ishiguro- The Unconsoled The Oxford Library of English Poetry Vols II and III Francosi Mauriac - The Knot of Vampires Leo Tolstoy- Anna Karenina Sylvia Plath- The Bell Jar How fantastic is that? I don't think I've read any of these before. Duncan was so grateful, telling the man \"thank you very much\" and on we went to the pet shop to buy a new run for the guinea pigs. We passed the indoor play centre and he asked to go in. Again, feeling very spontaneous, I consented. We were the first people there. For a while after it was just Duncan and a younger boy, then a large group of 6-10 year old boys arrived. I had to redirect Duncan from the area reserved for 1-3 year olds, as he liked the slide there best of all. He was a bit frightened of going up to the first level of the frame for children his age. But when the gang of children arrived he felt a bit braver and followed them up the ladder and had fun in that area. I stuck by him all the time, moving about to keep him in sight. When his play time was almost over, I witnessed him and another boy bump each other going up some steps. They each tried to pushed past the other a bit then I watched as the other boy raised his fist and punched Duncan hard on the forehead. I called out to him to quit, and asked Duncan to come to me. He was very upset. He fell into my arms, tears streaming. He shook and shouted and bit at my shoulders saying over and over he was sad, angry and a bad and horrible boy. I just held him and sympathised and agreed that he was angry and felt bad. We moved to the chairs and he had a drink of water and sat on my lap for a while crying. One of the staff checked he was OK, she'd seen the whole thing. One of the woman accompanying the group of boys, one of which was little master hit a lot, came over to say sorry too. A while later she brought the boy with her and he said sorry. Duncan just said sorry too. As we left the other staff member asked after Duncan. They had been very kind, oh yeah, they'd given me a free cup of tea earlier when I hadn't enough change to buy Duncan's bottle of water and my tea. In the end, Duncan had enjoyed himself prior to the incident and I think he will want to go back again some time. And the guinea pigs love their new run, they're popping (and pooping) all around while Pippi looks on greedily/curiously.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.actioncancer.org/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/08/loads-of-books-and-punch-to-head.html", "title": "\nLoads of books, and a punch to the head\n"},
{"date": "31 Jul 2009", "body": "\nMy Dad called around just after lunchtime. Lady and Thomas were at the leisure centre for summer scheme, so only myself and Duncan were at home. We decided to go for a walk after having a cup of tea, but there came an almighty shower of rain. Ach well, we thought, it's only rain. What do you expect in Ireland. I took a couple of raincoats for myself and Duncan, packed Pippi's poop pick up bags and off we went, 3 humans and a dog. Or rather, since Duncan was categorising his family members as either human or elf yesterday, one elf, two humans and a dog. Where we were . Despite the earlier rain, it was a beautiful, clear and sunny afternoon. Before long I was too hot to wear my raincoat so tied it and Duncan's about my waist. I should have taken a bag. I had intended to walk part of the way along the coast towards the next town and then turn home with Duncan while Dad carried on and got a train home. But Duncan was away ahead on his trusty (and rusty) scooter and had no intention of stopping. I had to jog a few times to reduce the gap between us and often was to heard roaring after him, \"DUNCAN, STOP! WAIT!\" no doubt to the delight of other walkers. I always announce our presence when we're out and about. It's a fair way to the town, taking an hour of fast walking to get there. Once there I lost sight of the boy for a while as it became more crowded and there were many more options of places he could go to. I ran to catch up (phew) and it turned out he was still tootling along merrily on the coastal path right to the town centre. He had a target in sight- the shop that sells half price ERTL Thomas the Tank trains. A well placed ice cream van impeded our progress for ten peaceful minutes. Then on to the shop which provided one pretty little Bluebell steam engine. They sell cuckoo clocks there too, except that instead of a bird, they each have a farm animal pop out. The staff recognise Duncan now and always set off the clocks for him to enjoy, which is kind. Dad waited outside with Pippi, who as usual attracted lots of positive attention. While she barks lots at anyone arriving at out house for the first  minutes they're here, she is always impeccably behaved when we go out. She sat and enjoyed the adulation and strokes. Then on to the park to wait a while until summer scheme finished. We were diverted again for a while to watch a breaker machine tearing up the road in massive chunks. Then I took Duncan into the library to use their facilities, he left his scooter very neatly against the bike rack. Then he raced off again to \"the green grove\", a rose covered walkway. Dad and I sat on a bench and watched him race about. He went into the play park for a while. I hovered nearby as usual, the park was full of younger children and I needed to be sure he was careful enough. He got on the roundabout with a little girl and pushed it around slowly until she got off then he sped that mother round like it was going to drill into the earth's core. He went on a see saw with a boy whose mum said they were over for the week and live in San Francisco (where Gordon is right now, and loving it!). She remarked that playgrounds here are rather more dangerous hence more fun that in the USA. By then we had to go to meet the others. Duncan was fading a bit, finally all that exercise was taking a toll. We reached the leisure centre and walked to the train station. I was told that I couldn't take Pippi on without a carrier. Nooo! I was knackered by then and didn't relish the idea of walking home. The inspector went to ask the train's guard if he'd allow a one-off exception and thanks be, he said yes, so long as Pips didn't go on the seats. No problem there, I just held her on my lap. I will buy some sort of light collapsible carrier for future use. We said bye to Dad on the train as he carried on the his house. Home again at last, and time to get the dinner on.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SnK73p63nxI/AAAAAAAAA54/n32AQ20iKNQ/s1600-h/beach.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/scooting-all-way.html", "title": "\nScooting all the way\n"},
{"date": "29 Jul 2009", "body": "\n Many bloggers today  are reprinting a slightly altered version of the article on chiropractic  Simon Singh wrote for The Guardian . Unlike scientists who defend their claims by discussion in the scientific media, the  British Chiropractic Association  (BCA) used the method so beloved of practitioners of non evidence based medicine, and sued Simon Singh for libel. There's nothing the alties like so much as a spot of legal chill. Like  all  forms of woo,  chiropractic is said  to  cure/treat autism . Quentin Wilson says it cured his autistic son and he used to be on the telly talking about cars so he should know. His anecdote  is used by this UK chiropractic clinic  as some sort of evidence of effectiveness. Chiropractic is one type of woo that has before now, seemed to avoid close inspection from the  DCs  of the world who excel in exposing pseudoscience, as it seemed more scientific, or at least, sciencey. But the decision of the BCA to apply legal muscle to silence reasonable critique has only drawn lots of people  to focus attention on their practices and positions . They are  not enjoying the scrutiny . Simon Singh wrote a decent, informative article and it'd do no harm for more people to read it. If you agree that the law has no place in scientific disputes, please add  your name to the statement . ----------------------------------------------------- Beware the spinal trap          Some practitioners claim it is a cure-all, but the research suggests chiropractic therapy has mixed results - and can even be lethal, says  Simon Singh .                You might be surprised to know that the founder of chiropractic therapy, Daniel David Palmer, wrote that '99% of all diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae'. In the 1860s, Palmer began to develop his theory that the spine was involved in almost every illness because the spinal cord connects the brain to the rest of the body. Therefore any misalignment could cause a problem in distant parts of the body.    In fact, Palmer's first chiropractic intervention supposedly cured a man who had been profoundly deaf for 17 years. His second treatment was equally strange, because he claimed that he treated a patient with heart trouble by correcting a displaced vertebra.    You might think that modern chiropractors restrict themselves to treating back problems, but in fact some still possess quite wacky ideas. The fundamentalists argue that they can cure anything, including helping treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying - even though there is not a jot of evidence.     I can confidently label these assertions as utter nonsense because I have co-authored a book about alternative medicine with the world's first professor of complementary medicine, Edzard Ernst. He learned chiropractic techniques himself and used them as a doctor. This is when he began to see the need for some critical evaluation. Among other projects, he examined the evidence from 70 trials exploring the benefits of chiropractic therapy in conditions unrelated to the back. He found no evidence to suggest that chiropractors could treat any such conditions.    But what about chiropractic in the context of treating back problems? Manipulating the spine can cure some problems, but results are mixed. To be fair, conventional approaches, such as physiotherapy, also struggle to treat back problems with any consistency. Nevertheless, conventional therapy is still preferable because of the serious dangers associated with chiropractic.    In 2001, a systematic review of five studies revealed that roughly half of all chiropractic patients experience temporary adverse effects, such as pain, numbness, stiffness, dizziness and headaches. These are relatively minor effects, but the frequency is very high, and this has to be weighed against the limited benefit offered by chiropractors.    More worryingly, the hallmark technique of the chiropractor, known as high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust, carries much more significant risks. This involves pushing joints beyond their natural range of motion by applying a short, sharp force. Although this is a safe procedure for most patients, others can suffer dislocations and fractures.    Worse still, manipulation of the neck can damage the vertebral arteries, which supply blood to the brain. So-called vertebral dissection can ultimately cut off the blood supply, which in turn can lead to a stroke and even death. Because there is usually a delay between the vertebral dissection and the blockage of blood to the brain, the link between chiropractic and strokes went unnoticed for many years. Recently, however, it has been possible to identify cases where spinal manipulation has certainly been the cause of vertebral dissection.    Laurie Mathiason was a 20-year-old Canadian waitress who visited a chiropractor 21 times between 1997 and 1998 to relieve her low-back pain. On her penultimate visit she complained of stiffness in her neck. That evening she began dropping plates at the restaurant, so she returned to the chiropractor. As the chiropractor manipulated her neck, Mathiason began to cry, her eyes started to roll, she foamed at the mouth and her body began to convulse. She was rushed to hospital, slipped into a coma and died three days later. At the inquest, the coroner declared: 'Laurie died of a ruptured vertebral artery, which occurred in association with a chiropractic manipulation of the neck.'    This case is not unique. In Canada alone there have been several other women who have died after receiving chiropractic therapy, and Edzard Ernst has identified about 700 cases of serious complications among the medical literature. This should be a major concern for health officials, particularly as under-reporting will mean that the actual number of cases is much higher. If spinal manipulation were a drug with such serious adverse effects and so little demonstrable benefit, then it would almost certainly have been taken off the market.    Simon Singh  is a science writer in London and the co-author, with Edzard Ernst, of  Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial . This is an edited version of an article published in  The Guardian  for which Singh is being personally sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380", "http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333/", "http://www.chiropractic-uk.co.uk/default.aspx?m=1&mi=1", "http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/freedebate", "http://www.chiropracticresearch.org/NEWS_role_of_chiropractic_in_the_care.htm", "http://www.jvsr.com/abstracts/index.asp?id=264", "http://www.newcastle-gateshead-durham-family-chiropractor.com/chiropractic-and-adhd.html", "http://www.dcscience.net/", "http://layscience.net/node/598", "http://evidencematters.org/2009/06/10/chiropractors-accuse-critics-of-witch-hunt-for-examining-evidence/", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/chiropractors-told-to-take-down-their.html", "http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/334"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/simon-singhs-chiropractic-article.html", "title": "\nSimon Singh's chiropractic article: \u201cBeware the spinal trap\u201d\n"},
{"date": "27 Jul 2009", "body": "\nThe first week of summer scheme was a great success. Thomas informed me that it was excellent and that he didn't even know he'd make some new best friends. He's especially keen on a boy whom he likes because he's kind, funny and thinks Thomas is funny too. I thought those particularly good qualities to look for in a friend. Lady told me that Thomas is hanging out with a few other boys his age who run around saying, \"uh oh, spaghetti-o!\" which is Thomas' new catch phrase. There are worse things he could have taught them! His other new thing is to describe everything, deadpan style as, \"fascinating.\" I don't know where he gets these things. Lady has joined a group of pals all into sporty stuff. She loved the swimming, badminton and gymnastics best. I'm happy that they're both enjoying it. Duncan and I had 3 quiet days together. We did a few tasks in town, chilled out at home, cooked chicken, printed out more pages for his Thomas the Tank books and went for lovely walks in the forest with Pippi dog. We also went to see the paediatrician and unlike the last time ( hellish ) it all went so well. The paediatrician wanted to review his progress since starting the medication. However he only took it for a month to no discernible effect. I thought about increasing the dose, after discussing that option on the phone with his doctor, but instead decided to stop giving it to him. By then the weather was better and we've been outside a lot more which helps him burn off his pent up energy and like all of us, he's happier when it's nicer outside. He found a Thomas the Tank book in the waiting room so spent his time in the doctor's office avidly looking through it, reading out little lines now and then. I was so much more aware than ever before of talking about him in front of him, and trying to save his potential embarrassment. He was listening carefully even though he appeared not to and told me \"that's enough\" when I told some anecdote or other. We went to the funfair for a while on Saturday while Lady had her cheer leading class. I took Thomas on the waltzer. Sweet mother, never before have I experienced a ride so fast. It went on for ages, kept slowing down giving me a false sense of relief that it was finally over, only to speed up again. It was like some sort of metaphor for life. Thomas was shaking when we alighted, but got his nerve up enough to sit by Gordon on the bumper cars while I accompanied Duncan. He \"helped\" me steer and we'd a great laugh. It was the only ride he wanted to go on, he just watched the rest. On Sunday morning Duncan asked me to take him and Pippi for a walk. He specifically requested that the rest of the family not come! We walked for a couple of miles in the forest park and out near the shop. I had no money with me and he was content to just walk past and not go in. It was really nice. He took his scooter and was a little way in front of me. He pushed the scooter up one especially steep and bumpy hill saying as he went, \"this is very hard work. Will I  ever  see the top!\" Then nearing the road he took Pippi's lead and I carried the scooter. She kept digging in her heels and looking back to see where I was which limited his ability and desire to race off. Later, Gordon's mum came over to babysit while he and I went shopping for clothes he needed. He's off to San Fransisco on Wednesday for a week long conference so he's got to look sharp. I'm well used to being the only adult about. But perhaps some time soon I'll get to switch the roles, at least occasionally.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/notes-from-week.html", "title": "\nNotes from the week\n"},
{"date": "23 Jul 2009", "body": "\nI am so sick of this. There are some people who choose publicise their feeling of rage, hate and shock at having given birth to autistic children. On  Gonzo's blog  I read about one woman's horrible bile-filled blog post about her daughter. This child is 8 years old. Her mum describes her as \"recovered from autism\" whatever that means. But this girl still causes her mum  so much pain  because  she just isn't how she's supposed to be  (link broken deliberately). The mother complains that her daughter isn't into dolls and make up, but prefers to goof about, play computer games or ride a scooter. I mean, how dare the child resist the gender role assigned to her. If she doesn't start with the make up by 8 she'll never know how to apply liquid liner properly. But mum has more to say. She is jealous of the parents whose children have  cancer ! She wanted to punch her cousin in the face for sympathising about another cousin's child going through surgery, because her troubles were bigger; \"my [recovered] daughter's MIND, HEALTH and LIFE\u2019S POTENTIAL were stolen and I\u2019ve had to figure out how to pay for them and get them back on my own! Don\u2019t fucking talk to me about surgery! Where was my basket of cookies and flowers, Sorry about the Autism, Get Well Soon? Oh yeah, didn\u2019t get one.\" It's not good enough. It can't be right to get off on vitriolic hate speech about your own child like that. Then this morning at  Cat in a Dog's World  I read that that  Mummy venting  had struck again. In a New York Times blog, a woman with a son with Asperger's felt free to tell the world how rotten her life is because of the way her son behaves. She blames all of this on his autism. Does she think this venting will make her life better? Does she think her portrayal of what is titled \"the unvarnished reality of autism\" will increase understanding of autism and autistic people or will it, as I suspect, make the public ever more fearful of those with an atypical cognitive phenotype? Some of what she describes is society's reaction to her son. I face the scowls when I'm out with Duncan too but that's not his problem but that of the mean ninnies who judge him and me. She even says, \"my son has been doing much better lately\" but still tells her tale of woe as if it's all still happening. I cannot say that her son is not as hard to live with as she says, but there are lots of children who are not autistic who are bloody hard work too. Choosing to become a parent means you have to expect the unexpected. Autism, or any disability, doesn't necessarily have to bring pain and suffering to parents. Different people react in different ways to difficult situations. While I am stressed and upset at times by things I must deal with, some of them related to my son's autism and some not, I don't see my life as a litany of horror. I get over it and keep going as best I can. What she describes is NOT the unvarnished reality of autism, it's just how she chooses to characterise it. I also disagree with the implication, by \"it's time to stop mincing words\" that until now, no one was telling about how horrid autism really is. That's nonsense. There are  newspaper articles  nearly every week by parents and siblings venting about how terrible the autism is and how it's ruined their lives. We have children's charities depicting autism as a monster. Massive USA autism organisation  Autism Speaks  released a staged film a few years ago which was all about how haaard life is for women with autistic offspring. Quack cures are featured on health pages, along with pictures of grim faced parents describing that they just had to try the calcium stripping chelation drugs/chemical castration drugs/homoeopathy/shaman therapy/exorcism/chiropractic manipulation because life was too awful before. Loads of books have been published giving insight into the \"real and raw\" suffering of these parents. How the hell can any of these people claim that they need to speak out and share their pain as if it's not been told of hundreds of  times in very public places before? And aside from how this affects the perception of autism in society, how do you think all this gross negativity affects the people being described? What will my son feel when he's old enough to understand the depth of hate that exists towards people like him? Oh this is something I fear. Sarah expressed carefully and with compassion, her feelings on the New York Times blog post. Her  letter was published . It's wonderful. But I feel like giving up when I read the comments on what she had to say. Over and over again people are disparaging autistic people in the harshest terms, accusing them of lacking empathy because they express hurt when someone writes about how they destroy normal people's lives. I still feel shock at the hate filled garbage thrown at Sarah for daring to write. She is damned as not autistic enough to comment, as mentally ill, as complaining over nothing. It's a box ticking exercise in seeing how privileged groups diminish the voices of marginalised people. Edited to add,  Bev has a typically marvelous post up  on all this and  Sarah has responded to the commenters . I have yet to read it, but I look forward to her annihilation of their ill formed arguments.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://gonzogalore.blogspot.com/2009/07/insane-parent-syndrome.html", "hxxp://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/autism-perception-a-bump-in-the-road.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SmjNbwcYtrI/AAAAAAAAA4M/7_3Ox9I-OEg/s1600-h/big_make-face-angry.jpg", "http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2009/07/new-york-times-parenting-blog.html", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/the-unvarnished-reality-of-autism/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/autism-from-the-inside-looking-out/", "http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/blogspot/ZooX/%7E3/2zoCXQHTTEg/i-repeat-myself.html", "http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/2009/07/responding-to-responses.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/im-mummy-and-ill-vent-if-i-want-to.html", "title": "\nI'm a Mummy and I'll vent if I want to\n"},
{"date": "21 Jul 2009", "body": "\nLady and Thomas start summer scheme today. It lasts all day from 9 to 5. Thomas has never done anything like this before and was a little nervous but excited. I arrived a bit early to sign them in. There were quite a few families gathered, and since it was raining hard, everyone was milling around indoors instead of lining up outside. Duncan was, I think, overwhelmed by the crowd and started running around and shouted a bit. I scooped him up in my arms since I had to talk to a staff member. I asked if I could sign my children in quickly as their brother is autistic and finds the wait difficult. Duncan was kindly providing evidence of my statement. The staff member agreed and went to fetch a pen. When the staff sat to tick off names I sidled up to sort out Thomas and Lady. That done, I heard a woman behind me complain loudly that \"some people are so rude\" and something about \"pushing children.\" I turned, with Duncan still in my arms and asked if she was talking about me. She said yes, and that I'd pushed past people. I explained that my child is autistic and I'd been given permission to sign my other children in quickly. She said, \"well, but you pushed my daughter and didn't even say sorry.\" I really don't think I pushed anyone, but perhaps Duncan in my arms had brushed the child without my noticing. Anyway I apologised to the girl who was about Lady's age, and said I hadn't meant to push her. The mum moaned a bit more but I didn't hear what she said. I looked at her, exasperated and said, \"Do you know what it's like?!\" She said no, and I left to say bye to Thomas and Lady. They had been standing apart from me in silence the whole time. I am not sure if they were just letting me get on with sorting things out, or if they were a bit concerned by my or Duncan's stress, or if they were embarrassed at all. But they smiled and took their swim bags and packed lunches to the hall to join the fun. Walking out to the car I though about the encounter and what I'd said. I know I needed to get that accommodation for Duncan and that others could see it as unfair. I suppose it's the same at theme parks etc. when I get a pass to allow him to go on attractions more quickly and some mutter about queue jumping. I was concerned that my response was less than optimal. My last statement could be read as rather \"poor me\" when what I meant was, do you know what it's like to have to deal with people like you, not, do you know what it's like to have such a tragic life!

{"date": "20 Jul 2009", "body": "\nMy brother and I swapped offspring for the weekend. I drove a car load of children west to his place on Friday, leaving for home a few hours later without Thomas, who was staying with his favourite male cousin C. and with an extra girl, my 12 year old niece A. A. is big into animals. There's nothing she likes better than to go hoking in the great outdoors for critters. Unsurprisingly Pippi was a big hit with her. The girls chatted until late, then awoke very early next morning. By 6am they were outside on the trampoline. I didn't mind, they're both big enough to get their own breakfast and I let them know I'd be getting a couple more hours of sleep myself. They went for walks, and took the train into town unaccompanied. They visited the funfair and Lady returned with an outfit she's bought with the money I'd given them. She was starving though having chosen clothes over lunch. They walked to the beach and chatted and chatted. Next morning I took them to see Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. We'd already seen it on the day of release but went again as A. was keen to see it too. I enjoyed it more 2nd time around as I wasn't so caught up in seeing how they'd translate the book, and enjoying it more on it's own merits as a film. The girls laughed a lot and A. was sobbing her little heart out at the end. Bless! Lady doesn't cry at films, she can't get too moved by what's not real. She doesn't take after her mum in that; I get all choked up for the silliest thing. Lady explained to me once that she doesn't get upset by scary scenes either as she just imagines all the film crew just outside the action. So much logic... We dined at Ikea then they were off again, to the swimming pool. Their grandparents came over for a visit in the afternoon and we had a lovely few hours together. Duncan didn't want them to go home, \"don't leave me!\" he pleaded with his hands plaintively at his face. It was clearly something he'd seen on film! Today my brother and his family all arrived here with Thomas. We had lunch and baby E. bum shuffled all over. She too was delighted with Pippi. She had a good ould poke and stroke at the dog, who was, after she got her traditional loud barking greeting out of the way, remarkably well behaved and tolerant. All the same, I watched her closely. Thomas is just having a nice bath. He doesn't like to bathe in other people's houses. He had been a big hit with everyone, though they think he's really funny with his serious nature and forthright views. He ate everything he was given but announced that he preferred the food at home (in fact, he said he likes his Dad's cooking best. Humph.) On being asked in the shop if he wanted donuts, he said, \"oh yes. They're my favourite type of junk food.\" It was an untypical response. But he's so very like his dad, a little professor type. And I know how that can read. Perhaps he does have a few  BAPs.  I think we all do in this family. We're a happy, bappy lot.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://steadyandslow.blogspot.com/2007/06/broader-autism-phenotype-bap.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/child-swap.html", "title": "\nChild swap\n"},

It's for a clinic in Wexford claim to specialise in the \"leading childhood epidemics of our time: Autism, ADD/ADHD, Asthma and other allergies.\" Clearly these are all conditions in which homeopathy has been shown to have no effect whatsoever. But then this form of \"medicine\"  has  been shown  to help many who have  \"a vague sense of unease or a touch of the nerves or even just more money than sense\" then the homeopaths will be \"there for them with a bottle of basically just water on one hand and a huge invoice in the other.\" It's rather spooky that I learn of the existence of this clinic claiming to be able to heal the body of autistic children and hence their minds (gak) on the same day I  read  of the  closure of a USA clinic  promising much the same kind of quack nonsense and similarly intent on fleecing the well meaning parents of disabled and sick children. The quacks just love to get a bit of that autism pie.  Br\u00fcno  knows that autism is \"in\" now, but not because its funny, but because it's a great money spinner for people with all sorts of agendas. The good folk at Homeopathy Ireland have a post up detailing their  philosophy of autism . I've left a comment which has to be approved and which I'll repeat here. Autism rates are not increasing. Changing diagnostic criteria, broadening of the autism concept, diagnostic substitution, improved services and awareness have all contributed to a  perceived  increase.   There is no evidence that autistic children have been successfully treated biomedically, and absolutely zero evidence of homeopathy having any kind of benefit in autism or any other non self limiting condition.    \u201cHere, at Homeopathy Ireland we believe that vaccination injury among other variables play a part in autism.\u201d Your scaremongering about vaccines is not backed by any evidence either, some parents may have a \u201cbelief\u201d that vaccines damaged their children but that is not enough. Do you at homeopathy Ireland welcome increased numbers of children suffering the ill effects of preventable infectious diseases also?   Where are these \u201cStudies [that] have shown that 80% of these children have symptoms that suggest gastrointestinal disease\u201d?    Autism is not curable, certainly not with homeopathy/magic water. Autistic children can learn, develop and benefit from sensitive parenting and appropriate education.    \u201cBy healing the whole body; the source of the problem, we then heal the mind.\u201d Prove it.

{"date": "16 Jul 2009", "body": "\nDuncan just laid out the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, eggs and butter out on the kitchen work top. He then set out a bowl, measuring scales and a wooden spoon and requested that I help him prepare a chocolate cake. We have been making a small, reduced sugar confection that can be cooked quickly in the microwave and which he loves. I don't, but then, that's an advantage as I'm not so tempted to munch it down myself. Duncan's recent desire to eat chocolate cake stems from a clip of the film Matilda that he watches regularly. Duncan likes to eat his cake like the talented Bruce Bogtrotter, enjoys seeing chocolate sauce smeared over his face in the bathroom mirror and has even be known to hold his empty plate over his head when he's finished. He has also gained some useful new expressions thanks to Miss Trunchbull;  disgusting criminal, scrumptious  and  sweat and blood  being among his latest acquisitions. Last night I cooked some chicken. Duncan ate 3 pieces while watching a 2008 BBC Olympics promotion film Lady showed him recently. This is why. He wanted to see the chicken-eating pig while he himself ate his chicken. This happens often. Many of the food he eats in his (thankfully) forever expanding diet are items he was inspired to try after seeing them on a film. He eats corn on the cob, having seen it on Home on the Range. He eats spaghetti, thanks to Lady and the Tramp. Oxtail soup is a favourite because of Ratatouille, porridge came from various editions of Goldilocks and the 3 bears. He often sets the appropriate clip going as he eats the particular food it inspired. I must see if he'd enjoy Popeye. he could do with more greens.

{"date": "14 Jul 2009", "body": "\nWhile some of my country folk were marching up and down the streets of our cities and towns, we chose to head for the soft paths of the country park around the corner. It was warm and cloudy so I packed a bag full of light rain coats but we never needed them. Pippi came too, she adores the park with it's cornucopia of tantalising scents and trails. Duncan has been happy to walk when we go out now and doesn't want to sit in the buggy. Neither has he asked me to carry him for ages, thankfully for though he's fairly light and knows exactly how to snuggle his centre of gravity in to make the job of holding him easier, I prefer not to. On the way, we stopped off for a few minutes in the smaller hilly grove opposite the main park. Duncan has decided that the narrow paths through the trees are train tracks and the hill is \"Gordon's hill.\" He raced up it, pretending to be an engine, went all the way to a fork on the path (the \"branch line\") then ran back down the hill 3 times before we continued on our way. As we walked the main road into the park, we were passed by dozens of cars heading for the car park by the beach. We decided to avoid that section and stick to the prettier and more secluded forest walk. Duncan was about 40m ahead of the rest of us. We have been walking out together often recently and I have seen him develop a much greater awareness of traffic and how to check the road before crossing. It's not something he was able to learn from me breaking it all into little steps, he just had to learn for himself with me by his side asking him \"is it safe to cross?\" or some such and then shutting up and watching him make the judgement. I'd still not let him be ahead of me by much on a busy road or cross the street in town. But that too will come. So I was unconcerned even though he went out of sight for a few seconds as he turned a corner and as we came to where the paths diverged, a woman with her children was hovering, obviously checking that the child who's just passed her alone was being accompanied. She pointed to the path he'd taken and I thanked her and said, \"was he looking a bit lost and lonely?\" Her son answered, \"he was saying, \"I'm in trouble!\"\" I explained quickly that he was probably reciting lines from Thomas the Tank, that he's autistic and likes to tell himself stories as he goes. As we continued, Lady, whom I think loves the forest more than any of us, climbed leaf cluttered  banks and examined holes and in behind loose bark, with an excited little dog following her. Duncan was a bit concerned about Pippi running away when she was off lead, but he managed to tolerate it. Thomas is least fond of the forest, preferring the thrills of the playground. I told him that he can do all the balancing and climbing he wants in the forest instead. He wasn't convinced. But he was happy enough to walk and talk about the big questions of life, as he does. We put the lead back on the dog for Duncan to hold. It helped keep him closer to us as there were too many choices of path to take and we didn't want to loose him. He enjoyed running beside the burn (stream) with her. We rested by the waterfall for a while then headed out to the village and the shop where the children each chose a treat. Duncan also requested milk and a packet of porridge oats. Then to home, where the chicken casserole Gordon had prepared earlier was just ready.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/glorious-day.html", "title": "\nGlorious Day\n"},
{"date": "12 Jul 2009", "body": "\nDuncan loves Thomas the Tank Engine. Of all the book formats depicting the bold Thomas and his useful friends, his favourites are the slim hardback editions by the publishers Ladybird and Buzz books. He's been trying to collect the full quota of these books over the years, and since they're no longer being produced new, we have to buy them second hand via charity shops and internet shops or they're received as gifts from friends whose own children no longer want them. Recently he discovered a series of YouTube films from an obviously similarly dedicated fan, who has shown pictures from the books with audio from the Thomas and Friends TV series. Duncan has taken lots of screen shots of these and then adapted them with other images and even his own text, then printed these out on our old monochrome printer, coloured them in and stuck the pages together to create his own books. Here are some of the images he made. This is his version of the back inside cover, listing some of the other titles in the series. It even has a bar code. These are some of the inside pages that he has adapted with his own version of the text and his preferred choice of pictures. It reads,  \"prentley he herd a whistle gordon was verry cros insted of nise ching coashes but the others not help out he was a lot of thery dirty trucks a goods train a goods train he grumbled the sham muddy all the shame mud edward laghted\" The actual text is something like (from memory) Presently he heard a whistle. Gordon was very cross. Instead of nice shiny coaches he was pulling a lot of very dirty trucks. \"A goods train, a goods train!\" he grumbled, \"the same of it, oh the shame of it!\" Edward laughed. I can see a few places where he has misheard the words and tried to fill in as best he can with alternative words. I like the use of \"the shame muddy\" for \"the shame of it\"! The spelling is interesting too. He's managed to spell some difficult words properly and has made some good approximations for the rest. I asked him to read out for me and told him the correct words for the ones he mixed up, but he's so contrary he insisted on his own version. I reckon he probably did hear what I said but just didn't want to lose face by admitting he had heard it wrong. Here's another of his self typed pages. Though the story is about Gordon it's illustrated with pictures of Thomas, one of them taken from his  Train Simulator  program. I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation even if I'm too blinkered to see it. It reads: \"hurry hurry puffed gordon to the coashes now all he gon to fast gordon gruned at the coashes az thay rech the top of the hill.\" I don't think that needs any translation from me. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Slm4-KvR2gI/AAAAAAAAA2U/r76OhFls-Pg/s1600-h/thomas+buzz.gif", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Slm432tPKbI/AAAAAAAAA2M/9QQdF749Ifs/s1600-h/thomas+ladybird._SS500_.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Slm9Fx4eymI/AAAAAAAAA2s/R1OFATBdY7Y/s1600-h/book+5parts.bmp", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Slm9-DoJEJI/AAAAAAAAA3M/GOazexARZUI/s1600-h/edward+helps+out.bmp", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Slm9eAaa9fI/AAAAAAAAA28/A3g5CJOKLNM/s1600-h/Edward+2+Gordon+4.bmp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Slm9-8f43qI/AAAAAAAAA3U/2BGgsVT-0ug/s1600-h/hearsts.bmp"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/thomas-tank-engine-new-edition.html", "title": "\nThomas the Tank Engine, new edition\n"},

I'd been up and down the stairs many times trying to settle him and then I just snapped, said loudly he was being a bad boy and I had hurt his feelings. He told me that he didn't love me and that \" Mummy is a bad woman .\" Well, if I thought it was OK to say to him... I said I was sorry for making him sad and for shouting at him. He wasn't ready to forgive too soon. He sobbed, \" Duncan hates Mummy...Duncan loves Mummy .\" Poor boy. I acknowledged his confusion and said that I love him and that he is so sad and cross now and he will feel better later. He agreed that he would be \" happy tomorrow .\" He lay quietly for a while but it must have come to mind again and he burst out, \" put my shoes on !\" I asked where he wanted to go. \" To the airport .\" How will you get there? \" In the taxi. I will bring small Superman case. \" Do you want to fly somewhere? \" Duncan will go to Germany. Mummy will stay at home. \" I did feel like laughing at his rebellion, but hugged him a bit tighter (which he likes), kissed his curls and told him he could go to Germany some day.

When I started saying something else about our night time conversation he instructed me to drop it; \" don't say it .\" He's been interested in going to Germany and especially the Black Forest for a while now, ever since he started his interest in  cuckoo clocks  and watched films about their manufacture, often in German.

{"date": "1 Jul 2009", "body": "\nSunday was another fine day. We had to take the train into Belfast to pick up the car, abandoned the  previous night . We decided to go to   Delamont Park  for the first time since  Duncan's 6 th  birthday . It was beautiful. Even the drive was pleasant. The children were in great form, Duncan was leading the others in a clapping/chanting game about hot chocolate. The park itself borders the gorgeous Strangford Lough. After riding the miniature train (we could hardly be expected not to!) we followed one of the many guided trails opting to go by the lake. Duncan started off in the buggy but lept out almost instantly to run after his siblings. We passed a lawn on which Lady performed various gymnastics/tumbling maneuvers. Various bits of exercise equipment dot the paths and the children all had a go on a device with handles and a swingy bit for the legs. Duncan and Thomas worked on it for 10 minutes, their wee legs swishing back and forth like upside down metronomes. When we got to the lake, the children ran onto the stony beach and tossed stones into the water. Duncan found a few big stones he labelled stepping stones and lept about on them like a mountain goat. I forced myself to keep quiet, but was a bit freaked in case he fell in as we had no spare clothes. A week without rain (yes really!) had left the grass looking dry and a bit grey. It didn't seem to have harmed the grasshoppers we heard but didn't see. Duncan was a bit freaked out by the preponderance of flying insects. No matter how I try to reassure him, he thinks they're all deadly stinging creatures intent on harming him. Eventually I hope, he will pick up on my lack of concern about these creatures and lose this fear. But for a while he retreated to his buggy and pulled his T-shirt over his face for protection while I struggled to push him up a bumpy hill path, That was my work out for the day. After our walk the children played for a while in a really cool adventure playground. Lady and Thomas loved the long steep slide, but it was a bit too much for Duncan. To finish we called into the food establishment preferred for our family composition; the McD drive through. Burgers, fizzy drinks and ice cream provided the perfect accompaniment to what had been a busy and just about perfect day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.delamontcountrypark.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/07/sunday.html", "title": "\nSunday\n"},

He particularly enjoyed  Say, Say Say  and had a little \"wave your arms around\" dance to himself. Then we played a few of our favourite tracks from the  Off the Wall  CD and danced about the living room. Lady and her friend came in and requested  Thriller  then demonstrated their entertaining interpretation of the zombie dance. Thomas was a tad embarrassed by it all. I went into Belfast hoping to meet a  blog   buddie  who was up attending an  ABA conference . I had the wrong time in my head and arrived half way through her lunch hour. Eventually we found each other and had a few minutes of hasty but delightful conversation before she had to go back to one of the many talks. I sneaked in to listen to just one of them, to see if any of my criticisms of ABA and it's promotion were addressed, but I felt terribly guilty about crashing the conference so I went off to poke about in the shops for a while. Later Gordon and I went out for my birthday dinner. I had been especially grouchy; we were late to leave and I was starving. I am not at my best when I am hungry. But after sitting down and downing a drop of red wine, I suddenly cheered the heck up and we had a most delicious meal. We declined dessert, but were provided with one anyway; three of the waiters brought out a toffee cheesecake embellished with a birthday candle while singing Happy Birthday. I can thank my waiter chum for that kind surprise, and for the massive reddener [blush] it generated. We met  Phil  afterwards, a smart and talented man who's a fantastic photographer and as into literature as Gordon is. Over a few drinks we yapped about all sorts and tried to get my husband interested in twitter and blogging.

How did this woman get the ear of the PM? She and her supporters ran an astute marketing campaign  of billboards and posters costing over \u00a3500 000 (according to their  press release ).  She and a group of other  rich and attractive mothers  posed in comely black dresses  as the \"Autism Mothers: Delivering Where Governments Have Failed.\" They are supposed to show that these women \"aren't downtrodden, ill educated women who somehow deserve to have an autistic child.\" Their billboards made out that this woman alone can save the PM \u00a3508 million a year, can help cut the divorce rate, can help him get people back to work. She is the messiah mum! She's going to make it all better. The billboards didn't make it to Northern Ireland, but I've heard that there were loads of them about in England. For some reason, they were common in motorway service station toilets too. But Gordon Brown for some bizarre reason fell for it and has since met the amazing Polly. I met her too 7 years ago and  wrote about it here : I spent a long afternoon listening to her theories and her detailed regime to rid her son of his autism. Back then I was impressed at her zeal and ostensible knowledge of autism's causes and treatments. Her son had had intensive ABA teaching. He had a host of supplements daily. He was fed only organic food and water from glass bottles, lest any pesky toxins intrude. She talked about his numerous infections and how she believed the many courses of antibiotics he'd taken as a baby, together with vaccinations, were connected to his autism. ... I was caught up in her pitch and wanted to think that she knew how to help me help [Duncan]. She warned me against joining the local NAS group where they refused to believe in cures and whose acceptance she interpreted as negativity. She  was  a very kind lady. She welcomed me into her home and really did want to share what she knew in an effort to help. She presented me with a glut of her magazines which I read religiously for the next week or so. I tried to get Gordon to take an interest in it all. I showed him the article by the nutropath, advocating various vitamins and minerals. I showed him the articles about the labs which tested autistic children's hair, blood and stools and found all sorts of non standard levels. He scoffed at the lot of it. He just knew too much about microbiology, statistics, pharmacology etc. to be taken in by any of it. He pointed out a pile of what were (to him) ridiculous assertions contained in the magazines, and since he really knows his stuff, I dumped the lot of them. But times have changed since then. What could be attributable to ignorance back in 2002, is less excusable today. The science has moved on. Numerous studies have failed to find a link between vaccination and autism, while as many have found more evidence for the genetic basis of the condition. Those who cling to environmental explanations in the face of the evidence are coming from a faith based position.  The Autism File magazine has moved on too. It still backs failed gastroenterologist/autism quack therapist Andrew Wakefield wholeheartedly, and still pushes unproven biomedical treatments as the best option for autistic children, and carries copious advertisements for the providers of such woo, but these days it's more widely available. Sadly, there's a market for such bollocks. Here's how this dynamo of autism nonsense is introduced in the Daily Mail: A few weeks ago, a one-woman campaign culminated in Polly Tommey meeting the Prime Minister to improve support for the families of children with autism. She was fighting for the sake of thousands of other parents around the country, having become an unofficial 'Good Samaritan' for the desperate parents of autistic children. Oh really? A petition in her favour got only  574 signatures . Where is the evidence that this woman and her company represent \"thousands of other parents\"? The NAS is much more representative of autistic adults and children and their parents/families. Polly starts her article by describing the time she counselled a man who felt suicidal because he couldn't cope with his autistic 2 year old son. It's great that she was able to stop him killing himself but why did he have her phone number to call in his time of need? Why has she set herself, as an individual no more qualified than I myself am, to be the authority and source of help and information for parents of autistic children. Wouldn't a well established charity like the NAS be more useful? Polly then describes \"how unrelentingly hard it is looking after autistic children\" with an apparently illustrative incident in which her son, then aged just two, pulled his six month old little brother's hair out. While I'm sure that was traumatic for the baby and hard on his mum, it's hardly unusual for toddlers, autistic and not, to inadvertently hurt their baby siblings. Oh I forgot, here's what marks it out as bizzarro autismo stuff; \"Toby was screaming and his head was all bloody - but Billy was just laughing.\" Yes, the  two year old  laughed instead of recognising the full magnitude of his crime and promising to make reparations. Polly tells us about her charmed life before the dread autism came to call and she and her husband \"cried until we fell asleep\" for six weeks. She calls her son's autism \"regressive autism\" and was \"desperate to get my child back. I would have done anything for a smile or a cuddle, or to hear him say: 'I love you, Mum.'\" Polly continues with the myth of the autism gut: People don't realise that a large proportion of autistic children have terrible gut problems, and for 18 months that was the case with Billy. Any normal child would have been taken to A&E at some point and given a battery of tests, but with autistic children doctors say it's just part of their autism. Just what is the evidence that autistic children have more gut problems than non autistic? And why would a child go to the A&E department for tests on autism? That's one of the oddest suggestions I've heard yet. I've said it before, if you think your child has gut issues,  see a doctor , but not at an accident and emergency department. When a child is sick, it's irrelevant that the child has autism. When Duncan was younger and had a limited diet and wasn't gaining weight fast enough, we were referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist as part of the investigations into his health needs. He had various tests performed, all by proper doctors and all expenses were covered by the NHS.  No  doctor has  ever  said to us that any of Duncan's medical issues should be taken as just part of his autism. But maybe we've just been lucky. The Tommeys discovered the gluten free/casein free diet and like magic, Billy improved. His Dad was so impressed that he sought out more sources of (mis)information on biomedical approaches to autism and he \"re-trained as a clinical nutritionist.\" Of course he did! But what's this, in the bit about how they were the first in the UK to try treating their son with the hormone secretin, Polly says that \"Billy still suffered terrible constipation, and we thought it would help regulate his gut. It worked and Billy's behaviour improved.\" But...I thought the GFCF diet had sorted all that?! Anyway, one of the couple's media mates got them onto the Trevor McDonald Tonight TV show talking about secretin and they found themselves \"inundated with people asking us for help.\" They decided to start a magazine, it's circulation is now an impressive 44,000 and it's on sale nationally for \u00a34.95.  It's safe to say, the Tommeys words are read a bit more than my own. Polly then explains the type of problems people ask for their help with but she admits, \"I am not trained to deal with any of this. All I can do is listen and advise where I can.\" So why not send them to the NAS, where the phone counsellors are trained? She comes out with an amazing admission: There is so much misinformation out there, and so little understanding from health professionals, emergency services and the authorities that it makes caring ten times harder. The Autism File magazine is one such source of misinformation. The article proceeds with an anecdote of autism induced difficulties. In this case however, if what she says is true, a terrible miscarriage of justice has been suffered by the man described. He screamed on a bus when he couldn't deal with the sound of a baby crying, was taken away by the police and sectioned. This is all told from the perspective of his mother who, Polly says, \"didn't see him for six months and by the time she got him back he was pumped full of drugs and could only sit rocking backwards and forwards in his bedroom. All her hard work had been destroyed.\" All  her  hard work?! Polly continues; The cost of life care for an autistic person is around \u00a32.9 million, but we think that with the right help that could be massively reduced. This  figure relates to the cost of a person with autism and a learning disability . For people with High Functioning Autism, the same authors estimated the cost at \u00a3784 800. Polly postulates the provision of an autism centre which she reckons would cost \u00a310million to set up and \"where we could educate the police, magistrates, teachers and anyone else who comes into contact with autism.\" The unsubstantiated claims of biomedical believers are shared; There are amazing things being done to help autistic kids, particularly with biomedical intervention  -  detoxifying children through supplements and probiotics, diet, speech therapy and behaviour analysis. Some children respond so well they are taken off the autistic spectrum and can return to mainstream school. But very little of this help is available on the NHS, or through the local education authority. But, why should the state fund this when there is no evidence of its effectiveness? Polly might learn from an astonishingly good article the Mail ran earlier,  the great autism rip-off . Polly tells that Gordon Brown \"loved the billboard campaign and said it was genius.\" Money talks. The article continues; Gordon wants me to work with his wife Sarah to bring all the autistic organisations together so that we can work for a common cause. He wants there to be more understanding towards autistics, and for them to be more included in society. For that to happen, the public sector needs educating, so he wants his representatives to attend a conference that our charity, The Autism Trust, is running in October. We want doctors, scientists and the public sector to learn more about dealing with autistic people. I am all for more understanding of and towards autistic people. I don't see how this can be achieved by attending a conference run by a group of parents whose dearest aim is the removal of their child's autism. The government representatives would be better off meeting actual autistic people to learn from them about their needs for services and respectful, inclusive treatment.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1194841/I-helped-son-beat-autism-making-weetabix.html", "http://www.davincivirtual.co.uk/uploads/Autism_Trust_Press_release.pdf", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1164799/Mothers-unite-World-Autism-Day--8216-If-want-heard-noticed-8217.html", "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/03/25/article-1164799-03AA53F6000005DC-225_634x461.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SkIAE48SrpI/AAAAAAAAA1s/uoI1v1frg18/s1600-h/autim+divorce+bullshit.png", "http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?TA2009A", "http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/5/1/7", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1023351/The-great-autism-rip---How-huge-industry-feeds-parents-desperate-cure-children.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/so-gordon-met-polly.html", "title": "\nSo Gordon met Polly\n"},

Here goes: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ On May the 28th my Dad, brother, Grandma and I went to Jamaica for my great auntie's funeral.  We  had  to get two planes, one from Belfast to London Gatwick and one from Gatwick  to  Montego Bay (in  Jamaica). But it was not easy! We had to wait in Gatwick airport for a very long time because the flight we were taking was delayed by about one full day! When we at last got on the plane it took off and we were going. I was really glad because  all of the passengers had started to get incredibly mad. I was too! After 11 hours on the plane, we landed. It was extremely hot and I felt exhausted. We all got a taxi to our hotel which was about 10 minutes drive away. We slept as soon as we got in our rooms. Next day, Thomas and me went outside and started climbing trees in the beautiful garden. The mango trees were full of fruit. Next we went swimming in the pretty pool, surrounded by trees and exotic flowers and with a waterfall and a pond. We ate breakfast on the balcony looking over the garden. We went back to the airport to hire a car then all drove into the country to my Granda's house. He lives in Jamaica. He lives near lots of mountains and loads of the houses are built on sticks. There are goats, dogs and chickens running about. We played with our cousins Justin, Jamie, Monique, Anesca and Rosa. We played chasies, hide and seek and I taught them some cheer leading and gymnastics moves. Justin was great at doing cartwheels. My Granda uses a wheelchair and he likes to chat a lot. He asked me lots of questions about what I've been doing. I met him once before when I was 5 years old. He was very friendly and I like him a lot. When we left his house we drove to Mandeville where my other great aunt, Mary lives. It was quite late when we arrived and I hadn't eaten since breakfast. I had a tiny bit of mango and cocunut at Granda's house but I was too busy playing to eat more. Dad took Thomas and me out for KFC while Grandma got some time to talk to her sister Mary. We played with some of our other cousins who lived there and went to bed in Mary's house. It was very late and I was really tired, but I was still one of the last people to go to bed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://lookinginrockpools.blogspot.com/2009/06/my-trip-to-jamaica-day-1.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sju6pctzD_I/AAAAAAAAA1M/76z8zaj2nNM/s1600-h/jam1.png", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sju7KjcMhbI/AAAAAAAAA1c/QRl8qx_DGTo/s1600-h/P5300085.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sju7oaQ8gLI/AAAAAAAAA1k/I_EtZcvGXtQ/s1600-h/P5300104.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sju6qN0wxrI/AAAAAAAAA1U/Nj0zS4x4-q0/s1600-h/jam2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sju6o5Vx81I/AAAAAAAAA1E/NaD8HmAPGg8/s1600-h/jam3.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/guest-post-by-lady-jamaica-day-1.html", "title": "\nGuest post by Lady: Jamaica Day 1\n"},
{"date": "19 Jun 2009", "body": "\nLast week a  reader asked for advice  on how to tell children in his/her son's school class about his autism.   I've discovered that some boys in my son's class believe he is brain damaged. Now they're not evil children and were happy to talk to me about this. They just want to know what's 'wrong' with their well liked classmate. Age of these children 8ish. I've mentioned it to his learning support assistant and class teacher. I think a class talk is necessary. The problem is my son thinks he's perfectly normal with something called in his words 'I forget what is it again? Oh yeah Autism.' Of course to us at home he IS perfectly normal. He's aware that he behaves differently from others but he's very happy about this difference. The county autism team have suggested that my son not be present when the talk is given.  I don't know about this. Can anybody help? How do we go about this?  How does anyone explain autism to a bunch of children without resorting to cats and mawkishness?   I don't know if it would be right to have a class meeting about the boy without him present. It would be better, in my opinion, to have someone, you the parent? talk to the class and then take questions. Your son could say a few words too if he wanted. I tell children who come here that Duncan is autistic. Then I explain that it's a kind of disability that for him means it's harder for him to speak and understand other people and that he likes to do things in a different way from most boys his age. I've not had to tackle the class situation and most children who come here don't play with him much anyway as he just ignores them. I know what you mean about cats and mawkishness. Since I've been of no help, I'll leave this post up and invite the clever people who read this to leave their advice in the comments. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/explaining-autism-to-class-of-8-year.html", "title": "\nExplaining autism to class of 8 year olds\n"},
{"date": "17 Jun 2009", "body": "\nIn January, a major UK children's charity, Action for Children, released a television advertisement ostensibly about the help they had offered an autistic boy. It gave however, a shockingly inaccurate, damaging and offensive portrayal of autism and I and several others ( listed here )  wrote about the ad  and contacted the charity with our concerns. Action for Children responded with a form letter apologising for upsetting us, as if that made it all OK, but ignoring all our valid explanations of why the ad was wrong. I created a Facebook group as a way of mobilising support and attention on the issue quickly and in a few weeks, over 2600 people had joined. The ad was supposed to have run for 3 weeks but  was pulled after only 2 . In January, I  complained to the Advertising Standards Agency  (ASA) about the ad and on June 3rd finally received a letter with their adjudication. Unfortunately, they decided that the ad did not breach their codes. I was instructed not to publicise this decision until today when the  ruling was made available on their web site . I appreciate the time and effort the ASA has spent on this but I am very disappointed with their decision and also with the text of the ruling. Action for Children responded to the ASA by saying that they \"believed they had a responsibility to tell their stories through their [young people's] own eyes, not through the eyes of parents, carers or adults\" and that \"their organisation was committed to raising the issue that support was available through their advertising and campaigning, despite that being uncomfortable for some.\" For the first time ever, I read that, \" \"Dan\" (not his real name) was  now an adult  who was therefore  able to give informed consent .\" (my emphasis.) The advertising company also responded: \"Clearcast said that, at pre-production stage, they had been informed that the stories told in the ads would be real case studies using children's own words.  They considered the ads were  extremely sensitively made  and that the animation of the \"monster\" symbolised, in a child-like drawing, how  a child  felt when he felt out of control.  They believed \"Dan's\" story was an uplifting one about how  a boy  who felt unable to deal with his autism could find help and support from Action for Children.\" (my emphasis) Does an advertising company just stating their opinion that the monstrous ad was \"extremely sensitively made\" make it so? Also, I dispute all these claims that the ad represents how a  child / boy  feels about his autism, since we now know that \"Dan\" is an  adult . I wrote to the ASA in January and  posted my letter on this blog today . The ASA have summarised my extensive, reasonable and evidence based objections and those of the others thus: All the viewers and Autreach challenged whether the ad was offensive and distressing, particularly to autistic children and their families, because of its negative depiction of an autistic child as a monster. 31 viewers challenged whether the ad was offensive and misleading because it portrayed autism as a behavioural problem that needed to be corrected or because it implied that an autistic person chose to behave in the way they did and could modify their behaviour if they wished. 11 viewers challenged whether the ad was misleading because it suggested autism could be cured. Six viewers and Autreach challenged whether the ad condoned bullying because \"Dan\" appeared to believe it was his own fault that he was bullied. Objection 1 Action for Children responded by talking again about the  individual  depicted in the ad, \"his feelings of anger and frustration\" and how  \"he overcame those feelings and was \"more at peace\" with himself. \" They claim also to have \"received supportive comments on the ad from senior government figures and members of the public.\" Well how nice, but thousands of people showed their disgust with the ad by electing to join a protest group, many others signed a petition against the ad, and 61 people and one autistic organisation were sufficiently bothered to complain to the ASA. Action for Children's income from grants and fees is \"mostly derived from local authorities, health trusts and central government sources\" according to their  annual report and financial statements 2006/07  (see page 44 of the PDF link.) It is not too surprising therefore that senior government figures speak in the charity's favour. What is surprising is the insight gained into the views of the Rt Hon Hilary Armstrong MP, latterly the Minister for the Cabinet Office and for Social Exclusion on disabled self advocates. \"She said she disagreed that the ad portrayed autism as dark or evil; that it was the effects of autism that had left \"Dan\" feeling angry and isolated but that, with the right kind of support, it was not nearly as bad for him; that \"Dan\" was not \"cured\" of autism but had learnt how to deal with it with sensitive help and support.  She said  she was aware of a section of the disability lobby that believed the behaviour of those with a disability should not be \"interfered\" with but she believed that view should be challenged .  Even if wider society tolerated the behaviour \"Dan\" described, it was painful for him.\" (my emphasis) That line about the disability lobby deserves further investigation. I wonder from where Ms Armstrong derived this peculiar view, what evidence she has that it exists and what relevance this notion of hers has on the criticisms of the monster autism ad? I am disappointed that the ASA saw fit to use this in their adjudication as it implies that those of us who object to the demonisation of disability are some peculiar \"lobby\" that seek to leave disabled people to flounder. Objection 2 Action for Children responded by saying  \"\"Dan\" had  approved the concept and the drawings  as how he had seen himself and what he had felt he needed help with.  They said he felt strongly that he now had support to help him with aspects of his behaviour which previously he had not understood and which had created difficulties for him in his relationships.\" In the  email I received from Gary Day  on Jan25 this year, he wrote something else entirely. He said then,  \"Dan tells his own story in his own words, and he chose to name his condition, the drawings that you see were also  drawn by Dan , the pictures depict how he saw himself before we as a charity got involved and helped Dan and his family.\" Why were they claiming at first that Dan drew the pictures when it was an advertising company all along. Why are they hiding behind this individual, as if Dan saying it makes it all right no matter how damaging it might be to all the other autistic people out there? They also quoted the principal of Dan's school saying that Dan used to have behavioural difficulties but with their support, he got over them. That's all great but I don't see the relevance to an ad that is damaging to public portrayals of autism for all the other autistic children in the UK. We learn also and I am not surprised, that the former chief executive of another major UK charity, Mencap, \"supported the ad \"because it raises awareness of some very complex issues that are frequently misunderstood by the general public\" and who said awareness of the lack of services available needed to be raised.\" It's all about the awareness isn't it? It matters not, apparently, if that awareness causes more harm than help. An ad that makes more people \"aware\" of autism as a condition that makes you into an anti-social monster is supposed to be a good thing? Objection 3 Another glut of false arguments are presented in the next bit of Action for Children's response to objection that the ad appeared to show Dan being cured (my points in red): \"   They said the ad showed \"Dan\" shedding his anger and frustration but referred to their comment above that he was still on the autistic spectrum at the end of the ad.   This is not apparent to the average viewer.  They said there was a wide range of opinion on almost all aspects of autism and that some groups disagreed with showing autism as any kind of problem for those diagnosed on the autistic spectrum, or their families.  A total fabrication!  Action for Children said they knew, however, that people and families who experienced autism also experienced problems and that they did not feel they could shy away from difficult or sensitive issues for fear of upsetting a small minority of people if they were making a case for the good of the children and young people with whom they worked.  It is not fear of upsetting a minority that we have criticised, it is your misrepresentation of and damage to the lives of autistic people. Objection 4 Their response to the bullying queries: Action for Children said the ad quoted \"Dan\" as saying \"I used to lash out if somebody pushed my buttons or I wasn't able to do something.\"  They said that contextualised his feelings of anger and frustration in that they were not just in response to other people - he was also generally frustrated with things around him.  No one objects to Dan's feelings nor that he was helped to find ways to deal with them.   They said the crucial aspect of Action for Children's support was that it allowed \"Dan\" to be \"more at peace with himself\" and less likely to respond with violence to things that perhaps did not warrant that response.  Action for Children said they did not condone bullying or cruelty but that, nevertheless, children and young people found bullying was a common and profoundly damaging experience.  I contend that the ad itself would cause more bullying of autistic young people as it portrays them so badly. It is worth noting that the opinions of the autism professionals who spoke out about the ad or against damaging portrayals of autism, are missing from the ASA's adjudication report. The ASA's Assessment Objection 1.  Not upheld The ASA say: We considered, however, that they had taken pains to represent autism and the issues it raised in a way which, in their experience, was accurate and truthful, and that the message of the ad was positive.  We concluded that the ad was unlikely to result in widespread offence or to have the effect of undermining the dignity of autistic children and their families through its depiction of autism. I feel that I demonstrated in my letter the ways in which the ad  was  inaccurate, untruthful and that it's message  was  damaging. The ad  did  result in widespread offense and  did  undermine the dignity of autistic people. That the ASA don't agree is disappointing, but it doesn't change the facts. Objection 2.  Not upheld We noted the concerns expressed by the viewers and the points made in defence of the ad by Action for Children and Clearcast.  We considered that, while views on how best to address the issues autism raised might differ, the story told in the ad centred on one person's - \"Dan's\" - experience; on the difficulties he considered he had experienced as a result of his behaviour and his reactions to his surroundings; his wish to address them and the difficulties he had experienced in doing so until he received help and support.  We did not consider the ad suggested an autistic person chose to behave in the way they did or that they could simply choose to modify their behaviour if they wished.  We considered the ad did, however, tell the story of how \"Dan\" had wanted to deal with his situation and how, with the right help and support, he was able to do so.  We concluded that the ad was unlikely to cause offence or to mislead viewers by portraying autism as a behavioural problem or because it implied that an autistic person chose to behave in the way they did and could modify their behaviour if they wished. I disagree with this assessment. As I showed in my letter to them, the NAS have shown that 17% of people already think that autism is just bad behaviour. I expect that number would increase if those being surveyed were shown this ad first. Objection 3.  Not upheld We considered that the story told in the ad centred on one person - \"Dan's\" - experience; on the difficulties he considered he had experienced as a result of his behaviour and his reactions to his surroundings; his wish to address them and the difficulties he had experienced in doing so until he received help and support.  We considered that, just because issues or a situation could be addressed and supported, it did not necessarily follow that they were completely resolved or, in this case, \"cured.\"  We considered that views on how best to address the issues autism raised might differ and that, while the ad told of the experiences of how one person had been helped to address the issues they considered the condition raised for them, it did not suggest that the condition was one that could be cured or that \"Dan\" had been cured.  We concluded that the ad was unlikely to mislead viewers by suggesting the condition could be cured. Making this all about a man called \"Dan\" and claiming that as it's just one man's opinion, and then presenting this as if it were actually the views of a child, does not exonerate the charity and the professional advertising company from culpability. This ad was expensive to produce and run and portrayed autism in the way Action for Children thought would best gain them publicity and support as the saviours of even tragic cases like Dan's. Objection 4.  Not upheld We noted the concerns expressed by the viewers and the points made in defence of the ad by Action for Children and Clearcast.  We noted that the ad referred to \"Dan\" being insulted and reacting to that by being physically violent to the person concerned.  We considered that, while \"Dan\" regretted reacting with physical violence and wanted to be able to deal with the situation more appropriately, the ad did not suggest that \"Dan\" considered it was his own fault he was bullied or that bullying behaviour was acceptable.  We concluded that the ad was unlikely to be understood as condoning bullying. I consider that the ad implies that autistic children are more likely to act aggressively than typically developing children. This is another misrepresentation as aggressive behaviour is not one of the diagnostic criteria for autism or Asperger's syndrome.       Professor Tony Attwood, criticised this ad  with specific reference to the bully message:     \"\u201cI am very concerned that the advert gives a message that children with autism and Asperger\u2019s syndrome are dangerous and potentially disturbed.    When the child refers to \u201ccorrect errors in my behaviour\u201d this seems to imply \u2018brain washing\u2019 and a sense of guilt for how he behaved. Many of the behaviours I consider as coping mechanisms for the lack of understanding and respect from other people. He refers to reacting when people insult him. Those that insulted him need the treatment.\u201d  Professor Attwood was not quoted on the report. So Action for Children can celebrate that they have won. I had hoped that the advertising guidelines might provide some protection for autistic people from the disturbing way Action for Children chose to portray them. But that has not happened. Action for Children must be proud of their victory, their right to show autistic children as monsters thrashing around terrifying the population has been upheld.

I will shortly publish my view on the ruling and Action for Children's response. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Complaints Reception Team Advertising Standards Authority Mid City Place 71 High Holborn London WC1V 6QT 31 January 2009     Dear Sir or Madam,    While I commend the work Action for Children does as a charity, and have no doubt of their good intentions, I object to this campaign and contend that it breaches the CAP Code for TV advertising, section 11.3.4, relating to ethical responsibility, in the following ways.   11.3.4(b) The problem AFC seeks aid for is exaggerated by the use of highly emotive imagery. A cartoon monster is shown jumping around in an urban landscape, attacking some accelerated film footage of real people. As this image plays a boy's voice-over says, \"I used to lash out if something pushed my buttons or I wasn\u2019t able to do something. Things that wound me up were if they\u2019d insulted me I would physically hurt that young person.\" Then we see that the monster has a sad looking normal boy trapped inside, looking out through its mouth. Straight after that image is shown, the boy says the words \"My parents sought out help with my autism because it was becoming a pain in the bum.\" [ 17/06/09 edit; It turns out that he actually said, it was \"a pain  for them \", but it was very unclear and no one from AfC saw fit to correct the transcripts any of us had made on our blogs even though they spent long enough reading them from their offices in Doncaster. ] This exaggerates the problems autism causes and implies that autism is making the boy a monster. It connects autism with aggressive, anti-social, monster-like behaviour.    My 10 year old daughter said on viewing the ad, \"It's showing the boy stuck inside a monster and that's autism and then he goes away to a school and he comes out of the monster and he's not autistic any more. But that's not right, Duncan (her autistic little brother) isn't a monster. He's a human being.\" 11.3.4(c) The AFC ad does not respect the dignity of vulnerable children and young people who are the very people AFC are supposed to help. On the morning of  Sunday 25th January 2009 I created social networking group on  www.facebook.com  in order to campaign against this advertisement. Between the time of its opening and the time I am writing this letter (the evening of Saturday 31st January 2009), 940 individuals have read my reasons for starting the group, and have decided to support my protest by signing up to the group. The group can be viewed here: http://www.facebook.com/groups.php?ref=sb#/group.php?gid=47154931157   Professor Roy Grinker, author of \"Unstrange minds: Remapping the World of Autism\" has joined this group. There is another renowned autism author and at least one distinguished FRS scientist as well as many autistic people, and others who have autistic family members and friends. Others joined because they care about the human rights and dignity of all people including those with autism. AFC replied to the dozens of complaints they have received about the advertisement by sending everyone form letters which request that we take our concerns to the ASA. In some of their responses, AFC defend the ad by saying that it uses words and drawings Dan produced to describe himself. In other responses they say that Dan \"approved\" the ads. But an advertising company created this ad, employing both marketing professionals and art direction staff. This ad is not, no matter how AFC have tried to spin it, the self-published, direct telling of one child's experiences. This ad shows how AFC choose to portray autism by using Dan's story, with his poor self image and worries. They have used the troubles and fears of a vulnerable child to generate pity and fear, to make them appear to be heroic in saving even tragic cases like Dan. They cannot claim that they were merely giving him a voice. The harm to other vulnerable young people just like Dan, is too great to be ignored. There is a great deal of misinformation in the public sphere about autism. The National Autistic Society carried out studies recently about public attitudes to and understanding of autism:      http://www.think-differently.org.uk/Awareness/Contacts%20and%20Resources/%7E/media/ThinkDifferently/CampaignPack/NAS_Aware_report_Wales_FA.ashx     They uncovered a great deal of misinformation. For example, 17% of those surveyed mistakenly thought that some children with autism don\u2019t have a disability, they\u2019re just badly behaved. Advertisements like this one could well cause that number to increase as it implies that Dan merely had to learn to control his behaviour. The voice-over reinforces this view, \"Thanks to the carers I was able to correct a lot of errors in my behaviour and become a better person.\" There is no mention of the effects of outside influences on the child's behaviour, or the difficulty for any child approaching the teen years in dealing with bullies (\"if something pushed my buttons\", \"if they\u2019d insulted me\") and the pressures of growing up. There is no mention of the extra difficulties in dealing with these pressures for a child with a disability that affects communication skills, sensory precessing, and who can find certain social situations more difficult than his non-autistic peers. Aggressive behaviour is not one of the diagnostic criteria for autism or Asperger's syndrome. The ad implies that autistic children are more likely to act aggressively than typically developing children. This is another misrepresentation.       Professor Tony Attwood, internationally respected researcher and expert on Asperger's syndrome, recently criticised this ad;     \"\u201cI am very concerned that the advert gives a message that children with autism and Asperger\u2019s syndrome are dangerous and potentially disturbed.    When the child refers to \u201ccorrect errors in my behaviour\u201d this seems to imply \u2018brain washing\u2019 and a sense of guilt for how he behaved. Many of the behaviours I consider as coping mechanisms for the lack of understanding and respect from other people. He refers to reacting when people insult him. Those that insulted him need the treatment.\u201d      The ad implied that autism was a monster trapping Dan, and after time and help from AFC, he was able to (according to the ad's imagery) climb out of this monster, into the calm green field and crush the monster with his foot when it threatened to devour him once more. It implies that Dan is no longer autistic and is much better off that way. There has long been a view among some people, of autism as a shell which traps a \"real\", non-autistic children inside. It was first used by Bruno Bettleheim who described the autistic child as an \"Empty Fortress\" and was of the (now utterly discredited) opinion that \"refrigerator mothers\" cause their children to \"act\" autistic as a defence mechanism. This imagery is still used by those who emphasise a model of autism intervention of cure and prevention instead of helping those living with the condition to thrive. Some unscrupulous people make money by selling false therapies to desperate parents, who are even now, led to believe that they can release their precious child from the clutches of the \"autism-monster\". Parents of recently diagnosed children may see this advertisement and worry unnecessarily about their children and may be more willing to fall for the false promises of those selling dangerous and expensive, fake autism \"treatments.\" The National Autistic Society study showed that 56% of their respondents thought that autism was curable. This ad helps enforce this discredited theory of autism. 11.3.4(d) That 2000 (and rising) people have joined a Facebook group protesting the ad, and that so many have left messages expressing their disappointment, worry and hurt at the ads on AFC's YouTube page, on personal blogs, parent and disability forums and that so many have already written to AFC to complain, shows that this ad has aroused strong feelings and caused great distress. The representation of autism by the media is a very sensitive area, especially coming so soon after a great deal of public discourse about the possibility of prenatal screening for autism. The AFC campaign isn't merely offensive. It also misrepresents autism, portraying it as an external monster to be defeated. It will damage the self esteem of young autistic people in particular to see their autism, an integral part of themselves, depicted as monster trapping them, as something to be defeated. They will see themselves depicted as frightening beings whom others fear. There are many testimonials from parents saying that their autistic children were disturbed by the ad. There are many descriptions of the hurt the ad has caused to older autistic people too. One woman tells of her 20 year old daughter who is seeking work and fears that the ad may make her less employable to employers thinking she could be aggressive and lack control. This ad contributes to the mass of misinformation and prejudiced, negative rhetoric about autism in the media and wider society. One autistic adult wrote to me about the effect this has, that such rhetoric will, \"contribute to the widespread social construction of prejudice, and how that prejudice, in the clueless hands of the general public, endlessly pelts us and pounds on us, every minute of every day, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after spirit-crushing year... \" AFC seem to have opted to jump on the autism bandwagon, thinking that autism always gets the media interest they seek, given its prominence in captivating articles like those on the MMR and the recent high profile debate on prenatal screening. AFC have used the problems of autistic children to raise their profile, but have misrepresented the condition. This is utterly unethical. Every airing of the ad furthers the potential for damage.      To end, I would like to use the words of AFC themselves. In a report produced by the charity, they say (regarding the current government's policies): \"With regard to younger children, the emphasis has been on children\u2019s vulnerability and support for parents. With respect to older children, there has been a tendency to demonise them and to fail to see young people\u2019s viewpoints, which is at odds with ministers\u2019 avowed wishes in other contexts to listen to and be seen with young people.\" http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/uploads/media/77/3333.pdf Many young people have written to AFC, and have written on my Facebook group and on blogs and forums about how they fear this makes them appear to the public. Others have expressed their dismay and fears about this ad to their parents who have signed on their behalf. Other allies have signed because they object to the unethical depiction of autism and their concerns for the ill effects this ad is having on the people it seeks to help.  AFC know that to demonise children is wrong, that to fail to see their viewpoints is wrong. I would like to see AFC withdraw this advertisement, apologise to the autistic community and commit to seek the input of autistic-run advocacy organizations, and well informed mainstream autism organisations like the National Autistic Society in future advertising and fundraising efforts.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/", "http://www.facebook.com/groups.php?ref=sb#/group.php?gid=47154931157", "http://www.think-differently.org.uk/Awareness/Contacts%20and%20Resources/%7E/media/ThinkDifferently/CampaignPack/NAS_Aware_report_Wales_FA.ashx", "http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/uploads/media/77/3333.pdf"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/mt-letter-to-asa-about-action-for.html", "title": "\nMy Letter to the ASA about Action for Children monster ad\n"},
{"date": "15 Jun 2009", "body": "\nAll of us who home educate our children in the UK will already know about the  Badman review of home education in the UK  (PDF link). I am shocked and very concerned by the review and the recommendations ( summarised here ). It is low on evidence and high on speculation. There is so much in this document to object to. I can only mention a few of the problem areas in this post. These recommendations seem to be designed to end the right of children to receive the personally optimised education that their parents can deliver at home. Duncan's learning style will not be accommodated if this becomes law as I will have to drastically change the way he and his siblings are educated to bring it into line with the government's particular preferred method. Nor can I be sure that I will even be considered eligible to keep on teaching my children at home as Recommendation 23 states: \"That local authority adult services and other agencies be required to inform those charged with the monitoring and support of home education of any properly evidenced concerns that they have of parents\u2019 or carers\u2019 ability to provide a suitable education irrespective of whether or not they are known to children\u2019s social care, on such grounds as: alcohol or drug abuse incidents of domestic violence previous offences against children And in addition: anything else which may affect their ability to provide a suitable and efficient education.\" (my emphasis) What the heck does \"anything else\" mean? If an inspector doesn't like your choice of books, or how tidy your house looks (neat=repressed family, children not allowed to be creative, messy=not enough structure, children probably neglected?!) Could the presence of an autistic child who shouts a bit be construed as too disruptive to my \"normals\"? Nothing would surprise me. Like other concerned parents, I am extremely dismayed about Recommendation 7: \"The DCSF should bring forward proposals to change the current regulatory and statutory basis to ensure that in monitoring the efficiency and suitability of elective home education: That designated local authority officers should: \u2013  have the right of access to the home ; \u2013  have the right to speak with each child alone  if deemed appropriate or, if a child is particularly vulnerable or has particular communication needs, in the company of a trusted person who is not the home educator or the parent/carer.\" (my emphasis) I do NOT want to allow local authority officers more rights than the police-to enter my home when there is no reason to suspect any crime or wrong doing is occurring.  I will NOT allow any of these people more rights than the police-to speak to my children without myself or their father present. I do NOT trust them to speak to my typically developing children alone, never mind my autistic son. They claim that children like Duncan would have a \"trusted person\" with them, but it's not explained whether this is someone he and I trust, or someone  they  trust. I utterly reject the calls among some commentators in the media, to accept the draconian measures of registration, inspection and alteration of educational philosophy because they claim,  if you have nothing to hide, you have noting to fear . This is not so. I do not invite the police to inspect my house and garage to assure them that I am not storing stolen goods or growing illegal drugs, I do not hand over my emails and phone records to prove I am not a terrorist or hacker, nor do I submit my children's meal plans to a state nutritionist to prove they are getting a balanced diet. There is a presumption of compliance with the law and my parental duties. Like all citizens, I expect that it unless the organisations charged with the important duty of providing justice and protection have good reason to suspect that I  am  up to no good, then I am entitled to privacy and a presumption of being law abiding. Although one of the reasons the review had been ordered by the Secretary of State for Children, was to \"investigate suggestions that home education could be used as a \u2018cover\u2019 for child abuse,\" Badman had to admit in his findings that: \"8.14 With regard to other specific groups within the remit of this inquiry I can find no evidence that elective home education is a particular factor in the removal of children to forced marriage, servitude or trafficking or for inappropriate abusive activities.\"  Several newspapers have  utterly inaccurately produced headlines  proclaiming that children like mine and those of my many home-educating friends, are more at risk of abuse! They seem to reckon that because the review claims that \"the number of children known to children\u2019s social care in some local authorities is disproportionately high relative to the size of their home educating population\" that this correlates to more home educated children suffering abuse or neglect. In reality, as the report also admits, they do not have accurate figures for what percentage of home educated children are in touch with social services. But in any case, there appear to be more cases of Special Educational Needs among the home educating population than average and many of these people are, like my own family, known to social services because of a child's disability. There are many entirely innocent reasons why families may be known to the social services (disabled parent, malicious reporting of children \"making noise in the garden when they're supposed to be at school\" etc.) and it is a shocking slur to imply that this implies some wrong doing among such families. What  is  dangerous to all those children in the UK who  are  harmed by their carers, whether they are at school or not, is the divergence of scarce resources into looking for non existent problems among a subset of the country's population. It is well known that there are not enough resources to properly meet the needs of all the children who really do need help to deal with threatening situations. As a poster on an email list expressed it, putting all home educators under suspicion merely because they make the legitimate choice to have their children learn without school does not help those charged with ensuring child protection. It only increases the size of the haystack. Finally (for now) I draw attention to Recommendation 18: \"That the DCSF should reinforce in guidance to local authorities the requirement to exercise their statutory duty to assure themselves that education is suitable and meets the child\u2019s special educational needs. They should regard the move to home education as a trigger to conduct a review and satisfy themselves that the potentially changed complexity of education provided at home, still constitutes a suitable education. The statement should then be revised accordingly to set out that the parent has made their own arrangements under section 7 of the Education Act 1996.\" I may not be interpreting this correctly, but it seems to me to say that the Statement that was until now, only enforceable in the school setting, must now be enforced at home also. Therefore, whatever recommendations the education authorities employees make, must be adopted by the parents no matter whether they tie in with their own priorities and preferences and what they think is best for their child. This is a just another worrying development. I can only hope that despite our many differences in approach and ideology, we home educating families will be able to pull together to stop these awful recommendations becoming law. It will not be easy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.freedomforchildrentogrow.org/8318-DCSF-HomeEdReviewBMK.PDF", "http://daretoknowblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/reviews-recommendations.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SjbCXbMNMII/AAAAAAAAA0U/3wQiHQTHSnk/s1600-h/bad+man.png", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/children-educated-at-home-more-at-risk-of-abuse-1703220.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/home-education-under-threat.html", "title": "\nHome Education Under Threat\n"},
{"date": "5 Jun 2009", "body": "\nHaving spent so much time with Duncan this week has given me time and space to think about him and autism and expectations. He was a very restful companion in many ways. There wasn't a need to chat incessantly. He did talk a lot, but not all the time. Often I missed what he was saying as he spoke too quietly in the noisy surroundings and he didn't want to repeat himself. His observations were probably not aimed at me anyway, he was likely just musing to himself. When we relaxed in our room, he pottered about, playing with his toys or splashing and telling himself complicated tales in the bath or he snuggled beside me and watched the TV. But it was very quiet and peaceful. In the parks, he sat in his buggy with his long legs folded up and his stuffed Donald Duck clasped in his arms. He had his cap pulled low over his face and on the second day, despite the heat, wanted to wear his green hooded top. He wore his ear defenders about 1/3 of the time. I thought about others who might think I should be encouraging him to walk rather than sit in the buggy, engage in conversation instead of companionable silence. I dismissed these ideas as impracticable, unnecessary, intrusive and unfair. I was frequently overcome with happiness at sharing this time with my son. He was experiencing such joy and he was such a content little soul, that I was brought to tears a few times just out of love for the perfection personified that he is. I know that I have been described as lazy, a lunatic even, and as having \"given up\" on Duncan, or for thinking I have \"missed my chance\" to apply some sort of early intervention that would supposedly have minimised his autistic difficulties. That is why, it has been said of myself and others like me, we speak out against the quack \"cures\" foisted on some autistic children and the false blaming of vaccines and toxins for having caused their condition. But that's nonsense. Duncan is who he is. He is autistic and there is nothing I can do to change that. I can parent him and teach him, I can help him like his siblings to learn more as he gets older, to develop more knowledge and skills, to change from a helpless infant into a man as competent, self-reliant, decent and as capable of continued learning as he can be. There was no missed narrow window of opportunity. He will learn best when he is comfortable and feels safe and appreciated. I do not have to make him suffer by cutting off the place of safety his buggy has been. I thought about the autism therapies marketed, the Floortime, RDI, ABA and Son Rise. I thought about what I have read about each of these. I have not followed any of these autism therapy programmes. Well, I did use PECs with Duncan, but only for a short time and not exactly as instructed in the manual. The cards were very useful for a time though. But for the others, I bought or borrowed books about them and though in a few of these books, I picked up a couple of useful ideas to try, none of them appealed to me as something to do wholesale with Duncan. None of them have any good evidence of their effectiveness beyond parent testimonials. Though ABA is less bad than the rest, it's main claims are still based on a badly run study over 30 years old the results of which have not since been replicated. I know many people have found some of these ideas have helped them and their children. That's good. But I dislike the marketing of each of these therapies. I do not think that it is necessary to follow the trademarked and expensive therapy of some guru to be able to teach an autistic child. As Duncan enjoyed the parks in his own way, I though about what I read in the RDI book for example, that you're supposed to make every moment a time for developing those relationships, for making the child interact with you enough to overcome those pesky autistic deficits and change their neurology. The thought of pushing myself into Duncan's inner world at every opportunity and distracting him from all his own thoughts and observations with my own desire to make him talk and ENGAGAE is abhorrent to me. I thought about how much of these therapies are based on the idea that autism is so terrible, that autistic people are lesser people. I don't agree with that. I witnessed my son enjoy perfect happiness. He was doing what he wanted to do, we negotiated so that my needs were also met. We both had fun. I may be making a circular argument here for which I apologise. But it comes down to my acceptance of him and his autistic way of being. It might be harder in some ways to deal with the aspects of life that present fewer difficulties to the parents of non-autistic 8/9 year olds, but that's how it is and in some ways, I have to admit, it is actually easier. But then, no-one chooses to become a parent because it's easy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SilPa3q8BKI/AAAAAAAAA0E/AyRw2CWxFUM/s1600-h/SDC11406.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/just-as-he-is.html", "title": "\nJust as he is\n"},

{"date": "4 Jun 2009", "body": "\nYet again I am blogging again about time spent in the Kingdom of the Mouse. I won't apologise, for my beloved son enjoys this greatly and his happiness is important. We left on Monday. The flight wasn't until after 6pm but Duncan was awake shortly after 4am in his excitement. Not excitement that we were going on holiday mind, but that a book I'd ordered for him from Amazon a few days previously was most likely to be delivered that day. Now I'd partied hard (for me) at the weekend and Mummies need their sleep, especially before setting off on adventures. Thankfully I managed to get him back to bed for a while, but he was still up early and waiting by the window for postie. Glory be to the Royal Mail for they hath delivered unto us a saviour, in the form of a 2nd hand copy of Ladybird's \"Percy Runs Away\" a book we already have in few other formats and one he and I could both recite from memory. The flight went well. I brought his buggy which proved to be so useful in Florida and just a couple of small backpacks that I could manage alone. I'd organised a taxi shuttle from the airport and we were met by the driver as soon as we exited French passport control. Only 40 minutes after we'd landed, we were in the hotel and checking in. Fantastic. On booking the hotel I'd requested a room close to the reception and breakfast restaurant if possible. They had delivered. We were staying in what had been the cheapest Disney hotel on site but our room was perfect, with a large double and sturdy bunk beds in the block nearest reception. Duncan loved our cowboy room and claimed the top bunk at once. We settled in then went to buy some drinks (I'd packed a lot of snacks) and he pounced on a stuffed Donald Duck toy. I bought it, he's been on a Donald phase for a while now and I know from before that these toys are useful and important to him. Donald was from then on his companion and protector and a most excellent duck. Donald, cuddly and kind to overloaded little boys. The only slot left for breakfast was 7.30 but we managed to drag ourselves awake and to the crowded breakfast hall. I'd asked for and received permission to scarper back to the room with our selection of rolls and croissants. We did the same both mornings and had a much more relaxed time that we'd have managed in the bustling and loud refectory. Some time after 9 we took the bus to the parks. It was a bit of a bind getting the buggy on board but I'm pushy enough and we managed. After picking up Duncan's Easy Access Pass (green card to enable shorter queuing times and use of wheelchair accessible entrances) we were off on our first ride, Buzz Lightyear's Laser Quest. In a short time we followed up with the Small World, Pinocchio and Pirates of the Caribbean rides. Then Duncan wanted to go \"home\". It was only 11.30. So we went towards the exit but on passing the Disney Rail Road station, he agreed to my suggestion of a ride and we did a circuit of the park. On the train, photo taken by a nice German man with whom I'd griped about the lack of a ramp onto the disabled customers' carriage. Afterwards he asked to visit the Studio park. We queued for a few minutes for a hug and photo with Sully, then went to watch Crush's Coaster. He asked to go on the bus, meaning the Backlot Tour. This was I think, the highlight of the day. Having seen it before he knew what to expect but was still exhilarated by the fire and thundering water. Very cool. Awesome Autistic Dude! I was surprised that he asked to go see Stitch Live next as that had been one of the most difficult parts last time. But I complied and it worked out great. He laughed his head off with everyone else. It all gets a bit much, this work at having fun. We were both ready for a rest and went back via the train station shop where I picked up a few ice-creams and drinks. Mummy needed a cold beer after all that time in the sun. We had a lovely relaxing few hours in our room. He spent ages in the bath while I read a bit more (Restaurant at the End of the Universe) and we both had a wee sleep. Very chilled. We went out again at 6 though the parks closed at 7. I'd hoped to buy him food in the place where they show cartoons but it was shut. Duncan wasn't so happy. It was busy and hot. \"Too much\" he called as he buried his head under Donald. I pushed him out to McDonalds and we queued for ages to buy him food and ice-cream. He ate as we walked home. It was much calmer on that particular path. After another relaxing time in our room (more bath time for the boy) we headed back to the hotel shop for water and he picked out a tiny ceramic bell to buy. It was just his sort of thing. Soon enough he climbed into his bunk and slept. Next morning we hung around in the room a while later as we wouldn't be able to return once we'd checked out. We still left too early and it was hard at times throughout the day, just keeping going in the heat. The only ride Duncan wanted to go on by then was Phantom Manor so off we went, but it hadn't opened so we watched his beloved Big Thunder Mountain instead. Unfortunately, he still didn't feel even close to being ready to actually ride it. Shame, for I love it! We wandered though Fantasy Land which was very crowded and in which there were speakers blasting out princess music at every turn. Duncan was fed up! He did agree to go on the Snow White ride and enjoyed it, but vetoed everything else. He wanted to watch a show in the Studio but it was too late when we got there. We headed to the Rock'n'Roller coaster exit instead to watch for a while. I made the mistake of saying \"let's go\" when I was ready to leave and he panicked for a while thinking that I wanted him to go on the ride. Oops! Reassured, we left and went to the next show, a Playhouse Disney thing in French. It was nice and he liked it well enough but apart from Mickey and co. the characters were unfamiliar and it was all a bit too babyish. We returned to ride Phantom Manor and he loved the spookiness. After another go on the Small World boat and a circuit of the park on the train, we settled in the Videopolis for a few cartoons in the cool. By then I was just trying to pass time. Duncan wanted to go back to the hotel and was disappointed that we couldn't get into the room again. But he consented to watch the parade with me so for the first time ever, we went to one of the dedicated viewing spots for disabled customers, showed our green card and waited in the roped off area. It was much better there. Duncan worried a bit about the potential for loud noises and bangs but was assured there would be loud music but no bangs. When the parade passed, we had an excellent view, right by the curb. He enjoyed it and several of the characters approached him and the others in our area to touch hands and ruffle hair. He loved that, otherwise I'd have pulled him back! So finally all Disney-ed out I pushed him back slowly to the hotel, got our bags and awaited the taxi. It was early and we arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight was leaving. Those were not such pleasant hours, especially since on passing passport control there is nowhere to sit but a cafe. It's a horrible place to wait. To kill time, I took Duncan to the loo and he had great enjoyment washing his hands using touch sensitive taps. We had been the only travellers in the vicinity so I didn't try to attenuate his loud appreciative calls of excitement. There was a loud knock on the door. Thinking someone else needed to use the disabled person's toilet, I called back that we'd be out soon. The person knocking informed me that he was \"the police\" and that I was to open the door asap. Thankfully I had not commenced my own business. I opened to find 2 large uniformed men looking around. I explained in my finest Franglais that my son is disabled and was excited by the taps. They left us alone. A while later as I pushed him up and down the bleak hall I had a laugh about it, but not too much in case they decided I wasn't in a fit state to travel. We couldn't get into the seating area for another 30 minutes and the police had just about banged the toilet door down when I needed to use it. I did a far bit of internal filthy mouthed swearing at the lot of them. Apart from that the journey home was sweet. Sweet enough. A baby started screaming 15 minutes before we landed and Duncan screamed a couple of times in sympathy, but thankfully no more than that. He had to visit the toilet twice but there was no-one sitting beside us. He worried when we'd landed and the plane was pulling in beside the terminal building that a crash was imminent, \"Pull back! Apply the brakes!\" he recommended. I asked and was allowed to fast track through passport control, we picked up the car and weary, we headed on the last leg of our journey home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SigxcQTjxiI/AAAAAAAAAzk/KkE7aNV4HlI/s1600-h/SDC11362.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sigxchf88iI/AAAAAAAAAzs/811t0ixUjnE/s1600-h/SDC11365.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sigzr7Y6iPI/AAAAAAAAAz8/W-lFuFkn2x8/s1600-h/SDC11387.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sigxc5IZ9kI/AAAAAAAAAz0/9L-6zuzVe0E/s1600-h/SDC11375.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/06/practically-perfect-disneyland-paris.html", "title": "\nPractically Perfect Disneyland Paris\n"},

This might have been linked to the strange feeling of warmth on my skin when I went out, but I don't want to mistake correlation and causation. I ran with the dog down through the park, beautiful with the last of the bluebells and pungent in places with wild garlic. It was early and few people were about so I slipped her lead off. I tested her recall by sitting down every so often, calling her over for a cuddle and praise before sending her off again. She was great, exploring but watchful. The beach was deserted except for ourselves and the birds. It was perfect. Gordon cooked a Jamaican style breakfast with supplies brought over from their recent trip to Oxford. It's harder to get hold of such exotic foods in Northern Ireland. Then I took 2 children to jujitsu and dandered the shops while they worked it. I lost track of the time and had to run up the hill to the sports centre to meet them when it was over. One of Gordon's Jamaican aunts died suddenly last week and his mum decided to go over to be with her last remaining sister for the funeral. It's a long and arduous journey so Gordon will accompany her. We decided that Thomas and Lady should take the opportunity to go and meet some of their Jamaican relatives too. Thomas has never been and Lady went when she was only 5. It would be too much for Duncan so I will stay home with him. Well, I'll stay home for some of the time, for i will be off to London at the weekend to stay with my little sister who will be celebrating her 30th birthday. My marvellous dad will look after Duncan then, and even cancelled his own trip t London to allow me to go. What a brilliant dad he is. So during the day, we sorted out flights and hotels, insurance and car hire. They have now planned a fantastic trip to combine family duties and attendance at the funeral with a few days relaxation and fun in a nice hotel and the opportunity to tour the island. Gordon's mum will spend all but the 1st night with her sister. Am I jealous? A little, but Duncan and I might do something fun ourselves! In the evening we all realised we were hungry and someone had the inspired idea to go the the chippy. We had the best fish and chips for miles in the car (we eat in our car a lot as a family, not being the most restaurant friendly bunch just yet). Then we headed off to enjoy the last bit of evening sunshine with a drive. We stopped off at Strangford Lough and the children all had a good run around, collecting stones and shells and getting their shoes and trouser legs wet as you're supposed to on such occasions. Duncan leads the expedition. Full as I was of starch and protein, there was still plenty of room for contentment, peace, and joy in the life I find myself leading and the people who are with me on this voyage. (The photos aren't great as I took them with my poor quality phone camera. I still like them though.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sh1CfOica1I/AAAAAAAAAyk/YRVXBMNG-Ds/s1600-h/IMAGE_060.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sh1CSBfGx4I/AAAAAAAAAyc/zbhL9Ji7xJU/s1600-h/IMAGE_055.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sh1DC4Oo7eI/AAAAAAAAAy0/2WVxGqbh3VE/s1600-h/IMAGE_056.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/05/fishnchips-and-family.html", "title": "\nFish'n'chips and family\n"},

I have read more of the report and news and opinion articles on blogs and in newspapers. I have witnessed the pathetic response of the  Irish Catholic church  spokespeople, and even worse, the religious orders that perpetrated these crimes and who have no idea what true sorrow and repentance means. Then via  John's blog  I heard this man. I witnessed his anguish and his righteous anger. I do not know how those in power in government and church can allow this man, Michael O'Brien, and all the others like him who were abused in those places, to continue to suffer. This is outrageous. It is our national shame. We can't allow this to  just hold the headlines  for a few weeks and then move on to something else. There has to be a fundamental change in Irish society. You will not be able to watch this without crying. There might be a subtitled version available soon which I can embed instead. However,  Will Knott  has kindly provided a transcript of the video which is copied below. (Edit, the video is now subtitled. ) Transcript : Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m surprised at the minister there now. First of all Mr Minister (directed at  Minister Noel Dempsey) you made a bags of it in the beginning by changing the judges. You made a complete bags of it at that time, because I went to the La Foy commission and ye had seven barristers there, questioning me and telling that I was telling lies, when I told them that I got raped of a Saturday, got a merciful beating after it, and then stuffed\u2026 \u2026 he came along the following morning and put holy communion in my mouth. You don\u2019t know what happened there. You haven\u2019t the foggiest, you\u2019re talking through your hat there. And you\u2019re talking to a Fianna F\u00e1il man, a former councilor and former mayor you\u2019re talking to, that worked tooth and nail or you, for the party that you\u2019re talking about now. Ye didn\u2019t do it right, ye got it wrong. Admit it. And apologize for doing that. Because you don\u2019t know what I feel inside me. You don\u2019t know the hurt I am. You said it was non-adversarial. My God. Seven barristers. Throwing questions at us. Non-stop. I tri.. attempted to commit suicide, there\u2019s the woman who saved me from committing suicide,  on me way down from Dublin, after spending five days at the commission. Five days I spent at the commission. They brought a man over from Rome, ninety odd years of age, to tell me I was telling lies. That I wasn\u2019t beaten for an hour, non-stop by two of them. By two of them. Non-stop from head to toe without a shred of cloth on my body. My God minister. And could I speak to you (comment directed to Leo Varadkar, Fianna Gael), and ask your leader, would you stop making a political football of this. You hurt this when you do that. You tear the shreds from inside our body. For God\u2019s sake, try and give us some peace. Try to give us some peace and not to continue hurting us. That woman will tell you how many times I jump out of the bed at night with the sweat pumping out of me. Because I see these fellas at the end of the bed with their fingers doing that (gestures) to me. And pulling me in to the room, to rape me, to bugger me and bate the shite out of me. That\u2019s the way it is. And you know what? You know what, sometimes I listen to the leader of Fianna F\u00e1il. I even listened to the apology. T\u2019was mealy mouthed, but at least t\u2019was an apology. At least t\u2019was an apology. The Rosminians said in the report, they said they were easy on us. The first day I went to them. The first day to Rosminians in my home which is Ferryhouse in Clonmel, \u2019cause its the only home I know. He said \u201cyou\u2019re in it for the money\u201d. We didn\u2019t want money. We didn\u2019t want money. We wanted the pr\u2026  someone to stand up and say \u201cyes, these fellas were buggered, these people were ra\u2026\u201d Little girls. My daughter, oh sorry, my sister. A month old when she was put in to an institution. Eight of us from the one family, dragged by the ISPCC cruelty man. Put in to two cars, brought to the court in Clonmel. Left standing there without food or anything, and the fella in the long black frock and the white collar came along and he put us in to a van. Not a van, a scut truck, I don\u2019t know what you call it now. And landed us below with two hundred other boys. Two night later I was raped. How can anyone\u2026 You\u2019re talking about constitution. These people would gladly say \u201cyes\u201d to a constitution to freeze the funds of the religious orders. This state, this country of ours, would say \u201cyes\u201d to that constitution if you have to change it. Don\u2019t say you can\u2019t change it. You\u2019re the government of this state. You run this state. So for God\u2019s sake stop mealy mouthing. \u2018Cause I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m sick of it. You\u2019re turning me away from voting Fianna F\u00e1il which I have done from the first day that I could vote. Because. And you know me. You know me Mister Minister. You\u2019ve met me on a number of occasions. So you know what I\u2019m like. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/", "http://www.johnbraine.com/2009/05/a-hero-speaks.html", "http://www.thepost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=NEWS+FEATURES-qqqm=nav-qqqid=41970-qqqx=1.asp", "http://willknott.ie/2009/05/26/michael-obrien-transcript/", "http://willknott.ie/2009/05/26/michael-obrien-transcript/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/05/catholic-church-in-ireland.html", "title": "\n"},

{"date": "21 May 2009", "body": "\nWe all knew what to expect. It is still shocking though when you read  the report , or, as much of it as you can stomach. The people of the church carried it out, they covered it up. Generations of children had their lives ruined, and in some cases, taken. The state conspired with the church leaders to hush the suffering children and to ensure that their pain wasn't made known beyond the cold stone walls of the orphanages, reformatories, \"care\" homes for disabled children and industrial schools. What was done to these children was brutal, far worse than the accepted level of child abuse tolerated at almost all schools in the country, the run of the mill beatings and canings by teachers which were legal and known as corporal punishment. These were an expected part of education in those not far gone days. What happened to these children, taken from their families or who had no families, was far worse. They were abused in every way. They were beaten, bullied, raped, neglected. Reading Nick's blog today I learned of the chapter of this massive document dedicated to the abuses perpetrated in  Special Needs Schools and residential services . A table is used to show the 11 combination of types of abuse the witnesses endured. It is a long list of heart breaking tales, examples of hurts, lives destroyed, families torn apart. To pick a random example: \"I was locked in the washroom overnight. ...... ( named religious staff member) ... would walk out and close the door, you\u2019d have your ... night clothes ... on and you could stand at your basin and do what you liked but you had to stay there, no blankets, mattress, sleep on the bare floor. We used to get together in a corner and try to keep each other warm, it was scary, you\u2019d hope that nothing would happen, you could also be there on your own. ... You could be there for more than a few nights in a row, freezing cold.\" For these disabled children, the report describes how they; \"generally reported having great difficulty in finding ways of disclosing their abuse to anyone. In all instances the witnesses\u2019 particular disability was described as a barrier to communication and disclosure, both at the time and subsequently. A number stated that this difficulty was particularly highlighted when addressing such a sensitive topic as sexual abuse.\" The report also details ways in which the appalling start these people had in life has affected them as they've grown up. I do not excuse or forgive this brutalisation of the vulnerable. I cannot. I want to see a revolution. The people who did this and the others who colluded in the cover up cannot be allowed to continue to wield the power and influence over so much of Irish life any longer. We ,must stay away from their churches and ceremonies. We must freeze them out. We must take back control of our schools and hospitals, care homes and residential facilities. They cannot be allowed to get away with this. They have bullied and impeded our lives for long enough. The children who suffered in the Irish gulags are owed a duty by all citizens to stand up against the vile creatures who harmed them. It is no longer good enough to point to all the good some of the clergy and others in the religious orders have done and to say that many of them are not abusers, that the majority are decent men and women of faith. That is true, at least I think so, but then I haven't read the full report. But the leaders are up to their necks in their culpability for allowing this to happen and as such have tarnished the whole show. There must be trials and prison sentences. The guilty must be named and sent down for their crimes. The incoming leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales was wrong when he  described the people who have admitted some portion of their crimes  (and only when absolutely forced to do so as their cloak of concealment was finally dragged away) as \"courageous\". I remember being a child and how powerless I was, and I had a very safe and happy childhood. I can\u2019t imagine living in fear every day like generations of my country people have. I look at my own children, exasperating, joyful, vulnerable, hopeful and the idea that little people like them can be harmed for the perverse pleasure and convenience of religious orders fills me with fear and anger and unfortunately, hate. I am ashamed of my nationality and of my abandoned religion.

{"date": "21 May 2009", "body": "\nIn the brave new world of Irish politics, we were promised great things to come from North-South initiatives. For some bizarre reason, it was decided that the needs of autistic children in Ireland would be best met by placing a dedicated autism centre in a tiny village about half way between Belfast and Dublin. Here was an opportunity for those with a vested interest in such things to proclaim the benefits of a centre that would, we were told, be an excellent resource for everyone, north and south. It has come to nothing.  According to a  BBC report , \u00a36 million has been spent on the centre since it was approved 7 years ago, yet not a single child has been through its doors. Instead it, \"currently carries out research and training for professionals who work within the autism field\" though the founders has hoped to have children and their carers stay over in a residential block \"for assessment and therapy.... Building work was due to begin in the autumn with the facility to open in 2010.\" Now that the Irish economy is utterly banjaxed, the minister in charge has declared that they will be withdrawing funding from the centre and his Northern Irish counterpart is annoyed and has said, \"This project has to go ahead, this project will go ahead. It is important, especially in times in economic difficulties, that we don't disadvantage our most vulnerable children, our children on the autistic spectrum.\" Well that's an admirable sentiment, but the Middleton centre would be about as useful to the lives of Irish autistic people as a chocolate teapot. Middleton is in the middle of a country with appallingly bad public transport links, miles from any sizable city. The centre has a  1 page website  which sets out its aims: Training, Advice and Guidance Research and Information               Educational Assessment Learning Support      But why should people have to travel to Middleton for all this? There is already a training centre in Belfast run by Autism NI, wouldn't it make more sense to improve the services offered there than to start again form scratch? No doubt there are training services offered in the republic too that could be improved. Research and information- are we really expected to believe that a world class autism research centre can be built from scratch in a village of 240 people? Where is the nearest university? Are the very best in autism science going to move to Middleton? Are they going to equip a new lab space? Are there not already bodies like the admirable  Research Autism  set up to share \"information resource[s] for parents and professionals\" and with a charter to \"publish and disseminate research findings\"? It sounds like more wastage to me. Educational assessment and learning support can be carried out in the child's home or school. It is important to have more well trained and knowledgeable people who can do this work. Again, the funds can be put to better use to improve the training of teachers, to employ more speech and occupational therapists, well paid and dedicated classroom assistants and educational psychologists. There is so little help for parents in NI when they are told their child is autistic. There needs to be much better access to diagnosis, more of a support system in place in each area post diagnosis, more opportunities for our children to join in with groups and classes, and an overhaul of the educational opportunities available for those (the majority) who opt to have their children educated at school. However, all changes must be based on the evidence and not on the loudest voices and special interest groups calling for ABA for all or unproven biomedical treatments. I can't even begin here to address the dire state of provision for autistic adults in Ireland.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8056444.stm", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/ShU1DPTpF4I/AAAAAAAAAxw/Tt0GLT8Yw6o/s1600-h/map.png", "http://www.middletownautism.com/", "http://www.researchautism.net/pages/welcome/home.ikml"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/05/middleton-autism-centre-whats-point.html", "title": "\nMiddleton Autism Centre, what's the point?\n"},

I did all the protocol of the so call DAN doctors and the gluten and caisen free diets...Methyl-B-12 shots...Occupational therapies etc. the whole nine yards...nothing helped,  no surprise there, that stuff is all hokum  until I tried a new form of external homeopathy.  Oh, here it comes... First of all, I have to comment, and to probably no avail, as I can see your posture is quite fixed on your mindset about homeopathy, but let me just be frank...and clear...your ignorance and contempt for a medicine that has cured and ameliorated conditions for several centuries  Prove it  is quite nauseating to say the least.  Surely if I'm making you so nauseous you can find the right type of magic water to cure it!    Get over your Irish stubborness  Nope.

I also have over 15 years of a science and medical background  shall I take your word on it? I wonder what exactly this \"science and medical background\" amounts to  including an understandiing of quantum physics  Don't be daft! I've a degree and a postgraduate degree in physics and I wouldn't claim to have much of an understanding of quantum physics, more than you though I'd bet!   and that vital force that you so readily scoff at  where is it? share your evidence and I shall scoff no longer .  Quite frankly, if you think that your son is uncurable  my son is perfectly autistic, I feel no desire nor need to cure him. I only want to parent him to be the best he can ...I feel great sadness towards you and your family particularly your son  you can stuff your great sadness, we're all getting along quite delightfully well ...as you are failing him with that kind of attitude  No, you are entirely wrong .  I want to extend my help to you if you will accept  no , as a practitioner liaison who works with children on the spectrum,  I feel sad for  those  children  using the exact same cure that brought my son out of his world and into ours,   out of his world, into yours, where had he been, Mars?

They'll all be home tomorrow. He is having a good time, enjoyed the Star Trek film last night. (I want to go see it myself some day too.) I popped into see the GP yesterday, had a mole on my arm I wanted checked out. I didn't think it looked too scary but thought it best to be overcautious. Duncan and Lady came with me. Duncan pranced around the doctor's room looking for the Thomas trains, for surely, every doctor has some stashed in a box somewhere? Sadly, they weren't to be found so he hopped onto the examination bed, grabbed the pillow and telling us all about his discoveries, lay down for a few seconds. All the while I was talking with the doctor. To distract him (Duncan I mean) I asked him to look at the eye test letter chart and to read the letters. Instead of naming each letter, he made words of each line, \"zee not, dosap...\" The doc laughed, and remarked on what a clever boy he is. And my mole is entirely benign, I'm just to photo it so as to track possible changes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/05/doctor-distractions.html", "title": "\nDoctor distractions\n"},
{"date": "29 Apr 2009", "body": "\nYesterday our pooch, Pippi, was 1 year old. Isn't she gorgeous? She is a darling dog, and happily, she seems to like living with us, enjoying her runs by the beach, kibble and lots of snuggles and scratches. And Thomas is 7 today. He celebrated the big event by choosing the activities and menu for the day. His Grandma arrived this morning and joined us for a breakfast of sausages, bacon, potato bread, beans, toast and scrambled egg - marvellous. I stayed at home with Duncan (working together on his Trainz game) while the others went shopping for his birthday present, a Wii Fit balance board. That was set up and so far 3 of them have signed in and got started on the games. I haven't tried it myself yet, but it is great fun. The next meal choice was chippy fish'n'chips, and after a bit more Wii play, I took the gymnasts to their class. Amazingly they claimed to be hungry again afterwards so I made some spaghetti carbonara, the birthday boy's favourite and of course, a cake. We gathered for the cake ceremony. Duncan agreed to join in so long as no-one would sing the birthday song. He kept his hands near his ears at all times just in case though. He vacated the room before the song. Thomas looked perfectly happy with his lot. And I am happier than I can describe to have such a boy as my son. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sfi66dOGR8I/AAAAAAAAAuk/Syvk1DwCpBk/s1600-h/IMG_1518.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sfi66twsjeI/AAAAAAAAAus/8oZcMfPvFQ0/s1600-h/IMG_1536.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sfi668FCmyI/AAAAAAAAAu0/PrA-yJsZuF4/s1600-h/IMG_1551.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/04/two-birthdays.html", "title": "\nTwo Birthdays\n"},
{"date": "29 Apr 2009", "body": "\nVia Michelle Dawson's  Autism Crisis  blog, I have just read a recent  Salon article about the supposed \"burgeoning \"autism culture\" movement\" . This is presented as an idea with which \"not all parents or medical experts agree.\" Amazingly, Elizabeth Svoboda the article's author, totally misrepresented the work Michelle Dawson does and just invented a belief system for her. Ms Svoboda did not contact Michelle before writing about her. Michelle works as an autism researcher but is mistakenly called a \"autistic-rights crusader\" who \"convinced the Canadian Supreme Court to overturn an appeal that would have provided state funding for ABA therapy.\" Read  Michelle's post  to learn the truth about her court appearances. Ms Svoboda writes,  Like the deaf culture movement before it, the so-called autistic culture movement continues to gain traction, boasting thousands of adherents among parents, patients and healthcare professionals. And the rhetoric is often as strident as anything out of the deaf-pride movement. Some autistic people even use the pejorative term \"curebie\" to refer to people who hope for a cure for the condition. Organizations like  Autism Network International  view efforts to cure autism as similar to misguided efforts to cure homosexuality and left-handedness. As its associated swag -- buttons and T-shirts proclaiming \"I am not a puzzle, I am a person\" -- suggests, the movement aims to redefine autism as something to be valued and protected, not obliterated. Proponents insist that forcing autistic people to behave like \"neurotypicals,\" a term that borders on insulting, squelches the very qualities that make them unique. Ooh scary, rude people, calling those who push any old untested, dangerous and painful \"treatments\" on little autistic children by pejorative terms and calling people whose brains function in a typical way the borderline insulting term, \"neurotypical.\" Would she prefer they (we) be called  normal ? Also, few would call those who merely  hope  for a cure curbies. Like others I know, I don't much like the words  curbie  and  neurotypical  and prefer to use  pro-cure  and  non-autistic  (or when referring to children,  typically developing ). Is there anything wrong with autistic people proclaiming their personhood on buttons and T-shirts? Does Ms Svoboda have any idea of the long history of dehumanising language and treatment autistic people have endured and continue to endure? There are a few examples on the  Autism Demonized  blog and more on my blog under the label \" disablism .\" Neither can I understand how Ms Svoboda, came to the conclusions she did based on the quotes given by the 3 supposed representatives of \"autism as a culture\" in her article. Ari Ne\u2019eman, president of the  Autistic Self Advocacy Network  is quoted as saying,  \"The real ends for autistic people should be quality of life, full access in society, the kinds of things we support and are working for. Parents have been told that the way to approach these things is to support research for a cure, but our belief is that that's not the most effective paradigm. The cure paradigm sends a message that there is somehow a normal person under the autistic person, and that's a significant denial of who we are.\" These are reasonable points to make. A cure is not going to help autistic children and the adults they will become. I don't see how this can be rephrased, as Ms Svoboda does as, \"Jenny McCarthy can go jump off a cliff\"? I think she's setting out a false alternative of cure versus culture when it's a bit more complicated than that. Kathleen Seidel  is quoted as saying,  \"A person's nervous system is not fundamentally going to change -- an autistic person is going to remain autistic throughout his or her lifetime. And it can be very problematic and a source of stress for an autistic child to have to suppress certain mannerisms.\" No, nothing about autism-as-a-culture there either. Dora Raymaker  is quoted as explaining her preference to communicate via text chat,  \"If we'd done this interview on the telephone you would have been lucky to get much more than disjointed, stuttering, completely non sequitur responses from me. But because you allowed me to do this interview through text-only media where I can slow down, really understand you, and bypass my difficulties with spoken language, I'm able to give you intelligent, on topic answers. Do I need a pill to make me suddenly able to have phone conversations, or do I need you to be able to find a middle ground that bypasses my disabilities?\" Oh dear, Dora actually used the \"D\" word! But never mind, just misrepresent her too and pretend she thinks autism is just a difference: The key assumption that underlies much autistic culture discourse is that any autism-related limitations can be worked around and dealt with in a way that does not compromise the autistic individual's core \"personhood.\" When such workarounds are found, Raymaker asserts, the concept of a \"cure\" becomes irrelevant.  From my reading of the piece, Ms Svoboda would do well to read a bit about the  social model of disability .  Some people have mobility-related limitations that can be worked around with the use of a wheelchair and assessible transport and services. These do not compromise the person's core \"personhood.\" Harold Doherty is interviewed and does his party party piece of making stuff up about those uncaring neurodiveristy types. Then near the end of the article Ms Svoboda makes the following  fabulous claim, that \"the autistic culture movement may come off as dogmatic at times.\" Oh my. When compared to pro-cure proponents like the aforementioned Jenny McCarthy and her Generation Rescue buddies, the tricksy lawyer, the ABA battlers, sure, those of us who reckon autistic people should be treated well and not cured or eliminated are really dogmatic!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/04/elizabeth-svobodas-autism-culture.html", "http://www.autreat.com/", "http://demonized.autistics.org/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/", "http://autism.change.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/04/autism-culture-in-salon.html", "title": "\nAutism Culture in Salon\n"},

{"date": "23 Apr 2009", "body": "\nI was very interested to read a few comments on my  \"Horse Boy\" blog post  from Kristin Neff, the mother of the child featured in the book. I don't think she likes what I had to say. I am happy to respond to her comments but since she wrote so much, I thought it warranted a separate blog post. My comments will be in  red  below. Comment 1  Might be a good idea to read the book before slamming it.  I have not slammed the book so much as the  media articles I have read  and listened to about the book and by the book's author. I have read  several long   excerpts  from the book in a UK newspaper and listened to a detailed and uncritical radio interview with your husband on Irish radio. I have made it clear that my criticisms are based on all these. It's amazing how quick people are to judge things, with almost no information to go on.  I disagree that I have judged with \"no information\". The book has featured prominently in many major newspapers and magazines. All the information made public in these gives me plenty to make a judgement on. I am Rowan's mother, subject of the Horseboy, and I can tell you that I feel like I used to when people would judge me at the supermarket when Rowan was having a tantrum, assuming I was a horrible mother and Rowan a brat, without knowing anything about us at all.  Do you really call your son \"Horseboy\"?  [Edit, she never called him \"Horseboy\", I made an error and apologise for this.]  Wow. I'm sorry that you are upset at my criticism's of your husband's articles and what I have read of his book. It appears from what I have seen, that most people think what you've done is just great and admirable. I don't. When you decided to make your story so widely known you must have expected there would be some people who would be shocked and offended at what you have done and have said. Neither do I agree that this is comparable to strangers making snap judgements  in supermarkets. I hope people take more time to learn about you and understand your personal stories before making such harsh and unkind judgments.  People are free to judge me based on what I have made available in my writing here. I have a few detractors, but this is a blog of little importance so I am ignored by most. Whether my criticisms can be deemed harsh and unkind is, I think, a matter of opinion. And in fact, based on ther viewpoints you've expressed here, I think many of you will actually find resonance in the book. We've had hundreds of e-mails from other autism parents (those who have actually read the book or seen the documentary) who've expressed their gratitude that we were able to raise awareness of the incredible struggles but incredible love we have for our wonderful children.  That's nice. I think there's already plenty of awareness of our struggles and love and not enough about respecting autistic people and their needs. (In fact, this is why our next book will about about the Gifts of Autism, because we believe that for every problem posed by autism there is a corresponding gift that us supposedly \"normal\" people can learn from.)  Smart move, I'm sure there will be a market for it too. By the way, the first thing we did when we got the advance was to open up a non-profit riding center for families who couldn't otherwise afford hippo-therapy (soaking up a huge portion of the advance). We wanted to give back to the autism community for our incredible good fortune.  Cool, so the poor children in the area can ride for free or at a greatly reduced cost? Do you offer shamanic healing at your centre or is it more like the many great equestrian centres  already   out there working with disabled people? I hope all of you also find happiness, fulfilment, and prosperity in your lives. Autism parents are some of the bravest and most loving people around. Can't we support each other?  Thank you for your kind wishes. Some parents of autistic people are brave and kind, some aren't. I'll support those whom I think are working to make life better for people like my son and I'll speak out against those who I see preaching nonsense and disablist language about people like him. Comment 2 Also, since I suspect that the views expressed in this blog will make it unlikely many will actually read the book, you might be interested in this passaage from the end of the book (p. 348-349). \"Rowan is still autistic - his essence, his many talents, are all tied up with it. He has been healed of the terrible dysfunctions that afficted him - his physical and emotional incontinence, his neurological firestorms, his anxiety and hyperacivity.  Kristin, I consider the expression \"emotional and physical incontinence\" to be a revolting way of describing a child. What do you mean also by \"neurological firestorms\"? Could this be temper tantrums? I agree we all wish for our children to grow out of incontinence, have much fewer tantrums, be less anxious and hyperactive. I also agree that such development, which usually takes longer for autistic children, does not mean that the person is no longer autistic. But he has not been cured. Nor would I want him to be. To \"cure\" him, in terms of trying to tear the autism out, now seems to me completely wrong Why can't he exist between the worlds, with a foot in both, as many neurotypical people do? Think of immigrants to the United States, living with one foot in their home language and culture, the other in the West, walking in two worlds. It is a rich place to be. Can Rowan keep learning the skills necessary to swim in our world while retaining the magic of his own? It seems a tangible dream. I like this sentiment a lot.  Comment 3 And one final thing. One of the sad aspects of many people's dismissive reactions to the idea that we consulted traditional healers and shamans to help our son is the incredible arrogance and ethonocentrism of Westerns who believe that no healing tradition has any validity except their own. I dismiss that which has never been shown to work. If shamans can prove their effectiveness then let them do their healing thing everywhere. That's not arrogant \"ethnocentrism\" just applied reason. Humans had to find ways to improve well-being and happiness for thousands of years before modern science came along, and many of these healing traditions are very effective.   That something has existed for a long time is no proof that it is worth continuing with, especially not when dealing with health and medicine. If the ancient remedy is shown to work (like willow bark) it is used in modern medicine. There is just medicine that works and that which doesn't.  (Not saying that science isn't also wonderful of course, and by the way we do use traditional therapies such as ABA as well, but do we have to restrict and limit our options?)   Yes I read an article about your son 2 years ago in the  Times , that you used, \"speech and occupational therapy, applied behavioural analysis, chelation to get rid of toxins, supplements to adjust the child\u2019s chemistry this way or that.\" These techniques were not based on science either, chelation in particular is potentially fatal. Still you make out that it's the horses and shaman stuff that has wrought this amazing, no, miraculous change in your son? How do you know? It's nice that you think science is wonderful. I think so too and apply a bit of scientific thinking in weighing up stories like yours. If you were to spend any time around traditional cultures, you'd observe their beauty and integrity for yourself. My husband has been a tireless advocate for the rights of indigenous cultures, spending years of his life, without pay, to advocate for their land rights (he played a key role in the San of Southern Africa winning one of the largest land claims in history.) But people are so quick to ridicule and dismiss what they don't understand.   I'm sure there are many fascinating, beautiful and wonderful aspects to cultures you have been around. I am happy that your husband works to advocate with these. I do not ridicule the people, but I do not wish to adopt methods of medicine that have no basis in evidence, no matter how lovely the people practicing it are nor how long they have used it. As parents of autistic children we understand this attitude all too well don't we, when people make fun of and dismiss our children without bothering to try to know or understand them? Isn't there a better way? A way where love and tolerance and patience and compassion allow us to open our hearts and minds to each other, rather than viciously attacking what is different and unfamiliar?  Not similar at all. The people are not being dismissed, just their non effective medicine. I do not viciously attack them at all, they perhaps are limited in the medicine available to them in far flung corners of the world. I have not viciously attacked you or your husband either, but I am irritated that you who should know better can believe in magic, can use your son to market a book in a dramatic way that jumps on the autism bandwagon, choose to use offensive and disablist language in describing autism and your son and promote nonsensical healing \"exorcism\" ceremonies that can only be described as abusive.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1145145/The-horse-saved-son-Little-Rowans-life-devastated-autism--hope-unlikely-inspiring-way.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1146044/Id-dragged-autistic-son-Mongolia-healed-horses-witchdoctors-Had-I-totally-lost-mind.html", "http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2393112.ece"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/04/horse-mum-gets-in-touch.html", "title": "\nHorse Mum gets in touch\n"},

He's getting changed. Today he dressed up as Donald Duck by putting a pull-up nappy over his pants to create a nice bulky white bum, and wearing a blue T-shirt with 4 cardboard \"buttons\" stuck on with tape. A couple of days ago, he and I were in town with the girl who lives next door. We'd dropped the others off at gymnastics and were on our way to the charity shop to buy videos. Then, Duncan was dressed in a new long, navy dressing gown, short green \"Peter Pan\" trousers, wellies and a back-to-front blue cap and carrying a torch. He was, as will no doubt be obvious, Professor Ludwig Von Drake. Our neighbour, rather admiringly described his look as \"extremely random.\" She's a great girl.   Last seen in an Irish town, bowing graciously as he went. Thomas went to work with Gordon today. He called me to tell me he'd been all around the labs and seen a cell under a microscope and wanted one of his own. A microscope that is. He wanted to figure out how many cells we each have and then about how many cells are in all the people in the world. Later they went to the cinema together, and from the photo I was emailed this afternoon I can deduce they were in the Victoria Square Shopping Centre. After the film they went for tapas. They're having a great old time. Thomas with the dazzling Belfast city skyline. After persuading his dad he needed hot chocolate. Duncan's new favourite thing is his Vtech camera. He can take photos and videos whenever he wants and incorporate them into his films. He made a film a few days ago, in which he videoed a YouTube film as it played and sang along and gave a bit of helpful commentary. It's posted on his blog  here . The other children have had loads of fun with the camera too, taking shots of Pippi and using the special effects to frame their faces with horns or a viking helmet.

{"date": "15 Apr 2009", "body": "\nA few weeks ago  I shared some thoughts  on a recently published book, a new addition to the autism-parent canon. In this one, instead of using a dog, a restrictive diet, behaviourism or some random, off-label and unproven combination of medications to  defeat the dread autism , the parent has subjected the autistic child to shaman \"healing\" rituals and dragged the boy, with a film crew, across Mongolia on horse back. The post was read by New York Times journalist Motoko Rich, who contacted me for an interview as she was writing an article on the Horse Boy book which was released in the USA this week. Her article appeared today with the unfortunate headline;  A Gallop Toward Hope: One Family\u2019s Adventure in Fighting Autism . Fighting autism- ouch. It's clearly a brilliant article, and my inclusion hasn't created any bias in my opinion. Really. In writing about Rowan\u2019s experiences, Mr. Isaacson is careful to avoid the word \u201ccure,\u201d but writes of an amazing \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201chealing.\u201d That has some prospective readers wary. Sharon Fennell, a mother of three in Belfast, Northern Ireland, whose 8-year-old son is autistic, said she had read newspaper excerpts and reviews in Britain, where the book came out last month. She questioned whether Rowan\u2019s progress could be attributed to what happened in Mongolia or to just typical changes that all children go through. \u201cTo make this story more engaging, it has to be portrayed as something miraculous and fantastical, because ordinary, everyday, slow-plodding progress does not read so well,\u201d Ms. Fennell said. OK so I'll get over myself now. It was interesting to learn the inside story of the publishing deal: ...the publisher paid more than $1 million in an advance to Mr. Isaacson before he and his family had even taken their Mongolian trip.  Michael Pietsch, publisher of Little, Brown, said booksellers had already placed orders high enough to justify a first printing of 150,000 copies.  \u201cIt just touched so many points of interest \u2014 helping to heal an autistic child, traveling under difficult circumstances,\u201d Mr. Pietsch said. \u201cMost of all, I felt this was a story entirely driven by the chances you\u2019ll take for love, and I felt, who\u2019s not going to want to read this story when they hear the outlines of it?\u201d The publisher also admits,  \u201cthat regardless of the outcome in Mongolia, we thought he would write a very moving and interesting and dramatic book.\u201d  So Isaacson went off with his son knowing he had to produce a tale worthy of the wad of cash he'd already been handed. What would he have done if there hadn't actually been an acceptably dramatic level of progress in the boy's development? Is there a chance that he might have...massaged the truth, made it more saleable and sensational? Actually, I hope he  did  exaggerate when he described the shaman ceremony in which his little son was surrounded by strangers beating drums and passed, kicking and screaming, to an old woman who spat vodka all over him. Of course, ordinarily, this sort of thing would be called by it's real name- child abuse- but anything goes,  or so it seems , when it comes to \"fighting\" autism. Dr Paul Offit, whose book  Autism's False Prophets , is  one of the best I've read recently  is less than impressed with the book's premise. He's said to think that: anecdotal examples of recovery like that in \u201cThe Horse Boy\u201d could give parents \u201cfalse hope\u201d and lead them to spend thousands of dollars trying to replicate an experience without any scientific proof that it would help. The NY Times blog has  collected more opinions on the book . Oddly, those questioned appear to be giving their opinion on Mongolian horse/shaman therapy as if it's even worthy of a moment's serious consideration. Temple Grandin, well known autistic author and animal scientist, said that \"it\u2019s important to expose young autistic kids to new things,\" something I'd agree with, and something you don't have to go to Mongolia for, no matter whether you head off with $1 million in your pocket or not. Simon Baron-Cohen, ( lovely man ) points out that all children, and not just those with autism, \"develop in leaps and bounds rather than having some kind of steady, linear increase.\" He also said,  \"The combination of a story about a child with autism and a location that\u2019s outside the West; throw in the extra ingredient of communicating across species, and maybe a touch of mysticism with the shamanism \u2014 you\u2019ve obviously got a lot of ingredients for interesting drama, and it\u2019s very televisual. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to tell us about the nature of autism or what would constitute a useful treatment.\" I agree with him, and also with  Ari Ne\u2019eman, president of the  Autistic Self Advocacy Network  who spoke of \"public attitudes that autism is some sort of appendage that attaches itself to a normal child rather than an aspect of a normal person\u2019s development that doesn\u2019t go away.\" He also recognised the \"role of emotional support animals\" and mentioned the ASAN advocacy to ensure people's legal rights to have such animals. His quote ends,  \"My hope is that people can take the message of acceptance that an autism diagnosis doesn\u2019t have to result in the end of one\u2019s life either as an individual or a family.\" University of California psychiatry professor, Sally Rogers describes the studies of autism treatments in which children in placebo groups: \"show as much improvement as the intervention group. When that occurs in a child with autism, my assumption is that being in the study changes the expectations of the caregivers and the caregivers\u2019 behavior changes as a result.\" ... \"So part of what I wonder about is whether their expectations from the experiences they are having are changing for their child, and that\u2019s changing not only their expectations, but their behavior. And that results in changes in the responses of the child.\"  This is important and highlights the effect that parental effort, attitude and expectations can have on their child's development. The so called \"horse boy\" liked riding, and hopefully, despite the trials he was subjected to, enjoyed having more of his father's attention than he would presumably have had usually, even if he did have to contend with a film crew tagging along capturing every moment of engagement. A paediatrician called Dr. Rosen bafflingly reckons we should look more into \u201cn of one\u201d research studies. But what about statistics, which a clever man once said, exists to stop us making fools of ourselves? Sarah Spence, paediatric neurologist thinks \"these books do inspire hope for a lot of people with this disorder, which is very difficult and can make some families feel very hopeless.\" I'm not so sure, I think these books can be harmful in that they present autism in such a negative light, they portray autistic people in discriminatory and damaging ways, and they claim that without some sort of dazzlingly unlikely breakthrough, autistic people are unlikely to make any progress. They are frequently false. They sometimes (as in this case) portray dangerous or highly aversive practices (horse riding without helmets, vodka spitting strangers) as necessary and minimise the importance of empathetic, accepting and understanding parenting and optimised and targeted education methods. They can be good at showing how it's is possible to use an autistic child's interests and preferences to help him or her to learn and develop, but they imply that without the particular system described in each particular book, the child would be lost...trapped forever in the fortress of their autism. Which is crap. I dread the film. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/books/15horse.html", "http://www.autism-watch.org/", "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/healing-autism-with-horses/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/04/horse-boy-book-and-me-in-new-york-times.html", "title": "\nHorse Boy Book -and me- in the New York Times\n"},
{"date": "1 Apr 2009", "body": "\nIt was wonderful. We left the children in the capable hands of their grandparents and headed off to the airport. As soon as we left home, I was on holiday, off duty. Marvellous. Our flight was perfectly pleasant, we landed in the afternoon and took a train into Paris, changing once to get to the station near the  Arc de Triomphe  from where we walked for 15 minutes or so to our hotel. Just before we made it indoors, the rain started, soon followed by some very rubbish hail. The hotel we'd picked was nice enough, small and friendly. The room wasn't anything special, but there was a bed and all the other stuff you need from a hotel room so it did us grand. We were keen to get out and see around so we dandered off in the opposite direction to how we'd arrived and soon ended up by the  Palais des Congr\u00e8s , an arts venue and shopping centre. We had coffees inside and then spent some time wandering the supermarket, feeling utterly jealous of the French approach to food production, supply and preparation. There was such a wonderful selection of great food and though we'd reservations for dinner later that night, we couldn't resist buying a small selection to take back to our room. We returned to the hotel for some chilling time and sampled just a tiny bit of the irresistible food we'd bought. I was getting well into some TV documentary about early humans and their struggle for survival. It was far more explicit than what would be shown on UK or Irish channels in the afternoon, and all the better for it. But I had to tear myself away from the box to get dolled up as best I could. A reservation had made at  Senderens , a hugely posh restaurant. We had to take a taxi as I was wearing stupid shoes, not my usual practical and sensible gear. And the restaurant, wow - other worldly. It was very attractive inside and the food was like something prepared by angels to torture our fallible and flawed human forms with perfection that we will never be able to attain. Not unless we shell out for another top rated, pricey Parisian restaurant anyway. It was so very good. Next morning we had the rest of our supermarket procured food in our room, and a fine start to the day it was too. Then we went out and walked for miles, down to the Trocadero area where we very obviously took photos of each other in front of the Eiffel Tower. It was dry but fairly cold and I was glad I'd packed gloves and a scarf. We headed east along the river, following the south bank for a while then switching north and passing  Place de la Concorde  and on to  Ile de la Cit\u00e9  all the while marvelling at the beauty and grandeur of the city. It's so very different from Belfast! So we dandered up to the  Centre Pompidou  and walked the streets for a bit looking for somewhere to eat. Before long we spotted exactly what we wanted, a cafe set over a bakery, with such an array of bread and pastries downstairs that we knew we'd be well set if we ate upstairs. So we had brunch, and it was as fine a meal as what we'd had the night before. The bread and croissants were the best we've ever eaten, the coffee was good and the atmosphere was fantastic. Now we embarked on our quest to enjoy some more trashy culture and we took a train out to Disneyland Paris. We've been before, but wanted to ride the faster, scarier rides without having to worry about who would look after the children. We had such a blast, and managed to go on 4 roller coasters and the Tower of Terror. Next morning we just had time to have another great breakfast and do a bit of shopping before getting a bus back to the airport and flying back to Belfast. The children had all been fine and had enjoyed their time with Granda and G. and as ever, it was great to be home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lucascarton.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/04/paris-report.html", "title": "\nParis Report\n"},
{"date": "19 Apr 2009", "body": "\n Lady has been staying with one of her friends and her family in their Donegal caravan for a few days. Gordon and I took the boys into Belfast on the train yesterday morning. Duncan was so chilled out as we travelled. We went to St George's Market first. I'd hoped he would have enjoyed it like when we last were there and he was enthralled by the large clock with the visible mechanism. But the crowd and live music bothered him too much yesterday and I'd forgotten to bring his ear defenders or hat so he darted in with hands over his ears for just long enough to spy a bag of fudge for sale, ask me to buy it, and then he went back out and sat on some stairs. Gordon and Thomas wandered around the market for a while while I sat by Duncan. We shared a little fudge, unfortunately it was horrible. I asked if he wanted to go in to look at the clock, but he said, \"Daddy and Thomas love the market, Duncan loves the stairs and Mummy loves Duncan.\" He's not wrong. After this we walked to Victoria Square shopping centre. Duncan had livened up a bit by then and rushed off ahead of us trying to find somewhere that stocked  Thomas & Friends  toys. He had decided that he wanted a  Tomy Fearless Freddie . Argos was no help so we went to the Hamleys store and he found a different friend of Thomas (the engine) to purchase. Thomas (the boy) chose a microscope. I paid for both items and we left the shop and headed to Nandos for an early lunch. Duncan has been eating chicken most days recently, a welcome addition to his previously limited and low protein diet so it was great to see him eating something in a restaurant and behaving quite well. It helped that there were few other customers, we were sitting in a large booth and he had a brand new toy to focus on. As we left, he realised that the dinosaur book he'd been carrying around earlier was nowhere to be seen. I knew he must have put it down while he examined the toys in Hamleys so we had to make our way back there and lo, there it was. It took a while to extricate the boys from the toy store again and we decided to make our way slowly back to the station to get the next train home. On the way, Duncan darted off into a toy and crafts shop which also boasted a large collection of  Thomas & Friends  stuff as well as puppets, Lego and other interesting booty. He spied some modelling clay and chose a few packets, in all the colours needed to create an effigy of his new favourite, Donald Duck. Being only a few pounds each and of \"educational value\" I decided to buy them for him, but my purse was not in my bag. The last time I'd used it had been in Hamleys so we had to all troop back there once again. The woman who'd served me when I bought the toys, and who'd given me back the lost book was amused to see me back again, asking if I fancied someone working there or something. Ha bloody ha. Anyway, the purse wasn't there, so I had to look in Nandos, and thankfully, they  had  found it. By now a bit fed up with my less than simple day out, we rushed back to catch the train, and guess what, at the ticket barrier, I couldn't find the flaming ticket. I'd probably pulled it out off my back pocket when I'd been searching madly for the missing purse. The woman working there let us through anyway (Gordon has a season ticket) as I think she'd remembered us coming through earlier when I was running after Duncan as he raced into the shop. What a kerfuffle! One thing I know for next time, is to carry a larger bag. But it was a beautiful day so we decided to risk another outing. This time, we drove to Gordon's mum's house and left the boys there. Then we ran back home with Pippi dog, a 6 mile journey along the coast. It was beautiful and is by far the longest run I've done for years. I did OK too, not needing to stop except after going up some steep steps near the end. Gordon then rushed back to get the boys, but his mum had found looking after them both hard work this time so we've decided not to ask her to do it again. We'll need to find another babysitter if we want to go out together on Saturdays. Tell you what, I'm stiff and sore as nuts today though. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SeshrE13hqI/AAAAAAAAAuc/leFKxRxjh7M/s1600-h/IMAGE_034.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Ser2PD2eUgI/AAAAAAAAAuU/hC4v3dmQhBo/s1600-h/IMAGE_033.jpg", "http://www.tomy.co.uk/products/fearless-freddie/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/04/absent-minded-mum.html", "title": "\nAbsent minded mum\n"},

{"date": "27 Mar 2009", "body": "\nGordon and I took Duncan to the doctor yesterday. In my referral letter, they'd said that the building was being renovated in parts so we were to use an alternative entrance and that parking might be limited. Duncan likes going to this hospital, calls it the nice hospital as he likes playing with the toys in the waiting room. Unfortunately, we were told to wait in a different area, crowded with people of all ages. Duncan was not pleased and wailed and cried and shouted. I asked the receptionist if we could go the other waiting room as it's what he's used to and what he expects when we go there. I hadn't known it would be so different and he was unprepared for such a change. I was told we could not. So he cried and shouted some more and the others waiting either avoided eye contact or adopted that pursed lip, disapproving look at my \"very naughty\" boy and my inability to \"control\" him. I told Gordon (who was not able to help him either) that I was going to wait in the car and asked him to get me when they were ready. Instead he gave the receptionist our phone number and joined us in the car. After a few minutes we were called out and led to the  toy filled waiting room  which I'd wanted to go to originally! What an avoidable load of hassle. Eventually we were seen, a full hour after our appointment time, and in a tiny room located right beside a load of builders wielding jackhammers and drills. All this conspired to make a very unsettled boy. Duncan played for a while but soon got upset again and was looking for a toy train he played with at a previous appointment there. I was utterly frazzled and Gordon wasn't doing much better. I looked after Duncan in a quiet hallway while Gordon talked to the doctor. We're going to get some involvement for the first time ever from the social care team, who might be able to help us find some activities for Duncan. We also got a prescription for a methylphenidate drug at the lowest dose. I'll get the medicine early next week and we shall try it out, that is if I can get Duncan to take it, and see what happens.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/but-thats-not-what-i-expected.html", "title": "\nBut that's not what I expected!\n"},
{"date": "25 Mar 2009", "body": "\nI listened to Stephen Nolan's bumptious phone-in show on local radio this morning. He had a few people on discussing our  climate change denier  Minister for the Environment, Sammy Wilson and his latest kerfuffle in Stormont. The Belfast Telegraph reports that his  department admitted  that he, \"did not consult any    scientific articles when deciding not to air the Westminster-sponsored Act    on CO2 ads.\" Naw, our Sammy came up with that grand idea off his own back. He knows better that them scientists with their ungodly evidence. He  called another assembly member  the 'carbon king of Stormont' because he lives 100 miles from the parliament building and has to drive, public transport links in NI being utterly pathetic, and getting worse the further west you go. But then, once the drone of whinging politicians blended to innocuous background noise to my kitchen cleaning endeavours, Johnny Ball was on the air again, blustering about matters he doesn't understand and ruining my good opinion of him. He used to be an exuberant presenter of children's TV shows about maths and science, and is fondly remembered by nerdy types of a certain age: But he has turned cranky in his old age. He said today that \"Sammy Wilson is right.\" \"People are talking about a carbon footprint. Carbon dioxide is half as heavy as air again. It falls to the ground and it feeds the plants. A tree is made of CO2, it puts the oxygen back into the atmosphere and takes the carbon. 85% of every tree is CO2... When you're talking about CO2 you're helping the plants, you could say you're greening the planet.\" I think that here, Johnny has employed the logical fallacy known as the  WTF? fallacy . But he goes on (and on and on) and eventually, near the end of the interview, he gets to the \"dangers of scientific consensus.\" He even has examples, 100 years ago, so Johnny says, all the scientists agreed about eugenics. I think he's trying to make the point that we're more enlightened now and have moved on from those bad old days, something I'm not so sure about. He also mentions how in Darwin's day, the consensus was against him. But he neglects to mention that the science consensus changed to adopt the new ideas when they were explained, understood and backed up by huge amounts of  evidence . Does Johnny really think that scientific consensus is always dangerous? What about our ideas on gravity, germ theory, what about consensus on units of measurement? What a ridiculous argument. Silly old duffer. And why on earth has he been asked to come on to the programme to talk about climate change? Is it really reasonable for the BBC to allow this man 7 minutes to talk a load of old nonsense, just because he was once a wacky kind of kids TV presenter?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/environment/environment-minister-sammy-wilson-i-still-think-manmade-climate-change-is-a-con-14123972.html", "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/environment/sammy-accused-of-lsquosolo-runrsquo-on-climate-change-ad-ban-14241106.html", "http://www.nwipp-newspapers.com/FH/free/351490121756565.php", "http://www.skepticsfieldguide.net/2006/07/examples-of-wtf-fallacy.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/johnny-ball-what-happened-to-you.html", "title": "\nJohnny Ball, what happened to you?\n"},
{"date": "21 Mar 2009", "body": "\nI've had better days. Sure I've had worse, but I'm worn out and feeling negative. Dealing with Duncan today was no picnic. He's been shouting, screaming, wanting to have things go his way and making loud protestations when they don't or can't. My head hurts from the noise. He's full of plans to act out songs and not everyone wants to play along. Lady had 2 girls over to play for a while and he was roaring and thumping on her door to get them all to line up and pretend to be marching ants or something. Later, he threw a toy and it hit a picture hanging over our bed, shattered the glass which scattered all over the bed and floor. Thankfully he'd been standing in the doorway and wasn't hurt, and it had been an accident but it made me feel closer to overload. He was very sorry and drew one of his apology pictures. But he's been acting, I think, more loud and hyperactive recently. It might be an effect of winter weather and not having enough time outdoors, which will improve with the better weather. He has an appointment with the paediatrician soon and I have been reading about people having ADHD with autism and looking into stimulant medications. It seems from the trials that children with both conditions can benefit from very small doses of stimulants like Ritalin. I will talk to the doctor about the possibility of trialing one of these drugs with Duncan, using the smallest possible dose and keeping a careful eye on the side-effects it might have. Though I'm anxious about using such medication, at least I can be sure these drugs are approved for the treatment of ADHD. I think it's worth trying it out as it might help him concentrate more on tasks other than film making, and help him learn more easily. And if it doesn't help or has side effects, there is no noted risk to suddenly stopping the medication and we can try something else. There's always something else to try, drugs are NOT \"my last hope\" or anything. If this fails or if I'm advised not to try them, we'll be fine. On a related matter, I was tidying a cupboard and showed Duncan some pictures of his old school, not the one he went to last and which he asked to leave, but the school before that which he had always (as far as I could tell) enjoyed. I had preferred that school too and only moved him as the 2nd school had opened a dedicated autism unit which I'd thought would benefit him more. But the home-school communication wasn't as good as at school 1; there were a few notes home that baffled me. For instance, I was told once that Duncan wouldn't settle down and insisted on \"running around too much\" during a PE class in the  school gym ! Anyway, Duncan asked to go to the school and named one of the children in the picture. This is a child he hasn't seen or heard about for 3 years! I asked him in surprise if he wanted to go to school, and he said, \"go to school and play with the toys and then come home again.\" I got thinking, often a dangerous pursuit. Perhaps it is time to try out school again for him. (Lady and Thomas are utterly uninterested in school.) While I can take him out with me, there are  no groups around here  that he can be part of, unlike his siblings who are in various sports and social clubs and who see their friends from the street regularly. He went to a Saturday club for learning disabled children twice but he was just too autistic for them, and anyway, it closed. There are pros and cons no matter what I decide, and I just want to know what is best. Again, if he does go and is not happy, I can simply stop sending him, but is it worth the potential upset to find out? I'm going to contact the educational psychologist and ask to meet her again and then I'll take a tour of the schools and meet the teachers. He will have to go to one of the \"special\" schools as there is no such thing yet as proper inclusive education and he would flounder at a mainstream school. Besides, I'm not counting on school to provide the main aspects of his education, he'll still get that at home. I just want him to have a chance to go out somewhere and be with other people now and then. No doubt I'll update here when I know more.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/decisions.html", "title": "\nDecisions\n"},

A few special \"chuckie\"cakes  (don't bother me with the spelling M, I'm being ironic!) got the green, white and orange beans and these we took to my dad's place where we were having dinner. We all had a lovely evening, Thomas played Kerplunk with anyone willing to give him a game, Duncan jumped on the bed and pulled the rail off a wardrobe - oops. Daddy said that he had to sort his clothes out anyway. Right. Duncan also enjoyed a few tickling and tumbling games with his Granda, especially \"throw me over the balcony,\" an exciting swinging game and \"take him away\" in which he kisses Granda who pretends to want rid of him and I or another volunteer try to prise him away. They invent new ones every month or so and it's all very exciting. Duncan headed off to the loo taking the Argos catalogue with him so I knew it was a sit-down assignment. A few minutes later we heard pouring water and he'd decided to run himself a bath. He had a lovely wee soak, splashed the bathroom and got himself all nice and clean again. Eventually I decided I'd allowed everyone to enjoy the pleasure of my boisterous boys for long enough and we headed home. It was nice to be asked out, much better than sitting home all day. In the car, Thomas was muttering to himself then wondered aloud what his last word would be. He'd had a first word, he explained, so it made sense that he had to have a last word too. I said that my last words would probably be something like, \"just another slice please!\" Later in the evening Lady returned after a very successful trip to Donegal with her pals. Unfortunately she arrived at that part of the day when I've just about run out of cheer and good will and I was giving out to Duncan for some mess or other he'd created and she was saddened to see me cross and sadder still that her Daddy would be away for the next 3 nights for meetings and lectures. But they had a great chat the next morning and she felt better again. The next day we ladies watched  Pride and Prejudice  ( Ehle and Firth version , yummy) while I combed her matted hair for hours. It's all nicely plaited again now. Then while the gymnasts in the family did their thing, Duncan and I went shopping, he sitting in the Tesco trolly for disabled children. Right by the trolley park was a mound of Easter eggs in Thomas the Tank boxes. Uh oh, chocolate and Thomas combined, a potent mix. He picked one up, examined it and said, \"Thomas! Duncan likes it the  best !\" Then he thought for a while and said, \"and Thomas likes Doctor Who the best and Lady likes Bratz the best.\" (He's a few years out of date with that last, but it's nice he's thinking of them.) I asked, \"What does Mummy like the best?\" He answered, \"Mummy likes Duncan the best\" earning a big smile and affirming hug from me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112130/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/who-do-you-love-best.html", "title": "\nWho do you love the best?\n"},
{"date": "7 Mar 2009", "body": "\nWhat do people think of the term \"special needs\" to mean disabilities? I don't like it. I know it's in common use. Disabled children in UK schools who need them are allotted (often after a fight from their parents against intransigent education authorities)  statements of special educational needs . When I lived in outer London, we used a toy library and went to a fantastic playgroup at the   Project for Children with Special Needs . In fact, in my old Borough (Richmond Upon Thames) there are a whole load of services with the \"special needs\" label. It strikes me however as an anachronistic term. I don't know of any disabled person who would describe themselves as having special needs, sort of like  normal  people but with extra,  special  additional needs. It is a term I think, only parents and professionals would use and usually only when referring to young children. It has a very infantilising ring to it, to my ears anyway. I am asking these questions now as I recently learned (via  jypsy  and then on  Dave Hingsburger's blog  )of a Facebook group created to tackle the hundreds of other Facebook groups and pages whose aim/title mocks disabled people, groups started by people with a droll wit of almost Wildean proportions with titles like \"Hott Retardz\" (that's humour to test one's pelvic floor right there). The group aiming to tackle the disablism and hate these groups engender is called,  FACEBOOK: STOP ALLOWING HATEFUL GROUPS THAT MOCK PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS I have exchanged a few messages with the group's creator about the title and asking if she would consider changing it, while acknowledging the laudable aims of the group and her right to utterly discount anything  I  would have to say. In a reply she explained that special needs is the expression she always uses when referring to her daughter and that she has asked \"many friends with siblings and children with various issues and they prefer special needs.\" I have to highlight here the expression, \" nothing about us, without us .\" It is not good enough to just ask parents and siblings. Disabled people themselves must be central to the issue and effort. There are plenty of disabled people who are happy to take part and explain their concerns on this Facebook group, but these people have not been treated well. I have witnessed 3 different disabled people come in to discussions on this group who have all been told that their thinking is amiss and that  they  need to learn from parents what the right way to talk about  themselves  is. I have also seen many people (all parents as far as I can see) complain about the discussion on words and terms as distracting from action. This makes no sense to me when the point of the group is to tackle the use of words like \"retard\" used in offending ways. I'm was also surprised to read her view that to, \"many people we asked, disability had a more negative connotation than special needs.\" Andrea Shettle  posted publicly to the group , asking the same question politely and gently. She was attacked by one group member and told that she was being condescending and stuck in the seventies for preferring the expression \"disabled people\" or even \"people with disabilities.\" When I questioned this person's dismissal of Andrea's questions and meanings and pointed out that it might be worth listening to and learning from disabled adults, he told me that I must be happy to be spoken down to. Amanda Baggs  then stepped in with a detailed and powerful series of posts explaining all the issues about how parents have too often ignored and marginalised the efforts of self advocates, about the important role we have as  allies , and how damaging it is (with several eye-opening examples) to claim that we parents are at the \"heart of the disability community.\" She explained that her posts were lengthy as she has difficulties in summarising her thoughts and that she wanted to be as clear as possible on an important and complicated issue. The same poster who had earlier been rude to Andrea now claimed untruthfully that Amanda was attacking him, he put words into her mouth (that she wanted to let people insult his child!) and he rudely called her long winded, but did not engage with a single thing of substance that she wrote. Wanting to tackle disablist practices and injustice on Facebook is great, but it has to start in this group before I can be part of it or invite my friends to join. Nor can I be part of a group that thinks the very word \"disability\" has negative connotations.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.planetautism.com/", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2009/03/blog-in-5-acts.html", "http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=63516216741&ref=nf", "http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=63516216741&ref=nf#/topic.php?uid=63516216741&topic=7328", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://www.autistics.org/library/allies.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/special-needs.html", "title": "\n\"Special Needs\"?\n"},

{"date": "5 Mar 2009", "body": "\nOn this day 13 years ago my mother, then aged 49, died after living with cancer for 10 years. I think about her very often, and not with sadness either. I'm lucky enough to have had years to know her, to be raised by her and my Dad in the knowledge that we were all completely loved and cared for. Mammy (as we all called her) was amazing. It's hard, no impossible, to explain just what she meant to all of us who were close to her and loved her. She could crack you up with a little aside about someone or something, she was smart but I don't think she knew it, having been convinced by one too many nun of her academic inferiority at school. She was to me, utter safety and comfort. She believed in me and supported me, hassled and nagged when necessary. She wanted the best for us and though I know that in one thing I have let her down, I have turned away from what she cherished most in life after family, I think she'd still be proud of me now...though she'd despair of my much less stringent standards of housekeeping. I miss her much, I miss her when there's a big event, a marriage, birth or death. Oh how she would have loved her grandchildren! When Lady was born, I was blown over by the knowledge that I would be as big a presence in the life of this child as my mother had been in mine. I miss her some days just out of the blue when something makes me remember her, a game show (she liked to see the prizes spread as fairly as possible rather than one winner taking it all) or an overblown song performance (she was irritated by singers throwing their arms around and going all theatrical) or when I catch myself parroting a saying of hers. Some of my most prized possessions are our old family photos and the letters Mammy wrote to me when I was away at university. In these, she wrote as she spoke, same little phrases and colloquialisms (the very things the unenlightened nuns might have marked her down for). I can hear her voice clearly when I read them. She didn't have long enough, and too much of her time was hard and involved awful suffering. But she was our Mum, the best you could have and an inspiration to me. I think I've perfected her hugs and kisses, and there's a fair number of choice chastisements that I'm passing on faithfully.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/thevoyage/2722959628/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/remembering.html", "title": "\nRemembering\n"},

Susan Greenfield, head of the Royal Institution, raised concerns about social networking sites in a  House of Lords debate : \"Perhaps we should therefore not be surprised that those within the spectrum of autism are particularly comfortable in the cyber world. The internet has even been linked to sign language, considered as beneficial for autistic people as sign language proved for the deaf. Of course, we do not know whether the current increase in autism is due more to increased awareness and diagnosis of autism, or whether it can\u2014if there is a true increase\u2014be in any way linked to an increased prevalence among people of spending time in screen relationships. Surely it is a point worth considering.\" But, but Susan...don't you know that people are  born  autistic, they don't just  catch  it when they're 14 and setting up a bebo account. Lolz! I was gratified that Ben Goldacre (cutely) destroyed the argument on Newsnight.

{"date": "16 Mar 2009", "body": "\nWe've had a few friends come to visit in the past week or so. First, a friend of Lady's, whom she met at gymnastics stayed over for 2 nights. The 2 girls stayed up really late on Friday night, chatting and giggling then both had collapsed in a heap by 7pm the following evening. Thomas did his ju-jitsu grading (he's on the orange belt now!) despite Lady and her pal going off for a walk before we needed to get out to the sport's centre and sauntering back home 20 minutes after we should have left. I was one angry mummy as we eventually got on our way. She's a good hearted girl, the very best, but  phew  can she make me mad with her day-dreaming forgetfulness. In fact, she reminds me of myself at her age, same desire to wander off on explorative walks, poking at holes by tree roots, collecting leaf and flower samples, and best of all, looking for wriggly things in ponds. Lady had landed back with a jar full of frog spawn that I then had to get a tank for. Kids eh. Our next visitors were some good friends who live close by and who also are learning without school. Lady and Thomas enjoyed their company greatly. Duncan wasn't much interested most of the time, but he did get them to join him as he played out the scene from Snow White where the 7 slovenly dwarves return from work and are surprised to see a pretty girl has opted to cook and clean for them all. Patriarchy, bah! As so often these days, Duncan requested that I film their escapades. He often edits bits from these films (at least those involving just my own brood, other people's children are safe) cut with Disney film pictures. He's  got loads of them on YouTube  now. One of his Robin Hood series had the following great slide: Robin Hood The Speicel A Dishon I'm sure you can decipher his invented spelling. Another family were round later for a few hours. These people live just up the road and one of the 3 children is autistic. I got to meet him briefly once as he's been at school where he stays for 3 (or 4?) nights each week when his mum and siblings were around. I hope he can visit properly soon, but I'll have to do something about Pippi as he's really scared of dogs. His mum is lovely and we got along really well. She shared my outrage over the  autism manure book  and the father writing that he'd  prefer his kids had cancer, not autism . Here are a few videos I took a couple of days ago showing Duncan's self devised Pinocchio outfit. Unfortunately this costume did involve the mutilation of a few innocent tops to achieve the correct layering effects. But the clothes involved were very cheap and just about too small for him anyway. I've asked that he gets my permission before cutting his clothes up in future. Anyway, it's my pleasure to introduce, Pinocchio, the dancing puppet and his pet dog Pippi. As I was writing, he told me to out his Rugrats picture \"on the blog,\" said with such a proprietary air. I aim to please: Lady's gymnastics friend's mum kindly took her out with them to watch her first ever ice hockey match which starred the  Belfast Giants . She arrived home elated, with a signed photo of some handsome, burly hockey player and painted stripes on her face. I'm not even sure if her team won, but they all certainly had a great time. She says that I have to take Thomas to the next match as he'd love it. She's been staying with the same family at their mobile home in Donegal since Saturday. I hope they aren't getting sick of her! She's called home twice to say what a great time she's having. No doubt there'll be further details on  her own blog  presently. Gordon's Mum offered to babysit the boys on Saturday night. Not surprisingly we jumped at the chance to get out together and headed out for a really nice meal. It was kind of a special evening. This morning Thomas wasn't feeling the best and though I'd hoped to take them to W5 to meet up with friends, after Thomas forcibly expelled his stomach contents orally all over the dining room floor, I decided that we'd be better to stay put. So I cleaned up and when he was settled again, I read him a few more chapters of Harry Potter 3. Later he declared that he was feeling a bit better but, \"I'm not 100% yet, more like 50% so I've 50 still to go.\" How do you know when you're raising a nerd? I must end and tidy. Gordon heads off for the rest of the week for meetings and lectures here there and wherever. No doubt, the fun and games will continue without him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/user/sharonf1000", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sb6daSq0CsI/AAAAAAAAAqA/RwEBge6qiUA/s1600-h/special+edition.png", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2009/03/judging-book-by-its-cover.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Sb60VCkIwjI/AAAAAAAAAqI/HGhFlUmnkb0/s1600-h/Reptar+on+Ice.bmp", "http://www.belfastgiants.com/", "http://lookinginrockpools.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/03/encounters-with-friends-and-neighbours.html", "title": "\nEncounters with friends and neighbours\n"},
{"date": "27 Feb 2009", "body": "\nSweet mother of mercy have they taken leave of their senses. Some dude wrote a totally ridiculous book, and the newspapers give him lots of space to promote his totally wacky notions. Can this be right? The book is called \"The Horse Boy\" by Rupert Isaacson.  The Times features the book  opening with the title, \" Shamans and horses work magic on autistic Rowan Rupert Isaacson was almost at his wits\u2019 end over his son\u2019s demonic fits, but a riding trip in Mongolia to visit local healers brought an amazing change\" \" Demonic fits \"...I ask you. How is this stuff cleared for publication, doesn't anyone catch themselves the hell on and think that perhaps such language might be offensive, inaccurate, discriminatory?! And given that the young son of a prominent politician died this week, a child who had epilepsy, couldn't they have thought to be a bit more sensitive in their choice of language. In the first paragraph of the article we learn that,  \"Rowan was autistic: incontinent, uncommunicative and given to fearsome bouts of nerve-shredding screeching, even at home.\" But  obviously , he couldn't possibly have been (for example) autistic, sweet, cheeky, athletic and into Formula 1. That wouldn't create the same levels of drama. The article continues as these things tend to (see my post on  how to write a book about your autistic child ), by explaining how they came to notice the child was different and how he was diagnosed and they were  devastated  (can't they come up with a new word for this- I suggest dismayed, inconsolable, disconsolate...I'm sure the rest of you will have more suggestions.) Actually, by the time I'd read that far, I was thinking that this all felt very familiar and I found an  earlier Times article lauding Isaacson and his notions . Since then, someone has backed his plan to sell his Mongolian adventure book and film by pitching it as, not just another well-off westerner meeting the natives, but as a quest to cure his poor, suffering son. Autism is so hot right now. He tells about the day his child, aged two, ran into the middle of a group of horses and lay on the ground. Luckily he wasn't killed, and his Dad was able to read from the horses' reaction that actually, his son had inherited his \"horse gene.\" I'll bet. The son got on a horse and  IT'S A MIRACLE!!!  he said a few words. Why is this always presented as such a big deal? Something strange happened when he was on the horse.  \u201cHe began to talk meaningfully, not just babble or recite Thomas the Tank Engine train names,\u201d says Isaacson. \u201cFor the time we were together in the saddle there were no tantrums. It became a place of respite and joy.\u201d  While it's nice that the child enjoyed horse riding, his previous speech probably wasn't just \"meaningless babble\" but was an important stage that all children go though as they're developing the ability to speak. Duncan's early words were almost all repeated phrases for films, and much of it still is, but his speech has real communicative intent. The article preps us for the truly wacky stuff to come though, \"what happened next has no rational explanation.\" Too flippin' right!  \"when Rowan was three, Isaacson brought a group of bushmen from Botswana to the United Nations in New York to protest against land being lost to diamond mining. Their chief shaman, or \u201cwise man\u201d, performed a healing ritual on Rowan. \u201cIt was extraordinary,\u201d says his father. \u201cFor five days or so it really was like having a normal kid. Rowan\u2019s symptoms started to fall away. The problem was as soon as we went home he tumbled back into the autism.\u201d \" Aw, it must really gall you to see your child tumble into autism. I'm not sure how it happens, but I'll go with it for now. Not wishing to miss a chance to  profit from his son  inform the world of this miracle, Isaacson had a film crew follow them as they travelled to Mongolia...as you do. Here's a but more insight into how this father thinks. He;  \"believes that shamanic healing works.   \u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen enough people with cancer, or snake bites, or dementia or whatever, healed \u2013 and the doctors scratching their heads and saying we don\u2019t know where the tumour\u2019s gone, you come to realise it\u2019s a pretty valid system.\u201d\" I'll just let the full stupid of that remark simmer, no further comment is required. Photo  owned by   Morning  theft  ( cc ) So this is what they did to \"help\" their autistic child;  \"To western eyes the ceremonies they underwent appear bizarre. One Mongolian shaman told them Rowan had been touched by \u201cblack energy\u201d in the womb and it was necessary to draw this negative energy away. Another prescribed fermented goat\u2019s milk. A female shaman beat on a drum while summoning spirits with a whirling, dancing prayer. They were hit with reindeer horns and spattered with vodka.\"  I once met an old woman who called out to Duncan, and told me that he isn't disabled, he's one of the lost tribe of Atlantis and that I was trapping him in a false dimension with my greasy soul and that if I didn't let her snort snuff out of her nostrils on us both, he'd never progress. Actually, I was lying there. Yep, my eyes must be western all right as that shaman stuff sounds like a whole big pile of horse manure. Imagine how that child must have been feeling, dragged across the plains and subjected to all those sensory overloading, invasive, unpleasant and ridiculous interventions. He'd have been better off with a bit of  The Shamen , which I think Duncan would quite like though he's big into Gwen Stefani these days. This bit is hilarious;  \"As their trek across Mongolia continued, so did Rowan\u2019s progress, despite setbacks \u2013 intermittent tantrums that saw him refuse to go near a horse and reduced his father almost to despair. At last they reached the so-called Reindeer people, reputed to have the most powerful shamans. After a ceremony there, Rowan\u2019s incontinence was apparently cured.\" So Rowan was acting as any reasonable person would expect. How is incontinence \"apparently\" cured? And please could someone please teach these people about conflating correlation and causation! (Duncan only rarely wees in his sleep now, I credit oxtail soup for this breakthrough...Not really.) I'll bet you can't guess how it ends...oh all right. They've set up a centre to help other children benefit from horses just like Rowan. The book/film gets  masses of coverage in the Daily Mail  too, where they've been publishing excerpts from the book. It's toe curling, hippy bull. Here are a few choice phrases, \"my emotionally and physically incontinent son\" Gack. \"the shaman's assistant passed her spiritual mistress a bottle of vodka, from which she took a hearty pull, then without warning spat the liquid all over Rowan's face and body.\" And instead of sweeping your son up and running as fast as possible out of there you let this continue? \"But Rowan was screaming now. Genuine distress. Too much adventure, too tired, too cold, too hungry. ... The cameraman rode up to our side, filming from the saddle. 'Put the damn camera away!' I snapped.\"  Had he forgotten it was he who had arranged the film crew! \"I'd taken the poor boy to his edge and he was now falling apart. 'Help!' he sobbed. 'Help me.' Rowan had his eyes tightly shut now, as he retreated into himself. This is a very bad thing for an autistic child to do - every autism parent's worst scenario, seeing his child shut down, his nervous system overloaded.\" No. This is not my worst scenario, not by a long shot. My son being really sick or in pain or suffering at the hands of another, are much worse scenarios to my mind. And there plenty more where that came from, as demonstrated in  another piece in the Daily Mail : \"My son was diagnosed with autism in the spring of 2004, when he was two. It was like being hit across the face with a baseball bat. Grief and shame engulfed me: weird, irrational shame, as if I had somehow cursed this child by giving him faulty genes, condemned him to a lifetime of living as an alien because of me. And then came the pain of watching, horrified, as he began to drift away to another place, separated from me as if by thick glass. \"  Oh pull yourself together, this is just silly, there is no glass, no drifting. There is just your child with a brain that works in a different way who needs his parents to adapt and meet his slightly alternative needs. Now came something new: a demonic, almost possessed edge, materialising suddenly out of nowhere.  Again, the demonic thing. What makes these people think it's an acceptable way to label their own children to millions of the reading public? \"Our hope that our son would share a life of adventure with us was dashed. Instead, our life became a mechanical drudgery of driving from one therapy and assessment appointment to another and dealing with insurance companies, therapists and our son's ever-increasing, inexplicable tantrums\"  From the earlier Times article, linked to above, he's explained what these therapies are and some are far from mainstream. Before they went gallivanting east, they were pushing chelation chemicals on the boy. This stuff is dangerous and useless in autism. There is no need to spend time and money chasing a cure. Acceptance, education of self and your child, an optimised environment and knowing what makes your child tick are far more important. And I can tell Rupert Isaacson, I didn't have to drag my son anywhere. Wherever we are, we're sharing this voyage as a family together, and there may be ups and downs, but I wouldn't want to be travelling with anyone else.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5779851.ece", "http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article2393112.ece", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/23632660@N03/3254804948/", "http://www.flickr.com/people/23632660@N03/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-o15Xmaz2A", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1146044/Id-dragged-autistic-son-Mongolia-healed-horses-witchdoctors-Had-I-totally-lost-mind.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1146044/Id-dragged-autistic-son-Mongolia-healed-horses-witchdoctors-Had-I-totally-lost-mind.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/more-manure-about-autism-in-media.html", "title": "\nMore Manure About Autism in the Media\n"},

A few were utterly dire, clearly I won't link to these, but some of them I loved. Fist of all  Daddy or Chips?  which seems to be a magpie sort of blog picking up on fun, pretty and shiny things. I'm happy to be corrected if I'm missing layers of deeper meaning, some sort of rage against the system. It's got pop and well built men and more pop and I liked it a lot. Next I want to highlight  Stranded on Gaia  which somehow I'd not read before. It's a popular blog, frequently updated with funny as hell stories and rants and some top quality swearing. I'll be back. I discovered what might be the most beautiful blog of the lot,  Lickable Wallpaper . It's by an Irish couple who did the most marvellous thing; quit jobs and everyday safe life to travel the world. The blog records their journey with fantastic photos and makes me so very jealous. (If you're reading Cathy, you'll love this one.) I met Eddie at 4am or so after the awards when just 4 of us remained sitting around the skewed world-map table (Ireland was shown as x2 times Britain's size) and talking until the cleaners arrived the next morning. We only went to bed in case we were given a cloth and some polish. I don't know what they're going to do now they have come back home, but I think it would a shame to let such a great blog sit untended. So Eddie, g'wan and get back to it. I looked at many amazing photoblogs. These people are all astonishingly talented, but one of those that I loved and which didn't make the shortlist was  venividi , a blog by a Polish person living in Cork. I'm no photographer (which I hope doesn't make my praise too limited!) but I thought the images presented were amazing, telling stories, captivating and making me wonder what was happening and wanting to know more about the subject. There was a lively discussion on each post some in Polish and some in English. Many of the photos were taken in Cork so as I walked around the city on Friday and Saturday, it seemed at times to be that bit more familiar as I spotted scenes and places I'd seen in the blog.

{"date": "23 Feb 2009", "body": "\nI enjoyed myself so much this past weekend. Heading down to Cork for the weekend, staying in a decent hotel and meeting lots of fabulously interesting, opinionated, talented articulate and passionate people. I loved having some time with my beloved little sister and the banter and craic were mighty altogether. The Ladies Tea Party was delightful and the award ceremony was organised and enjoyable. Everyone I met was warm and friendly and all were impressed at how well Damian and all his helpers had managed everything. New friendships were made and old ones strengthened. It was delightful to return to my family. Gordon met me at the airport with the boys. Thomas blew kisses every time I looked around and smiled at me like a matinee idol, Duncan grinned and held my hand as we drove to pick Lady up from her friend's house. It was a rapturous reception. Later I had a quick look at the blog which won in my category and was shocked to see that it only started on December 2nd. Now I'll be honest, when the shortlist was announced, I had a quick read through the 4 other \" Specialist Blogs \" and I thought that the only one that didn't stand a chance of winning was the one that won,  Irish Economy . The blog content, while incredibly topical, seemed to me, to be written in a dry textbook style. I fully admit that I only spent a few minutes reading it, whereas I read many posts by the other bloggers, and personally,I was more impressed at  their  content, style, wit and the level of engagement they had with readers. And what I had taken on first glance to be a blogroll on the Irish Economy blog, was in fact the list of contributors- 24 in total. Each of the other 4 blogs shortlisted are written by just one person. Now I'm confused about something. Perhaps people will think this is just sour grapes that I didn't win. It's not though... I was a judge for this year's blog awards. Judging each person's quota of the massive list of nominated blogs began at the beginning of February, only 2 months after the Irish Economy blog commenced. But crucially, the awards nomination rules stipulated that, \"to be nominated the Blog has to have been actively blogging between July 15th and December 15th 2008.\" As a judge, I took this to mean that to be eligible, all blogs (except those nominated for best new blog and best blog post) had to have regular posts in the period stipulated, not that the blog must have had some posts at any point in that time. It never occurred to me to use the 2nd possible meaning. For each blog I judged, I went to the archives and read a large selection of the posts written between July and December and ignored the rest so when I came across blogs that hadn't started until later in the year, I gave them as few marks as possible and wrote my reasons for the low mark in the allotted space. It now seems that other judges interpreted the nomination rules the 2nd way and I fear I have discriminated against many good blogs. I would appreciate it if  Damien  or someone who knows, could clarify this. It's too late to do anything about it this year but I hope that by next year, it will be more obvious to those nominating and judging, exactly what the rules are. PS, I'm really delighted that 3 of the winners were those I nominated; well done,  Maman Poulet ,  Trust Tommy  and  The Cedar Lounge Revolution , and well done too all the other winners...even if some of you might be glad you weren't judged by me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://irisheconomy.ie/", "http://www.mulley.net/", "http://mamanpoulet.com/", "http://trusttommy.com/", "http://cedarlounge.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/irish-blog-awards-great-times-but-how.html", "title": "\nIrish Blog Awards, great times but how does it work?\n"},

Usually these days, he is dressed in his short green trousers, and a green t-shirt he customised with a pair of scissors, cutting the sleeves shot and shaping the shirt bottom to medieval style zig-zags, finished off with a yellow hard hat. He got a grey fleece hat a few days ago, and asked me to \"read it\" (name it) and now he wants me to buy a yellow fleece hat with a bright red feather. Many times he has presented me with the camera and asked me to take a photo \"like that\" as he does some move or other. It's videos he wants, not photos and I've made a dozen or so in the past few days. He takes the files and uses movie-making software to add a few effects, text and music then gets me to upload them on YouTube. A few times I've forgotten to log out of my YouTube account on his computer and he has renamed a file or deleted a film. Yesterday however he uploaded 2 films I had never even seen. He did everything in these entirely unaided. The first is another in his  Pinocchio  series. He has combined screenshots and downloaded Disney images with his own pictures and set the lot to music from Disney's  Dinosaur  soundtrack. It seems he has been inspired by  an evil Pinocchio YouTube film . He's got screen grabs of this video- I'm going to have to try explaining copyright soon! I hope the maker of that film isn't bothered by having his images used... The 2nd film is part 10 of the Robin Hood series. In this, he's had me or someone else film him. For most of the film he's trying to kiss Lady, who he's deemed to be Maid Marian, but his hat keeps falling off. he keeps on trying, pausing only to replace the hat and wipe his mouth until he comes up with the solution. Lady and I are cracking up laughing throughout, but he decided in his wisdom to overlay a bit of Black Eyed Peas music. It's a hoot.

I've often heard other parents of autistic children lament that their child will \"never marry or have children of their own.\" My response: How do you know? So what? I didn't have children so they would provide me with the opportunity to wear a fabulous hat at their wedding or to ensure a supply of grandchildren when I'm older. I've given them life and it's now theirs to live as they choose. In raising these 3 children, I aim to teach them about relationships and sexuality. I hope they will develop the ability to make safe, healthy and wise choices. I want them to feel empowered, to have fun, to have respect for themselves and others. Their lessons started early: they have always had their questions on bodies and life answered honestly and age appropriately, they've known the correct terminology for body parts and been offered little bits of information relative to their understanding. Instead of waiting until they are of a certain age and sitting them each down for \"The Talk\" we have lots of chats as we go along. There's a lot more to learn yet.

He is taught about his body and to expect to be treated with dignity and to have his privacy respected. I want him to learn how to avoid exploitative encounters. He is learning like all children, what is and isn't appropriate in certain situations, and as he grows, he will be helped to understand the physical and emotional changes he's experiencing. As for each of my children, I hold no expectations for how, when or even if he will want to have romantic relationships. But he will be a man and his sexuality is a given and a right. I don't assume that just because he's learning disabled he's some sort of eunuch and I will help him however I can to learn how to negotiate the perplexing, fraught but ultimately exciting and joyful complexities of relationships. Whether marriage or children will be part of this path is up to him. I recommend you go read  Dave's own post  which is just awesomeness and power and all that's great...funny as hell too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2009/01/blogging-on-sexuality.html", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/10964711@N06/3264746409/", "http://www.flickr.com/people/10964711@N06/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2009/02/and-then-of-course.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/not-eunuch.html", "title": "\nNot a eunuch\n"},
{"date": "13 Feb 2009", "body": "\n SO we've already had young Sammy Wilson, Minster for the Environment in the parliament of this peculiar and fought over minuscule corner of our planet, a  climate change denialist ,  block a UK government commissioned TV ad  advising people how to reduce consumption and CO2 emissions from their homes. There's a  Royal Society's guide  he'd be well advised to read. Last year the DUP MP  Iris Robinson promoted her own brand of bigotry  to the world. Today we hear again from Mervyn Storey, fellow  DUP member  who not only believes that this whole universe is about 6000 years old, but that it was all put together in just 6 days. Now the man can believe what he wants as long as he doesn't interfere with my or my children's right to enjoy life free from his fairy tales. But here's the problem; little Mervyn (look at his wee Bash Street Kids face, the tyke!) is threatening the Ulster Museum with legal action if it doesn't represent his fabulous tale alongside its planned exhibition on evolution when it reopens later this year after undergoing a major refurbishment. Mervyn thinks that because he's not the only person living here who believes his astonishing 6 day tale, that he can use  equality  legislation to force the museum to show nonsense alongside evidence based information! Yes, I know... Worse still, this man chairs the NI education committee. Once again, I'm glad to home-educate. Walter the Softy   Mervyn told the Guardian ,  \"In the past, when I have written to the museum about necessity to show the public an alternative to Darwin's theory (and let's stress it is still only a theory), they have been quite dismissive.\" Argh! He used the \"only a theory\" thing! From  Understanding Evolution , a site Mervyn would learn much from,  \"Scientific theories are explanations that are based on lines of evidence, enable valid predictions, and have been tested in many ways. In contrast, there is also a popular definition of theory \u2014 a \"guess\" or \"hunch.\" These conflicting definitions often cause unnecessary confusion about evolution.\"  In the Guardian article Mervyn attempts to smear Charles Darwin with accusations of racism, when others have recently shown that he was in  part motivated by anti-slavery principles ,  \"In this politically correct society we live in today, if Darwin expressed those views about other peoples of the world now he would not be put on any pedestal.\" Asked if humans evolved from monkeys, Storey said: \"Certainly not, and there are plenty of other people in this society who don't believe it either.\" The chairman of the education committee at the Northern Ireland Assembly said: \"I am not against the museum or anywhere else promoting Darwin's theory, but I think it would be in the public's interest to give them an alternative theory as well. \"We are currently because of the anniversary being bombarded with Darwin's theory but there are others in the scientific world who question that thesis and their voices should be heard in publicly funded institutions like the museum.\" Darwin may have dispassionately dismissed some peoples as savages in one of his books, which wrong as that is, must be seen in light of the prevailing attitudes of his time and class. Moreover, if Mervyn reckons only those with politically correct views by today's standards should be on pedestals, he should hire a truck to knock down most of the public statues in this province...and sack many of his party colleagues. I am looking forward to the Ulster Museum's reopening. It was a  fusty but fun place to visit  before, and I'm sure after it's make-over, it will be even better. No doubt we will visit often as part of our learning voyage, but I don't want to have to negotiate frankly incorrect exhibitions in a place of learning and science.   Praise be then that the  museum has pledged to do the right thing  and will,  \"house galleries and exhibitions of international    significance interpreted in line with  excellent scholarship and research . Within the permanent science galleries we will explain the  conventional    scientific theories internationally accepted by scholars and scientists  to    describe life on earth from the earliest evidence of fossils.

Clearly in the home of a biologist and (I may have been rubbish but...) an ex-physicist, a day dedicated to honouring the great man and science in general is not going to pass by unnoticed. I was reading to Lady and Thomas about Charles Darwin and his work. We talked about how he was fascinated by all the different species he observed on his travels and wanted to find a way to explain such diversity. We mentioned how the generations before Darwin thought there were only a few hundred types of animal, as many believed literally that they'd all had to fit on Noah's Ark. Thomas didn't know that story so Lady enlightened him. \"Ah,\" said he, \"it's like  Evan Almighty \". Well, close enough. But as I explained, by Darwin's time scientists and explorers already knew there were far too many species to fit in a boat (\"unless it was as big as the world\"-T). And Darwin was really puzzled about why this was, and after he read a book about people, poverty and the struggle for survival, he decided to apply those ideas to animals. But he knew his theory would upset a lot of people so he had to go carefully and he worked hard for years, collecting samples and writing letters, gaining evidence and working out the details of his theory before he felt he had to let other people know. We read a little bit about barnacles since the big guy studied them for years. Lady already knew that they're crustaceans. Both were surprised to discover that they catch food with their feet, that they're hermaphrodites (cool new word) and best of all, that they have the longest penis of the animal kingdom relevant to their length. Later Thomas was telling Gordon what he'd learned; Charles Darwin apparently, built a huge boat during a flood. Teaching fail! But Thomas did remember what he'd learned about barnacles somehow! Today we met Dean outside his hospital and had a late lunch at McD's since we don't do dine-in, then drove up to the zoo to have some Darwin Day appropriate fun. It was 2.45 when we arrived but sadly we were not allowed in as they close to visitors at 2.30 in the winter. Boy did I feel llama-ish. I thought of invoking the occasion to see if I could convince the man to let us have just an hour or so to wander around but I wasn't up to it. So we went to the playground by the beach. Lady and Duncan spent much time on the beach, he throwing stones into the sea while she collected interesting shells and examined seaweed and various bits of slimy stuff she found lying around. She's a natural naturalist. Thomas, not being a fan of the beach when it's cold, shimmied up poles and swung on ropes and other peculiar monkey like things. Actually, I suppose he was demonstrating our primate origins, so that was very suitable for the day too. Back home, I baked a cake and Lady helped to decorate it. We all had a nice piece of Darwin's birthday cake, and Thomas made a toast, \"cheers to Darwin, even though he's dead.\" (Oh and I was in the  local paper .)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scientificblogging.com/darwin_day_2009", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SZShUGGUjaI/AAAAAAAAAm0/E-JPCWqn0G4/s1600-h/IMAGE_011.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SZSmF3xBLvI/AAAAAAAAAnM/MXNW5ehIazk/s1600-h/IMAGE_013.jpg", "http://www.spectatornewspapers.co.uk/assets/coverpage/spectatorcoverpage.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/darwin-day-2009.html", "title": "\nDarwin Day 2009\n"},
{"date": "11 Feb 2009", "body": "\n This week, people around the world learned of  Jeni Barnett's ignorance  and how her  radio station, LBC,  attempted to stifle debate with legal threats . As explained so elegantly on  Autism News Beat , Jeni is a, \"British actress who feels obligated to share what she knows about vaccines and measles. But since she knows so little, Barnet was compelled to fill the rest of her three hour time slot with anti-vaccine talking points, addle-pated  weltanschauung , and other assorted brain farts.\" From the wonderful worlds of autism and vaccine quackery, and sadly the two are inextricably linked, we also learned this week of  Andrew Wakefield's incompetence/falsification of data  (the only possible explanations for what happened). In a bid to restore balance to the universe, I shall give away a copy of Paul Offit's wonderful book, \" Autism's False Prophets .\" I must get around to doing a proper review soon, but for now, although I wish he'd looked at the behaviorist's claims with the same rationalism as those of the vaccine causation cranks, and though I oppose the harsh words on autism of one contributor, it is a fine book. It details the history of the false association of autism with vaccines, just part of the anti-science story exemplified by Jeni Barnett and LBC. Clearly, liar/extreme incompetent anti-scientist Andrew Wakefield has a prominent role in the tale, which is highly readable, a bit of a page turner even. If you have children and are concerned about having them vaccinated, read this, and realise that the whole sorry mess was manufactured out of nothing. The various vested interests are laid out in full. Offit's is open about his own role as a specialist in infectious diseases and co-inventor of a flu vaccine. So if you want a copy, no matter where in the world you are, just leave a comment below and tell me who is your autism hero and why, and who is your autism anti-hero and why. I'll have one of the children pick a name at random and then I'll get the book sent out. To get you started, here are a few names, a mixture of heroes and zeroes, (hotties and notties...sorry): Wakefield, Leitch, O'Leary, Offit, Shattock, Shattuck, Lovaas, Orac, Dawson, Stanton, McCarthy, Leary, Geier, Seidel, Baron-Cohen, Rimland and so on...

{"date": "7 Feb 2009", "body": "\n The monster was saddened by his premature dismissal. Something smells good today. Our coalition of bloggers, Facebook users, disability organisations and exceedingly obliging autism professionals, have partially succeeded.  Action for Children  had previously expressed their intention to air the monstrous autism ad on television until February 15  in emails to Barbara Jacobs  and to  Mike Stanton : \"Action for Children is a major provider of services for disabled children, including some with autism. We have other significant areas of work as well, and are a leading charity working with over 178,000 of the most vulnerable children, young people and their family members. The advert will be running until the  15th February . If you would like to further your complaint or concerns about our advertisements then you can do this by contacting the Advertising Standards Authority at  www.asa.org.uk  They will look in to your complaint and if your concerns are upheld then we will be instructed to change or remove the advertising.\" (my emphasis) But they announced yesterday that it shall now end early on February 8. This capitulation to the huge wave of protest, bolstered by over TWO THOUSAND people joining the \" Let's stop \"Action for Children\" demonising autistic children \" Facebook group I created less than a fortnight ago, can be found on their  blog : \"Thanks very much to everybody who has commented on and contacted us about Dan's story. We had always scheduled the advertising campaign to finish on  8 February  and so Sunday will be the last day that the advert runs. I wanted to let everyone who is interested know that we have genuinely listened to the different perspectives that have been expressed. We have been and will continue to take these views into account and learn the lessons as we go along. We do appreciate that people feel strongly about the areas in which we work - as do we - and it's essential that we listen to these views.\" (my emphasis) It's funny that they should say this. When you read the response  Action for Children  have given to every one of us who complained to them, it's clear that apart from a mix up about how they chose to present \"Dan's\" part in the creative process (did he draw the pictures or did he just approve the ad?) they  have not  listened to our carefully worded and detailed concerns. We've spoken of the damage it will do to the self esteem of autistic people, how it adds to the false, damaging rhetoric about autism and perpetuates the myth of autism as a shell, hence playing into the hand of the charlatans who offer false cures that release the \"normal\" child trapped inside the \"autism monster.\" Perhaps they will now realise though, that there are lessons they must learn from what has happened. I hope so. Of course this doesn't end here. The ad is still on their website and YouTube channel. They had intended to run a postcard campaign which would use images from the Dan slide show, and there have been ads in newspapers and posters on the London Underground. The Advertising Standards Agency have yet to make a decision on the complaints they received about the ad. If anyone wants to upload their own complaint, email me for a copy of my  \"5 minute guide to complaining to the ASA. \" Like PETA and their laughable \"got autism\" billboards and NYU's pathetic \"ransom notes\"  Action for Children  are realising that you don't mess with the autistic community and their allies. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SY3wtW_1cRI/AAAAAAAAAmk/LR03lHPVam8/s1600-h/afc+complainers.jpg", "http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2009/01/23/action-for-children-or-action-against-autistic-children/#comment-2933", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2009/01/29/action-for-children-reply-to-critics/", "http://www.asa.org.uk/", "http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=47154931157", "http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/blogs_entry.aspx?id=27", "http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/", "http://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/action-for-children-abolish-odious-ad.html", "title": "\nAction for Children abolish odious ad early\n"},
{"date": "8 Feb 2009", "body": "\nOne of the major sources of suffering for autistic people and their parents over the past 10 years, has been the continued association in the media and in the public's consciousness between the MMR vaccine and autism. Andrew Wakefield was a gut surgeon, a maverick doctor with a hunch and in the pay of lawyers. He held the  patent on a rival measles vaccine  and stood to benefit if somehow he could sully the MMR vaccine approved of by the health department and have it replaced with his own measles vaccine. For a while he tried to link the MMR with Crohn's disease to no avail, so he must have been delighted when he heard whisperings of parents blaming the MMR for causing their children's autism. He managed to recruit a bunch of these parents, most of whom were suing the government for causing their children's neurological condition, and though he wasn't a paediatrician, he got a mate to scope their guts, had the samples analysed at a  badly run lab  and concocted the results he needed to make out there was a strong association. Yes, it seems he  falsified the data . Brian Deer writes on today's Sunday Times  about the many ways in which Wakefield's Lancet paper of 1998, the article that set this whole confusing and damaging mess in motion, changed many important details about the 12 children studied. 11 of them were described as having a brand new condition invented by the authors, \"regressive autism.\" According to Deer's investigation:  \"Wakefield and his team reporting that Child One\u2019s parents said \u201cbehavioural symptoms\u201d started \u201cone week\u201d after he received the MMR.   The boy\u2019s medical records reveal a subtly different story, one familiar to mothers and fathers of autistic children. At the age of 9\u00bd months, 10 weeks before his jab, his mother had become worried that he did not hear properly: the classic first symptom presented by sufferers of autism.\"  (Dear Brian Deer, your work here is excellent, but please, no more of the \"sufferers of autism\" thing.) Another child was written about in the Lancet paper as developing \"regressive autism\" two weeks after his jab, but Deer explains that: \"...this child\u2019s medical records, backed by numerous specialist assessments, said his problems began three to five months later.\" So Wakefield blithely ignored the truth when it didn't support his theory. There is much more, the only girl in Wakefield's cohort was described in the Lancet as, \"having suffered a brain injury \u201ctwo weeks\u201d after MMR\" but \"she had been seen by local specialists, and her GP told the Royal Free of \u201csignificant concerns about her development some months before she had her MMR\u201d.\" There is more: \"Child Six, aged 5, and Child Seven, aged 3, were said to have been diagnosed with regressive autism, with an onset of symptoms \u201cone week\u201d and \u201c24 hours\u201d after the jab respectively.   But medical records show that neither boy was \u201cpreviously normal\u201d, as the Lancet article described all the children, and that both had already been hospitalised with brain problems before their MMR.\" The MMR debacle, started by one arrogant, dishonest doctor with scant regard for scientific accuracy or even for ethics in how he treated the children, has been extrapolated by the media with years of inaccurate, awful reporting on vaccines and autism. Even last week, one radio presenter, former actress  Jeni Barnett, spewed her ignorant and rather deranged views  on vaccination over the airways for an hour. She of course spoke of her notion that vaccines made her child autistic. Dr Ben Goldacre played  a long excert  from her LBC show so people could hear for themselves just how befuddled and mistaken the woman was, just how it is that media personalities fuel the lies that have resulted in the low uptake of a life saving vaccine, the continued misrepresentation of autism as something that happens to previously \"normal\" children and the high rise in measles cases. The show is now available on  Wiki Leaks  and there are loads more links on  Holford Watch . Her response,  send the lawyers after him . Typically, this has only served to spread the recognition of her stupidity world wide as transcripts of the show pop up all over the blogosphere. Hurrah for the internet. But enough! There have been so very many biomedical and epidemiological studies done into that supposed association. It just doesn't exist. It is a fairytale. The time and money spent attempting to reassure the public of the MMR's safety could have been used to do make actual progress in health and science. If the smallest fraction of that effort had focused instead on helping autistic people live and thrive, the benefits would be immense. We are fed up hearing our children described as toxic and poisoned. Surely even Wakefield's most ardent supporters, those who wave placards outside the GMC when he turns up for his disciplinary hearings and who gaze adoringly at him as if they're 10 and he's Zac Efron, will rethink and realise he's no hero.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article391141.ece", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=566", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece", "http://www.jenibarnett.com/2009/02/mmr_and_me.php", "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45360000/gif/_45360950_measles_cases_gr_226.gif", "http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/bad-science-bingo/", "http://www.wikileaks.org/leak/jeni-barnett-mmr-and-vaccination-slot-on-lbc.mp3", "http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/05/jeni-barnett-lbc-radio-mmr-vaccine/", "http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/wakefield-falsified-data-to-link-mmr-to.html", "title": "\nWakefield falsified data to link MMR to autism\n"},
{"date": "3 Feb 2009", "body": "\nI've been reading a document that is full of excellent advice on  how to portray children in film and photographs  (PDF link). According to the authors, images used in publicity material must portray a: \"A positive message \u2013 Children are at the centre of everything we do, and we know for certain that children want to be portrayed in a positive way in the media. There is no point in fighting for children\u2019s rights, if we then undermine this work, by using imagery that they will find offensive. This is in fact one of our organisation\u2019s pledges.\" Before I share more of the sensitive and considerate advice contained in this document, I will reveal that the organisation who have pledged that they  will not use offensive imagery as it undermines efforts to effect children's rights , is... Action for Children . The hypocrisy this document has uncovered is astonishing, as the following few exerts demonstrate: \"It is essential that we represent them [children] with dignity, accuracy and fairness.\" Screenshot of Action for Children TV ad. \"...use positive imagery that does not exploit children and young people.\" Screenshot of Action for Children TV ad. There is guidance on how to represent children who cannot be photographed due to legal restrictions: \"Creative Services also have a large library of real Service User\u2019s art, which can be another very effective way to give a feeling of the real person, when you can\u2019t show their picture. Always remember though to only use the art in a genuine context. Say, if you\u2019re talking about an art event, or if you\u2019re talking about the feelings of children in a particular area Action for Children work in.\" While Dan's art may (or may not, it's hard to know given the conflicting stories AFC told those of us who complained) have been used in the ad, it was used in a way which negates all the other advice on this document. And just who drew the picture of a little girl struggling to hold the massive heart \"burden\" placed on her, as the \"Nicola\" ad makes out, by having a disabled mother? The woman who narrates that ad is in her twenties now. But Action for Children have yet more tips of portraying children in a sensitive manner: \"We should aim to move beyond stereotypes of children passively receiving services and aim to portray, for example, disabled children involved in activities. Remember we\u2019re called Action for Children. This is particularly important if a photograph of a disabled child or young person is being used in isolation. Care should always be taken to ensure that any impact on the children is positive. Disabled children and young people rarely see images of themselves published, so any photograph of them may have a profound effect on their self-image.\" Too right! I've heard too many stories of autistic children disturbed by how people like them are depicted in the AFC Dan ad. The chasm of difference between their stated standards and what they've actually done with their first ever TV ad, is utterly breath taking. \"Action for Children works fearlessly in the most difficult and challenging areas relating to children. We are not afraid of any issue, and know better than anyone the seriousness of the subjects we are dealing with. Because of this, and because we aim to give our service users a voice, all imagery should be authentic and sincere. Use of gratuitous imagery should be avoided at all costs...\" Gratuitous imagery...like a big scary, hairy child-eating monster rampaging about and attacking all the normal people? \"Use of gratuitous imagery should be avoided at all costs...\" Screenshot of Action for Children TV ad. More wise words from Action for Children on representation via illustrations: ...all images should be real rather than sensational, and should take into account the feelings of the people in them, and referred to by them. The best way to work this out is to consider the context of the image, (how the accompanying text works with it etc), and then use your common sense. If in doubt, ask yourself: \u201cHow would I feel if I were portrayed like that in a photograph?\u201d Real images, not sensational?! What excellent advice! And what a pity they ignored it totally when making these ads. I wonder who from Action for Children decided they'd feel just peachy to be portrayed as a monster when they approved the Dan ad? Did Action for Children consider context when they superimposed images of a rampaging, child entrapping monster with narration saying, \" My parents sought out help with my autism because it was becoming a pain in the bum\"? Were the feelings of people referred to, that is, autistic people, taken into account when AFC decided to put this shockingly bad ad out? Are they considering the feelings of these people when despite many, many letters of protest, comments on their own YouTube channel and the 1665 people who joined the Facebook group protesting the ad, they keep on playing on televisions in the UK? (I'm well aware that AFC are watching the group and the blogs, their ISP has been all over this blog in the past few days, always following Facebook links to get here.) Action for Children, whoever is reading this, please, do the right thing, follow your own excellent guidelines for portraying children and young people in an ethical, sensitive, respectful and honest manner, and get this gutter level, shock and awe, false, sensationalist and damaging ad taken off our televisions.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://brand.actionforchildren.org.uk/uploads/media/71/3140.pdf", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SYikwLCLlkI/AAAAAAAAAmc/miM1xRIyZNY/s1600-h/dan3.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SYiIIhKlXqI/AAAAAAAAAmU/g3QIarMXzX8/s1600-h/dan2.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SYiCyniQfHI/AAAAAAAAAmM/pI7y5_u1jgI/s1600-h/dan1.png"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/action-for-children-arrant-hypocrisy.html", "title": "\nAction for Children: arrant hypocrisy\n"},
{"date": "2 Feb 2009", "body": "\nI've been granted permission to share a recent email I received from  Professor Baron-Cohen of the Autism Research Centre  at Cambridge University regarding the current advertising campaign by  Action for Children : \"Whilst I support any efforts to help children with autism and to alleviate suffering, I hope there will be more thought given to both the language and the imagery we use, to avoid risk of offence. For example, the name of the charity DAN contains the word \"Defeat\", as if autism is a disease like cancer against which we have to wage war. Autism is a complex mix of disability and strength, and whilst we need to work to find imaginative ways to reduce the disabling aspects, we do not wish to \"defeat autism\" since this would also eliminate the positive aspects. The latter include an excellent attention to detail, excellent memory for detail, and the ability to focus for long periods on a narrow topic. These features are not just seen in the high-functioning individuals or those with Asperger Syndrome but are seen right across the autistic spectrum. Sometimes these positive aspects can result in remarkable talents. We need to work to get the balance right, between using treatments for those aspects of autism that need treatment (such as the language difficulties, the epilepsy, the self-injury, the gut issues, or the learning difficulties) and encouraging those aspects of autism that do not need treatment and are special, so that the person can fulfil their potential. An image of a child as a demon in an ad campaign is equally unhelpful if we are to educate the public about autism. These issues, about language and imagery, are important if we take seriously the notion of neurodiversity, and wish to show respect towards those who are neurotypical and neuroatypical.\" There is nothing I can add to this but my thanks to Professor Baron-Cohen for adding his voice to those of Professor Tony Attwood, Dr Mitzi Waltz, and renowned authors like Professor Roy Grinker, Donna Williams and Barbara Jacobs, who have all publicly demonstrated their objections to this unethical, misrepresentative and damaging ad.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/", "http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=47154931157"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/02/professor-simon-baron-cohen-speaks.html", "title": "\nProfessor Simon Baron-Cohen speaks about Action for Children ad\n"},
{"date": "30 Jan 2009", "body": "\nMike Stanton has  posted an email on his blog , which gives the response of  Tony Attwood , a well known researcher on autism to the  Action for Children  ad. We have been given permission to share what he had to say: \u201cI am very concerned that the advert gives a message that children with autism and Asperger\u2019s syndrome are dangerous and potentially disturbed. When the child refers to \u201ccorrect errors in my behaviour\u201d this seems to imply \u2018brain washing\u2019 and a sense of guilt for how he behaved. Many of the behaviours I consider as coping mechanisms for the lack of understanding and respect from other people. He refers to reacting when people insult him. Those that insulted him need the treatment.\u201d There is no mistaking it. There is no way  Action for Children  can wriggle out of this and try to fob off their damaging mistake by claiming that they were just letting Dan tell his story and saying that when we complain, we're being nasty to the poor autistic boy. This is precisely what they imply in their stock email, and what the few people who have tried to defend the ad on  YouTube  and on our  Facebook group , have said. I emailed the NAS last week about the ad, as did many other people. They have contacted  Action for Children  and explained how so many of their members are objecting to the ad, but unfortunately even they were sent the same pathetic excuses as all the rest of us. I'm well aware that the ASA is receiving loads of complaints about the ad. There is also a  Facebook group  protesting  Action for Children's  MS ad. The ASA has been contacted by many about this too. I hope that  Action for Children  will learn from all of this. They must commit to involving advocates from the groups they seek to represent. They must ensure that they are not misrepresenting people, or perpetuating dangerous stereotypes.

{"date": "19 Jan 2009", "body": "\nStaring me! I didn't get off to such a good start though. The taxi was to pick me up at 8.15 am to arrive at the BBC by 8.45. I woke several times in the night, always checking the time on our clock radio. Just after 7am I had to sort out the dog and though I felt wide awake, I went back to bed as I didn't want to sit about worrying for over an hour. The phone rang a while later; I was told my taxi was waiting, and had been outside for 10 minutes. I stupidly told him it was almost an hour early, but no, turns out my clock was an hour late. Yikes! I managed to get ready quick sharp, aware that given how little time I'd spent on my appearance, I was presenting a face for radio. The taxi man worked some sort of miracle and got me to Broadcasting House on time. I'd a few minutes before we entered the studio and chatted with the lovely Ann Marie, a woman with Asperger's, about the test and the media coverage. She shared my disgust at the comments expressed in the Daily (spit) Mail's disgusting article by the crone Sarler. (I'd link, except it'd make me feel dirty.) We were shown into the studio. William Crawley was charming and welcomed us while the news was read. Then we listened in as he discussed a story about a soap opera and a crucifix with a vicar and... Minnete (a damaged baby is a damaged family) Marrin , another crone who puts  big hate on the disabled young'uns . Oh man I wish she'd been staying for the autism test discussion, I'd have relished the chance to question her! Below is the show podcast. The autism bit starts after 6 minutes. The BBC ram file link is  here . The segment began with a few \"voices from the street,\"  almost all in favour of screening. Then  Professor Fitzgerald  was introduced. I knew him as the man who specialises in diagnosing the dead. He's written several books linking autism with important and clever historical figures. He defined the condition as a variety of problems, with some people like  Frank Pantridge ,  Joyce  and  Beckett  having a very high IQ while others (1 in 200 he says) exhibit savant skills. He said that if pregnancies with high testosterone were terminated, since you wouldn't know what level of autism it was you'd put humanity at risk as people with autism and Asperger's are going to save us when the sun burns out. He claimed that autism is quite different from Down Syndrome, which isn't associated with genius. He then repeated his theory. ( My thoughts- are the only people who matter geniuses? Also, Simon Baron-Cohen's measurement of testosterone was never intended to be used as a prenatal screening tool. ) A spokesperson from a charity called  Antenatal Results and Choices  said that they see people make difficult and different decisions after prenatal diagnosis and didn't reckon people would end pregnancies on the possibility that their baby had autism. She didn't think there'd be a national screening but that people who already have severely autistic children who'd say they couldn't cope with another one might want the test. Since not everyone would be tested, autism wouldn't be eliminated because after all, we still have people with Down Syndrome. ( That's nice to know...snark. ) Anne Marie spoke next, giving a definition of Asperger's that matched the learned professor's; these people are on the high end of the spectrum, there's a lack of eye contact, a lack of empathy, etc, but usually with a high IQ and sensory issues. She told how she came to be diagnosed after her daughter, and how it explained some difficulties she's experienced growing up. Her daughter's diagnosis helped her get educational support and to improve her socialisation difficulties. ( Does she really believe that about empathy? ) Then it was my turn. I was asked that, though I love my son and wouldn't wish for a world without him, what would I say to those mothers who have autism in their family line who would choose to have screening and abort affected fetuses. I thought he said \"mothers who have a child with autism in their family.\" I answered, after a pause as my mind went blank, that I didn't think it was fair that a child should pass a subjective test to be born, that autistic lives should be as valuable as other lives and that no one can predict the outcome for a child based on a diagnosis just like you can't predict it for other children. William asked if I thought the issue was quality control, that some people are acceptable while others are not. I agreed and explained that testing for a condition implies that those people are less valuable than those without it. Then it was the good professor's turn again. He was asked why he made a case for protecting geniuses, but why not protect children with Down Syndrome? Prof. Fitzgerald agreed but insisted that he was speaking about the survival of the planet. Individual mothers should have the test and make up their own minds. ( That seems to go against the idea of protecting the vulnerable post diagnosis.) He reckoned it's a question of individual rights versus survival of the species and claimed that genius and learning disability are often found in the same families. Anne Marie said that society doesn't know enough about autism and Asperger's to make decisions on this. She then said that Asperger's and autistic people like Bill Gates have a lot to offer and should be cherished. The ARC spokesperson was asked about the risks of the test itself. (Hold on a minute, what test are you lot discussing here? Do you know something I don't because  there is no test yet !) She answered however by detailing the risks of the amniocentesis test. Baron-Cohen's cohort had the testosterone in amnionic fluid measured that way. (I think there's a mix up in that people are assuming that this is going to provide the basis for the strictly hypothetical test!) Prof. Fitzgerald wittered on yet again about the autistic Champions of the Universe, but said it was each woman's individual choice. He then told how 1% of people are autistic. Anne Marie mentioned that many people are not yet diagnosed. I came in to say that I thought the role of society is very important as it's hard to make a choice while autistic people and families are not supported and I got my little NAS quote in about focusing research on improving the well being of and opportunities for autistic people rather than focusing on cure and prevention. Eventually Prof. Fitzgerald mentioned that autism is complex and Baron-Cohen's work looked at autistic traits which doesn't correlate to autism. He talked about risk factors in families with an autistic child already. My final point was that it's difficult to discuss this while the media presentation of autism is so negative and doesn't tell of families which are managing fine and thriving even with children with severe autism \"like my son who's just an adorable, quirky, amazing child.\" Anne Marie finished by saying that the world could miss out on a lot, there needs to be more acceptance and this goes back to Hitler and the Nazis and the professionals and aspies she knows fear the world would be like Stepford Wives. I left feeling like I should have said more, but that I'd made a decent effort in my first time speaking on the radio. I'd been nervous, you can hear it in my voice. But it had been a decent discussion. I hope I was able to repesent my view that ALL autistic people have worth.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/minette_marrin/article5258348.ece", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/radioulster/sunday_sequence/story5.ram", "http://www.professormichaelfitzgerald.eu/index.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pantridge", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett", "http://www.arc-uk.org/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/autism-discussion-on-radio.html", "title": "\nAutism discussion on the radio\n"},
{"date": "25 Jan 2009", "body": "\nI had a reply from Gary Day of Action for Children to my letter of complaint regarding their campaign: \"Thank you for your recent e-mail concerning our current advertising campaign. I am sorry that the current 'Dan' TV advert has upset you this was never our intention. Action for Children's new advert focuses on how we as a charity help to transform the lives of the most vulnerable children and young people. It is focussed on the real story of Dan who has autism. The advert is the second of three, which all take real and different stories from children and young people across our different areas of work. As a charity we're committed to giving vulnerable children and young people a voice about issues that affect them-and this approach was central to the way we designed and produced the ads, and why we feature real voices and real experiences and are highlighting the story of a child suffering with autism. Dan tells his own story in his own words, and he chose to name his condition, the drawings that you see were also drawn by Dan, the pictures depict how he saw himself before we as a charity got involved and helped Dan and his family. Of course we would not intend to cause any distress to anyone who has autism or parents who care for a child with it and hope instead that people will understand that there are organisations like us who are there to give support to parents and children who have the condition, should they need it. We also hope that through raising the profile of children who have autism and those who look after them, we can help to give a voice to those who are in this situation. If you would like to complain about our advertisements then you can do this by contacting the Advertising Standards Authority at www.asa.org.uk.  They will look in to your complaint and if your concerns are upheld then we will be instructed to change or remove the advert. Once again I can only apologise for causing you upset and hope I have been able to explain why we are currently airing this advert on TV in its current form. Yours sincerely Gary Day Head of Supporter Care\" I don't think this even approaches a reasonable defence of this revolting advertisement and campaign. I didn't write because I'm upset or offended.  It does matter that you will cause distress to autistic people. If you care about that, then do the decent thing and remove the advertisement. Have a look at what  Bev has done with the illustrations  on her blog. Though I hope Dan benefited financially as much as ad agency Baby Creative, and \" director Dan Sumich, who worked on the David Beckham \"Impossible is Nothing\" ad campaign for Adidas \" that the ad tells his story makes it no less objectionable and disturbing. Dan's story is tragic. He's blaming himself for the problems he faces and has been taught to regard his autism as a monster to be defeated and that he would be better off acting as non-autistic as possible. You have portrayed a dangerous and damaging view of autism. This ad will hurt vulnerable young autistic people. It will also reinforce the prejudice that already exists in wider society against autistic people. The only way you can make this right is the cancel the ad and the web campaign in their current forms. Next time you want to use the problems of autistic children to sell your charity, please seek out the superior knowledge of autistic self-advocate organisations and mainstream autism charities like the NAS. The  Guardian has an article  on this campaign: \"Our values of passion, hope and equality continue throughout this campaign,\" said Polly Neate, executive director of public affairs and communications at AFC. \"We deliberately avoid the more traditional charity methods of playing on guilt or shock. In all our work and now our advertising, the focus is on positive outcomes for the most vulnerable children.\" How can Polly Neate think the autism ad is not playing on guilt or shock? Hasn't she watched it yet? I have started a Facebook group called  Let's Stop \"Action for Children\" demonising autistic children . Please join and invite your friends. We managed to get rid of the  NYU \"ransom notes\"  advertisements. We can do it here too if we work together.

{"date": "24 Jan 2009", "body": "\nI was having a pleasant enough evening though Duncan was finding it hard to settle to sleep and boinged up and down the stairs with his wind-up torch and battered  Green Eggs and Ham  book. I'd enjoyed the splendid  @stephenfry  on the rehabilitated  @wossy  show and was impressed by just how much Tom Cruise resembles a 3/4 size  Michael-6 . I'd a case of itchy remote finger so flicked the channels about a bit, and then I saw it: an horrific new advertisement by the charity  Action for Children . A few minutes later I saw that Mike had already blogged about it and  presented his reasoned objections  to the ad. He has also transcribed the voice over: \"I used to lash out if something pushed my buttons or I wasn\u2019t able to do something. Things that wound me up were if they\u2019d insulted me I would physically hurt that young person. My parents sought out help with my autism because it was becoming a pain in the bum. I went to an Action for Children school. I started feeling a bit more friendlier with other people. Thanks to the carers I was able to correct a lot of errors in my behaviour and become a better person. Well I feel a lot more confident thanks to them. I feel at peace with myself.\" So there's a boy, an adolescent, who lashes out at people who insult him and push his buttons. People who harass disabled kids are bullies. Dan's  would  benefit from learning better ways to deal with the bullying but it's unfair that he's been taught to blame his autism which he says was, \"becoming a pain in the bum.\" He was, he says, \"able to correct a lot of errors in my behaviour and become a better person.\" What a great self image(!) Action for Children must be so proud to have a boy feel that he has defeated his nasty autism like that. It sounds like a classic case of blaming the victim. I dashed off a rather strident but heartfelt letter to the charity. \"I am the mother of an autistic child. I saw your new advertisement on TV a couple of minutes ago and was slack jawed with horror. It is just so very wrong. I am astonished that anyone thought it would be a good idea to demonise autistic children in such an overtly horrid way. The boy's (Dan's) autism is portrayed as the monster with the nice well behaved boy trapped inside, a reprise of a theme many of us are sick hearing. Who on earth did you consult with before unleashing this monstrosity on the world? How will autistic children feel after seeing themselves portrayed in such a way? Please think again about what message this portrays. Have you read any of the commentary about autism from the past few weeks when there was lots of media discussion about developing prenatal screening. It was unremittingly awful and biased against autistic people. Your terrible ad will further reinforce the view many have of autism as a miserable thief of children and destroyer of families. Families with autistic members face enough difficulties, discrimination and stress from the lack of understanding of society. Your organisation has just gone and made our lives even harder.\" There's more information about \"Dan\"  here . It just gets worse. Dan is said to have \"a form of autism that is characterised by difficulties with social interaction\" but was able to, \"find peace with himself at Action for Children's Headlands project.\" But we also discover that he felt betrayed when his parents left him at this residential school and he sat alone, really upset, in his room for ages. He says it took him a year to feel a bit steadier. I have to wonder how Headlands school treats autistic children. This is the image of themselves they choose to portray; a vulnerable and sad child, blaming himself for his problems, sitting around alone for a year before he accepts the friendship of his  wardens  teachers.Then he's shown as finally breaking free of the autism monster that has been entrapping him. Zipidee-doda. I've had enough of this crap. It's bad enough when it's a contrarian old crone writing in the Daily Fail who is penning horrible portrayals of children like my son. It's a whole lot worse when it's a major UK children's charity. Action for Children say they are  \"committed to helping the most vulnerable children and young people in the UK break through injustice, deprivation and inequality, so they can achieve their full potential.\" With this campaign they have failed the people they seek to help.

Unfortunately he opted to watch films about ear wax extraction as we ate. I persuaded him to watch more  Morph films  first, and watch ear wax films later. (RIP  Tony Hart , a source of joy and inspiration to so many.) Lady started to work on a volcano kit she'd been given as a gift ages ago. The boys gathered to watch and participate. Duncan was alarmed at the idea of an explosion in the kitchen. I was able to explain that it isn't a real volcano, just a little pretend one for children. He donned the plastic safety glasses and helped with the first activity, a basic demonstration of the effects of coloured water on a mixture of citric acid and sodium bicarbonate. He was impressed, the others were a bit underwhelmed. Next they painted the volcano case and we've left it to dry in preparation for a demonstration of the stunning power of our planet. The weather wasn't too bad so we headed off to the playground for a while. Duncan ran the length of the tennis courts, throwing his orange \"Green Eggs and Ham\" book into the air several time. He told me he was doing \"the egg travels\" and though I don't know the scene he means (from Disney's  Dinosaur ), I trust his interpretation. Lady did gymnastics moves and pushed her brothers fast in the spinning bowl thing. They have an uncanny tolerance for rotational movement. Thomas does effortless gorgeousness.

Even had I not won, that was a fantastic experience and was the first time I got to meet some very friendly, funny, welcoming and supportive people and later, it was lovely to join some of these people in contributing a chapter to the  Homepages  book. As always I have loved the energy, vision, honesty and power in the efforts of those in the disability/autism blogging communities (you know what section of this I mean) to tackle discrimination, delusion and to improve the lives of people like Duncan. I hope that in some small way my words will seep out and possibly influence someone somewhere to think differently about autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SW-bpTLNRsI/AAAAAAAAAkg/MrWYB6WKa38/s1600-h/yearly+stats.png", "http://homepagesthebook.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/3-years-of-voyage.html", "title": "\n3 years of The Voyage\n"},

He'd get to sit at a computer, in a quiet room, and use his brilliant eye for detail and technical abilities. His peculiar overall vision might bring him into dispute with the director though! OK, I know I'm just spouting and getting way too far ahead of things. But no matter what happens when he's an adult, he's certainly enjoying making films now. Over the past few days he's churned out about 10 films using Windows Movie Maker. He imports a piece of music and a selection of images, some he created from scratch, others he copied from the web and a few that he copied and then customised. He drags each component into place, precisely and in a carefully designed order. Then he adds credits or titles, choosing the text font and style and colour scheme. He types his own text. He adds effects. He may ask me for help in finding a certain effect. Yesterday he called me over, pointed to the image on screen and said, \"make it...\" as he closed one eye and moved right up to the screen. He didn't have the words to say that he wanted to see the picture \"ease in\" but now he does. He has learnt how to fade in and out, pan across, and has experimented with other effects. He publishes and saves the film. Then he calls me over and asks me to complete the final stage, upload his masterpiece onto  my YouTube channel , letting him type in his choice of title. I think he needs his own channel! I've added 7 of his films in the past few days. Most of them use Justin Timberlake's \"Cry me a river\" song; he wanted to use the Black Eyed Peas \"Phunk it\" but YouTube kept blocking the audio for breaching copyright. Obviously, people will choose to watch Duncan's peculiar little videos rather than pay for a CD or download(!) He's also used the theme music from Disney's Dinosaur film-I expect that'll be blocked eventually too. He loves to watch the films he made on YouTube alongside all his favourites, featuring BBC idents and various logos, Rugrats, Tots TV and Thomas characters. I think this one is my favourite as it's got more of his own pictures. These guys are from Kinder Eggs, the blue haired fella with the sad face is Oliver, who features heavily in Duncan's work and his friend with purple hair is Siver.

{"date": "12 Jan 2009", "body": "\nChecking the  Guardian  late last night, I saw a glut of autism headlines. The first is  New research brings autism screening closer to reality . Baron-Cohen and his team have just published on their study tracking 250 children, all of whom had amniotic fluid testosterone levels tested prenatally. These non-autistic children's consequent development has been studied until they were 8 years old. I have not managed to source the study paper but on the  ARC website I read : So far we have only conducted studies of typical individual differences and found that foetal testosterone is inversely associated with social development, language development, and empathy; and that foetal testosterone is positively associated with systemizing and number of autistic traits. So, based on this, the papers are shouting about prenatal screening tests? Baron-Cohen's testosterone theory of autism is not well established or universally accepted. Baron-Cohen seems to accept that the current male/female ratio of autism diagnosis represents the real numbers while other researchers think that  women are underdiagnosed . Moreover, what this study has measured is a few autistic \"traits\" which is not the same thing as autism. These are just ways of being that vary in the population, it's possible to be a bit less chatty and not much of a party animal and not be autistic! And I wish they'd drop that old canard about autism and reduced empathy. Where is that coming from? It's a dangerous, damaging delusion. So there's no proven link between high fetal environment testosterone levels and autism, but even if there was, there's no way of telling how each affected child would develop. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the research team, told the Guardian that it is now time to start considering where society stands on the issue.  \"If there was a prenatal test for autism, would this be desirable? What would we lose if children with autistic spectrum disorder were eliminated from the population?\" he said. \"We should start debating this. There is a test for Down's syndrome and that is legal and parents exercise their right to choose termination, but autism is often linked with talent. It is a different kind of condition.\" The research could, equally controversially, open the way for treatment, he said. \"We could do something about it. Some researchers or drug companies might see this as an opportunity to develop a pre-natal treatment. There are drugs that block testosterone. But whether we'd want to would be a different matter.\" Why is it necessary to find a way to prevent people who perceive the world differently, people like my son, with all their strengths, problems, disabilities and talents from existing? Even if this theory was to lead to a prenatal screening tool, which I very much hope it doesn't as it would have little sensitivity and specificity, need we discuss the right of autistic people to be born? It's also irrelevant that autistic people can have special talents that benefit society and that if there was a way of telling if a child could grow up to be (sarcasm) a useful, clever autist or a wasteful, stupid autist with absolutely nothing to offer (/sarcasm) the test would be more useful. Heck, if everyone had to prove their usefulness to society to be allowed to exist, the world's population would take a big drop. It is also very premature to be thinking about using this bit of research to work on curative techniques. An NAS spokesperson says that currently gaining a diagnosis can take too long, and while better diagnostic tests would help speed that up: \"It is important to stress that everyone with autism has the potential to make a unique and valued contribution to society. It is not always the autism that is a problem. It is other people and a lack of services and support.\" I can think of no reason save the chance to offer abortions, why a better diagnostic test has to be done prenatally. The final few paragraphs quote Vivienne Nathanson, the head pf ethics at the BMA. These made me feel queasy. This is how the ethicist of a leading doctor's group puts it:  \"The question, then, is are we comfortable with [testing] for a disorder which is life-limiting in terms of opportunities and experience, rather than life-ending?\" she said. \"My guess is that society would look at it like Down's syndrome,\" she said. \"There are people who wouldn't approve of terminations and people who would. If you talk to parents of people with autism, however much they love their children, they find it very difficult. They agonise over their child's limited life opportunities and some of them say it would have been better not to have had the child and some don't.\" The more complicated ethical issue would be that of treatment in the womb, she said. \"You get to the situation where you have a very great difficulty if families say we wouldn't want to be tested. As a society, do we accept that people can refuse tests when the outcome can make a difference to that unborn child?\" That final sentence sends chills up my spine: \"As a society, do  we  accept that  people can refuse  tests when the outcome can make a difference to that unborn child?\" Is it a possibility that people will one day be forced to have these tests? I also listened to the  Guardian podcast by Mike Duran  about this and I felt obliged to transcribe some of it. Health editor, Sarah Boseley is introduced and takes on the role of explaining the research. Here's some of what she had to say: \"...It might be possible to test the levels of testosterone around the growing fetus in the womb. ... This is research done on NORMAL children, not autistic children...we all have some autistic traits; being LESS sociable, being LESS verbally agile, and perhaps LESS empathetic towards other people. ... Autism spectrum disorder runs a LONG way from the development of MINOR difficult traits such as children not being very sociable and not being very verbally skilled which might lead to learning difficulties right through to people who probably can't lead a normal life outside of an institution, who can't communicate with anybody, who couldn't hold a conversation and somewhere around there also are some very interesting, very BRILLIANT people who perhaps become mathematicians or musicians. What you can't possible know if you have a prenatal test in the womb is what level of autism, what place on the autistic spectrum your child would have. (My emphasis.) Who briefed this woman and how can she speak such rubbish? Autistic people are either BRILLIANT or have to be stuck in institutions, unable to converse or communicate in any way!? Too many people have taken the idea of the autism spectrum and apply it rigidly as if it was a linear thing, with each autistic person falling somewhere along a line of \"functioning\" level, when it's much fuzzier than that. People are good at some things and bad at others, ability to cope varies with time and location, stress levels and accommodations available. A child could cope brilliantly at home but have severe difficulty at a badly optimised school. An adult may do well while at university but flounder in a certain job. Very few (most likely no) autistic people cannot communicate in any way whatsoever. On the matter of causes of autism, she said: \"...it seems to be a combination of genes and the environment, we don't know what the environmental factors are. But a lot of genes are now being identified, over 100 of them so far, that do have some link with autism and it does look that if we can't have a prenatal test featuring testosterone then one day you may be able to do pre-implantation genetic diagnosis...and you would be able to identify an embryo that tended towards autism and again it could lead to a termination.\" Shudder. At least she's not messing around with a story about how this is good news for autistic people as early warning can help parents prepare, no, it's all about getting rid of the damaged goods. Duran then talks to Charlotte Moore, mum to 2 autistic sons. She says that she doesn't see autism as a disease that has to be eradicated and that the vast majority of autistic people can have a good quality of life provided certain accommodations are made, but these can be difficult to achieve. She says that in the hypothetical situation where pregnant mothers are told that their babies may be autistic, they should try to read about the condition. But she said, it would be hard for them as it's so complex and they have a short time to make their decision. Also, each person has to decided how they would cope with the situation themselves but they should speak to parents of autistic children about what their view is. But the short time available would not give the woman any picture of what her own life would be like. There was no mention of learning from individuals who are themselves autistic. Duran then asked Moore a question that just shocked me, \"Would it depend also on whether the child had other siblings because there are forms of autism which could put those siblings in danger if they manifest violence among other anti-social traits?\" Sweet mother of mercy this is the  Guardian ! Even for a devil's advocate question, that showed a disgusting level of ignorance, prejudice and callousness. If this guy's going to talk about autistic people, children even, as if they're anti-social sibling beaters (when I'd say it's far more likely that autistic people themselves are at a far higher risk of physical and emotional harm-I can look for evidence for that theory if needed) he will affect the public's perception of the condition and increase the fear and ignorance. Then it's a given that pregnant women will opt to abort the \"monsters\" they're carrying. Is there a test to see if the child you're pregnant with will grow up to be a thief, an abuser, a drug dealer, a thug, a user, a murderer? Is autism so much more deserving of eradication than all these? Thankfully Charlotte Moore says \"It's too crude to say you shouldn't have an autistic child because it might damage your other children. I would just reject that.\" Duran asks, \"Do you welcome this test, doctors presumably would argue that armed with the facts you can prepare for any problems with what the National Autistic Society calls a serious, life-long, disabling condition?\" Moore replies that it would be good as:  \"most parents can't tell until the child is a toddler sometimes beyond [that s/he has autism] and what happens is that you waste a lot of time acting as if your child is not autistic and maybe making a lot of wrong choices about how, what you do with your child. Where if at least if you'd had the test when you were pregnant and you knew that your child was going to be autistic, then you would be better prepared...\" I don't agree. I want to see basic research on autism but with caveats. The  NAS phrased it well : The National Autistic Society (NAS) welcomes research into all areas which may further our understanding of autism, but it is vital that the information gained from any research is handled responsibly. The rationale for research into autism must always be to improve the well being of and increase the opportunities for people affected by the condition. Michelle Dawson, is forever saying it  and the message has yet to sink in: autistic people deserve to be benefit from and be protected by recognized standards of science and ethics. I look forward to the day this happens.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.guardian.co.uk/", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/12/autism-screening-health", "http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/research/project.asp?id=13", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7616555.stm", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/audio/2009/jan/12/guardian-daily-podcast", "http://www.autism.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2074&a=18466", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/prenatal-tests-and-curing-autism-in.html", "title": "\nPrenatal tests and curing autism in The Guardian\n"},
{"date": "11 Jan 2009", "body": "\n Pure, refreshing, and lacking all medicinal properties. Oh this is delicious. I had another  comment  from the person who was unhappy with my  assessment of homeopathy recently , and whose contribution was so hilarious that I dedicated a post to answering her/him. Well s/he came back and it's beautiful. I showed Gordon what this person wrote and he decided that he wanted to leave a comment. But I don't want his words of wisdom buried away as a comment on a post written last year so I offered him the opportunity to write a guest post for my award winning (snarf) blog. He has agreed. So, I take great pleasure in introducing the first even contribution to the blogosphere (he's not written so much as a comment before; too busy doing properly useful stuff like trying to cure cancer and that) from the man known to some as Gordon! (Yay! Applause!) Homeopathy: a lucrative hoax founded on belief and not evidence by Gordon Anonymous  wrote , \"You may well know chemistry,but you certainly do not know homeopathy...\" I feel that it is important to state some simple facts about homeopathy and why it is not only a belief system founded on the supernatural, but potentially harmful. Yes I am a doctor, yes I do conduct clinical trials and have a passion for pharmacology, so perhaps I'm biased, but here goes. ... fact 1. Homeopathy has never demonstrated effectiveness - ever. Period. We define causality in therapeutics by its effectiveness compared with some sort of control. The simplest, easiest control is comparison of the treatment in question with \"nothing\" or \"placebo\". Lets say for argument's sake that homeopathy could have a measurable benefit even in the absence of any scientific explanation of how it works. If a benefit can be shown to be causal, all things being equal, homeopathy must demonstrate a greater benefit in persons receiving it compared with nothing at all. Simple as that. Anecdotes, telling of individual cases of suggested benefit are completely meaningless. Why? Because spontaneous remissions and disease stabilization happen in individuals, even in cancer (my speciality). Its the cohort effect that matters and provides the measure of effectiveness ie. benefit in a group of individuals treated either at the same time or one after another. So...A simple study taking as the  \"lowest bar\", the easiest possible comparator to beat, i.e. nothing, should be able to demonstrate efficacy for homeopathy shouldn't it? Well actually, no it can't....I challenge ANYONE to show me a randomized (all bias removed), prospective study where homeopathy has shown any benefit above \"nothing whatsoever\". I have no doubt at all, that this will not be possible, ever. The reason is simple, homeopathy is placebo and therefore it will never be possible to demonstrate superiority over \"nothing at all\". (You know, sometimes in real therapeutics, we try to demonstrate non-inferiority of a new therapy over an old one. We need large numbers, often thousands of patients to do this. Taking this to its logical conclusion with comparison of one placebo over another, the numbers of patients required to show a difference could be astronomically large or even infinite. Meaning in reality that such a difference can never be shown!) The anecdotes that we see relating to little Timmy's \"asthma getting better\" time and time again are utterly meaningless. It demonstrates a total failure on the part of those believers purporting efficacy of homeopathy to simply consider whether the suggested effects of this approach can work when the numbers of treated individuals are greater than one. Do we ever see response rates? Of course we don't. Could anyone out there tell me for example if the homeopathic treatment response rate for urticaria (or anything) is say 20%? I thought not. Running even a non-randomized study, gathering data to present some simple evidence of efficacy is too much and would collapse the arguments of the \"homeopathy-peddler\". Asking for randomized data may be a little much I suppose, but benefit rates? That should simple right ? Even that is too much, and would expose the lucrative fraud that is homeopathy.  Fact 2. Science has no explanation for how homeopathy could work in the first place. It simply goes against natural science, the thing that brought us, yes you guessed it....civilization including the Internet that you are reading this on!!! Take a quick look at the history of science and it is clear that we have a thorough but still very incomplete knowledge of how our universe works. Certainly some of the 20th century's great scientific discoveries revealed some uncomfortable truths (take that to mean testable theories that hold true), as revealed through the wonders of quantum mechanics or relativity as two examples.  We all know that if a cake is divided into more and more parts, we ultimately get less and less. Try dividing a cake into 100, million pieces sometime and see how much cake you end up with! At the heart of pharmacology, the study of drugs that do work, the law of mass action is central. Simply put, the action of any agent is related to how much of it is around.... How easy is that to understand? Homeopathy believers, take this fundamental natural law, equivalent to saying \"things fall when dropped\", and turn it on its head. \"No\", they say, \"..When things become dilute, they acquire a potency!\" Moreover, they state that this potency can modify biological systems in a direction that can be exploited as therapy.   A quick examination of this homeopathic principle makes it clear that it is rooted in belief  and nothing else . The same sort of belief that has led humans throughout history to believe in ghosts, elves, sun gods, animal sacrifice, etc...Without evoking some supernatural unproven, invented \"idea\" about what happens when a substance becomes dilute, my smallest child can tell you that if you mix a fruit cordial with enough water, it tastes like water...That's because folks, and here's the rub...With enough dilution that's what it becomes. But you all know that don't you? A very famous pharmacologist, the late Jaques Benveniste, who I once respected for his work on platelet activating factor and allergy, caused one hell of a fuss some years back when he proposed that homeopathic dilutions of an allergy inducing antibody called IgE could still cause degranulation of histamine from mast cells, an event linked to allergy. Quite rightly he stated this as an observation without explanation but one which was statistically robust. I found this fascinating. It was reported in Nature which I can tell you has one hell of a high bar for evidence based reporting. However, Benviniste was discredited when it shown that robust reproduction of his experiments were not possible. The claims were false. Dilutions of an active agent cannot retain their initial activity. This original Benveniste paper is I believe, the closest homeopathy ever came to being considered science. Since then (1988), the truth has been somewhat different. fact 3. Duping vulnerable individuals with falsehood is financially lucrative and is not subject to any regulatory control, compared with real medicines. Lets be absolutely clear   about this. Homeopathy is a big business and makes its peddlers money. Homeopathy is quasi-therapeutics, based on no evidence, yet somehow is legal ! I'm baffled at this. For a real drug, it requires years of painstaking research in the laboratory and clinic. Years and perhaps hundreds of thousands, may be millions of US dollars worth  of funding before it even achieves a licence (IND) to allow the first experiments or clinical trials in human beings. Even then, the rate of success of a drug getting into routine practice after reaching this massively important stage is very low, around 10%. Studies are then required to establish the right dose (phase 1), and whether there is any meaningful activity (phase 2). Only when this has been shown, is there the opportunity to conduct the definitive randomized controlled phase III trial. Only if the activity of the experimental drug \"beats\" this control, will the study be positive (you would be astonished at how many negative phase III trials are out there). Even with a positive phase III trial, there is no guarantee that an agent will \"change clinical practice\", because the difference in efficacy (often minimal) could be insufficient to justify the costs of that new medicine. Agencies such as the FDA and the EMEA are around to make sure that before a licence to sell a drug as a medicine is given, the evidence base for its activity is sound. Given all of this investment in what is a \"odds-against\" enterprise, is it surprising that massive global pharmaceutical companies are needed to deliver new medicines ? But wait, there is another way. Lets just state that a homeopathic remedy is effective, bypass of this testing and regulatory bullshit and just get our remedies to market!!  That way we can sell a panoply of remedies for all sorts of not really serious ailments. Rashes, bowel issues, you know the sort.....Of course its good business. If I were of lower moral standing I would have done this ages ago myself. Imagine how much money I could get if I used my MD PhD credentials to con people into paying for my magic water! Perhaps the only justification for not sanctioning homeopathists is that they peddle water, and as we all know water is harmless....Or is it ? I think that people duped into spending money on homeopathy need to have the best information about what they are spending money on. If they were appropriately informed, I think the market would rightly collapse. Why should \"water\" be a solution for patients where conventional cancer therapy fails to work (for example), in the absence of any evidence, either laboratory-based or early trial evidence of activity. Much better for a patient to be offered treatment in a clinical trial. The possibility that asthmatics or any other patients with potentially life threatening conditions might be treated with homeopathy, fills me with horror. But then, perhaps the homeopathist would defer to the conventional therapy for \"such serious conditions\". Now that's what I call a cop out. Where are your balls homeopathists??? The idea that the UK National Health Service in the UK uses tax payers money to fund a homeopathic hospital at a time when there is major rationing and lack of availability of effective therapy, is nothing short of scandalous. But this is a fight that other distinguished colleagues have waged for sometime. In summary, homeopathy is an often lucrative belief system based on  no evidence whatsoever.   Let me say that again:  no evidence whatsoever.  Those who support it have no grounds to do so. They are in the same camp as people who believe in astrology or any other supernatural phenomena. Their view of the natural world is distorted by the invented, rather than the demonstrable. Homeopathy is dangerous because it offers something that does not exist, efficacy without evidence. I have no problem about people spending their hard earned bucks on sugar pills  (hell, we still have cigarettes to get rid of). What I do have a problem with, are the liars who purport to know something about this universe that we live in, without the slightest evidence, then attempt to convince the most intellectually vulnerable in our society to believe it too. Its just wrong. I invite anyone reading this who disagrees, to challenge what I have said. I don't expect much of a response.... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SWnF6GUlZoI/AAAAAAAAAkE/XAzOnQHFErs/s1600-h/1129828_65679113.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/guest-post-by-gordon-medical-experts.html", "title": "\nGuest post by Gordon; A medical expert's assessment of homeopathy\n"},

One was upset at my bad attitude to John Melnychuk : Can someone please explain why John Melnychuk is being harranged liked this when the child in question is %95 less violent and his digestion has improved? All the snide remarks seem to me to be based on contempt for a system of therapeutics that you have judged long before you have understood it- if you ever have understood it. Ignorantly poking fun at something can hardly have anything to do with a search for scientific truth. While you continue along these lines of thinking and communication, people all over the globe are using homeopathy to help heal all manner of illness. This has been demonstrated on people of all ages and on animals. Oh FFS. How can people be smart enough to type a message on a blog (admittedly not a thing requiring much in the way of brain power) and yet unable to see just what a pile of rubbish they're spouting. Tell me where, anon, Melnychuk has been \"harranged\"(sic)? How do you know whether the child is \"%95 less violent\" or that \"his digestion has improved\", and if he has, how can the changes be attributed to the magik water? You claim that I'm dismissing a system I don't understand, well Anon, I studied enough chemistry to know what Avogadro's number is and how there can be no molecules of the original substance in extremely dilute \"remedies\". I'm going to go with the whole evidence based thing over some eighteenth century nostrum. Will you be the first person ever to provide proof that there has been any confirmed cure of a non self limiting disease using homeopathy alone? I don't think so. Why do people look for a cure or sucessful treatment for illness and then scoff when one is demonstrated? If it is so incredible to you that autism can be cured or much improved then why are you even looking at this kind of information? Why don't you just accept your plight and stop reading and searching. Who do you say is looking for a cure? Not I! I read about this stuff because I was appalled at the awful treatment an autistic child had suffered at the hands of a quack. I hope to shed some light on the high amount of misinformation and nonsense in Melnychuk's article. I am disgusted that these charlatans think they can treat autism. I think you might like to rethink your wording of that last sentence: having Duncan in my life is no  plight , but a pleasure. Perhaps some reading on the history of medicine would be helpful. Grossing wrote about the different schools of thought in his book Homeopathy the Great Riddle. I believe it would be somewhat enlightening to one who could read it neutrally- if one could read it neutrally. Much of this is really about two different perspectives- materialism vs. vitalism. It would be interesting to read the commentary in 100 years from now on medicine in the 20th century. Some of the scare tactics from those promoting the current medical system (especially vaccines) sound like the ones from 200 years ago except that then they ended with something like \"if you spare the lancet from your child's mouth\"- a reference to bloodletting. It would be nice to get beyond all this. Yep, it's about 2 perspectives all right, reality and make believe.  Vitalism ?! What the heck is that? So those promoting vaccines describe the risks of infectious diseases, and you call that scare tactics. It'd be nice to get beyond this silliness alright. So then another one pops up, this time  Lyak shares some advice : Instead of attaching all these labels to your son (ADHD and autism) why don't you try to heal him? Loads of people have helped their children who have autistic symptons and even recovered them. Homoeopathy is a safe theraputic system that has been used for hundreds of years with lots of sucess. It's helped children like your son too. http://www.impossiblecure.com/autism.html Good Luck!! Oh Lyak, you sound all polite and all as you dispense your badly spelt advice. So forgive me, but such tripe doesn't help at all. But good luck to you too!! There's word of a film being made about homeopathy and autism, to be called \"Saving a Lost Generation\". Can't these people think up any new metaphors for autism, surely the whole, lost, trapped, missing, changeling child thing is old now? Anyway, this story is beautifully dealt with by jdc325  here . I promise, I'll be nice again tomorrow. Probably.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SWPLCo7I42I/AAAAAAAAAiM/V4HZ8qhehRQ/s1600-h/538383_27494381.jpg", "http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/saving-a-lost-generation-autism-and-homeopathy/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/homeopathy-cures-autism.html", "title": "\nHomeopathy cures autism\n"},
{"date": "7 Jan 2009", "body": "\nI took the children shopping yesterday. My brother discovered the existence of a decent sports shop next to our local Tesco store when he was here last week. Not that he had to have great exploration skills, he just ambled into the shop and had a peek upstairs, something I'd not thought to try. Duncan needed shoes so off we go to see if anything is suitable. Almost as soon as we're in and up the stairs, he notices a light blue hooded top. \"Get that one, it's a Rugrats top.\" I check the size and price and all's well so I pick it up. He shrugs off his navy top and dons the new one immediately. Then since he's trying to emulate Chuckie who only ever wears shorts, he rolls his trouser legs up to his knees. I have to say, he looks a bit odd. He dashes around the shop looking for other Rugrat inspired items. Eventually I get him to come and look at the shoes. It's hard to source a pair of size ones and keep up with a whirling boy. He wants red shoes, but finding none, settles for black, Velcro fastening trainers. He spots a pair of trousers adorned with pictures of Spongebob Squarepants. As he's grown out of some trousers recently, I allow him to get these too, but am unprepared for his decision to pull his own trousers down right in the middle of the shop to try to change. I convince him to wait until I've paid. As soon as that's done he's off with the attempted stripping again so I usher them all to a changing room. As expected the trousers are long enough but much too big on the waist and need a belt. Never mind, Duncan wants to tuck the blue top inside the trousers. It's a look that makes me think of Steptoe, for some reason. So clothes bought, I turn my attention to our food needs. Trawling the big supermarkets can be a pain when you've a boy who runs. Sometimes I take his Major buggy but it's a bugger to steer and makes it hard to gather the groceries. Sometimes he squeezes into the toddler seats on the trolleys; there aren't many 8 year olds who can manage that. For the first time I notice that Tesco has these disabled child trolleys in store, with a wide seat facing the person pushing. Perfect for Duncan! He happily sat down and was strapped in and we had the easiest scoot around a shop for ages. See how a little adaptation can help! (Oh, he wants \"square purple glasses\" and to paint a \"yellow planet\" on his top now.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SWSACc061ZI/AAAAAAAAAiU/zLihUap0Uho/s1600-h/charles_crandall_chuckie_finster_jr_3.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/good-shop.html", "title": "\nGood shop\n"},

{"date": "5 Jan 2009", "body": "\nAs the old year ended I thought about how things are and what I need to change to be happier. It turns out that some major adjustments are required so I had to work out how to achieve them. I've been stressed and worried about things but I think there's been a resolution and though I'm fearful, I'm now also hopeful about the months ahead. The Christmas holiday wasn't as happy as it could have been, but there were  some  brilliant times. The children were delighted with their gifts on Christmas morning. Duncan liked the Roller Coaster Tycoon CD Rom more than anything, even the cuckoo clock. Yep, I got one, and the blasted bird doesn't go out and in properly on the hour. I would have returned it to the online shop, but I see he's already customised it by painting the bird. Thomas has been in Doctor Who heaven with his haul of DVDs, including a set from some of the old series. Lady likes her fancy new leotard and spent much time upside down against a wall or doing the splits on the floor. I enjoyed a night out in the pub with a gang of cousins and my brother and his family stayed with us for a couple of nights; they finally saw our beach. I was also very happy to spend some time with one of my oldest and dearest friends who lives in New York. She's just as wonderful as ever. Duncan has been hard work. He's very shouty and grouchy. I've not been able to figure out how to deal with it yet but it's hard. He's been emulating this awful YouTube video of an angry German kid, and keeps bashing his computer and disc boxes. It may be, actually it probably is, that he's picking up on my own less than optimal mood. He's my personal barometer. We were in Ikea yesterday and he roared and shouted, utterly obsessed with getting an ice-cream from the cafe behind the tills. I was very close to just heading off to the car with him many times. It's likely that that as well as autism, as his paediatrician pointed out, he also has ADHD and this is what causes many of the difficulties. He has next to no impulse control: he's all about the Id. He can be very focused on tasks of his choosing but it's just about impossible to get him interested in other activities. He's certainly hyperactive, and when we're out places he always dashes off to whatever it is he's interested in. He's highly oppositional. If someone in the family hums or whistles or sings, even on another floor, he shouts at them to be quiet. He hates it when people express pleasure when eating, a yum or appreciative 'mmm' is countered with his angry, 'yuck!' If someone is counting down, he'll often start counting up and saying 'go' is likely to make him shout 'stop!' I have to think again about how I can help him more. He's smart and cute, funny and loving. He's my darling boy and I'm proud of him. It's important that I see what can be changed in him or in his environment and what must be tolerated.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-year-ruminations.html", "title": "\nNew Year Ruminations\n"},
{"date": "23 Oct 2008", "body": "\n Image via  stock.xchng Tuesday is swim day. We go at lunch time when the learner pool isn't in use by school groups. It's not so long since Thomas was nervous and clung to me in the pool, tolerating only short periods in the water. Now he wears goggles and swims over and under with true dedication and joy. I can usually manage to give him one helpful tip per week to improve his doggy paddling, bum in the air, legs splayed swimming style, but he tells me he doesn't need my help and he can do it himself. He's right, he is getting about well enough and is getting better and stronger each week. Lady takes my advice slightly better and she swims now in a sleek, smooth manner, her long limbs pulling through the water. We raced a length last week, and she kept up with me, though I was looking backwards every second stroke to check on Duncan. Duncan just loves it and grins the whole time we're there, even enjoying the showers after. He has me pull him as he holds a float. I try to do a life saving stroke as I drag him along but he's the wriggliest and bossiest rescue subject ever, and insists that I swim faster and go from left to right. I tell you, I certainly get a work out anyway. One of Duncan's favourite things now is watching people go off the diving board in the adjacent diving pool, and the bigger the person, the better the splash. Last week, a very large man made him very happy by repeatedly plummeting off the board, creating gratifyingly gigantic turbulence in the pool. Duncan couldn't withhold a little shout of glee each time the big fella went off. He emulates in his own small scale way, jumping from the poolside very carefully so as not to make a big splash or to go underwater. Sometimes he enacts a little pantomime of stretches and toe touching before he goes in, muttering the script from a relevant episode of  Tommy Zoom . At 1.20 a school group arrives and we retire to the baby pool for a few minutes to watch them. Duncan likes it when they all sit on the side splashing their legs back and forth creating lots of noise and white water. He joins in from where he sits. About thirty school children are crammed into a pool which we four usually have had to ourselves for the previous 45 minutes. Lady can't help feeling a bit sorry for them as they are restricted to a narrow strip about 10m across and must follow instructions to the letter. Ah the delights and freedom of home education. Smug...us? Just a bit.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SQBkLElWaJI/AAAAAAAAAYM/VuvHti_i0KM/s1600-h/489484_47894456.jpg", "http://www.sxc.hu/home", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/tommyzoom/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/make-splash.html", "title": "\nMake a splash\n"},
{"date": "2 Dec 2008", "body": "\nDuncan is really into his  Roller Coaster Tycoon  PC game. He's been trying for ages to recreate some of the Disney World/Land rides, in particular,  Space Mountain . He kept showing me  YouTube videos  of these amazing versions of the rides, and bugging me to download them for him. I didn't know how or where to get the sets from. He's been going onto the Atari forums and scrolling through the posts. He showed me a few topics that seemed to help. It took me ages to piece together what I had to do though. It's not bad, what he managed to achieve. He typed his request, and found the relevant pages. He managed to read enough (and find the right images) to know when he was on the right track. He has tried so hard to make the coasters by himself, and he has designed some fabulous scenery, including a great version of  Expedition Everest , with snow topped mountains and all. He has a great feel for how to use the program, how to build the walls and change the landscape. It's quite astonishing really. Since I finally figured out where to get the set of files he needed to build Space Mountain (Mission 2) I helped him get the files in place. He asked me to help connect the multiple pieces, so I gave it a go. He was very disappointed with my efforts. I was sent away and he got to work himself. He kicked my ass at the game, building a beautiful, synchronised version of the ride using the well designed scenery of someone kind enough to share his work online. I downloaded  Google Sketchup  (a cool, free 3D modelling program) and let him go to work, after spending a couple of minutes showing him some basic techniques. He knew what to do and had some ideas to try out instantly. The boy's got skills at stuff like that. Perhaps it'll develop into something marketable some day, but for now, he's learning loads through his interests and enjoys them.

It's perfect for us. We managed to witness the shuttle launch on Friday evening, though we were all shattered. But you just have to make the extra effort to see something so amazing. I just couldn't stop thinking that there were people inside that huge cylinder of fire bursting into the sky. It was terrifying and thrilling just to watch. The parks have been great fun. We got a special pass for Duncan and the staff here are so lovely and can't do enough for us. We're really enjoying that USA friendliness.

He wasn't interested in my reassurances that we had a very able pilot looking after us. When we did land (very smoothly) he grinned and said, rather surprised, \"we didn't crash!\" The Vroom is perfect for this gang. Gordon is on kid duty for now. There's a soft play area where the boys are currently launching themselves off foam structures and crashing into each other. Thankfully, there are no other children in it! We've had bacon rolls and coffee, and the children have helped themselves to juice and croissants. We'll be here for a few hours yet, but I can think of worse ways to spend the morning.

{"date": "4 Nov 2008", "body": "\nI took the children to a travelling fun fair last night in Belfast. Duncan was especially keen to go, associating Halloween with  Planet Fun,  even more than (as he calls it) \"tricks and treats\". Gordon's been at a conference since Saturday. I asked Duncan if he would write him an email. He typed the 1st sentence and dictated the rest, and this is what he said: Dear Daddy Now Duncan is a cute boy. Daddy was a good man. Duncan is drinking hot chocolate and playing Dogz 4 like a demo. Tonight is Planet Fun from Halloween in Granda's apartment. We're going to look at the Mad Mouse from Halloween. Duncan loves Daddy the best boy in the whole wide world. Gordon was able to receive his emails while sitting in a meeting, and somehow from his response, I think he liked it! I love you Duncan- your letter made me so happy. I hope you have a fantastic time tonight at Planet fun I love you very much Your Daddy That night I loaded the children in the car and we set off into the cold, dark night. We parked at my Dad's place since he lives near the huge, ugly building hosting the fair, and I fueled myself with a bowl of pasta then hit the noise, lights and crowds. I was very concerned about losing Duncan, though even if he had managed to sneak off from sight, I'd have a good idea of where to find him. But it definitely was more stressful for me to be out at night among so many people with no other adult on hand. Lady and Thomas were instructed to keep together and stay near me as I knew Duncan would be liable to dash off to whatever caught his eye with no notice. I even took a photo of him just as we arrived in case I had to give his description to any security staff, paranoid or what? SO for all my fears, we had a good time. Duncan was pleased to watch one of his favourite coasters, the Mad Mouse, and then his siblings rode the Caterpillar Coaster/Wiggly Worm or whatever it's called. He enjoyed watching them from the otherwise deserted back end of the ride, and racing the train as it went. He chose to go on the animal train and since there were few young children around by then, he rode up front and rang the bell ecstatically all the time. It made him so very happy, and that made us all happy. The fella working the ride looked like he'd had a sense of humour bypass though. They went on a few more rides, Duncan again choosing one usually favoured by the under five age group, and Lady and Thomas enjoying something a bit more thrilling. Today I worked for a while on planning an itinerary for Disney World in Florida. We're leaving next week and are psyched about it. I dare say the parks will have a bit more to offer than the particular brand of fun and thrills available last night in Belfast, even if they're are much less easy to access.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SRDNVhdvoAI/AAAAAAAAAeE/XzrR68NOux4/s1600-h/IMG_3634.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SRDNVT7mOWI/AAAAAAAAAd8/Ctnz7GO1-Xo/s1600-h/IMG_3636.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SRDP6yDxYII/AAAAAAAAAeM/DH_WK9y81tQ/s1600-h/IMG_3639.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SRDQLpMoEbI/AAAAAAAAAeU/fVp8ZxKejUc/s1600-h/IMG_3642.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/11/fun-all-over-planet.html", "title": "\nFun all over the planet\n"},
{"date": "15 Oct 2008", "body": "\nI'm one of the moderators at the  Autism Parent's Forum , but it's Bullet who does the work there and who keeps that place going so well with her excellent and courteous advice. But whenever one of the members reports a controversial post, usually by someone trying to sell their dodgy \"treatment\" or being disrespectful to people like our children, I get to hear about it. I was recently alerted to the most pathetic and ridiculous post ever put up on the board  here . Now this is obviously a text book example of trolling; join up, write one incendiary post  then leave forever. I have no interest in trying to reach the poster \"The Reclaimer\" and explain his errors or to help him understand just how insulting he has been. I'm assuming this is a male, I can't imagine a woman writing like this or signing off as \"The Blademaster\" and I shall  address my remarks to Bladey. But I'm still interested in looking at what he wrote, as an extreme example of how some people feel about autism. I think I'd also enjoy pulling this pile of drivel apart: I\u2019m terribly sorry to interrupt everything here but I cannot take this any longer. I sit here day in and day out hearing things about autism so I thought I would add my own interjection for a change. Thank you Bladey for your touching concern, opening your heartfelt remarks with an apology like that shows just how much you obviously care. We are so delighted to hear your \"own interjection.\" Please do continue: I\u2019m getting rather tired of this whole \"classification\" thing that seems to have nestled itself into society. EVERY little thing is being categorised all over. All these disorders that people are coming up with just so they can slap a goddamn label onto something. Back in the day, if a child misbehaves then said child is disciplined and learns to behave. Whereas today, if a child is naughty then there has to be some disorder involved where they can get \"support\" for themselves. Well I for one think this whole charade is completely and utterly FOOLISH. Oh wow Bladey, that must be it, you've hit upon a truth the rest of us have been unable to grasp. Our children don't need to be classified or labelled, they need some proper slaps now and then instead, or some better way to force them to behave! Has anybody for one second stopped and thought about this as an outsider? Not as a parent etc of the \"affected\" child, but as a person who has to sit here everyday and listen to and try to sympathise with this bullshit? Oh yes Bladey, it must be so hard on you choosing to come on to our forum for the parents of autistic children and listen to us talk about autistic children everyday. We must have colonised the internet with this stuff such that you just can't  not  come here. I have a few things here that I would like to get off my chest: 1. For me, as a person studying science and parts of human psychology, I find it hard to believe in something that cannot be fully proved. For example, I have read articles stating that \"your child may be autistic if it has one or more of the following traits\". I\u2019m sorry but \"one or more\" doesn\u2019t really cut it for me. Mainly because of the fact that ALL people are different in their own ways and having such a list that itself is too broad is both foolish and condescending! Lots of people in the world will end up falling, even in the slightest, under one of these categories. I myself just prefer theories with a LOT more evidence to back it up. HA!!! Once again Bladey, it should be obvious, science as you say,  is all about proving things fully . There's no room for any level of uncertainty, ever.  And this way of bunging a label of autism on people for just one or two things, it silly isn't it. That crusty old  DSM IV  manual gets it all wrong with their insistence on  at least 4 different criteria from 3 different categories  being met to get the diagnosis. What do  they  know? They should get you, Bladey to write the next edition. After all, your study of \"science and parts of human psychology\" makes you qualified to bestow your wisdom upon we mere parents, you should share it more widely. 2. I\u2019m getting really tired of listening about how autistic people (mainly children) should get special treatment and stuff. It\u2019s HIGHLY irritating. One of the main flaws i have thought about here would be the lack of Treatment this treatment causes. if you think about this logically, children are highly influential. if you bring a child up to accept this preferential treatment and not to be as accepting the full responsibilities of their actions then this mindset is going to stick with them when they grow up, Hereby cutting out CURING this disorder. Once I figured out what all those words were supposed to mean, I could see that it is oh too true, it's HIGHLY upsetting to see these uppity children get speech therapy and blue badges and special passes at Disneyland. This makes them expect such wonderful things as their right when they haven't done anything to earn them. How greedy! Don't they know we live it a total meritocracy? It's a level playing field for everyone and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Age, race, class, sex, never count against anyone. That's obvious when you look at the evidence in measures of attainment or of  underachievement, like earnings and life expectancy, isn't it...? I know I\u2019m probably either going to get deleted form this site fairly straight away for this post, but I thought it would be nice for m to just get that off my chest. And before anybody tries to say \"you don\u2019t know what its like to live with someone like this\" because believe me I do. I\u2019m speaking here from a point of view that at first thought that autism was a very weak excuse for bad children, and then, soon after as a person speaking from the point of view who has several siblings that have been diagnosed with one type or another of \"autism\". You're just the brave maverick laddie, entering the hornets nest of our forum with all our silliness about working with our children, accepting their varied neurologies, loving them and parenting them to do their best. And how enlightened of you to remind us of that notion of bad children masquerading as disabled. Never miss a chance to out them for what they really are, eh?! Your \"autistic\" siblings must be so proud of you and your efforts to understand them. Also I\u2019d just like to add that support for autistics is DESTROYING society. the planets going rapidly downhill because of mankind\u2019s newfound compassion to help those who cant help themselves. Hell yeah! Now we get to the heart of it. Autistic people are  destroying  the planet! They are causing wars without due cause, they bring earthquakes, famine and hurricane upon us. They are behind the collapse of the banks and the volatility on the stock exchange. Compassion for people like that makes everything go wrong. What more words of wisdom have you got for us Bladey? There is a nice little thing that I know of as Natural Selection or, survival of the fittest. The people who are striving to help the weaker of the species are ultimately dooming us all to a weaker gene pool and an even weaker future. Good day Regards The Blademaster Please forward all hate mail to  Sh1zer@hotmail.com  as i shall enjoy reading it. Ah, natural selection and the problem of weak gene pools. Are you a fan of  HG Wells  and his non-fiction output? Those early 20th century eugenicists thought like you, but then Hitler went and lost the war. Have a look at what this crazy man has to say about these matters: ...there are two reasons why we need to take Darwinian natural selection seriously. Firstly, it is the most important element in the explanation for our own existence and that of all life. Secondly, natural selection is a good object lesson in how NOT to organize a society. As I have often said before, as a scientist I am a passionate Darwinian. But as a citizen and a human being, I want to construct a society which is about as un-Darwinian as we can make it. I approve of looking after the poor (very un-Darwinian). I approve of universal medical care (very un-Darwinian). It is one of the classic philosophical fallacies to derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. In case you're interested to know who this man is, who doesn't know what you Bladey have expressed so eloquently about the dangers of letting lesser people pollute the gene pool, the above quote is from a  piece by Richard Dawkins . He has also written about how some people mix up Darwin's work on evolution as an explanation for life with eugenics as a blue-print for society in his book, A Devil's Chaplain. ( Here's a preview .) I mean, what would Dawkins know about evolution? Actually, \"The Blademaster\" just in case you missed it, I was being as sarcastic as possible for all of the above. I think your ideas are worthless, and you are clearly a fool to spout such effluent. So catch yourself on, buzz off and do a bit of growing up before you come bothering us again.

{"date": "22 Sep 2008", "body": "\nI decided to check out the prices of a(nother) family trip to Disneyland Paris this autumn/winter. It was do-able, so I set to convincing Gordon of the benefits of a few more days of rodent-based corporate jollity, emphasising lower prices and crowd levels and claiming that we're tough enough to withstand the cold and inevitable rain when suitably attired. Gordon agreed that it would be great to go away, but he craves sunshine and suggested we look into getting our fill of Disney somewhere rather hotter and drier than Paris in November. So we checked out the possibility of going all the way to the USA. We have also collected a whole heap of supermarket/credit card vouchers than can be used to offset the cost when booking via Virgin Holidays, so we pondered and looked at the climate data for that part of the world and made our decision. All five of us are heading to Orlando this November. I ordered the vouchers and checked out all the board options, opting to rent an apartment near Disney World, so we have enough space and flexibility to meet our family's needs. Waiting for the vouchers, I was concerned to see some prices rise as tourists let down by the collapse of travel company XL, rushed to rebook. Thankfully there were a few seats left on our preferred travel dates and at the original price, so it's all booked now. I just realised I need a new passport if I'm to get into the US under its visa waiver programme, but the rest of the family are OK. As well as all that official stuff, we've been investigating the various attractions of the area and trying to figure out some sort of an itinerary, knowing well that plenty of REST must feature prominently. There'll be much more planning over the coming weeks. This is the kind of project the kids and I enjoy best, home-education of the finest variety. I feel a bit anxious. This will involve a lot of travelling, changing aeroplanes in London, lining for security checks and checking in as well as a flight time of over 9 hours. I've already spoken to a travel advisor at Virgin Atlantic, and she explained some of the very helpful accommodations the airline make for their autistic customers.

{"date": "7 Sep 2008", "body": "\nEvery so often, real life intervenes and blogging is the last thing I feel like doing. My head is too full of thoughts that are beyond the boundaries of what I share here. Also, I find it easier at times, to write when I have something to complain about. I suppose it's easier to declaim than to extol. I know I write positively about my children and make a point of focusing on the positives of raising a disabled child. As well as being my reality, I think it's important to redress the all too common narrative of \"devastation.\" I'm pleased that even now when I'm almost full of worry, my post about Good Stuff had 9 more entries than my list of Not Good Stuff. But here's another example of that narrative. Published in Saturday's Daily Telegraph is a story called  Autism: A different life  featuring the people behind a magazine pushing the unproven biomedical theory of autism and stuffed full of advertisements and articles on supplements, extra enzymes, detoxification and a host of other dodgy quackery. I was introduced to Polly Tommey by my health visitor when Duncan was diagnosed with autism six years ago. I met her and spent a long afternoon listening to her theories and her detailed regime to rid her son of his autism. Back then I was impressed at her zeal and ostensible knowledge of autism's causes and treatments. Her son had had intensive ABA teaching. He had a host of supplements daily. He was fed only organic food and water from glass bottles, lest any pesky toxins intrude. She talked about his numerous infections and how she believed the many courses of antibiotics he'd taken as a baby, together with vaccinations, were connected to his autism. She asked if Duncan had taken antibiotics and yes, he'd had two courses. She asked if he looked frail and had dark rings below his eyes. Yes, he looked frail as he ate very little and was well below the average weight for a child his age. I remember that I also said that he did have dark rings, even though I hadn't noticed such a trait, because I was caught up in her pitch and wanted to think that she knew how to help me help him. She warned me against joining the local NAS group where they refused to believe in cures and whose acceptance she interpreted as negativity. She  was  a very kind lady. She welcomed me into her home and really did want to share what she knew in an effort to help. She presented me with a glut of her magazines which I read religiously for the next week or so. I tried to get Gordon to take an interest in it all. I showed him the article by the nutropath, advocating various vitamins and minerals. I showed him the articles about the labs which tested autistic children's hair, blood and stools and found all sorts of non standard levels. He scoffed at the lot of it. He just knew too   much about microbiology, statistics, pharmacology etc. to be taken in by any of it. He pointed out a pile of what were (to him) ridiculous assertions contained in the magazines, and since he really knows his stuff, I dumped the lot of them. I considered it safer than taking the risk of passing them on to another unsuspecting parent, one without the benefit of an in-house quack-buster. But times have changed since then. What could be attributable to ignorance back in 2002, is less excusable today. The science has moved on. Numerous studies have failed to find a link between vaccination and autism, while as many have found more evidence for the genetic basis of the condition. Those who cling to environmental explanations in the face of the evidence are coming from a faith based position. The Telegraph article describes the efforts Polly and her husband Jonathon made to treat their son Billy: Jonathan's response was to do everything he could to improve his son's health by testing and treating the biomedical disorders that contributed to his condition. He put him on a gluten- and casein-free diet, treated various funguses, viruses and bacteria in his leaking gut, and gave him zinc supplements to increase his appetite. None of these therapies have any basis in evidence. Her son now sounds much like Duncan who has not had any behavioural or biomedical therapy. Young Billy was also the first child in the UK to be given secretin, ye olde wonder treatmente. It was a nineties thing and was later studied properly and found to  have no effect . But the Tommey parents are unfazed: Nine years on, Jonathan Tommey has completed training as a     clinical nutritionist and, last year, he set up the Autism Clinic     where he has tested and treated 500 children. Some of them have done     so well that he now calls regressive autism - autism that is not     evident at birth but begins during childhood - 'a biomedical     disorder with a psychological diagnosis'. 'Some     children,' he says, 'have improved so much that you could     call them recovered.' Well you could call them recovered, or you could call them  older , more  developed.  Or has Mr Tommey, like Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, really discovered a new condition? The Tommey's magazine is popular and is about to go on sale in Sainsbury's and Tesco. It's also said to sell well in the USA, no surprises there. The article continues: 'It's important to be international,' Polly says.     'It's only by putting our heads together that we will find     answers to the questions I want answered.' These include: why     are so many children becoming autistic? Why are parents having such     a struggle? Where will all these children go? And why are parents     committing suicide with their children? Apart from that last, it's a set of reasonable queries. But by \"parents     committing suicide with their children\" do they mean parents who  murder  their children and kill themselves? The \"apparent\" growth in autism is discussed, with increasing awareness and diagnostic substitution mentioned as possible explanations, but the Tommey's have their own ideas: ...the Tommeys     believe there are more than ever before; the survival of premature     babies and an increase in births to older mothers may be partly     responsible. Environmental factors may also explain the rise. These might     include vaccines (including MMR, as suggested by the     gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield), pollution, antibiotics and     other challenges to immature immune systems. 'Whatever the     cause,' Polly says, 'with all these children growing into     adulthood, we are sitting on a timebomb.' Ooh, a timebomb! Look out world. Forget about climate change, global poverty, war and fuel shortages, worry about scary autistic children growing up. Battling with local authorities for schools and respite care is     wearing for parents with autistic children, but fearing for the     future is worse. The day will come, they know, when they will no     longer have even a quiet few hours while their child is at school.     And what will happen when they die? 'People with autism have a     normal life expectancy,' Polly says, 'though a fair few     die young in accidents: they run across roads, unaware of danger. I too worry about my son's future but see the best way of supporting him as putting pressure on those in power to change work places to make them more autistic friendly and to arrange workable living support systems. I do not think it's worth mentioning that autistic people have normal life expectancy. If we parents of autistic children all focused our energies on enabling them to live as independently  as possible  as adults, and ensuring they have a good early education together with opportunities for life-long learning, then our time would be well spent. It has got to beat harping on about the MMR, secretin, chelation and dodgy American mail order labs. I also think the needs of our children and all autistic people can be met without resorting to using the terrible cases of Ryan Davies and James Wardle as examples of what happens without support. Ryan Davies was murdered and though what exactly happened to James has not been made known yet, it's likely that he died unlawfully too. These deaths can't be excused by saying that their parents were driven to despair. Some parents find the prospect of a lifetime of such misery so     unbearable that they take their own and their children's lives.     Two years ago Alison Davies took the heartbreaking step of jumping     off the Humber bridge holding her 12-year-old son Ryan, and the     discovery this April of the bodies of Heather Wardle and her     22-year-old autistic son James once again drew attention to their     plight. But there remains no systematic planning for the estimated     135,000 children with autism in this country, three quarters of whom     are boys. Polly talks about her own son: 'But I don't want Billy hidden away and     institutionalised. It's such a waste. I want him to feel useful     - and to be able to give something back to society. Often children     who appear very severely impaired, and are completely non-verbal,     have wonderful abilities that shouldn't be wasted. I know one     little girl who is brilliant at weaving, another who does wonderful     graphics. Some are good at circus skills because they have no fear;     others are very good at maths. They would all be much happier if     they could be productive.' People have innate worth, even when they don't seem to have any useful skills, but it's very important to help people enjoy life and develop their skills and interests. The article ends by describing the Tommey's latest venture, the  Autism Trust , a multi-million pound project to build a village for 50 autistic residents. They foresee the local authorities paying \u00a380,000 per year to care for each resident. On looking through its website, I don't think it demonstrates the best use of resources. There's the Wellness Centre \"where in\u2013house experts including nutritionists and therapists will practise alongside behavioural, educational and developmental experts\" and \"vocational opportunities...ranging from organic and eco-friendly agricultural and horticultural work through to technology and design enabled work stations within the office and administration area.\" We'll find another way thanks.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/09/06/sm_autism106.xml&page=3", "http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/aut_sec.cfm", "http://theautismtrust.org.uk/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/autism-its-just-life.html", "title": "\nAutism: It's just life\n"},
{"date": "10 Oct 2008", "body": "\nAt least  Nick  thinks so, as he's passed on both of these award/link building things to me, and for which I am most grateful. I've only been reading his blog for a month or so, but it's a fine thing, with stories and photos of his  adorable son Jacob , as well as observations on life and what  makes it worth living . He even knows that Raising Arizona is the best Coen brothers' film, most people get that one wrong. So now I have to name some kick-ass, lovable blogs (I'm combining the categories): First, I pick Michelle Dawson, who blogs at  The Autism Crisis , and keeps her  minions  in the loop at the  TMoB board  (the longest comment thread ever). Michelle is an autism researcher who works hard to address the glaring lack of evidence for most of the assumptions commonly spoken of as truths, about autistic learning and abilities. She just hit the  headlines in Canada  for her  terrific win at a Human Rights Tribunal  against her former employers, Canada Post, who discriminated against her in shocking ways when they discovered she is autistic. She represented herself throughout the arduous legal proceedings, and her win helps all Canadian autistic people, as well as everyone working for fair workplaces. She took this action solely because it was the right thing to do and didn't claim any compensation. Next up is Kev Leitch who blogs with a team at  Left Brain/Right Brain  and who has recently been part of the  Science Blogs book club  discussion of the fantastic book by Paul Offit (I'm half way through it)  Autism's False Prophets . Kev's been leading the fight back against the rise of dangerous quackery in autism discussions for years now, as well as promoting the importance of real rights, acceptance and ways to make things better. Another blog I've come to more recently and love, is  Grannymar , by, um, Grannymar. I had the pleasure of meeting the woman herself in Belfast last month, and even though she's an Irish blog celebrity, she was warm and welcoming. I was about to look through her blog for an example of what there is to love about her. It wasn't a hard task, the very first post is a  touching account of her marriage  with some great advice to everyone in a relationship. I dare say the woman will kick an arse in need of it too! Another fine Irish woman blogger is  Maman Poulet , whose ass-kicking of charlatans and crooks and exposure of their lies, is a joy to behold. She recently had a scoop about Sarah Palin's  foreign travel claims , hee hee! The last person I'm going to single out, is  Kathleen Seidel , the blogging librarian who is so terrifying to grubby money grabbing, vaccine-claim lawyer Clifford  Shoemaker, that he served her with an unjust, invasive and extensive subpoena in a craven attempt to intimidate her and stop her exposure of what  he has been engaged in . He claimed that she, as the \u201cmere mother of an autistic child and housewife,\u201d was too well informed. He lost, the subpoena was  quashed , and the judge set sanctions on Shoemaker, telling the fool man, \"clearly he is unfamiliar with the extent of the information which a highly-competent librarian like Ms. Seidel can, and did, accumulate.\" Kathleen continues to kick the asses of dangerous quacks. So there you are. I hope they are all pleased with the accolade.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://downsdad.wordpress.com/", "http://downsdad.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/more-special-than-you/", "http://downsdad.wordpress.com/2008/08/17/tree-of-happiness/", "http://www.mammadawg.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SO9FEbvOBjI/AAAAAAAAAXs/dVhrtme3k5g/s1600-h/heartblog.jpg", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7/p8409.8409", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7", "http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=785008e8-f501-4605-a3da-3bb960b602e7", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2008/10/another-autistic-victory.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/", "http://scienceblogs.com/bookclub/", "http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14636-4/autisms-false-prophets", "http://www.grannymar.com/blog", "http://www.grannymar.com/blog/2008/10/10/darren-asked/", "http://www.mamanpoulet.com/", "http://www.mamanpoulet.com/?p=437", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/165/", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/152/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/my-lovable-kick-ass-blog.html", "title": "\nMy Lovable, Kick Ass Blog\n"},
{"date": "7 Sep 2008", "body": "\nYesterday, I had the chance to go off for a few hours to  Creative Camp  in Belfast, an event billed as bringing together \"technology and creative enthusiasts who want to make things happen with web, mobile, open source, new media, music and design.\" I was unsure whether to attend, not knowing if my web endeavours really fit that description. But I decided that with this blog, I aim to make things happen, specifically by challenging assumptions, in a very small way for a few people. But mainly, I felt it would be good to get out and hopefully meet a few folk whose online identities I could fit to a real world face. I enjoyed the talks I heard, and the atmosphere of untapped possibilities. One man discussed soluble dresses. Strange topic that! He was an artist involved in a project hoping to highlight the problems of our throw away culture. It's very worthy, but he showed a film of dissolving dresses making pretty colours in (now toxin laden) water tanks and it dragged on for rather too long. He made me laugh when he said that working on the project had alerted him to the dangers of plastics, and we shouldn't give babies milk in plastic bottles as it can harm them some way, by \"damaging their DNA or something.\" I shouldn't scoff, but hey ho. For another talk, a man described with near evangelical glee, a system of project organisation called Getting Things Done. And yes, it does require capitalisation. I could do with following some of his tips. I came in half way through a talk on creativity in the work place. As some people mentioned the importance of team work, socialising as a way of getting to know your colleagues and getting the proper balance of control and flexibility, I thought about those workers who have lots to offer employers but who prefer not to socialise down the pub or who can work with a team but like to do their part in a project alone and communicate via email. Basically, I thought about autistic and disabled workers and how they can be accommodated. I never spoke up though, I'd come in late and was a bit too shy. Perhaps at another one of these I'll think it through properly, get some advise and give a talk. The event was well organised, and it was great to meet people from the local region involved in all sorts of clever and creative activities. I enjoyed chatting with  Grannymar  and  Alan , both of whose blogs I read regularly. I met  Phil , another regular read and  Damien , blogging maestro and the guy who runs the Irish Blog Awards and the new Irish Web Awards. The whole thing, including a decent lunch, was free. When I explained to one of the organisers, a woman called Mairin, that I was \"just\" a blogger, she demonstrated the spirit of Creative Camp by deciding to have a panel discussion about blogging with Grannymar and myself, whom I suspect were the only people there not to be in paid employment. It was cool. I mentioned why I started to blog and what I get out of it, and enjoyed hearing others discuss their own views. One guy was a bit waffly and too keen to share, but there's always one of those. I left after that as Gordon's mum was minding the children for part of the day. I missed the first train home so dandered around a book shop for a while, picking up a book I've been meaning to buy for a while now.  Borderlands  is a detective novel set in my home town and surrounding areas. I started to read in the shop and almost missed the train again. Sometimes it's nice to be reminded that I have a life beyond these walls.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://creativecampbelfast.com/", "http://www.grannymar.com/blog/", "http://alaninbelfast.blogspot.com/", "http://words.iced-coffee.com/", "http://www.mulley.net/", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Borderlands-Inspector-Devlin-Mystery-1/dp/033045255X"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/creative-camp-belfast.html", "title": "\nCreative Camp Belfast\n"},

{"date": "27 Aug 2008", "body": "\nIn contrast to all the nice things mentioned in  the previous post , here are some things that have been pissing me off recently: Reading opinion on the Tropic Thunder thing. It's clear that many of the people who have some understanding of the evils of racism, sexism and homophobia are much less concerned with the problems of disablism. The stories from the USA about increasing outbreaks of measles and the pathetic responses of those who oppose vaccination. The terrible comments seen now and then on pro-science sites attempting to understand the irrational attitude of those parents who blame vaccination for their children's autism, but which end up being disgustingly disablist instead, comments  like this , comparing the dangers of infectious diseases to autism: \"To her, it probably is. Most victims of childhood diseases like measles and chickenpox either die or recover completely. Those that die ... well, their pain is over, and (in most cases) those left behind will eventually adjust to their loss. Even the diseases that can cripple or disfigure don't affect the person's ability to lead a more-or-less normal life. Hell, a polio victim once became President of the United States! But the more severe forms of autism (or any other brain-damage condition) destroy the victim's life without - quite - taking it away completely. It's said that the worst experience a parent can endure is having to bury their child. I'm not so sure of that. It's entirely possible that having a mentally-disabled child is worse, because it never ends and there's never a chance to adjust to it or recover from it. The wound is reopened every single time the parent looks at what is and thinks about what might have been. I'll tell such people that they're mistaken, but I try to never belittle the anguish they must feel.\" I had to  write something  about that: \"Dawn2  (an anti-vaccine stupidity promoter ) made a comment that makes no sense and makes her sound rather unhinged, but wolfwalker's comment might be the most callous, disablist and bigoted one I've ever read here. Do you really think that parents dealing with the death of their child, suffer  less  than those dealing with a disabled child?! And who gets to define what constitutes a \"more or less normal life\"? My autistic son may not have the same ambitions or abilities as his non-disabled peers and siblings, but I can guarantee you, that I am happy to have him alive and will support him as well as I can. He would  not  be better dead than disabled. Oh dear, I'm shocked, you actually wrote that having  a son like mine  might be worse than having a dead child! Think again wolfwalker. Parents who think like that have sometimes gone on to  kill their children . People who think like that are just plain wrong, always.\" S/he (wolfwalker) responded to my comment  with ; \"Sharon, I intended no offense and I apologize if any was taken. I certainly don't wish death on any innocent, whether they're autistic or not. Being single and childless (both by choice), I literally do not know which would be worse, having a severely autistic child or losing a child entirely. All I know for sure is, I never want to experience either one and I have a great deal of respect for those who have been through either experience and survived it with their sanity intact.    Please note that in the comment that got you so angry, I said a  severely  autistic child. I read your linked post, and I will tell you flatly that your son's condition is not what I had in mind when I wrote that.\" Wow, talk about missing the point. Aside from the fact that Duncan's diagnosis  is  \"severe\" autism, there is no way of being alive and autistic that is less preferable to being dead. S/he claims to have respect for people who have experienced such things but fails to understand that society's horrible attitudes about the value of our children's lives add greatly to our stress load.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/antivaccinationists_on_the_measles_outbr.php#comment-1063522", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/antivaccinationists_on_the_measles_outbr.php#comment-1064999", "http://thiswayoflife.org/murder.html%20rel=", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/antivaccinationists_on_the_measles_outbr.php#comment-1065781"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/08/not-good-stuff.html", "title": "\nNot Good Stuff\n"},

The  problem  is the way in which this ad contributes to the mass of misinformation and prejudiced, negative rhetoric about autism in the media and wider society.

{"date": "4 Jun 2008", "body": "\nWe had a new carpet fitted on the stairs. The old one, sort of sand coloured, was  irreparably stained with poster paint, oxtail soup, hot chocolate, yogurt and who knows what else. There was a fair bit of banging and bashing during the fitting process. Duncan renamed his \"rocket\" cupboard under the stairs the \"safe place\" and spend most of the time in there, popping out every so often to monitor progress. He has enjoyed riding his fancy, new bike outside our house. As I was watching him yesterday, he tumbled over while he was turning. He had been just walking and pushing the bike so he didn't hurt himself, but I helped him get the bike straight again, and he said, \"It was embarrassing.\" Then as he pushed off again, he called out, \"OK, lets's go again!\" Wow, when did he learn about embarrassment! I noted before that he has been repeating what we say. I only just realised that it's what is referred to in the autism books as  echolalia . When I first read about it as one of the common traits of autism, my thoughts were \"if  only  my child would say  anything !\" Duncan was then what is described as non-verbal. Today I looked at some  NAS information  on echolalia: Echolalia (\"parroting\") This is when a child repeats what they have heard rather than giving an appropriate response to what has been said to them. For example:    Mother: \"Hello Tommy\" Tommy: \"Hello Tommy\"   When a child is using echolalia they are copying speech alone and showing no understanding of what has been said to them. Therefore it is most likely that the echolalia is not being used to show communicative intent. I don't think this is the case with Duncan. When he repeats what we say, I think he  is  engaging, and communicating that he is part of the conversation. He is also, I think, trying to improve his vocabulary and pronunciation. He is also now commonly reversing his pronouns, like asking me to \"put your shoes on\" when he needs help with  his  trainers. Again, I'm delighted that he has progressed to being able to communicate so well and am confident that he, like his siblings, will eventually figure out this difficult aspect of grammar. One thing he does communicate frequently these days, in perfect English, and to my delight, is an emotion I had been told he would never be able to express without x,y or z expensive therapy. Every day, many times, he is unknowingly  breaking down stereotypes  when he tells me \"I love you Mummy.\" I don't think I'm breaking any stereotypes, but I always answer with a huge grin, \"I love you too Duncan.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=3771&d=1070", "http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=321"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/06/words-and-meaning.html", "title": "\nWords and meaning\n"},

We never found the blue one, only a couple of his siblings/colleagues. But a few weeks ago, Duncan showed me an Ebay listing for the much sought after blue alien toy. Can you imagine that there are people out there selling the junk toys found inside Kinder eggs? But then, mugs like me come along and buy them. Yes, I forked out good money for this thing, and was glad I did as it made my boy so very happy. Since then, it's been renamed. The blue alien is now known as Oliver Companies, and his mates are Roger and Siver. They get up to all sorts of japes, some of which involve Thomas the Tank engines, Super Mario and his brother, as well as rascal eighties kids TV star, Tiny from Tots TV.

{"date": "31 May 2008", "body": "\nGordon left on Thursday to attend a massive conference in Chicago, and won't be back until Wednesday. Before he went, we all went out on a bike ride. He and I cleaned up our bikes and pumped the tyres, dusted the cobwebs off our cycle helmets, and joined the 3 children on their shiny new bikes. Lady's pal from next door came with us. We headed off through the forest park and along the shore front. It was magical, beautiful and I got such a thrill that we were able to do such a thing together. OK, so I was more tense and there was a bit more calling out instructions that there might be for ordinary families (whatever they are!). \"Pull the brakes a bit, slow down, keep pedaling, stay near me...\" etc. We had an unscheduled stop as our middle child hopped off to run along the beach for a bit, then we were off again. We dropped Gordon to the airport then when the children were getting ready for bed, Lady came to tell me that there was a mouse or something in the upstairs cupboard, a really loud one! I went to investigate and discovered a bird had somehow made its way inside. I closed all but one of the bedroom doors, opened the front and back doors and let it out. It flew into the bedroom and after about 20mins fluttering around in a distressed manner, it eventually flew out the wide open window. (The bits of fruit and crumbs I'd placed on the window sill made no difference!) What is going on here?! The last time Gordon was away for a conference, there was a mouse in my wardrobe. I feel like Snow White (albeit older and uglier) with all the ickle creatures around me. Unfortunately, these ones were useless at housework. Yesterday Duncan built a rocket in the under-stairs cupboard. (He was the only cute creature in that one.) He stuck their Doctor Who posters on the walls, and brought down a selection of toys, and their space-themed duvet. He arranged a key board and Gordon's synthesiser on the shelf to be the control panel, told us he was the pilot, and invited us all inside the rocket. He'd also made a clay model of a scary spider monster with 5 eyes. I didn't recognise it but Lady knew at once, it was a  Racnoss , the big spider-alien from Doctor Who. Later I cooked a M&S pie for our dinner. Duncan got to it before me after the timer went, and unfortunately he dropped it on the floor, much of the pie splattering out of the tin. I was not best pleased and he was very apologetic. Later, I discovered that he had made a real mess in his bedroom, and had written on the wall inside the cupboard and I told him off. He was upset and ran to Lady to be comforted. A few minutes later Lady brought me a card he had made. It said, \"Momy soory Duncan Noddy\" and was decorated with 5 hearts and a picture of me. I went to find him and he said, \"Mummy not be angry with Duncan.\" Oh boy, did I feel bad. We cuddled and made up and I let him know how much I love him. As he now says, \"Mummy loves Duncan the best.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mikescomics.com/images/UT0029_empress_racnoss_small.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-disney-life.html", "title": "\nMy Disney Life\n"},
{"date": "5 Jun 2008", "body": "\n The amount of trash that is written about autism just never fails to astonish me. Can people really still be filling column inches in the Telegraph a supposedly serious newspaper, with junk articles like  MMR: The debate that won't go away ? Thankfully, the bloggers are on to them, as Dr Aust tears  this one apart . My old pal, Phil Doherty, whose breathtakingly credulous article on the MMR/autism supposed connection I wrote about  here  and  here , has been at it again. I know he writes for a small, irrelevant and parochial publication, but I feel, given our correspondence, that we have a special sort of bond, much as a terrier has to the rat. Recently  Doherty repeated the bogus claim  that: Research has shown that up to 38 per cent of autistic kids have a DNA defect which can be triggered by jabs, compared with 0.2pc in the general population. No it ain't. In the same article he reported on Bernadine Healy's journey to the dark side, and the preposterous autistic monkey study carried out by an associate of Andy \"Maverick\" Wakefield. Doherty followed this up with a glowing story on ex-travel writer David Kirby's trip to London to promote his book and his ever changing theories of autism causation. He said it was an honour to be asked to speak to Parliament on the controversial health topic. Titter! A fringe meeting in a back room with a  vaccine obsessed peer  and a selection of woo-tastic MPs and their mates, isn't exactly \"speaking to parliament\"! I wish I could be there when Kirby is doing book signs tomorrow in Kensington - pesky sea getting in the way. I'd want to know when he'll be writing a new, updated edition without all those old, discarded notions, I'd ask, \"remember how in the old days you used to say all autism is mercury poisoning and caused by vaccines but these days, you're  blaming mercury, general toxic nasties and other pollution in the atmosphere and food? You've taken up the mitochondria disorder cause and now you are promoting that link and your own numbers suggest,  only 1% of autism could possibly be vaccine-associated .\" (Even though there is no evidence of harm for that proportion of children either, but that's another story.) Actually, I'd much rather go to the swimming pool with my children, so perhaps I can be glad of that watery barrier. Away over a much bigger puddle, I also missed out on what was billed as a thrilling day out in the company of celebrities like Jim Carey and Jenny McCarthy. (Who she? Oh, some American who wouldn't be out of place on Celebrity Big Brother and who has gone into the autism anecdote business in a big way.) They had a rally in Washington DC yesterday to supposedly, \"give everyone who loves a child with Autism a day for their voices to be heard.\" No they did not. I love a child with autism, many people I know love children with autism, and none of us concur with Jim'n'Jenny and their marching mercury moms. They were calling it \"Green our Vaccines.\" What is that even supposed to mean?! TACA , a totally barmy group are involved and say, Jenny and Jim are working hard to eliminate all toxins from our children's vaccines and have our national health agencies reassess the mandatory vaccine schedule, as our children are receiving  TOO MANY, TOO SOON . While Jenny and Jim support the vaccine program, like many, they feel vaccines are too toxic. Oh goody, Jim'n'Jenny are onto it! With all their training and expertise in medicine and immunology, we'll be sure to have all the answers any day soon. Pull up a bench Jim, and dust down your white coat Jenny, lab work has its rewards, but it'll be a big change from what you're used to. I'm not too sure just what toxins you'll be able to eliminate from the vaccines without rendering them totally ineffective in their designed purpose at providing immunisation against infectious disease. But hey, I trust you guys, after all you're famous (well, Jim is, Jenny, not so much.) Perhaps they mean well, but they are just  wrong  here. They are wrong about autism and wrong about science. I feel it is important to make it explicit that many people who have autistic children,  do not  buy into their nonsense. I will trust those in the know. My children's father is a doctor and scientist. Like you Jenny, he has looked at the evidence and made a decision based on his findings, but he and I have come to the opposite conclusion about what is best for our children. Why do you think that is?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SEfHwhB4ArI/AAAAAAAAAOM/Dn5vGiPIjDE/s1600-h/bin.png", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2008/05/26/hautism126.xml", "http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/who-needs-facts-these-vaccine-conspiracy-pieces-write-themselves%e2%80%a6/#comment-429", "http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/news/north-east-news/2008/05/18/research-into-mmr-and-autism-wanted-by-us-official-79310-20926734/", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2008/05/28/hodgson/", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/vaccines_and_autism_the_incredible_shrin.php", "http://talkaboutcuringautism.org/jenny/dc-rally/images/green-our-vaccines-logo.gif", "http://talkaboutcuringautism.org/jenny/dc-rally/green-our-vaccines-rally.htm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/06/too-green-to-know-better.html", "title": "\nToo Green to Know Better\n"},
{"date": "13 Jun 2008", "body": "\n Duncan just turned 8. He chose to go to the toy shop to pick his present (another train!). He prefers to get exactly what he wants rather than a possibly unwanted surprise. We each bought an ice-cream and then he was happy to sit looking at the Mad Mouse roller coaster which has been erected in town with the rest of the summer fun fair, but not yet opened. The fellas building it must be getting used to my lot hanging around. Duncan noticed the construction on the very first day as we drove past and we had to go and watch them work for while, even though it was raining! Last year Duncan objected to people saying he was 7. He prefers to think of himself as number 6, because he is the Percy train in his family engine allocation. Yes, I got in wrong on my blog! This year I explained how Lady is number 2 like James (her engine) but she is 9 years old, Thomas is number 1 like Thomas (yeah, I got one right) but he is 6 years old. So Duncan can be number 6 like Percy the engine, but he is 8 years old. He thought that was acceptable. Back at home, we asked all the children who happened to be around the street, most of whom have somehow materialised in the past few sunny weeks to join Lady and Thomas as they scoot about on their bicycles, to come join us for some of Duncan's chocolate birthday cake. He blew out the '8' birthday candle, and everyone just  said  happy birthday! Earlier I'd asked him if he wanted us to sing the birthday song or just say the words and he'd made his choice, which I passed on to the children. He enjoyed his fairly low key celebration and giggled every time I made a fuss of him for being the birthday boy. I just want to record his latest achievement, he and his dad cycled to town to see the roller coaster at the weekend, a distance of about 5 km each way. Since then he has gone on a few evening bike rides with us down to the beach and back. He's made massive progress in his bike handling in such a short time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SFIlfLx1gZI/AAAAAAAAAOc/L13urvfhdig/s1600-h/IMG_3181b.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SFIlfdQot1I/AAAAAAAAAOk/rWsyCmfdM3Q/s1600-h/IMG_3182b.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SFImGeI9UYI/AAAAAAAAAOs/qGyRUS672SE/s1600-h/IMG_3183.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/06/duncans-birthday.html", "title": "\nDuncan's birthday\n"},

The first time I over cooked and blackened it but since then we've got the hang of it and now Duncan can make and bake his sculptures (with supervision). All these he made from memory. This is one of the first things he made. It's  Po from the Teletubbies . Of course, observant people will have known that just by looking at the little telly in the tummy. Then he made a model of the train from the Disneyland Paris's  Big Thunder Mountain train . He made  Casey Jr , the train from Dumbo. The next item, he told me, is a \"mometer, like in Madagascar.\" I thought it was some sort of snake from the film, so asked for further clarification. \"It's a mometer, for medicine. Like Melman in Madagascar.\" Oh, it's a  ther -mometer. He has since learnt the correct pronunciation of the word, having practised it many times. But my favourite, is the  EasyJet aeroplane . He has the wings, engines, tail and even the writing on the side; esy jet! We've been enjoying the warmer weather and spending much more time outdoors. Lady took the camera out and snapped her brothers playing. I love the picture of Duncan, in which you see Lady's reflection in the window and the weird looking shot of Thomas looking like an alien, with Lady reflected in his eyes! Further news on the dog question; our local animal sanctuary, where we got our 2 guinea pigs, have decided  not  to let us adopt one of their dogs because we home educate and have not had dogs before. They don't see how I could find the time to look after a dog when I am so involved with my children. It's ridiculous. There are all these dogs who are put to sleep all over Ireland daily, and they could ensure at least one gets a chance at a home but irrational prejudice prevents it. I explained to them that HE usually takes no more time than parenting a school child, who needs to be dropped off and lifted from school as well as packed lunches prepared, uniforms readied, supervision of homework, attendance at school meetings, and often helping out in the classroom or on school trips. Thankfully, another rescue organisation has approved our application so I hope we'll find a good canine match through them. Other family news; Thomas and Lady have new bikes, and Duncan will get his at the weekend. Neither Thomas nor Duncan had ever ridden a proper two wheel bike before. They have been bombing about on a cheap little trainer bike that has two wheels but no pedals, just getting the hang of balancing and steering it. It wasn't much of a surprise when they both mastered riding the proper bike within 3 minutes! So I took them to the park yesterday to have a good long ride each and to learn how to use the brakes properly.

{"date": "6 May 2008", "body": "\nSo we went to Disneyland Paris for a couple of days last week. We left on Monday evening. Duncan was rather worried about flying. Shortly before we left he explained his fears; \"aeroplane not go upside-down, aeroplane not go side to side!\" I was able to confirm that indeed, we would not be doing any stunts during the flight. While passing through airport security, Duncan dashed over to one of the security staff and lifted up his identity badge to peer at something. I rushed to intervene and explain; you don't mess with airport security these days. It transpired that the man had a tiny Noddy zip-pull figure clipped on behind the ID tag around his neck. I explained Duncan's autism and love of all things Noddy. The man was very understanding and explained he'd been given the Noddy for contributing to a cancer research charity. A minute later, as I was gathering up my bags and putting my boots back on, he came over and handed the Noddy to Duncan. How kind was that! Duncan was delighted. Even better (for him) in the airport shop where he spent much time as we waited to board, he spotted yet another Noddy toy. I bought it for him, so for the next 3 days, he went everywhere with Big Noddy, little Noddy and his Big Ears toys. Gordon's mum E. was with us on the holiday. She sat beside Thomas and Lady on the plane while Gordon and I stayed with Duncan. He was still a bit nervous, but excited. He kept pulling my arm around him as tight as he could and burying his head in my shoulder. He was repeating his worries about the flight, and his wish that the plane not go too fast, and I explained many times that we would be safe, we'd not got too fast, the person flying the plane is called a pilot and is very good and safe and clever. As we took off he shrieked a bit in excitement, but was happy. He was a bit bothered when his ears started to hurt but followed my instructions to yawn or have a drink. All in, the flight and airport parts passed as well as hoped. We landed in Paris a bit early and since we had no hold bags, were through passport control and in the terminal  very quickly. I had booked a taxi to take us directly to Disneyland, the same service I'd used last year. While then, the driver had been waiting for us with my name on a card, this year we had to wait for almost 30 minutes for him to arrive. I was not happy. Then on the way, he pulled into a petrol station. I thought he was a bit disorganised to need fuel while on route with customers, but instead he left us on the minibus for 10 minutes while he went into the bloody shop! Disgusted and knackered was I. His tip prospects were well and truly vamooshed. Eventually, at about 10.30 French time, we reached the hotel and after a rather lengthy check in procedure, we went to our rooms. These were in a great location, on the ground floor, close to the reception and restaurant. We had 2 connecting rooms, and soon the children and E. were in bed, with the ajoining doors open, while Gordon and I headed to the bar for a cocktail and a few crappy snacks. (Thus, the standard of food for the duration was set.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/disneyland-day-1.html", "title": "\nDisneyland Day 1\n"},

So he was in among the  elite  in a crowd of about 300. He didn't get the award, not that he was much fussed. But we enjoyed the night out, more so since we're tight and it was free. The awards part wasn't too painful, only those introducing the categories gave a speech and these were succinct and informative, well apart from the woman who droned on about pain and the other who blethered about the danger of BMIs higher than 29, to an audience where at least half fit the bill. I mean, they're important topics but make your point and get off the stage. Anyway, I was totally proud of Gordon for this local recognition after moving here only 3 years ago and starting his research efforts from scratch. Somehow I think the Irish Bloggers bash will be a bit less stuffy and a bit more fun.

{"date": "27 Feb 2008", "body": "\nWho'd have guessed, a (mostly) accurate, informative  article about autism  in the media! The article in  Wired , features  Amanda Baggs  and  Michelle Dawson , so I shouldn't be too surprised; they're both incredible, knowledgeable and smart women who have done much to challenge the many myths about autism. The first interview in the article is with Amanda, and describes how the increasing popularity of her  YouTube video , caught the attention of the media; By 300,000, the TV people came calling, hearts warmed by the story of a young woman's fiery spirit and the rare glimpse into what has long been regarded as the solitary imprisonment of the autistic mind. \" I've said a million times that I'm not trapped in my own world ,'\" Baggs says. \"Yet what do most of these news stories lead with? Saying exactly that.\" (my emphasis) How anyone could spout that \"trapped\" nonsense, especially after watching Amanda's videos, and reading just about anything she has written, is just astonishing, but somehow, some people manage it. The journalist tells how he got the opinion of an (unfortunately unnamed) \"world leading authority on autism\" to view the video, and he commented that such a severely autistic person as she  couldn't possibly  have produced it unaided. I think someone needs to read and learn some more. The technological advancements over the past few years have benefited autistic people, perhaps even more than they have benefited everyone else; Baggs is part of an increasingly visible and highly networked community of autistics. Over the past decade, this group has benefited enormously from the Internet as well as innovations like type-to-speech software. Baggs may never have considered herself trapped in her own world, but thanks to technology, she can communicate with the same speed and specificity as someone using spoken language. Personally, the community available via the internet, has been invaluable to me, as a parent seeking advice, knowledge and like-minded people. Amanda describes the growing autistic advocacy movement; \"I remember in '99,\" she says, \"seeing a number of gay pride Web sites. I envied how many there were and wished there was something like that for autism. Now there is.\" The message:  We're here. We're weird. Get used to it . (my emphasis) Oh I love it! How much better my son's future will be thanks to the hard work, research and activism of people like Amanda, Michelle,  Ed ,  Autism Diva ,   Joel ,  Larry  and so many others. The new approach to autism research by some neuroscientists is described; [Autism] shouldn't be thought of as a disease to be eradicated. It may be that the autistic brain is not defective but simply different \u2014 an example of the variety of human development. These researchers assert that the focus on finding a cure for autism \u2014 the disease model \u2014 has kept science from asking fundamental questions about how autistic brains function. This is a much more interesting question. Neuroscientist Thomas Zeffiro is quoted as saying; If Amanda Baggs had walked into my clinic five years ago, I would have said she was a low-functioning autistic with significant cognitive impairment. And I would have been totally wrong. The origins of the categorisation of autism by Kanner and Asperger are described, as well as their views on autistic intelligence; Kanner spoke of an array of mental skills, \"islets of ability\" \u2014 vocabulary, memory, and problem-solving that \"bespeak good intelligence.\" Asperger, too, was struck by \"a particular originality of thought and experience.\" Yet over the years, those islets attracted scientific interest only when they were amazing \u2014 savant-level capabilities in areas such as music, mathematics, and drawing. For the millions of people with autism who weren't savants, the general view was that their condition was tragic, their brainpower lacking. and later In 1943, Kanner wrote that while many of the children he examined \"were at one time or another looked upon as feebleminded, they are all unquestionably endowed with  good cognitive potentialities .\" Why were the observations of the first two autism researchers on the matter of intelligence, almost ignored? Also featured in the Wired article, is Laurent Mottron, a psychiatrist working in Montreal and who said; \"I wanted to go as far as I could to show that their perception \u2014 their brains \u2014 are totally different.\" Not damaged. Not dysfunctional. Just different. Mottron has focused on the enhanced visual, spatial, and auditory skills of many autistic people when compared to neurotypicals, whereas most other researchers ignore what they term these \"anomalous peaks of ability,\" to focus on the better funded questions like what is  wrong , what  causes  it and how do we  cure  it. I found this section most interesting; Mottron draws a parallel with homosexuality. Until 1974, psychiatry's bible, the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , described being gay as a mental illness. Someday, Mottron says, we'll look back on today's ideas about autism with the same sense of shame that we now feel when talking about psychology's pre-1974 views on sexuality. \"We want to break the idea that autism should definitely be suppressed,\" he says. The article continues with a brief profile of Michelle Dawson, and her unconventional route into autism research, and her recent first authorship of a study called \" The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence .\" This work compared two types of test used to assess intelligence and: suggests the Wechsler scores give only a glimpse of the autistics' intelligence, whereas the Raven \u2014 the gold standard of fluid intelligence testing \u2014 reveals the true, or at least truer, level of general intelligence. The Wechsler Scale is described as one which; assesses crystallized skills like acquired vocabulary, making correct change, or knowing that milk goes in the fridge and cereal in the cupboard \u2014 learned information that most people intuit or recall almost automatically. As such, it must be recognised that this is an inappropriate tool to use with people who have difficulty with verbal communication. Dawson is paraphrased as saying; you wouldn't give a blind person a test heavily dependent on vision and interpret their poor score as an accurate measure of intelligence. Indeed. It can be hoped that other autism researchers follow her lead, and that it becomes common practice to use the obviously more suitable Raven test in the future. Obviously, the usual journalistic balance is achieved by quoting those who disagree with this direction; In the vast majority of journal articles, autism is referred to as a disorder, and the majority of neuro-psychiatric experts will tell you that the description fits \u2014 something is wrong with the autistic brain. UCSF's Merzenich, who agrees that conventional intelligence-testing tools are misleading, still doesn't think the difference model makes sense. Many autistics are probably smarter than we think, he says. But there's little question that more severe autism is characterized by what Merzenich terms \"grossly abnormal\" brain development that can lead to a \"catastrophic end state.\" Denying this reality, he says, is misguided. Yale's Volkmar likens it to telling a physically disabled person: \"You don't need a wheelchair. Walk!\" Volkmar's remark is nonsensical and misguided. No-one is suggesting such a thing. More accurate research can only benefit autistic people. Knowing how my son's brain works, will help me know how to target his education better, to suit his skills and difficulties. Knowing that many, or most autistic people are much more intelligent than supposed, means there is a moral imperative to help them to find better ways of communicating, since that is usually the primary difficulty. How much effort has really been spent on trying to teach the autistic people languishing in group homes, how to type, use picture symbols, sign language, or other forms of augmentative communication. I would say this work is the absolute opposite of what Volkmar claims; it's more like, \"Here, have a wheelchair, you  can  become mobile.\" The Wired article continues; Should autism be treated? Yes, says Baggs, it should be treated with respect. \"People aren't interested in us functioning with the brains we have,\" she says, because autism is considered to be outside the range of normal variability. \"I don't fit the stereotype of autism. But who does?\" she asks, hammering especially hard on the keyboard. \"The definition of autism is so fluid and changing every few years.\" What's exciting, she says, is that Mottron and other scientists have \"found universal strengths where others usually look for universal deficits.\" Neuro-cognitive science, she says, is finally catching up to what she and many other adults with autism have been saying all along. This is great news and can only benefit people like my son. (Amanda would like people to know that \"treated with respect\" was a quote from D.J. Savarese, and another misleading part of the interview is mentioned in her  latest blog post .)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-03/ff_autism?currentPage=1", "http://www.wired.com/", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://youtube.com/watch?v=JnylM1hI2jc", "http://eds-autism-blog.blogspot.com/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/", "http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/", "http://laurentius-rex.blogspot.com/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17680932?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=497"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/wired-on-autism.html", "title": "\nWired on autism\n"},
{"date": "6 Mar 2008", "body": "\nI've written here before no doubt, about the time around Duncan's diagnosis. When he was almost two, I thought he was just at the far end of the range for what was 'normal' in children starting to speak whereas Lady had been at the high end. I knew he was smart; he could figure stuff out, especially it it involved him eating something sweet. He was very fast to crawl and walk and he smiled at the normal age, though not as often as his sister. But he mostly ignored us, unless he wanted something. He didn't respond to his name, but he looked round if you said something like 'Thomas video.' He couldn't point to any of his body parts, he didn't seem interested in most of the silly games I'd been able to engage Lady in. I wasn't too worried, and told myself he was just developing at his own pace. But anyway, after a few months when I couldn't really see much change in his abilities, well except his amazing money-like abilities in climbing and balancing, I was concerned and looked up the word  autism  on Google. This was a word that had been hovering in my mind for a while. After 10 minutes online, I knew this was it. We started the process of doctor visits, speech therapy, assessments and services which wasn't to be honest, all that onerous. I was upset and worried about it all. I didn't know what would become of my precious and at times, baffling boy. I still don't, but I don't know what will become of the other two either. Oh how I wish that something like the  Autism Hub  existed then. But it didn't and I had to work through the different emotions and reactions and options available. I could rail against the diagnosis, resolving to 'fix' my son and find the reasons why we were lumbered with this fate. Or I could opt to accept it, and resolve instead to raise my child and teach him in a way that best suits him, to find out more about autism from the real experts, people who themselves are autistic, and do a little to work against the extreme prejudice and ignorance around disability, especially autism. But while it was all new and I wasn't sure what to do, I went to a support group for disabled children and their families. I felt a bit out of place, like most people do when they're the new person meeting a group who all seem to know each other well. The children there had various disabilities and. The mums appeared so competent and calm. One sorted her daughters feeding tube out as easily as I might have tied my child's shoe laces. Another joked that her son thought he was the son of god, given her reaction when the doctors informed her he had Down Syndrome, 'Oh Jesus!' My child looked like he was just an ordinary two year old, albeit a naughty and destructive one whose mum had to stick very close and pull him down from the shelves more than once, and who could whip up a tantrum that left other toddlers in the dust. I met a woman I knew from Lady's school. Her son had cerebral palsy and she was surprised to see me there. She'd not known me as the mother of a disabled child, but then, neither had I.  She asked what disability my child had. While I told her, she watched Duncan for a while and then said, 'he seems very mild to me. I have a friend and her son is  really  autistic. He just sits around all day doing (something or other unusual but I don't remember what).' But then she brightened up and said, 'my friend's son got much worse as he got older!' Wow, thanks missus. You really made my day there. Well I persevered with the group, and it was one of the best things I did to help me in those early days. It's something I'd love to see here, and it's one of my secret dreams to help set up something similar in this region. But when I think back on that woman's insensitive remark I can now smile because Duncan has developed to be this funny, talented, intriguing, exasperating, loving and clever boy. I'd like to know from any of the parents of disabled children reading this, what was the most helpful thing to you in those early days, and what was the dumbest thing you encountered?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/03/somethings-help-some-not-so-much.html", "title": "\nSomethings help, some not so much.\n"},
{"date": "22 Feb 2008", "body": "\nThe Irish media's coverage of ABA continues. Last Sunday, there was an opinion piece entitled \" Disgraceful system that has failed or children .\" Writer Marc Coleman states that \"What is happening with autism calls on our resources of outrage.\" But just a few lines later he writes, \"Thank God, I have no experience of autism in my immediate family: in Ireland that would be some cross to bear.\" Is anyone else outraged at this disgusting statement? How dare he say people like my son are a cross to bear. He then tells the story of a friend of his who rang him to apologise that he wouldn't be able to attend his wedding, as the friend's child was about to start treatment that same day. This child didn't have cancer or an illness that meant \"treatment\" couldn't be postponed for a day, no, the child was autistic. Coleman then totes up the cost of autism on Irish society, the burden these people place on the economy, basing his figure on a UK study. He comes up with the figure of \u20ac100m a year; the cost of institutionalising a child with autism for the rest of their life. Because, he thinks, that's the only alternative to ABA. Humph. He then says; With a success rate of 50 per cent, the return on investment of an extra \u20ac50,000 for four years of Applied Behavioural Analysis leads to savings per child to the exchequer of \u20ac1.4m. And even if that figure is an overestimate, with around 6,000 children estimated to have autism, the return to the exchequer over our lifetime will be significant.Of Of course this is how a clever, worked-out and integrated approach to policy making would work, an approach with a heart, a brain and an ability to combine both. Yes Applied Behavioural Analysis is needed.   A success rate of 50%!!! What foolishness. In the  Irish Examiner , I read that  Michael Ringrose of  People with Disabilities Ireland  says,   What seems to be accepted by all sides is that the ABA teaching method is appropriate for certain children with autism. What is needed now is to make sure the appropriate system for each child is diagnosed in the first instance but crucially, that it is available to each child, not in a limited way as the current education system dictates but as the child needs it. I wonder if there are any autistic people on the board of  that  organisation. Yesterday's  leader in the Irish Independent  is supportive of the demands for ABA.    Parents believe ABA is by far the best treatment and this view is backed by    many experts, including a prominent member of a task force that advised the    Department of Education on autism. The department and the minister reject    the exclusive use of ABA and favour a combination of methods. Ms Hanafin    says that this view is endorsed by a consensus in the international autism    community.       Can both sides be correct? The parents who report phenomenal improvements in    their children's condition as a direct result of intensive ABA treatment, or    the minister who insists she is simply applying best international practice?        Earlier this week, in these pages, the minister made her case in a reasoned    and logical manner. Sadly, for her, many parents of autistic children see this only in terms of    love, not logic. I responded to the online edition, pointing out that not  all  parents think this way, and that you can have both love and logic. I also briefly outlined how scant the evidence is for ABA, and wrote, \"the study people kept referring to as the best evidence, is 21 years old, had major design flaws, and involved the use of harsh aversives; slapping and shouting at the children. Yet people keep quoting this study as evidence for ABA! (The 50% \"cure\" claim originated with this.)\" I had to keep the comment to under 1000 characters, which didn't seem to apply to some subsequent commenters! The next commenter got annoyed at what I said, especially the bit about the 21 year old study. But it is true, most of the media stories I have read do make the credulous statement that there's a 50% success rate\" or 50% of children are\"recovered\" using early, intensive ABA, so it is crucial to point out the flaws in this study. This  post in the blog Natural Variation , an excellent autism blog, does just that. One of the comments is from a Mr Mickey Keenan. What the minister has never understood is that ABA is NOT a METHOD any more than Medicine is a METHOD. Medical SCIENCE and Applied Behaviour Analysis are distinct SCIENCES. Until she gets this right, the minister can't even begin to address funding issues for training in ABA let alone funding for schools. You can't create more ABA schools if you don't have more trained behaviour analysts to work in them. So, minister, are you right, or are the professionals right? Is ABA simple another METHOD, or is it a SCIENCE? Once you acknowledge that it is a science then you have to concede that it is possible for one 'METHOD' to apply to all children. That \"METHOD\" is called the SCIENTIFIC METHOD. I sincerely hope you are not saying that you can envisage something other than the scientific method being best for the children. From all the SHOUTING, and weird statements, I will assume this is not  Dr Mickey Keenan , University of Ulster lecturer and ABA specialist. I'm a lay person, just a mum. I am interested in how autism is reported because the attitudes depicted and disseminated by the media directly and indirectly affect my autistic son. I hate to see the negative language used in some of these stories, the fear of difference and lack of understanding, the assumption that autistic children are so very strange, that they need a wholly separate way of teaching them, one which would never be used with typically developing children. I get upset at the hype and misrepresentation of the scientific basis for ABA, just as I do when people say vaccines cause autism. It's upsetting that there doesn't seem to be anyone speaking about these things in Ireland. Perhaps everyone else agrees with the idea of ABA funded for all the children whose parents want it, no matter that the reasoning they're using in demanding this is so flawed. But whatever, what I say is not going to change anything.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/disgraceful-system-that-has-failed-our-children-1291205.html", "http://www.irishexaminer.com/irishexaminer/pages/story.aspx-qqqg=ireland-qqqm=ireland-qqqa=ireland-qqqid=55312-qqqx=1.asp", "http://www.pwdi.ie/", "http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/personal-and-political-1294842.html", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/10/when-mainstream-is-mistaken-case-of-aba.html", "http://www.science.ulster.ac.uk/psyri/profiles/keenan_m/index.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-do-i-know.html", "title": "\nWhat do I know\n"},
{"date": "15 Feb 2008", "body": "\nI've  written  a few times about the  hype  and inaccuracies about  ABA  in the Irish media recently. Well it continues. Here I examine and summarise some of these articles. On Wednesday, the Irish parliament debated a motion by opposition party Fine Gael,  calling for government funding  of as many ABA schools as parents want. According to the Irish Independent, Experts say ABA is the best form of education for autistic children, but the Government refuses to provide blanket funding for the therapy. Who are these experts, and what gives them the authority to say such a thing without evidence? The reporting of the ABA stories is entirely credulous. Imagine if some people had developed what they said was a treatment for, say, epilepsy. They have no studies showing increased efficacy of their treatment over other standard therapies, and only one randomised trial, which also showed no benefits, and most of the authority for the claims of this new treatment, came from a poorly written 21 year old study, which combined the treatment with a now outlawed additional drug. Would people be writing this therapy up as the best way to help people with epilepsy? Well, I certainly hope not. Why then are standards so very low when it comes to autism? So the motion was lost by a mere 8 votes, and many members of the main government party, Fine Fail, while voting against the motion,  criticised their Education Minister . TD (member of parliament) Mary O'Rourke said: I feel that the door is not fully open within the Department of Education to embracing ABA. The effect ABA has on children with autism is huge. How does she know this? Keith Duffy,  Boyzone  member and Ireland's own 'autism advocate' celebrity,  said ; It's very, very simple. If you give a child the appropriate attention and education for four to five years it will cost between \u20ac26,000 and \u20ac50,000 per year and the child then has a chance of entering mainstream school. But if you don't do that the child could end up institutionalised by 13 and it will cost the State \u20ac3m to \u20ac4m over the lifetime of the child to care for them. Ah, it's our old favourites, the \"pay now or pay later\" and the \"only ABA (or chelation or homeopathy or insert crank therapy of choice here) will save those awful, tragic autistics from lifetime imprisonment\" canards. He describes his 7 year old autistic daughter before ABA; She had no communication skills, she had no language and her motor skills weren't great. She fixated on objects and she just lived her in own little world. But after 5 years of ABA, she is a \"completely different child.\" Well of course she is! It's to be expected that a 7 year old child is completely different from the child at 2! The last Irish Independent item (for today at least) is the  lengthy article  written by Brigid Sinnott, MA, BCBA, a senior behaviour analyst. She states that autistic children, or rather the parents of children with autism, \"held little hope of their child developing independent skills or going to their local school with their peers.\" But then, a new dawn, the ABA missionaries arrived with their ability to break everything down into lots of baby steps, and teach these poor creatures  how to learn ! She says of the Irish ABA schools; These schools provide a scientific and intensive approach to education, which results in significantly greater learning in every area, compared to any other type of 'autism schooling'. These results from our own ABA schools are absolutely in line with international research studies evaluating the effectiveness of ABA schooling. She then describes how 40%, or 12 of the students at her own ABA school went on to their local schools, She doesn't say what flavour of autism these particular children had on entering ABA, nor whether they are attending local schools without additional assistance or accommodations. I do hope not. Unlike a lot of other conditions, children with autism present with needs and abilities very different one from another; they do not learn in the same two or even 10 ways. Therefore, the eclectic model, even with its two or three strategies, will not meet the varied learning needs of most children with autism. I'd like to know what this 'eclectic' model is. Where is it said that it involves 2 or 3 strategies? I agree with Sinnott that autistic children have a range of needs and abilities, and each one deserves an individualised education with dedicated, knowledgeable teachers. This can easily be accomplished without resorting to a fully ABA driven system. On the other hand, a child attending an ABA school is accessing a curriculum generated by a detailed assessment of their specific learning needs. No two instructional programmes are the same in an ABA school and each programme is continually being adapted, based on the responses of each child, measured on a daily basis, to their programme of instruction. Each child benefits from an education that is not just autism-specific, but specific to their autism and far superior in meeting their needs than any other method. The detailed assessment and individualised education programme are needed for  every  autistic child in  every  school. Parents would be much better served working on that goal. There is no evidence that the ABA method is far superior than any other method. Most importantly, the way these learning goals are taught is specific to the way each child learns. ABA has hundreds of well researched, tried and tested strategies. This approach is possible because of the high level of expertise of practitioners in ABA schools. Tutors are typically psychology graduates with lengthy and ongoing training in ABA and supervision is provided by certified behaviour analysts.   This is not needed. The expense in paying for all these ABA trained staff could be much better spent on other resources thereby benefiting a much greater number of autistic children. When a family is burdened and heartbroken with the news their child has autism, and they encounter ABA -- with the learning and quality of life possibilities it has for their child -- this should be the beginning of hope, not the start of a battle. Well done, you managed to get the crucial devastation rhetoric into the article. The worst examples of hype, lies and callousness came from TD Ulick Burke, as quoted in a  Galway newspaper ; There are over 900 children currently waiting on speech and language therapy in Galway, despite constant appeals to government to provide further resources for autistic children in the West.  If true, this is a disgrace. I wonder how many of these children are autistic? They are being let down by their government, and parents and educators would do well to take the authorities to task over such a lapse. This shocking figure was released recently following a parliamentary question from Galway East TD Ulick Burke. The recent decision by the government to refuse to fund Applied Behavioural Analysis for autistic children in Ireland has caused outrage and concern among desperate parents, who believe that this treatment is the only way their children will be able to live an independent life. I'm getting fed up with the implication that my son will never be able to live an independent life,  because  he has never undergone ABA.  TD Burke says: They [the government] are essentially saying that every child should be in the mainstream system. There is no research to back this up. There is 40 years of research to show the that just two years of ABA before a child enters school means that they have a 50 per cent chance of being able to take full advantage of mainstream education and live a full life.   What!! Where have you all hidden this 40 years worth of research? Boy that old Lovaas paper sure does get misrepresented! Shockingly, Burke continues: One man I met told me about his son, who has been institutionalised since he was 17 because he didn't get the formative treatment he needed at a young age. He is sitting in a small room for up to 24 hours a day and he will be there for the rest of his life. The stories that you hear are absolutely heart-wrenching and something has to be done about it. All these parents want is what everyone other parent wants, for their child to happy, content and independent. It's just not good enough! So a man is to be imprisoned in a small room for the rest of his life, for the crime of being autistic! This is a terrible miscarriage of justice. I can assume that the dedicated member of the Republic's Parliament will be working tirelessly for this man, to ensure he is freed from such a fate. It is disgusting that shocking abuses are held up as the alternative to more spending on ABA. Finally, here's a post I read again recently, describing an  alternative to behaviourism  in the teaching of autistic children.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/national-news/politics/tds-to-debate-problems-facing-parents-of-autistic-kids-1287678.html", "http://www.independent.ie/national-news/backbench-backlash-over-special-needs-school-bias-1290106.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyzone", "http://www.independent.ie/national-news/familys-plight-an-outrage-fumes--boyzone-singer-1290107.html", "http://www.independent.ie/national-news/this-should-be-dawn-of-hope-for-parents-not-start-of-battle-1290109.html", "http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/905-children-waiting-on-speech-and-language-therapy-in-galway/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2005/04/better-much-better-way-of-teaching.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/aba-hyped-in-irish-media.html", "title": "\nABA Hyped in Irish Media\n"},
{"date": "22 Feb 2008", "body": "\nLast night, Gordon returned from a work trip to Cairo. He'd been looking forward to visiting Africa for the first time. Lady and Thomas read up on Ancient Egypt while he was gone and Lady wrote about how the pyramids were built, how mummies were made and why. Like most children that age, she liked the gross details, like how the brains of bodies to be mummified, were fished out through the nose. Gordon was lucky enough to see the pyramids and Great Sphinx at Giza When he got home, he was greeted as a hero by Lady and Thomas who bombed down the stairs and jumped on him. Duncan continued playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 on his PC. He always takes a while to get used to his dad's return, even when Gordon has just been to work for the day. But when he was ready, he came over too and demanded to go upstairs to play various rough and tumble games they have invented. I was listening to Duncan yesterday as he played with Gordon. His language has progressed so much recently. He can verbalise more complicated ideas and concepts. He uses more descriptive words. A few days ago, I was in town with the boys while Lady was at gymnastics class. Duncan asked to go \"look at the toy trains.\" He knew I wasn't going to buy one and was making it clear that he understood this. In the toy shop, he picked up a toy rifle, held it up as if to shoot, and looked at me saying, \"It's a gun, it's a toy one. It doesn't make fire.\" I asked who uses a gun, and he told me it was Clayton (the baddie in Disney's Tarzan), that Clayton is a \"bad guy\" who shoots the tree, which he does. He wanted me to buy the gun, but I had no money and anyway, I'm not happy with the idea of toy guns. Toy swords, fine, but I'm enough of a wishy washy liberal to feel creeped out at the idea of toy guns, Ah well, it's not that big a deal, and he didn't exactly push it so I can forget it for now. Though, he did pretend the long plastic vacuum cleaner attachment was Clayton's gun yesterday! I was thinking about Duncan's developing communicative skills. He has always been able to communicate, even if it was taking me by the hand and putting my hand on what he wanted, or by wailing or shouting until I got or did the right thing, or by smiling and turning to me when he was happy and wanted more of whatever we were doing or playing, or running away when he didn't want to do something. But the subtle ideas he is now able to convey, help us all. He also communicates via his pictures and typed titles, and he has started to type things in turn with me, though he's more interested in writing about his characters and logos than asking or answering questions! He is less frustrated that we're not missing his meaning, I'm happier that I can understand him better, and make myself understood better. He might not be happy with everything I say, but what 7 year old thinks his mum always knows best.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/words-and-ideas.html", "title": "\nWords and ideas\n"},

A man was holding a mike to the motley choir during 'We Wish you a Merry Christmas' and Duncan approached him to have a closer look, then directed the mike to himself before singing a couple of lines of the song. Lady said all the Brownies thought he was very cute. My sister arrived a few days ago and it's fantastic as always having her around. She's the cool pretty auntie who loves all the children and who is adored by them in turn. We've been out shopping a few times in preparation for Christmas day and yesterday's clan party. I was glad to have her with me on Saturday when I had a bout of what I refer to as 'flutters' or to be more exact, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), in TK Maxx. It's a benign but irritating condition I have had since late childhood, causing my heart to beat at around twice the normal rate leaving me dizzy and breathless. I know how to deal with the episodes. I just have to sit down, take it easy and do a Valsava manoeuvre (holding my nose while trying to blow through it). I can usually get rid of it in a few minutes, but in the shop it took what felt like ages, which made me more stressed and anxious, which made it harder to overcome. Anyway, I was plonked on the floor in the shop feeling a bit embarrassed but knowing I'd feel even worse if I walked downstairs to the nearest seats. Several people offered assistance and one lady got a staff member. The staff at TK Maxx were great. They got me a chair and water and the manager offered to arrange a taxi home. When I said I'd be driving, she offered to have one of their staff drive my car for me (my sister doesn't drive.) But when the SVT passed, as it always does, I was fine and well able to drive myself. It's just nice to know that people can be so kind. Anyway, yesterday was one of the highlights of the Christmas season; our big extended family party. I booked a room in a restaurant which is about equidistant from all of us travelling from north east, due west or south west. Attending were all my siblings except our youngest brother, their partners and children, our dad and step mum, our step sister and her family. We had lunch, the cousins played, we exchanged presents, my dad dressed as Santa and all the children recognised him, we chatted, Duncan ran around, we enjoyed being together, even if it was kinda loud. We did the same thing last year, and it's just such a nice way of getting everyone together without anyone having to travel too far, or anyone having to cater for 30 or so people. Now I must go wrap some gifts. I put them under the tree at the last minute, or it might be difficult for Duncan to resist the urge to open them. To all of you who read this, a very Merry Christmas and best wishes for a happy new year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/12/christmas-stuff.html", "title": "\nChristmas Stuff\n"},
{"date": "7 Jan 2008", "body": "\nWe got over the holiday season. It was mostly very nice, but everyone has been sick in various ways for the past week; not quite so nice. So what were the highlights; Obviously, Christmas morning, and the children delighted with their haul, even Lady who earlier in the year reasoned out the truth about the man in red.  Playing and watching the others on the new Wii game, our first games console and a fabulous bit of kit. Lady in her new dress-up 'ballgown' ('cause 9 year olds still like that kind of thing) and Thomas in his Quidditch robes. Duncan enthralled by Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 PC game. It is just so right for him! Christmas dinner, once it was on the table! Heading off with my sister on Boxing day and going out with a gang of cousins and our brother in the home town and yapping and laughing and drinking (cokes only for me, my SVT episodes were frequent and I didn't want to risk alcohol) and dancing and being benignly rowdy. That was great. Having my 4 year old nephew C. stay with us for 2 nights while Lady stayed with his big sister in their house. He and Thomas get on well, and more than a few games of Doctor Who and various super-hero type games were played out. C. made me laugh by putting on an American accent for these games, as opposed to his usual, shall we say, broad north west Irish one! Visiting with my family. We had a lovely visit with my aunt P. Duncan loves her house because they have a cuckoo clock. He didn't want to leave, saying 'no go home. Duncan stay in P's house, Duncan sleep in P's bed.' We liked their little dog too, a sweet if rather shy miniature schnauzer. I could see one of those in our house! Even Gordon is saying we need to think about the dog thing again. Duncan's many, many new computer generated pictures. Every night we look at what he produced, marvelling at the attention to detail and laughing at his titles. I will make a slide show soon to preserve them. Having the whole family together for so long. We've adapted our spare room to be a serviceable study and Gordon will work from home more this year, and he won't travel abroad anything like as often. That'll be good for everyone. 2007 was a good year, I have every hope that 2008 will be even better.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/past-few-weeks.html", "title": "\nThe Past Few Weeks\n"},
{"date": "14 Dec 2007", "body": "\nIt's been quite a week. 7 days ago, I learned that a very close friend lost a family member in the most shocking and terrible way. I visited their home, and sympathised with them in their grief and pain. The loss is severe, the victim was a wonderful, kind, vibrant and beautiful person who appeared to have been doing really well recently. It has given us all cause to question the current provision of psychiatric services in this province. The following morning, Gordon and I flew out to Malaga in southern Spain for a 3 day holiday, booked months ago for his birthday. We really needed that time together. Both of us were low and worn out by the past few months, and our time away was wonderful and rejuvenating. I was upset to hear when we returned, that Duncan, who with the other children had been cared for by their wonderful grandparents, had been a bit unwell and miserable. Yesterday I spent a while with Duncan curled up on my lap, making up for lost cuddle time, just browsing my favourite blogs and web sites and catching up on the latest news. It made for dispiriting reading. I read on Abfh blog, of the  NYU 'Ransom notes'  campaign. It appears to be an 'awareness' raising exercise by the Child Study Centre of the university, to highlight the impact of mental illness on children. That might be worth doing, but this is not the campaign to do it. This is disgusting, degrading, inaccurate and dehumanising. The autism 'ransom note' that they intend to splash all over New York and put in magazines and newspapers, says,  ' We have your son. We will make sure he will no longer be able to care for himself or interact socially as long as he lives. ' How can anyone think that such a statement on a billboard will benefit a single autistic person or their family? How would I like to explain that message to any of my children? I pity the autistic people who will face such a sentiment in huge letters as they go about their city. What fear and ignorance it inspires. They have similarly awful notes on other conditions too; bulimia, OCD. depression, Aspergers and ADHD. There is a  petition  that I would encourage anyone who reads this to sign. It consists of a well composed and thoughtful letter endorsed by several disability organisations, and addressing the justifiable objections to this campaign. Via  Autism Vox , I read the  New York Times article  about the controversy. The center\u2019s founder and director, Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, is quoted as saying, 'Children\u2019s mental disorders are truly the last great public health problem that has been left unaddressed. He went on to say (in the NYT article), 'While we knew the campaign was edgy and we knew it would be harsh and upsetting, the facts of mental illness are even more upsetting. 'I am disappointed. I thought the people we\u2019d be arguing with are the people who believe psychiatric illness doesn\u2019t exist or those who believe children are being overmedicated.' 'I thought we\u2019d be fighting ignorance. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be fighting adult patients or the parents of patients whose feelings have been hurt.' While there clearly needs to be more understanding of childhood mental health issues, this campaign only serves to increase fear, stigmatisation, ignorance and misunderstanding. This is not about something as nebulous and unimportant as 'hurt feelings' and I don't know why he considers those of us opposing the form of the campaign, as 'fighting' them. We just want to come to a resolution.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/12/held-for-ransom.html", "http://www.petitiononline.com/ransom/petition.html", "http://www.autismvox.com/provocative-harsh-upsetting-the-ransom-notes-ad-campaign/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/14/business/media/14adco.html?ref=business"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/12/dangers-of-stigmatising-mental-illness.html", "title": "\nThe dangers of stigmatising mental illness\n"},
{"date": "27 Nov 2007", "body": "\nMy brother and his girlfriend got engaged last week, so we had them over for Sunday lunch to celebrate.  We had a good day together, and 5 year old C. enjoyed playing with all our trains. He had insisted on bringing a few of his Thomas the Tank toys for Duncan to play with, which was nice of him. The children were watching a film now and then; something about real people and Warner Bros. cartoon characters playing basketball. Duncan was glued to the telly at one stage, watching as a man was squashed flat by a heavy character, after which a few cartoon animals put a pipe in his mouth and pumped him so full of air that he turned into a massive balloon and floated off. I commented on the funny man pretending to be a balloon, and promptly forgot about it. When I was trying to get Duncan settled that night, he kept talking about getting 'blown up'; 'Duncan not blown up, Duncan will be fine, be small boy.' At first, I associated those words with bombs, and wondered what on earth he had seen! It took me a while to realise he was still thinking about the film. I reassured him that he was fine, he would not be blown up like a balloon, he would stay small, that Mummy would look after him. I talked again about the man in the film, and how he pretended to puff up, he was a funny man, playing and pretending. We have gone over these facts a few times since then, and have explicitly explained how each individual in the family was safe from the threat of being pumped full of air. It's surprised me before, what the children have been worried by or frightened of in their videos. Lady used to be terrified of the opening scenes of 'Brum.' The kindly old engineer freaked her out for some reason. She used to go and sit quietly on the stairs when something she wasn't comfortable with was onscreen. It's harder to remember what Thomas was scared off, since he never was as sensitive as the other two. He didn't like the lion and the bear on the Teletubbies much though, and who'd blame him, the bear  was  voiced by the intimidating Penelope Keith!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/11/scary.html", "title": "\nScary!\n"},

{"date": "28 Nov 2007", "body": "\nHow far we still have to go. I just read a press release from the United Nations on a ' World Autism Day Resolution '; Member States should break the \u201c barrier of shame \u201d of people  suffering  from autism and raise international awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of the brain disorder, which was estimated to affect 35 million people worldwide, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations, urged this afternoon during a Headquarters press conference. Qatar shares the concerns of a number of countries about the high rate of autism in children in all regions of the world,\u201d Mr. Al-Nasser said. (My emphasis.) Well, I'm not sure what 'barrier of shame' means in this context. Perhaps he is trying to adopt the social model of disability and explain that people are  treated shamefully  for their autistic differences and  suffer  from a lack of acceptance, understanding and accommodation. There are calls for the UN to designate April 2nd as a UN autism awareness day. It's a shame that these efforts are appropriated by organisations like the badly named  Autism Speaks . Joining the Ambassador today was Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, a United States-based non-governmental organization that works to raise awareness of autism and fund research for its  causes, prevention and treatment .  \u201cCombating autism is going to require worldwide effort.  It is not politically, geographically or economically centred.   It is an equal destroyer ,\u201d he said. (My emphasis.) This is the organisation the UN chose to represent the interests of autistic people. Autism Speaks make no secret of their eugenic aims and trumps them at every opportunity. Notice that they make no mention of funding services, training, or living support for autistic people.  This is the group that proudly  displays a photo  of Bob Wright and  James Watson  on it's website, along with a quote from Watson saying, ' Autism is the worst thing that can happen to a family.' It's claimed that; In the United States, children diagnosed before the age of three and then properly treated had a 50 per cent chance of graduating from public school at an appropriate age level.  However, many African-American and Hispanic children, and children from non-English-speaking households, were not diagnosed until age seven.    Many children who are diagnosed very young as autistic, particularly as mildly autistic, lose the label as they get older. It is important to help all children as early as possible so that they receive the understanding and appropriate education (not treatment) they deserve and so their parents can learn how best to interact with them and encourage their communication. Many children, like Duncan, are unlikely to be able to graduate from a school at age appropriate level, no matter what 'treatments' I could have foisted on him when he was younger, and he was diagnosed at just over 2 years old. Suzanne Wright, also co-founder of Autism Speaks, said 1.5 million people had the complex brain disorder in the United States, and a new child was diagnosed with it every 20 minutes.  An immediate global response was needed to address the epidemic, she urged.  Ah yes, the ' autism epidemic '. That would be the  epidemic  which dates from the time the diagnostic criteria were widened to encompass many more people, the epidemic that coincides with the falling numbers of people labelled as 'retarded' or 'learning disabled', ie diagnostic substitution. It's disingenuous of this organisation to harp on about a non-existent epidemic, which they must know is false, to raise their profile and funding. And get that scary statistic about another one 'diagnosed every 20 minutes', they're like Body Snatchers... Also during the press conference, Jacqueline Aidenbaum Brandt, a mother of an autistic son, shed light on her personal experiences, including the misconception society had of the brain disorder and the concerns of parents of autistic children.  She said people often mistook an autistic child for an unruly or poorly behaved one, blaming the parent instead of the disorder for the child\u2019s behaviour.  Caring for an autistic child was complex, as parents were left to grapple with whether the child would one day be independent, and how he or she would be cared for after the parents had died or were no longer able to do so. It's a pain when strangers are critical, misinformed and lacking understanding about autism. Autism Speaks make no efforts to help here, choosing to paint autism as entirely horrible, devastating and the 'worst thing that can happen to a family.' The NAS however have at least made some good efforts to educate the public in the UK with its ' Think Differently'  Campaign.' The mum quoted above worries about her son's future, perhaps she will be canvassing the charity that claims to speak for autism, about whether they intend to change their emphasis somehow to supporting autistic adults to live as independently as possible.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2007/071127_Autism.doc.htm", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/inthenews/wrights_cold_spring_harbor.php", "http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1576829,00.html", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=117", "http://www.think-differently.org.uk/home.aspx"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/11/united-nations-and-autism.html", "title": "\nThe United Nations and Autism\n"},

It may be when we're looking at a book together or when he's using the computer or he may be looking at a packet of crisps, (' Tayto Onion Rings' ). In his own way, and with zero stress, Duncan is learning to read. He's also learning to type. Here are some of his recent 'invented' spellings; The Gerrar                    (Bagheera, from the Jungle Book) Mogley                        (Mowgli, as above) Pinck mad mouse               (I love the  use of 'ck' at the end) sasagtas                      (sausages...I'm not sure why he has a 't' in there) However, I have only to show him once how to type a word correctly and he remembers it. Most of what he types in Google, Youtube or to name his pictures is spelt properly. We had loads of fun playing a demo version of 'Roller Coaster Tycoon', a game in which you design your own fair. I'll have to get the full CDRom as the demo cuts out after about 15 minutes of play. That's one idea for Christmas. Duncan is still enjoying playing with his Dogz 4 game. He now has learned to take a screen shot, paste it into the Paint program, cut out the part he wants and paste  that  to a new file where he expands the image then paints and adapts it to suit him. This is one of his pictures. The toy with blue hair was in a Kinder Egg. Unfortunately he lost the toy, but we managed to find a picture of it on the Magic Kinder website. The boy is an edited image from the excellent  Starfall  learn to read site. It's on the  Who Am I?  section. The toy is sitting in a car from the Mad Mouse roller coaster. This is another edited screen shot. I helped him a bit to draw the mouse, but he did the rest by himself. I love his vision! Here's a request to anyone who reads this. If you happen to buy a Kinder Egg and find the toy shown above, I would be ever so grateful if you would be willing to send it to me. Duncan was very upset to have lost it and we have bought about 20 Kinder Eggs since then, but have not found it again. Lady says it's like looking for the Wonka golden ticket.

{"date": "9 Nov 2007", "body": "\nWe went to an indoor play centre yesterday early in the afternoon. The only other children there were aged 2 to 5, since most of the older children would have been at school. Duncan was playing in his favourite part which is designed for 1 to 3 year olds, but since there were no little ones there at the time he was OK. That section has a nice slide, but the slide in the other section is much too scary for him. He was singing to himself; 'Welcome to the House of Fun' by Madness. It's the soundtrack for one of his beloved roller coaster videos. Two boys aged 4 or 5 joined Duncan. They were playing with the foam blocks, and Duncan approached them. He laughed and imitated them in their game of jumping onto the blocks. The boys looked at me and whined that he was ruining their game. I just asked Duncan to come and play with Thomas and Lady on the 'pirate ship' (the other section). Duncan was as always these days, wearing his Captain Hook costume. Duncan didn't want to move. He started playing on the slide and in the ball pool again, and the boys were mocking his speech, saying 'go go ga ga' as if he was a baby, though he's bigger than they are. Then he passed the boys again, and one of them started kicking him! I sternly told the boy to stop; 'don't hit or kick him, I'm right here watching!' and took Duncan away. Duncan was upset and kicked at me a bit, but I distracted him by playing at being a crocodile. The boys went off to terrorise other children and a few little girls came in. One of them was a real sweet heart. She went down the slide laughing with delight, making Duncan laugh with her. She started to play with him wordlessly, throwing balls and sliding and climbing and they ended up hugging each other. Duncan was rather distracted by the shop, with loads of sweets in easy reach and which was unstaffed most of the time we were there. I had to move him away from it many times. He worked out all the things he wanted in order of preference; '1, Kinder egg, 2, marshmallow, 3, apple juice with a straw, 4, ice-cream.' We actually got through the whole session without buying any of it. Bonus! I'd warned Lady about the nasty boys, and when we were leaving I saw her in a corner talking to them. Then she stepped back, and did a jujitsu high kick in the air. I asked her what had been going on. She told me that they had pushed Thomas on the big slide, and then tried to knock Lady over. She told them not to, and then demonstrated her martial arts capabilities. I think she was making a point. That's my girl. Thomas loved the play centre. He's become so brave and outgoing recently. He went on the huge inflatable slide, and jumped so far off the top that he landed half way down before starting to slide. He asked a (nice) boy to play with him and somehow I think Thomas was dictating what they did and when. His tooth fell out on Tuesday and he was so excited about the whole thing, especially the prospect of some cash! He cracks me up with how he talks. He sounds more grown up than he looks, and he's adopted lots of little phrases from films and TV. Echolalia? ;-) We were watching a film recently where a character fell and bumped his backside. Thomas goes, 'Oh that's gotta hurt!' He's a cute and sweet boy, but he can be rather, well lets put it nicely, self interested.  As I said to Gordon once, if Thomas were one of characters in Kubrick's film 'Spartacus', at the end of the film, he'd have stood up and shouted, 'well I'm not bloody Spartacus!'\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/11/house-of-fun.html", "title": "\nThe House of Fun\n"},

I give him a few tips now and then, but he prefers to get on with it by himself. Duncan has become more confident in the water as the weeks go by. I don't have to stay right beside him, and can swim around near them in the learner pool, so I'm getting a bit of exercise too. Thomas and Lady developed a 'history project' yesterday. They dressed up in different outfits, and read the relevant bits from their 'History Explorer' CD Rom. But the main point of the exercise seemed to eating the food of different places and eras. The had tea (ancient China) olives (Rome and Greece) bread (medieval Europe) and raisins, substituting for dates which we don't have, (Egypt). Like their parents, they believe food is the best way to engage in different cultures. In the spirit of educating himself, Thomas asked me to put on their DVD of the excellent Wallace and Gromit film, ' The Curse of the Were-Rabbit .' He needed, he said, to learn about cheese! We all recently enjoyed the film ' Ratatouille ' too, though it had a complicated plot and was much too long. Duncan loved the bit where the rat cooked soup. It's led to a revolution in his diet. He has for a while, been eating tins of Campbell's oxtail or cream of chicken soup. But these have too much salt, and I'd much prefer that he eats home cooked food.  Ratatouille  seems to have persuaded him. After the film, he asked to cook some soup, 'with vegetables, carrots and leeks.'  He took out the saucepan, chopping board, ladle and wooden spoon and arranged them all by the cooker. Then we worked together to make a nice chicken and vegetable soup, which I blended. He ate it all, and has since had many a bowl of hearty home made soup.

{"date": "6 May 2008", "body": "\n We spent all our of day 3 in the Studios Park. Again, it was very wet and quite cold. Moreover, the park was extremely busy. Obviously many French people were on holidays. If I ever go again, and I expect we will, I will check the French school holidays schedule carefully! This day we were determined to see a few of the shows, hoping to enjoy shelter from the awful weather. We were on time to see the Motor stunt show. I kept Duncan in his pushchair, waving his green access card when asked to leave the chair with all the other pushchairs. This helped him and he was more comfortable to remain in his little chair. I had wondered how he'd cope with the car show, with its loud noises, smells and scenes of danger and simulated shooting and fire balls. I explained carefully what was going to happen, and kept whispering to him throughout. He actually loved it, his little head moving from side to side as he followed the action. He got a real thrill when a stunt man pretended to be shot and dropped off the top of a building or when the cars jumped over a lorry. He reached his limit a while before it ended and I took him out early, and we had fun watching the newest roller coaster there, Crush's Coaster based on the Finding Nemo film. Gordon and I had mobile phones and walkie talkies to keep in touch, all of which were so useful. We all enjoyed the Animagique show. This is one of Thomas ans Lady's favourites. Again Duncan sat next to me, and he was wide eyed with wonder as the well known characters sang the familiar songs on stage. The live Stitch show, while hugely enjoyable, wasn't so successful for Duncan. It was a lot more discursive, and he isn't that interested in the character. So although he didn't want to leave, he did shout out a few times during the show. If I'd been able to see how to leave easily I would have done so. As it was, a little girl sitting in front of us spent more time staring at Duncan than at the screen. My whispering reassurances helped him. We'd stumbled upon a new phrase that seemed to help him. I would ask \"who does Mummy love the best?\" and he then calmed down to answer that I love Duncan the best, then I'd ask, \"who is the best boy in Disneyland\" to which he'd say he was! Lady and Thomas knew that neither statement was entirely accurate! Afterwards we ate at possibly the worst eatery in France. I really don't know how Disneyland Paris can serve such over-priced, poor quality food despite the deserved reputation for quality and appreciation of food in France. Why do the French let them get away with it? Is eating terrible American-style food seen as part of the Disney experience? But there was more fun to come. We went on the Studios Tour, again something I was worried Duncan would be frightened by, but which Gordon felt he'd enjoy. And G. was right. When the lorry went on fire, D. got a shock (even though I'd whispered to him it would happen) but recovered instantly, understanding that it was part of the show, and that no-one was worried. He got a real thrill watching and hearing thousands of litres of water gush down over everything. I took Thomas and Lady on the Aladdin Flying Carpet ride, which Duncan didn't want to go on then we went back to the hotel. As before, E. had had enough and stayed there for the rest of the evening. Lady and I had earlier picked up FastPass tickets for the Tower of Terror ride and we both rushed back to make our allocated time slot. Now this is an appropriately named attraction. We queued up, having a good idea of what was to happen, thanks to YouTube. But to experience it is something else. We lined up for about 20 minutes and were shown to our \"lift\". The cast member showing us in played the part to perfection. He was tall and gaunt, he gesticulated, and eye rolled. On entering, I asked, \"should I be scared\" and in a Norman Bates Manner, he assured me that all was well... Merde alors! It was far more scary than I anticipated. Lady was wailing and promptly shut her eyes. I had to fight my instinct to hold on to the handles below my seat with my instinct to put my arms around my distressed daughter. After the 1st drop, I managed to let go of one side and hold her. We came to a stop and Lady asked, with her eyes still tightly shut, if it was definitely over. \"I'm going to kill him!\" she said referring to the staff member who'd shown us into our seats. And as we walked out past him, she glared at him, drew her finger across her neck in that universally understood sign of \"you're dead\" and pointed at him. I was shocked, but he played along and pretended to fall down. Wow, scary daughter! But we felt very proud of our accomplishment/craziness. Later still, I took Thomas and Lady out for a meal at the Rainforest Cafe while Gordon stayed with Duncan. I ordered a starter which turned out to be revolting and they each had a children's meal of disgusting spaghetti with meatballs, a small drink and an ice-lolly for almost 15 euros each! Despite that we enjoyed being out together, and Thomas was thrilled that I allowed him to wander around the restaurant alone (he went on tours of 1-2 minutes each over to the aquarium) so we didn't let the terrible food bother us too much. Well, I went out with Gordon again later for something a bit better so I wasn't bothered. So ended the 3rd day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCBlEKF5YdI/AAAAAAAAAMU/u550ten5J4o/s1600-h/IMG_2949.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCBlDqF5YcI/AAAAAAAAAMM/LLtvfyTKZCM/s1600-h/IMG_2953.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCBkK6F5YbI/AAAAAAAAAME/Gb8XTACTv1s/s1600-h/IMG_2965.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCBlEaF5YeI/AAAAAAAAAMc/-pwSXLpSJxA/s1600-h/IMG_2982.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/disneyland-day-3.html", "title": "\nDisneyland Day 3\n"},
{"date": "1 Nov 2007", "body": "\nI read a  post  yesterday on  Gimpy's Blog , about a homeopath called  John D. Melnychuk  and his claim to have cured autism, and other named conditions.  What follows is a lengthy quote from Gimpy's blog, showing Mr. Melnychuk's case notes for an autistic boy taken to see him. Says  Gimpy , I have acquired the Case Notes of a case of Autism that John Melnychuk, RSHom (NA) claims to cure. These Case Notes were anonymised by John Melnychuk and were presented at a conference as well as being available on the web, I am assuming that all necessary permissions were sought by John Melnychuk, the organisers of the conference and the owner of the website. They make for distressing reading and are presented unedited below (apologies for length): Case Notes by John Melnychuk ; A Simple Case of Autism John Melnychuk, R.S. Hom. (N.A.) CCH August 2006 This case is written nearly verbatim and in the order the mother gave the case. (small changes made only to enhance readability.) Initial consultation 9/19/05 K.S., Six year old boy. Both parents bring him to my office complaining that he has Autism and that he is violent to others. We sit down and I observe: K. presented with paroxysms of noise and motion. Small stature, large head. Beautiful. This small stature is related to digestive impairment secondary to gut injury. Large circumference head is commonly found in autistic individuals. Autistic children are usually very beautiful \u2013 long lashes, big eyes, and symmetrical faces \u2013 perfect in appearance, (more commonly so where cancer is in their genetic history). He is the son of Japanese American immigrants. Father speaks almost no English and did not contribute much verbally to the case taking. Father, restaurant owner and chef. Mother helps with business, former professional dancer, now an accountant. One older brother \u2013 M., age 8 who is well. Maternal grandmother provided and provides a great deal of care. The mother says: History of hitting (his own) head severely. We saw Dr. Eric Dolgin, D.O. for Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy who helped a great deal. R. ear is deaf at birth. Conceived in America. Pregnancy was no problem. Did not know I was pregnant @ 3 to 4 weeks. Had a tooth removed under local anesthesia and took antibiotics (type unknown). Mother age 36 at delivery. Epidural, and then delivery after doctor broke the water to induce labor. Labor was 3 hours. During pregnancy K. was much quieter than his brother. We saw immediately that he had a problem with his R. ear. R. ear was bigger than the L. ear. After birth he stopped breathing for a short time. The doctors kept him overnight in the hospital because of this. Both boys had a bit of jaundice. Mother had many (20) silver amalgams due to unavailability of good dental care in rural Japan where she grew up. Also did not receive good instructions on hygiene from parents. Now only one mercury amalgam is left, (others have been replaced with composite fillings). Age 1 K. is seen smiling and waving in video tapes. Very early teething at 7 months. (carc) (Brother teethed later.) K. bit mother\u2019s nipple to get attention. (violent). Mother wanted to be a CPA, and got this job at K\u2019s age of 7 months. Lots of work. She would give 3 shots of vaccines at a time because it was difficult to get away from work. She ate Doritos and Cheetos and a bad diet. (Corn chips and cheese doodles). Mother was too busy to pay attention to any reaction after vaccines since maternal grandmother was the primary care giver at this time. No information available from MGM. Stool was always watery since birth. Then he had yeast infections. Now the stools are good. At the beginning very watery stool and diaper filled with liquid, not smelly. Brownish yellow. He would cry at night and kick until we changed his diet. Sleep is much better with a gluten free/casein free diet that began last year. His eye contact, responsiveness and attention are all better since we began the GFCF diet. Now he takes many supplements, but it is difficult to get him to take them. Doctor wants to give 7 supplements a day. We can get 2 into him. He will take vitamins in pomegranate juice. He climbs and is very athletic. Knows where his mother hides crackers, beef jerky, and juice. He has hit his head quite a lot. Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy has been given with benefit. He was less responsive by age 2. He began hitting and pulling hair this year. Also he bites. He knows pulling hair is more effective than biting. He needs help but is very violent. Mother has devised a way to hold him when he is in a rage so that he does not hurt her. He does not like speech therapy and cries there. Family Medical History: Mother age 20\u2019s Bladder infection. Mother used to be a modern dancer. Would sweat and then get a chill, then bladder infection would begin. MGM forgetful, short-term memory poor. MGF deceased from liver cancer after drinking alcohol \u2013 whiskey, even though he was happy. PGF died age 48 of heart attack. PGM died age, in the year 2000. Mother\u2019s brother is healthy at age 37. Father\u2019s 3 brothers are healthy, but not close. Obs: K. will lie back with his feet up in the air and play with toys \u2013 a soft anemone-like rubbery toy. Began at an Early Start Program offered by school district at age 2.5. (This program offers speech and occupational therapy to help children who have delayed development.) He cried a lot and did not like it. He is obsessed with leaves and likes to tear them. School has good resources and uses a \u201cFloor Time\u201d program. He is occasionally interested to interact with other children (but has very limited skills). Obs: K. will \u201cgive me five\u201d and glance at me if I ask him to. Fear of going to the doctor\u2019s office. Will cry. Used to be afraid of leaf blowers, bathroom fan, and the sound of video tape rewinding. Fear of new people. Sensitivity to sounds is better since chelation, but still sensitive to sounds. Likes smiling persons. Likes to be hugged. Likes to be upside down and standing on his head. Very good balance. He can stand on a horse that is walking. He swims like a sea otter and is very fast in the water. Can speak a few words, but almost always must be prompted several times. Can understand Japanese and English. He will calm down when Mozart is played. He will hit his head near midnight. No sweating or drooling. He did sweat on his head from age 2, a bit less since they removed wheat from his diet. Food: \uf0c5beef, chicken, McDonald\u2019s French fries, cereal, corn flakes. Nursed 8 months. He quit shortly after beginning to teethe. Mother was working at the time. She still loves her job. K. likes to be outside more than inside. Sleeps on back on a pillow with hands above his head. Likes to sleep with brother. (This was really the only time that he showed any interest in brother. Nearly no interest or contact with brother outside of sleep-time at night.) Will occasionally hump mother or therapist. (Masturbate). (common symptom). Obs. K. Climbs over parents as they sit on a sofa in my office. K. Gives video tapes to parents to play for him which he does not watch. (No speech). He takes methylcobalamine B12 injections twice a week. History of fevers once a month for which mother would give Tylenol. K. has been doing better since OMT and treatment from DAN protocol. (DAN \u201cDefeat Autism Now\u201d protocol is a biomedical approach to treating Autistic individuals with vitamins, supplements, diet and pharmaceuticals). Before he would not react to pain, but now he is reacting more normally. History of remedies: This child had been given infrequent and hight doses of Tarentula and either Stramonium or Scorpion, (I can\u2019t recall which) with no benefit in approximately a year of treatment. Plan: A two part prescription: 1) Morbillinum 30C , one dose only for one day. - gut damage in MMR injured individuals looks similar to that when the AIDS virus is present. Very syphilitic. Morbillinum individuals are miserable and cranky. (Shepherd writes beautifully about Morbillinum). 2) Beginning the next day, Cuprum metallicum 6C once daily. Seizure like paroxysms of pain resulting in violence to himself and others. Neonatal asphyxia. Vaccine injury. What did the first homeopath miss? Likely he did not comprehend the significance of the rhythm of symptoms \u2013 paroxysms or spasms of violence. He may not have seen them as seizure-like events related to a brain injury. He may not have ranked the episode of asphyxia as being important. Certainly he did not adopt the strategy of giving low potencies daily in a case where daily life was filled with violence. First follow up 10/24/05 by telephone with mother. He is better than the first time we talked. We stopped the remedy at Yom Kippur and began again after. No violent reaction. He had rashes and itching with soft stools. The stool has tiny bits in it (different from before). He is doing very well now, but he will wake after 2 or 3 hours. He cries \u201citai\u201d (Japanese for \u201cpain\u201d), but he is less violent, although he can still be aggressive. He had a yellow mucous discharge from both eyes on the morning of October 1st. (Keynote for Morbillinum \u2013 and in this case the discharge likely contained toxins from the vaccine and Tylenol in his brain). Violence is reduced by 50%. His headaches at night are much reduced. Also the Osteopath noted an entirely positive qualitative change in his ability to treat K. K. was not waking at night and crying and pulling hair or biting. It has been much easier. His ability to understand our speech is much better. He is growing more. (He is absorbing more nutrients from his gut and therefore less malnourished.) He still wants to go outside and is obsessed with leaves. Doesn\u2019t want to stop watching videos or playing. Will get upset and scream when interrupted. Cuprum is very useful for him. Impression: Doing well. Plan: continue Cuprum met. 6C daily. Follow up 11/21/05 by phone with mother. He is better than last month. We gave Morbillinum 30C on the 25th of October and he had some tantrums for a week, but these were milder and shorter than in the past. Now diarrhea is gone and it is easier for him to go to the bathroom. The pains he feels in the R. side of his head are less severe and less frequent. Now he is imitating us much more. (more social interest \u2013 usually the first thing to improve in such cases.) He is not organized with homework, but he will now willingly sit at his desk instead of resisting it. (new). He needs a lot of pressure in his joints to pay attention (a common symptom in brain injury cases). He no longer resists or pulls hair, or throws things for the last 2 months. His mood is good and he is smiling more. I stopped the chelation the last three months. I was giving DMPS transdermally. Still giving glutathione and methylcobalamine B12. Fewer tantrums and crying. Likes roller coasters. Not screaming or pulling hair. He can control his bladder now. Sensory and muscle control is developing. Can\u2019t yet say \u201cI have to go pee pee.\u201d Not banging his head these days. Plan: continue Cuprum met 6C daily. Follow up 12/27/05 by telephone with mother. Not as good a month since his molars are coming in. He has been cranky with the pain. We gave Morbillinum on November 22nd because he was stubborn. He would not cooperate at home or school. He was better again a week after this single dose Morbillinum 30C. After his molar erupted it got easier. Now he is doing very well \u2013 much less crying again. His father says it is much easier now. Now we can go to restaurants because his spontaneous noises are less, and he can sit at a table. Before it was like carrying a time bomb. He has no headaches now. He can more easily repeat what he hears. Mother is now pregnant again with 3rd child \u2013 in vitro. He doesn\u2019t hit me or pull my hair anymore. He is not hitting himself as often. Violence is 80% less than it was. Before it was every night. Now he is sometimes (merely) pretending to be threatening. He is not violent to his brother. He is growing a lot taller. He is very fit and dong a lot of sports and gymnastics. Plan: Cuprum met 12C once daily. Kreosotum 30C only if tooth pain is overwhelming. Follow up 1/26/06 by telephone with mother. He is much better with the higher dose of Cuprum. Headaches moved to a place near a bump on his head and the pains seem to be moving toward the back of his head and neck. He is now saying new words (spontaneously). He also is beginning to answer a bit in Japanese (primary language at home.) Aggressiveness is 5% of what it was. He can stay still to study now for between 15 and 30 minutes. Plan continue Cuprum met 12C daily. Follow up 3/1/06 by telephone with mother. Doing better. No headaches, no crying, unless he has wheat. Jaw pain is better in a just few minutes with an occasional Kreosotum 30C. Still can play with leaves for hours. Loves horseback riding, gymnastics, swimming, trampoline, climbing. Appetite is much better. Less obsessive than he was. Sleep is very good. Plan: Continue Cuprum met 12C daily. Maintain GFCF diet very strictly. (Gut inflammation is the last thing to be resolved in these cases and aggravating foods will delay general improvement). Follow up early July 2006 \u2013 An in person visit in Los Angeles, the first time I have seen K. since our initial consultation in September 2005. His brother and mother attend. K. is now very responsive to his family and teachers. He will make good eye contact. He has grown a great deal. Now K. is interested to play with his older brother and they have become quite close. (In September K. would not play or acknowledge brother. The only thing is that he wanted to sleep with his brother at night.) Obs: Speech is delayed but much improved and social interest is firmly intact. K. continues to improve. Plan: continue Cuprum met 12C daily. My perception: K. is very well loved and thoughtfully cared for. Although father speaks nearly no English, his presence at our initial interview was an important positive sign in the prognosis of K. His mother presented with a very positive and sunny disposition, and she did not reveal the depth of her suffering and worry in our first visit. K. had been attacking her with little restraint due to paroxysms of violence for more than a year. Only some months later did she reveal that she had been at her wits\u2019 end before bringing her son to homeopathy. She confessed that she had been contemplating killing her son and committing suicide herself because of his violence and lack of progress. Note: It becomes important to accurately measure progress yourself rather than merely by report of an overly nice or polite parent in this circumstance where the parent is more well mannered and hopeful than frank. When there is a history of violence, sudden or not, it is wise to use lower potencies and \u201cnudge\u201d the patient forward on a daily (or less often) basis. As well, dry doses were used because the primary care giver is elderly and unfamiliar with homeopathy. The last thing the family needed was to fuss with preparing LM potencies. Even the simple process of preparing LM\u2019s can produce a great deal of anxiety in those new to homeopathy. They often are stewing \u201cdid we prepare the dose properly?\u201d What happened to this boy K.? My perception is this is a case of poisoning. The first clue is that K. was mostly well, apart from the deafness in the R. ear. The family history of cancer is significant \u2013 it is an indication of higher susceptibility particularly to MMR vaccine. (There are dozens of factors which increase the risk of autism \u2013 genetic history is a major issue and I am careful to gather as much information as possible about the pregnancy and extended family history in these types of cases. Different genetic inheritance yields children which are more susceptible to various types of vaccines. There are many ways for children to become autistic and there are many types and manifestations of autism according to the unfortunate combination of inherited and environmental factors). It is very important to note that not all children will be negatively affected by vaccines, and not all autism is associated with vaccine injury, but vaccines are a factor in more than 80% of cases I see of true autism. Vaccines are an important, but usually a secondary factor in cases of Pervasive Developmental Delay. The second clue is the fact that he stopped breathing shortly after birth. He must have been blue at least for a short time in an episode of neonatal asphyxia. (Maybe from Hep B jab?) The third clue is the wet stools from birth. This indicates that there was already some inflammatory activity and lack of development in the gut \u2013 before any vaccines, except perhaps Hepatitis B vaccine which is routinely given shortly after birth in America. (I think this Hep. B is a major contributor to jaundice in newborns.) This digestive weakness shows that K. already had some susceptibility to vaccines and foods from birth. I speculate it was the antibiotics and other drugs that the mother received for the tooth extraction before she realized she was pregnant that contributed to this digestive problem in K. The timeline is the fourth clue. Note that K. was observed as developing normally socially and with language to his first birthday. There is even video evidence of his normal ability and conduct. After MMR there was a slow, insidious onset of symptoms over approximately six months which resulted in loss of social interest, speech, and intolerance of foods. This is typical for MMR vaccine related autism. The timeline here is quite typical. Several years ago the most common presentation would be of a child that was injured by MMR would have early normal development and then be affected by an MMR jab at 12 months. Most often a bit of fever or fussiness would come after the jab. Tylenol was almost always given (which always compounded the severity of the injury \u2013 don\u2019t get me started about Tylenol\u2026.) By 18 months speech and social interest would be lost and gut problems would appear. Pediatricians would typically stall the parents \u2013 \u201che\u2019s just a late talker,\u201d etc. Diagnosis of autism or Pervasive Development Delay \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified (PDD \u2013 NOS) would come by age three or four depending on the severity of damage the child had sustained. (PDD - NOS would be a more common diagnosis where motor planning problems were more evident rather than where primarily speech and social deficits presented.) These days the timeline is a bit different for children developing symptoms as a related to MMR injuries. Now for children where MMR is likely a factor, the onset generally comes later and the diagnosis comes earlier. What we see now is slightly atypical development to 15 to 18 months with loss of social interest and speech by 24 months. The prognosis for these children is better since their injury came later, is milder, and because diagnosis and treatment come earlier. The later onset and milder injury have likely arisen because thimerosal has recently been removed from MMR and many other but not all childhood vaccines. Thimerosal is one of many metals and chemicals commonly present in vaccines as stabilizers to extend shelf-life of the vial of vaccine. Thimerosal is more than 50% mercury by weight. The diagnosis comes earlier because Autism is a more popular diagnosis and pediatricians are very interested to make such a diagnosis even if the evidence is for PDD-NOS or some other problem. Is it clear that thimerosal is not the only problem, although it has been the focus of most of the Autism advocacy groups and most scientists and physicians. The fifth major clue is: paroxysms of violence. K. was actually suffering from something like minor seizures which would come on suddenly and result in his attacking his mother and others. We see that he would also strike his head. This is never a good sign and it frequently presents in cases of head or brain injury and autism. In this case K. suffered short, suddenly intense pains in the head which he responded to by pressing or striking his head very hard. (Hitting the head, or doing head stands.) So intense was his distress, without any other ability to express his suffering with language, he would strike, pinch, bite, kick and injure others, most commonly his mother. Sometimes these children strike their heads against a wall or floor, or they use their fists or hands to strike their heads. The striking results from two things: one is that this is a proprioceptive response\u2013 similar to when you rub your knee after bumping or injuring it. Secondly, the children are trying to relieve a kind of \u201cstuckness\u201d in their cranium. (The brain will contract in the presence of a vaccine \u2013 think of how a slug shrivels when salted. This contraction is painful, and it slows recovery since blood and cerebrospinal fluid circulation to the brain is impaired). By beating their heads, the children are trying to free up their contracted brains.) Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy can often be very helpful to these children as it was to K. Homeopathy proved to be profoundly helpful for K. as well. Cuprum will not be the last remedy K. will need, but he may benefit from it for the foreseeable future. The main clues about the next remedies will again be found in his family history of illness, his desire to swing, jump, swim and play outdoors. Also his fascination in tearing leaves is likely to help us find the next remedy. My clinical experience in treating hundreds of autistic and other brain injured children has given me an opportunity to identify common features with autistic children, their history, and their prognosis. In general the children:     Are uncommonly beautiful, and have symmetrical faces, frequently with long lashes. May be quite hairy down the spine. Are usually small in stature, but with a large circumference head.     Usually have at least one special talent or ability and also some definite areas of deficient functioning. Usually at least above average intelligence if not gifted. Have their entire physiology impacted \u2013 it\u2019s not just social disinterest and speech delay. Benefit greatly from gluten free and casein free diets. Love to eat what aggravates them. Generally don\u2019t absorb nutrients very well and this delays recovery; they are malnourished. It is therefore important to address this in treatment from the beginning. Most biomedical approaches focus on this. (DAN protocol, etc.) Frequently have problems eliminating \u2013 gut problems are usually present. Exhibit stimming behavior. Examples of stimming are repetitive arm or hand flapping, spinning, swinging. Feel better from deep pressure. (But simply giving zinc usually yields disappointing results). Find transitions very difficult, moving from one activity or location to another usually leads to an upset. Prefer to be outdoors rather than indoors. Circle time at school is not interesting. Love music and videos. Frequently they can sing before they can talk. Are echolalic at first when speech begins to return. Echolalia is a very common feature early on when speech begins to return. Echolalia is the name for the behavior where the child will repeat only what he has been prompted to say. It\u2019s a good sign, although the parents are frequently upset and frustrated by it. Retain ability to receive language . Expressive language is more the problem.     Recover social interest first and this drives their interest to speak. This is bizarre and worrying and frightening and desperately sad for the child involved. Various unproven theories of autism causation are discussed; mercury from fillings and of course the ubiquitous baddy, vaccinations. There is so much to take issue with. The boy is said to be beautiful, and it's claimed that all autistic children are beautiful, especially 'where cancer is in their genetic history.' My son is beautiful, and that's my entirely biased opinion. My 2 non-autistic children are just as lovely. It's nonsense and distancing to write that autism is linked to 'uncommon beauty' as if they are somehow 'other' from ordinary humans. And where has he pulled the 'hairy back' theory from? K is described as small due to 'digestive impairment secondary to gut injury.' How does he know? Has he read a report from a gastroenterologist regarding the boy, but failed to mention it? There is a reference to practinioner of 'Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy' and to a doctor of some kind who 'wants to give 7 supplements a day.' I don't think that this 'doctor' is a registered GP or paediatrician. I wonder if the boy has been seen by any proper doctors. Who diagnosed him? What about his right ear, has there been medical assessment of that? There is much discussion K's stools and the other altie-obsession, yeast. The GF/CF diet has worked as well as it usually does in parent testimonials. This line made me smile, 'He climbs and is very athletic. Knows where his mother hides crackers, beef jerky, and juice.' That sounds familiar! Duncan seems to have some sort of sensors that can detect sugar no matter how well you think it's hidden. Perhaps I should get him some magic water too. This line is not so sweet, 'Fear of going to the doctor\u2019s office. Will cry.' It's more chilling when you read a few lines later that 'Sensitivity to sounds is better since chelation'. It's no surprise that K is afraid of doctors' offices. He has not had good experiences there. Duncan is worried about seeing the dentist ever since he had a tooth removed. He likes seeing doctors in the hospital we usually attend, as he knows he can play with cool toys there. These things are not hard to understand! Another observation is that K 'will occasionally hump mother or therapist. (Masturbate). (common symptom)' I wonder what he means by 'common symptom.' Does he mean common to autistics or common to boys? What's the relevance anyway? Here is a list of the therapies poor K has been subjected to, before setting foot in Mr Melnychuk's consulting room; Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy, 'helped a great deal.' GFCF diet. 'His eye contact, responsiveness and attention are all better since we began the diet' Many supplements and 'vitamins in pomegranate juice'. Early Start Program offered by school district; speech and occupational therapy. 'School has good resources and uses a \u201cFloor Time\u201d program.' Chelation. DAN protocol of vitamins, supplements, diet and pharmaceuticals. 'K. has been doing better since OMT and treatment from DAN protocol.' Homeopathic remedies: infrequent and high doses of Tarentula and either Stramonium or Scorpion with no benefit in approximately a year of treatment. In the follow up telephone consultation, K is said to be 'doing very well now, but he will wake after 2 or 3 hours. He cries \u201citai\u201d (Japanese for \u201cpain\u201d), but he is less violent, although he can still be aggressive.' How, I wonder, was his pain dealt with? That isn't pursued. We also are told that 'He is growing more. (He is absorbing more nutrients from his gut and therefore less malnourished.)' Children usually do grow at 6 and 7 years of age, even without magic water helping them along. In the next telephone consultation, pain is mentioned again; 'The pains he feels in the R. side of his head are less severe and less frequent.' There is another reference to chelation, and a few more things from the smorgasbord of non-evidence based autism interventions; glutathione and methylcobalamine B12. In the final assessment, K. is said to have improved in many areas, he has grown, he studies more, is less aggressive, plays with his brother, speaks and understands more language. The quantification of these improvement is truly bizarre. Where do these numbers come from? ('Violence is reduced by 50%...Aggressiveness is 5% of what it was.') It's interesting what happens to a 6 year old child in almost a year! Even if some of the therapies the boy has been subjected to have had an effect, it's impossible to tell what has helped since there are just so many. The most disturbing thing about the whole case report however, is Melnychuk's reaction to K's mother telling him that she had contemplated murdering her son then killing herself. He writes, 'Note: It becomes important to accurately measure progress yourself rather than merely by report of an overly nice or polite parent in this circumstance where the parent is more well mannered and hopeful than frank.' He does not recommend that she sees a doctor herself for counselling or therapy. He seems to accept this revelation as acceptable. The rest of his 'perceptions' are full of inaccuracies, mistakes and invention. Why does he think a family history of cancer is important? What has that got to do with MMR? He reckons, 'vaccines are a factor in more than 80% of cases I see of true autism.' How does he know this? He says, 'The later onset and milder injury have likely arisen because thimerosal has recently been removed from MMR and many other but not all childhood vaccines.' Wrong! MMR vaccines have never contained thimerosal. He talks about the pain K. suffered from; 'So intense was his distress, without any other ability to express his suffering with language, he would strike, pinch, bite, kick and injure others, most commonly his mother.' What investigations were made to discover the source of this pain and to treat it properly? I have read some downright nonsense since I started looking at autism quackery. This statement deserves an award for the most ridiculous claim ever; 'the children are trying to relieve a kind of \u201cstuckness\u201d in their cranium. (The brain will contract in the presence of a vaccine \u2013 think of how a slug shrivels when salted.' Give that man his prize quick! He ends with 17 observations from his 'clinical experience in treating hundreds of autistic and other brain injured children.' Some of them may be true for specific children, but mostly, he just made them up! I am focusing on this because I am disgusted that homeopaths think they have any right to 'treat' autism. As I said when I commented on Gimpy's blog, I had thought that homeopathy was fairly harmless, merely silly magic water sold to the worried well for self-limiting conditions. I had thought that while it was important to try to let people know that there is no evidence of its effectiveness, the fact that there is zero active ingredient in these pills/liquids means there would be no real harm done. However then I read about the homeopaths advising their magic water for malaria prevention, or to be used in clinics in Africa to treat real serious illness, or that homeopaths advise against vaccines for babies, and now this!! They have managed to delude themselves into thinking that their bottles of water and sugar pills, every one of which is identical when you remove the labels, can cure rashes, fevers, fatigue and now they reckon they can tackle more serious illnesses and even developmental delay. This is dangerous. It has to be recognised and dealt with. Thank you Gimpy for bringing this to light. Joseph  left a  comment  on an  earlier post  about homeopathy and autism. It turns out that there's a  book  recommended as essential, by those promoting homeopathy as a treatment for autism. I think we'll manage without it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/homeopath-cures-autism-a-black-hole-of-woo-with-case-notes/", "http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/", "http://www.paloaltohomeopathy.com/aboutjohn.html", "http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/homeopath-cures-autism-a-black-hole-of-woo-with-case-notes/", "http://www.interhomeopathy.org/index.php/journal/entry/simple_case_of_autism/", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/", "http://www.impossiblecure.com/autism.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/11/homeopathy-and-autism.html", "title": "\nHomeopathy and Autism\n"},

It's not done round here.  We might go to the Folk museum for a while, and then get a scary video to watch at home with fizzy drinks and popcorn. I was thinking about,  Monster House ; does anyone have a better recommendation? Nothing too scary, the children would be OK, but I frighten easily and like all my siblings, don't do horror. When I was wee (ie, a child) we'd have a bonfire on Halloween night in the field across the road from our house. A load of cousins would turn up, and we'd eat loads of nuts and fruit and wear scary plastic masks (no other dressing up) and wave sparklers. It was always good fun, even if you ended up with cow dung on your wellies since you couldn't see where you were walking in the dark field. Thomas intends to dress up as the not very scary, Harry Potter. What a surprise! Duncan has been wearing his Captain Hook outfit every day for over a week. He's worn it to all the shops, his Grandma's house, the swimming pool, and very dashing he looks too. I think Lady will wear her witch dress. I'll just be my hideous, evil and horrifying self. Look on me, and turn to stone... Right, well. I have to give a big congratulations to my big brother T. He ran his first ever marathon in Dublin on Monday, and got round in 3 hours 39 minutes.

{"date": "23 Oct 2007", "body": "\nSo  from one Noble , who may have been underestimated due to her model looks, but who has displayed depth of character and intelligence and loving support of her child, I hear all about the Nobel winner, who reveals more of his racist character, his misunderstandings of the concept of intelligence, and who has spoken harshly of his child. \n \nJames Watson has fled back home after shooting his mouth off just a bit too much. He was hardly a paragon of decency before he made his frankly racist, sexist and disablist statements to the press last week. It's surprising to realise the manner by which the Science Museum and other organisations decided not to give him a platform, as if they were unaware of his reputation for thoughtless and inflammatory views. \n \nThis is the  Times  quote that caused the most fuss; \n \nHe says that he is \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2013 whereas all the testing says not really\u201d, and I know that this \u201chot potato\u201d is going to be difficult to address. His hope is that everyone is equal, but he counters that \u201cpeople who have to deal with black employees find this not true\u201d. \nWatson also seems to hold autism up for particular opprobrium. In the Times article, he talks of the \u201chorror and destruction\u201d of life that can arise from having a severely autistic child, and hopes that by diagnosing autism early, \u201cwe might prevent some [autism-prone] families having subsequent children\u201d. \n \nSo he thinks Thomas shouldn't have been born then? Obviously he thinks I should have been able to prevent Duncan's existence. What a foolish idea! \n \nWatson was quoted on the  Autism Speaks  page saying \u201c Autism is the worst thing that can happen to a family .\u201d \n \nYep, that's right, he just claimed that autism is worse than murder or child abduction or fatal illness or abuse or drug addition or anything really. That's a horrible thing to say. \n \nHe's made other ugly statements  before ; \n \nFor instance, he believes abortions are acceptable where a foetus is found to be genetically inclined to homosexuality. \n\"If they want to, let them,\" he said. \"My wife really wants a grandchild.\" \nSomeone should tell him about all the gay parents out there. Would he advise abortion on fetuses found to have a genetic inclination to have fertility problems, or if their genes could predict that they may be heterosexual and child free by choice? \n \nI don't understand this idea that parents should be able to decide what kind of child has the right to exist. \n \nI was most surprised by the sheer number of people who came out in support of him. Most of these quoted his 'right to free speech' claiming that by denying him a platform, the Science Museum, and others, were trying to gag academic freedoms to ask difficult questions. That doesn't make sense. He's free to say what he wants, but that doesn't mean he gets to say it in any particular institution. I also think that the maxim, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, must hold true here. In spite of oh so many commenters on various liberal-leaning sites, crawling out to harp on about IQ tests  showing that Watson was right, others have pointed out the numerous flaws and biases in such tests. \n \nThere's a summary of the events in the Guardian  here , which includes the reaction of Craig Venter; \n \nAs Craig Venter, who pioneered much of America's work in decoding the human genome, put it: 'There is no basis in scientific fact or in the human gene code for the notion that skin colour will be predictive of intelligence.' \nSome good posts on these events are; \n A Twisted Life  and  Twisted Logic  by Club 166. \n This  and  this  by Evolution blog. \n This  at Pure Pedantry.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2630748.ece", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/inthenews/wrights_cold_spring_harbor.php", "http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/05/1057179206284.html", "http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,2196657,00.html", "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/twisted-life.html", "http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/10/twisted-logic.html", "http://gregladen.com/wordpress/?p=1535", "http://gregladen.com/wordpress/?p=1536", "http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2007/10/watson_loses_his_job_at_cshlth.php"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/not-so-noble.html", "title": "\nNot so Noble\n"},
{"date": "23 Oct 2007", "body": "\nThere was actually a pleasant autism story in some of the newspapers yesterday.  Emma Noble, talks in the Daily Mail , about her autistic 7 year old son Harry, with love and respect. (Harry is the grandson of former UK PM, John Major.) Emma is a beautiful, blonde haired, former model. There end the comparisons to  Jenny McCarthy , who has done the round of USA talk shows plugging her book about her 'recovered' autistic child. McCarthy blames vaccines for her sons autism and uses her celebrity status to spread her  misinformed inanities . Here are a few choice quotes from her interview with Larry King. When he asked for a definition of autism, she answered,  Wow! Well, it differs for a lot of people. But -- or opinions. But I believe that's -- it's an infection and/or toxins and/or funguses on top of vaccines that push children into this neurological downslide which we call autism. She was asked if she'd have more children, and said, I got my butt kicked. You know, it was really hard those years. Pulling Evan out of the window, I call it. I suffered a lot. I cried a lot. I'm just ready to move forward. I'm ready to help out. I'm ready to spread the word. I'm ready to make this world a safer, cleaner place. You get the picture. McCarthy is the new face of quackery pushing autism organisation, TACA.  As an example of their ethos,  here's  their sample 'To-do check list' for parents of autistic children. Among the many non-evidence based services mentioned (for the 1st year), are secretin, glutathione and chelation. Emma Noble has not taken this self-serving route, and just gave a really sweet interview. The fee for the interview was donated to the  NAS , a decent autism support charity, and one I'm happy to be a member of. The NAS does a lot of work to improve the lives of autistic people, both children and adults, and parents or carers of autistic people. Here are some highlights from the Mail article;  \"My life would be empty without my son and the experience we have been through together. His autism makes him who and what he is and I love him.   \"He makes it easy for me to accept because he makes me proud every day, proud of his achievements and of how hard he tries.    \" There is no part of me that mourns the mother I could have been to a son without his condition. I simply don't know that person. \"  ...  Emma reveals: \"Harry needs to know what is going to happen and in what precise order. There can be no surprises and definitely no dramas.   \"For example, he needs me to tell him what is going to be inside a wrapped present before he opens it.    \"He pictures it to be something that he wants and then, if it's not what he had in his mind, he can't understand what went wrong.  \"When he goes to bed he might have to touch the curtain a specific number of times and then similarly flick the light switch, climb the stairs in a particular way, ask if the cats are in their room, check the hall light is on and that the door is open at precisely the angle he wants. And he might make these checks 20 times.         \"If he's worried he's done them wrongly, he'll have to get up and start again. And he's very literal. ...  She refuses to ask \"Why Harry?\", saying: \"I could tear my hair out every night wondering why. There is no autism in either family and Harry did not have the MMR jab because I knew there was controversy over potential links to autism, which is ironic, really, given that he has it anyway.      \"What I do know is that the number of children with it are creeping up every year. Whether that's because the incidence is rising or because we have better diagnostic tools I don't know. But I do know we have to deal with it and I hope I am now sufficiently informed to help.   \"I don't want to betray Harry but it's only a matter of time before someone asks about my connection to autism and I have to tell them I have been gifted an autistic son and that I feel blessed to be his mum.\" ... \"I want people to understand that  autism doesn't mean a lesser life, just a different one.     \"I want people to know just how wonderful these very special children are and how much joy and love they bring to the lives of those lucky enough to know them.\"  (My emphasis.)

{"date": "27 Oct 2007", "body": "\nDuncan enjoys the PC game Dogz 4. He has adopted, named and changed the appearance of loads of virtual dogs. I have to 'cull' a few every week or so. Among the names he's chosen are, John (a dalmatian he's turned pink, and who wears a top hat and glasses) a pig called Michael (who wears what looks like pink pyjamas), a dachshund called Duplo Train (he's red, blue and yellow), another called Sky Rider (another mixture of primary colours) and a poodle called 'jymp pynis'. That last one recalls one of his current favourite words. Yesterday he was playing on YouTube. I found him a lovely film of the story, ' Where the Wild Things Are ' which he and Thomas watched many times. Then he found some videos of Dogz 4 pets, including one of puppies. He's decided he wants his dogs to make puppies, so we're trying to make the John and Jane dogs fall in love! Google is his friend. He uses the toolbar, and types as few letters as possible, then scans the suggested search words, to find the one he wants. It's helping him learn to read and spell. Sometimes he doesn't spell things quite right, but it's always a very good effort, 'cheez and unyin crisps' isn't too far wrong! He can now decode really well when we read together. And I find it interesting, that after he works out the words bit by bit, he re-reads the whole sentence so it is smooth and makes sense. It's also clear that reading is and will continue to help his spoken language. Often he works out a word and seems to realise for the first time, 'oh  that's  how it's said' when he can see all the letters that he just wasn't able to hear somehow. Today I dropped Lady and Thomas off at their jujitsu class and took Duncan with me to an enormous hardware shop. I had to buy a mousetrap. (I'd been reading in bed the night before when a little mammal intruder scuttled out from under my wardrobe door, then in again. There wasn't much I could do at the time except block up gap to try to contain it.) I choose a live trap thing so if it works, we'll have to release it away from the house. Duncan was fine, and had fun with some singing and dancing Christmas stuff, and a Jack in the Box (well teddy in a box really) which made him shriek with delight. When I'd sorted the purchases, he insisted in leaving the shop the way we'd entered, even though there are separate entrance and exit doors. I realised that he always does this now. When we're in the supermarket, we have to push the trolley back through the shop, instead of along the back of the checkouts. It's a funny little thing to need to do. But it's easy enough to manage. I hope he won't feel the need to leave the way he came in if we ever visit the new Ikea when it opens!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://youtube.com/watch?v=LDnwkUt2VrQ"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/all-creatures-virtual-and-small.html", "title": "\nAll creatures virtual and small\n"},

{"date": "18 Oct 2007", "body": "\nWe went with my brother and his girlfriend to a Thai restaurant on Friday night and had a lovely meal and loads of crack too. On Saturday, we all accompanied the boys to a once-a-month club for children with disabilities, run by the  Barnardo's  charity. While I was talking to the project leader and watching Duncan settle in, one of the staff came up and asked if we had been to Fanad in Donegal during August.  We had , and I remembered meeting her on the beach as she'd been out with her mum walking their dog. (Duncan had spotted their dog, and I had hastily gone to intervene if necessary. Duncan had been alternately running up to the dog, then squealing and running away. The dog was a bit spooked, she was quite a nervous animal. I had helped Duncan to calmly stoke her before he went off. I explained about Duncan's autism and the woman had said she works with autistic children, and she'd guessed he was.) It transpires that this same woman is an occupational therapist trainee, and works in this play club. She recognised Duncan as soon as we came in. It's quite a coincidence, Fanad isn't exactly a bustling metropolis! After the boys had settled in (Thomas was staying to play too) Gordon, Lady and me had an hour to spend together. I can't remember the last time we did this. Frequently each of the children spends time with either Gordon or myself, but not with both of us. I was reminded of the few times my mum and dad took me out for a meal on my own, when I was 14 or so, and how special I felt to have them to myself! The boys had fun and made cakes of chocolate, marshmallow, biscuits and golden syrup. Duncan, obviously, enjoyed this activity a lot! We didn't want to go home straight away, since we were having such a nice day. So we picked up some chips for lunch, then decided to take the train into Belfast. We dootered round the shops for a while, bought a few more sweets (have to keep the sugar levels up) and went home. Gordon and I were amazed at how well Duncan did. He held our hand, and enjoyed the trip out. On Tuesday I took the children swimming, and like last time, it was a great success. Lady can already swim quite well, though she's never had any lessons. I will take her alone a few times to help her improve her style. Thomas was like an eel; jumping in and diving under. He managed to propel himself forward by a few metres. He has taken some big steps out into the world lately. He's definitely not the baby of the house any more. Yesterday Gordon took a day off work and I convinced him that a family day out to the aquarium would be nice. It was too. The drive down along Strangford Lough is just so beautiful, especially on a sunny autumn day like yesterday. As expected the aquarium was very quiet, and Gordon spend a happy few hours discussing genetic diversity with Lady and a (not too interested) Thomas, while I took care of Duncan. The last time Gordon went there, the place was packed as the school were out, and it was all a bit stressful. These trips out together are very important. Duncan is slowly becoming calmer and more manageable. He still sees things he wants to have, but we can now negotiate better about what is and isn't acceptable. He's continuing to develop, and we can really foresee how he will continue to do so as he gets older, just like all children, though on his own trajectory. It's also important to have the public get more used to seeing a non-typical child out with his family and having a good time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.barnardos.org.uk/northernireland.htm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/trajectories.html", "title": "\nTrajectories\n"},
{"date": "12 Oct 2007", "body": "\nWe all headed off to one of our favourite places yesterday, W5, named for the 1st 5 'W' words in the post title. As Thomas announced, 'all the things here were invented by scientists.'  We met with a few other HE families and had a fantastic day out. There's so much to investigate and the children all love it. They have an area where you can record a weather report in front of a blue screen. You choose your background; either a TV studio or on-location footage of a hurricane or a volcano. There's a TV camera at the front and an auto-cue of the script. Lady enjoyed hamming it up, reading the script and pretending to be blown all over the place during a hurricane. Duncan joined her, watching himself on the monitor and jumping around the place for the camera. They then watched the recording on the big screen. Duncan enjoyed a few repeat performances then went on to something else. But later in the afternoon, while the other children were watching one of the demonstrations, Duncan took me back the the camera, and spent 45 minutes filming himself and watching the footage. He pulled a stool over to stand on, then he'd wait until after the count down to announce recording, then  he'd say, 'Look at this!' then '3, 2, 1, WOW!' as he jumped off the stool into the air. He also did a fair bit of dancing, chattered about stuff I couldn't make out, apart from 'Tots TV' and sang a bit of the 'Duncan song'. At one stage, he stood on the stool and pulled his trousers down a wee bit at the front, getting ready to wave his little bits about (to avoid using language that attracts creepy Google hits). This area of his anatomy has always held great fascination, but he's lately begun to  talk  about it so much more! Needless to say, I didn't want that on camera! I told him, in a matter of fact way, to keep his trousers up. Though the child is so skinny, that even with a belt on, his trousers are often lying a bit low! Duncan and I also spent ages on the huge model of a cargo ship and crane. The crane was fitted with an electro-magnet and could be moved in 3 dimensions, to lift metal 'crates' onto the ship. He quickly figured out how to control it. Another favourite were the story cubes. These have a selection of pictures of a cartoon man or  woman doing things like laughing, looking grumpy, talking on the phone, opening a door or blowing kisses. There are a few cubes showing various objects too. Duncan arranged the cubes, choosing which face to display and in which order, in a slot. Then he pressed the start button and the cubes were 'read' to produce a little animation on the screen. He made loads of little films. He particularly liked making the characters talk on the phone and then slip on a banana skin, before looking grumpy, then he'd have the man give the woman a present. That too took a lot of concentration. While I was minding Duncan, Thomas and Lady hung out with  my friend D. and her boys . They watched the displays and Lady helped out with 2 demonstrations. She told me she 'was Jupiter', and later, she had to wear safety goggles ('like Gabriella in  High School Musical ') for an experiment involving vinegar and sodium bicarbonate. The day ended with everyone in the Start area, which is aimed at younger children. Duncan played with the wooden trains, and I had a (plastic) meal prepared for me by my friend's 2 year old. We have been going to W5 for a few years now. I remember the first time we went. I took the 3 children and met up with the other home-educating families, whom I didn't know so well then obviously. I don't know exactly what happened, except that I was very stressed and harried, Duncan was running all over and having a very hard time, and I dragged all the children back to the car after after a short time, where I sat in tears of frustration for a while. How different yesterday was! I still need to stay right by Duncan, and I'm lucky that Lady and Thomas are so well behaved that they will stay with D. and not cause her much extra effort. But I have never seen Duncan slow down and concentrate for such long periods on all the exhibits. It was wonderful, even if I was knackered by the time we got home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.notsheep.net/2007/10/11/newton-inertia-pressure-planets-eggs-and-busesand-more/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/who-what-where-when-why-and-wow.html", "title": "\nWho, what, where, when, why and WOW!\n"},

{"date": "15 Oct 2007", "body": "\nLast year we heard about what had been done to a little girl in the US. She was known as Ashley X, and she had been subjected to numerous extreme surgical and medical procedures. Many of us  wrote  about our  horror  at what had happened. Now  I read about  a 15 year old English girl with cerebral palsy, called Katie Thorpe. Her mother, Alison, wants her to have a hysterectomy and explains why in the  Times ; \u201cWe already have to do everyday things for Katie that most people do for themselves,\u201d said Thorpe. \u201cKatie has an undignified enough life without the added indignity of menstruation. She will not understand what is happening to her body and it could be very frightening for her.   \u201cKatie would be totally confused by menstruation. She could not manage it by herself.   She could not keep it discreet, she cannot be private. What we need to do for Katie already is undignified enough.\u201d I think this is important; the reasons stated here do not in any way, justify a major surgical procedure, with a long recovery time, and life long after effects. I really fail to see why menstruation is considered such an indignity. In practical terms, it would be a few mls of blood once a month or so, added to the pad Katie already must wear. It's evident from the numerous newspaper and TV interviews given my Alison Thorpe, many of which show photographs of Katie, that Katie has not started her periods yet, and there is no mention of a medical problem that would call for hysterectomy as a treatment. There is no reason to suspect that she  will  have painful periods, or if she has, that painkillers would not help. There are also other, much less radical and invasive approaches available in the event that Katie does has extremely painful periods. I don't think that any doctor would be wiling to perform this procedure when it appears to be medically unnecessary. At least I hope not. There have been several references in the media to Katie's 'mental age', stated as  18 months  in some articles,  6 months  in another and  3 months  in another. The Mail journalist writes; She has no need for a womb. People would be horrified at the thought of a baby menstruating, but that is what Katie is. All she will know is further discomfort and confusion. Whatever her cognitive functioning is,  she is not a baby , she is a teenage girl. She has a right to bodily integrity, just like any other teenage girl according to the  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , Article 17 - Protecting the integrity of the person Every person with disabilities has a right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others. From what I have read, most people giving their opinion, think that Katie's mother should have  the right to decide . As a home-educator, I want minimal interference from the state in my duties to raise and educate my children, in accordance with the law and my personal philosophy. Parents have the right to make judgments for their children, and the state must presume that parents know best. It's an 'innocent until proven guilty' thing. However, when it is clear that a parent is not doing the right thing, like failing or neglecting their child, then the state has a duty to step in and make inquires and if warranted, take action. Likewise, if a parent decides that they want their child to have a totally unnecessary surgery, the state has a duty to that child, not to give the parent authority to allow it to happen. That the child is disabled should be irrelevant. Parents sometimes are wrong no matter how much they love their child.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://disstud.blogspot.com/2007/10/we-do-know-better.html", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article2604771.ece", "http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23415544-details/Why+I+want+surgeons+to+remove+my+disabled+daughter%27s+womb/article.do", "http://society.guardian.co.uk/socialcare/story/0,,2190233,00.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=487155&in_page_id=1879&in_a_source=", "http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=487155&in_page_id=1879&in_a_source="], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/katie-thorpe.html", "title": "\nKatie Thorpe\n"},

{"date": "12 Oct 2007", "body": "\nIsn't it funny how you almost always hear, in any discussions from proponents of various therapies for which no evidence of effectiveness exists, that the 'allopathic' practitioners, or big-pharma or the establishment, are suppressing the truth, trying to gag them, deluding the people. Well, here's evidence of exactly this sort of thing, only it isn't big-pharma doing the suppression, it's the Society of Homeopaths. They have threatened the writer of the Quackometer blog, with legal action, if he didn't remove  a post critical of them . Actually, they didn't even approach the writer, but complained to his ISP with lawyers letters, though it's not known what exactly they object to in the post. This isn't what I write about, there are many great bloggers tackling bad science stories, but this is just disgusting, and like many others, who intend to high-light the heavy handed antics of the SoH, I wanted to link to the story, and copy the post here. It's currently available on  Google cache . There's more about the whole incident on  David Colquhoun's  blog. (I managed to name check Gordon's favourite lecturer in a post!) Here's the post from  The Quackometer ; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Society of Homeopaths (SoH) are a shambles and a bad joke. It is now over a year since  Sense about Science , Simon Singh and the  BBC Newsnight  programme exposed how it is common practice for high street homeopaths to tell customers that their magic pills can prevent malaria. The Society of Homeopaths have done diddly-squat to stamp out this dangerous practice apart from issue a few ambiguously weasel-worded press statements. The SoH has a code of practice, but my feeling is that this is just a smokescreen and is widely flouted and that the Society do not care about this. If this is true, then the code of practice is nothing more than a thin veneer used to give authority and credibility to its deluded members. It does nothing more than fool the public into thinking they are dealing with a regulated professional. As a quick test, I picked a random homeopath with a web site from the SoH register to see if they flouted a couple of important rules: 48 \u2022 Advertising shall not contain claims of superiority. \u2022 No advertising may be used which expressly or implicitly claims to cure named diseases. 72 To avoid making claims (whether explicit or implied; orally or in writing) implying cure of any named disease. The homeopath I picked on is called Julia Wilson and runs a practice from the Leicestershire town of Market Harborough. What I found rather shocked and angered me. Straight away, we find that  Julia M Wilson LCHE, RSHom  specialises in asthma and works at a  clinic  that says, Many illnesses and disease can be successfully treated using homeopathy, including arthritis, asthma, digestive disorders, emotional and behavioural difficulties, headaches, infertility, skin and sleep problems. Well, there are a number of named diseases there to start off. She also gives a  leaflet  that advertises her asthma clinic. The advertising leaflet says, Conventional medicine is at a loss when it comes to understanding the origin of allergies. \u2026 The best that medical research can do is try to keep the symptoms under control. Homeopathy is different, it seeks to address the triggers for asthma and eczema. It is a safe, drug free approach that helps alleviate the flaring of skin and tightening of lungs\u2026 Now, despite the usual homeopathic contradiction of claiming to treat causes not symptoms and then in the next breath saying it can alleviate symptoms, the advert is clearly in breach of the above rule 47 on advertising as it implicitly claims superiority over real medicine and names a disease. Asthma is  estimated  to be responsible for 1,500 deaths and 74,000 emergency hospital admissions in the UK each year. It is not a trivial illness that sugar pills ought to be anywhere near. The  Cochrane Review  says the following about the evidence for asthma and homeopathy, The review of trials found that the type of homeopathy varied between the studies, that the study designs used in the trials were varied and that no strong evidence existed that usual forms of homeopathy for asthma are effective. This is not a surprise given that homeopathy is just a ritualised placebo. Hopefully, most parents attending this clinic will have the good sense to go to a real accident and emergency unit in the event of a severe attack and consult their GP about real management of the illness. I would hope that Julia does little harm here. However, a little more research on her site reveals much more serious concerns. She says on her site that \u2019she worked in Kenya teaching homeopathy at a college in Nairobi and supporting graduates to set up their own clinics\u2019. Now, we  have seen  what homeopaths do in Kenya before. It is not treating a little stress and the odd headache. Free from strong UK legislation, these missionary homeopaths make the boldest claims about the deadliest diseases. A bit of web research shows where Julia was working (picture above). The  Abha Light Foundation  is a registered NGO in Kenya. It takes mobile homeopathy clinics through the slums of Nairobi and surrounding villages. Its stated aim is to, introduce Homeopathy and natural medicines as a method of managing HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in Kenya. I must admit, I had to pause for breath after reading that. The clinic sells its own homeopathic remedies for \u2018treating\u2019 various lethal diseases. Its  MalariaX  potion, is a homeopathic preparation for prevention of malaria and treatment of malaria. Suitable for children. For prevention. Only 1 pill each week before entering, during and after leaving malaria risk areas. For treatment. Take 1 pill every 1-3 hours during a malaria attack. This is nothing short of being totally outrageous. It is a murderous delusion. David Colquhoun has been writing about this  wicked scam  recently and it is well worth following his blog on the issue. Let\u2019s remind ourselves what one of the most senior and respected homeopaths in the UK, Dr Peter Fisher of the London Homeopathic Hospital, has to say on this matter. there is absolutely no reason to think that homeopathy works to prevent malaria and you won\u2019t find that in any textbook or journal of homeopathy so people will get malaria, people may even die of malaria if they follow this advice. Malaria is a huge killer in Kenya. It is the biggest killer of children under five. The problem is so huge that the reintroduction of DDT is considered as a proven way of reducing deaths. Magic sugar pills and water drops will do nothing. Many of the poorest in Kenya cannot afford real anti-malaria medicine, but offering them insane nonsense as a substitute will not help anyone. Ironically, the WHO has issued a  press release  today on cheap ways of reducing child and adult mortality due to malaria. Their trials, conducted in Kenya, of using cheap mosquito nets soaked in insecticide have reduced child deaths by 44% over two years. It says that issuing these nets be the \u2018immediate priority\u2019 to governments with a malaria problem. No mention of homeopathy. These results were arrived at by careful trials and observation. Science. We now know that nets work. A lifesaving net costs $5. A bottle of useless homeopathic  crap  costs $4.50. Both are large amounts for a poor Kenyan, but is their life really worth the 50c saving? I am sure we are going to hear the usual homeopath bleat that this is just a campaign by Big Pharma to discredit unpatentable homeopathic remedies. Are we to add to the conspiracy Big Net manufacturers too? It amazes me that to add to all the list of ills and injustices that our rich nations impose on the poor of the world, we have to add the widespread export of our bourgeois and lethal healing fantasies. To make a strong point: if we can introduce laws that allow the arrest of sex tourists on their return to the UK, can we not charge people who travel to Africa to indulge their dangerous healing delusions? At the very least, we could expect the Society of Homeopaths to try to stamp out this wicked practice?

{"date": "9 Oct 2007", "body": "\nOn Saturday morning, I was lying in bed half listening to the Today programme on BBC Radio when someone called Catherine Pepinster came on to give her  Thought for the day . This is a short daily slot in the middle of a popular news and current affairs show, which is described by the BBC as, 'reflections from a faith perspective on issues and people in the news.' I have listened to it hundreds of times, usually unwittingly. It is often bland, preachy, irrelevant and occasionally, yep, thought provoking. On Saturday the subject was;  Can reciprocal altruism really explain the most extraordinary sacrifices that some people make? It included the following lines, available here in the  transcript ; Yet can reciprocal altruism really explain the most extraordinary sacrifices that some people make? Can genes really explain the price paid by Fr Maximilian Kolbe who volunteered to die in the place of a stranger at Auschwitz. I suspect he was more driven by Christ's admonition that we love our enemies, do good, and expect nothing in return. From time to time one comes across an example of altruism, of sheer goodness that no biologist could ever explain. Let me give you an example. A friend of mine took a year out of his own life to accompany a man suffering from a terrible degenerative disease on a tour of America. For 12 long months Joe drove Billy across the United States in a car specially adapted for his wheelchair, caring for him, helping to wash and feed him. He had no reason to do it other than a sense of fellowship. Joe won't be embarrassed by me mentioning this; he died suddenly this week, 10 months after Bruce's own death. Joe's story illuminates that being truly human takes far more than being a biological construct. Words don't always stretch far enough to explain it. A Christian might say it reveals the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. But all of us would agree that it is love. I woke up slightly more as I heard these words, and my response was a bit sweary. This woman, had just compared a man sacrificing his life for a stranger in a Nazi death camp, to her friend's decision to travel around the US for a year while working as staff to a disabled person?! Am I missing something? Look at the language used, her friend 'took a year  out of his own life  to accompany a man suffering from a terrible degenerative disease'. How did he take this year from his own life? Was he in a coma? No, he was working, possibly for low pay, or perhaps even just for expenses, and getting the chance to travel around America, presumably seeing the sights and staying in nice places. All this, for '12 long months'. Were they travelling extremely fast in that 'car specially adapted for his wheelchair', and perhaps experiencing some time dilation? 'He had no reason to do it other than a sense of fellowship.' Was he forced to take the job? Did he not enjoy it? Was there really no other reason than a 'sense of fellowship'? Perhaps Joe too wanted to travel around the US and this provided a good opportunity. Perhaps Joe and Billy got on really well and had an absolute blast on their road trip, no matter that one of them required services from the other. I hope so. It's terribly sad that both these young men died so soon after each other, one's death being presumably sudden and unexpected. But it's sad that the people left behind are interpreting that time as a terrible waste of a year in his life. What  should  he have been doing instead? Loads of us are caring for a disabled person. That's not a 'most extraordinary sacrifice', it's just life. And especially when a person's  job  is to care for another, that's just work. It's good and worthwhile work, not well enough paid, and from what I hear, there are some excellent staff out there supporting and enabling their clients.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/thought/week.shtml", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/thought/documents/t20071006.shtml"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/thought-for-day.html", "title": "\nThought for the day\n"},

{"date": "5 Oct 2007", "body": "\nThe home-educating family who live round the corner visited yesterday for a few hours. The little 4 year old girl was frightened by Duncan. He got grumpy a few times for various reasons; he was frustrated that he couldn't tie a rope round his big toy car, or he was upset when Thomas got cross with him over a different toy. In his grump, he pushed at me, and hit out at me in front of the visiting children. He also was shouting. Then he pushed the other mum a bit. She wasn't hurt or annoyed. I told him not to push, it hurts. But the little girl was upset and said she didn't like this place. Duncan's outburst was over fast, as it always is. I tried to explain to the girl, but it's hard to know what to say to a child you don't know well. I told her that Duncan can't talk as well as other children, that some things are difficult for him, he's trying hard to learn how to behave properly and I have to keep helping him. I told her that he's not a bad boy even though he does the wrong things sometimes. I don't want her to be frightened. And I know Duncan is trying his best all the time and just hasn't developed the skills to deal with his frustrations in a more appropriate manner. In fact when they arrived, Duncan was happy and went to hug them all and rubbed them all on the head in a show of affection. Her mum was right beside her and no doubt would have taken her home if that's what she really wanted. I think I'll have to talk with the mum about this.  But it just feels like we're all too wound up in this family these past few days. Lady and Thomas have spent loads of time playing together as they always do, but they've been fighting too, getting angry and loud. Duncan just seems to the barometer or the house. If anyone is upset or cross, it affects him and makes him far more likely to have an outburst. He's been more physically rough over the past few days, and it's all because of the atmosphere. If one of the others gets cross with him, he's likely to come straight to me and angrily squeeze my arm or punch at me. It's like he stores the worst of his anger to let off with/at me. Perhaps he feels more secure with me than the others. It's hard to know. What I do know, is we all have to try to reduce the grumps we're  all  having, lower the volume a bit, chill out and enjoy each other. It may sound from this that the past few days have been all bad. Really, we have had loads of fun, it's just that the fuses seem shorter. We're going to visit some other friends now. We've know them for a while and they are well used to all of us and our little ways.

{"date": "28 Sep 2007", "body": "\nDonna Williams  commented  on a recent post, not the post  I wrote about her lecture , but the one in which  I discussed the NI based P2P  autism organisation. I have too much to say back to put it in the comments, so I've written a new post. Donna said; Just for the record, my own position is moderate. I have seen neurologists, immunologists, pharmacologists, pathologists in the treatment of my gut, immune and metabolic disorders which showed signs since I was 6 mths old (was dx'd as a psychotic infant at 2 years old in 1965, tested for deafness into late childhood and formally dx'd as autistic in the 90s). I am VERY AWARE that the PUB MED info is that 20% of children diagnosed with autism have primary immune deficieincy - ie see the Gupta studies (hence 80% do not) and that 20 year studies - Rosemary Waring - have found 60% are salicylate intolerant (therefore 40% not) and 80% can't digest casein and gluten - Paul Shattock (so 20% can). In each case, the authors have shown irrefutably, that for  all  autistic children, 20% have primary immune deficiency, 60% are salicylate intolerant and a massive 80%  can't digest  casein and gluten?! And these have all been verified and reproduced by other studies? And what hypotheses have they presented to account for these manifestations in the physiology of autistic children? I have read the 'undigested peptides, leaky gut and opiates in the brain' hypothesis, but have never read of any evidence to prove this. Here's a few references wrt autism and GF/CF diets that I just found. They do not show clear evidence of benefits, excepting one which claims that the diet reduced 'autistic traits', whatever that means: Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2004;(2):CD003498 The one trial included reported results on four outcomes. Unsurprisingly in such a small-scale study, the results for three of these outcomes (cognitive skills, linguistic ability and motor ability) had wide confidence intervals that spanned the line of nil effect. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autistic traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. Pediatr Nurs. 2007 Mar-Apr;33(2):138-43 To date, there is little empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of dietary restrictions in treating child psychiatric disorders, in particular, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). J Autism Dev Disord. 2006 Apr;36(3):413-20 This study tested the efficacy of a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet in treating autism using a randomized, double blind repeated measures crossover design. The sample included 15 children aged 2-16 years with autism spectrum disorder. Group data indicated no statistically significant findings. J Dev Behav Pediatr. 2006 Apr;27(2 Suppl):S162-71. The purpose of this review is to examine the available trials of gluten/casein diets in children with ASDs regarding the strength of their findings and also concerning points that may be useful in the design of future studies.Seven trials of these diets in ASD are critically reviewed; 6 of these were uncontrolled trials and 1 used a single-blind design. All reported efficacy in reducing some autism symptoms, and 2 groups of investigators also reported improvement in nonverbal cognition. Design flaws in all of the studies weaken the confidence that can be placed in their findings. I don't doubt that some autistic people are  intolerant  to wheat and/or milk products. This is common among many people, autistic or not. Clearly people will feel better on a diet excluding foods that make them ill. It's a good idea to get a dietitian's advice before trying diets such as these, especially with young children who can't verbalise how they're feeling. And notice, I said dietitian, not nutropath. DW: I happen to be someone whose language processing was helped significantly by biomed interventions at age 9 (zinc, C, multivitamin-minerals) and jumped from 10% to 50% - enough to eventually develop functional speech (previously fitting Semantic Pragmatic Language Disorder) then up to 70% with the use of Glutamine in my 30s. I'm also very aware of the use of omega 3s in ADHD and Childhood bipolar (also in Pub Med) which are co-morbid conditions which can complicate SOME children's autism. I'm happy that you feel better on the supplements you mention. However, this doesn't mean that they are necessary for or will benefit others. The evidence of Omega 3's efficacy isn't as clear cut as the mainstream media would have us believe. Would you consider making it more explicit in your lecture, that you are not a scientist, and that just because these measures worked for you, it doesn't mean they will for others, and that a doctor's advice should be taken? DW: I do not support extremist chelation programs but as the SENSIBLE use of minerals in the management of gut, immune and metabolic disorders is low key chelation, I am on that and have been for decades. I'm happy to hear this, and I have never written anywhere that you do support chelation. DW: I have talked for groups on both sides of the culture-cure divide and will speak for any group I agree or disagree with if my information will help their audiences. As an autism consultant with over 12 years experience I'm VERY aware that biomed is NOT the answer for all people on the spectrum and that done in the extreme, long term and with no qualified medical supervision can be dangerous. As a consultant the approaches and strategies I suggest are environmental and biomed is only suggested if the family feel there are clear indicators that physiological disorders may be present and potentially contributing to neurological issues as PART of their child's autism. I hope this clarifies that in a black and white world, I live firmly in the grey. I very much enjoyed your talk. I do think that your preaching of the biomed gospel, as a highly respected, much published and renowned autistic woman, may be used as evidence of your support for their views of autism as something to be defeated, something where the problems lie mostly within the autistic child, and that changing them is the most important aspect to ensuring they make the most of life. I think that your message of respect, understanding, accommodation and acceptance is diminished by this. I would have loved to have heard you  mention  during your lecture that you are 'VERY aware that biomed is NOT the answer for all people on the spectrum and that done in the extreme, long term and with no qualified medical supervision can be dangerous.' I don't think that it is black and white for most people. Many of us use some type of biomedical approach. My own son used to take an iron supplement, as blood tests demonstrated he needed it. That sometimes left him a bit constipated, so I'd gave him a few spoonfuls of laxative now and then. He's also taken a multi-vitamin regularly, as his diet isn't as varied as I'd like and I can't be sure he's getting all the nutrients he needs. So, we fall into the light grey region according to your analogy. DW: As for GPs, many are great and have certainly helped me, but mostly they've helped with referrals to specialists. I do hear, however, of some GPs who don't help parents get referrals and fob off health issues as 'part of the autism' whilst being closed minded as to whether treatment of these things may reduce one's degree of autism. My personal experience is that GPs have been good about referring me to specialists when there are physiological issues they haven't been able to manage. Perhaps I'm lucky. I'm pleased that you have had good experiences with your doctors. I have too. Many of the biomedical approach advocates, often talk about how their doctor doesn't know, care or understand anything about autism, and they have to go to the DAN! practitioners before they're taken seriously. I don't see this myself. Like you said, there are some doctors who are rude or ill informed, and who, as you say, try to blame medical issues a child may have, on their autism. I think that those clamouring about the huge percentages of people who have medical issues because they're autistic, may have contributed to this view among some doctors. The DAN! folk like to imply that there's this vast conspiracy and the mainstream docs are keeping the 'truth' away from the parents.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15106205&ordinalpos=8&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17542236&ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16555138&ordinalpos=4&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16685183&ordinalpos=5&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/donna-williams-comments.html", "title": "\nDonna Williams comments\n"},
{"date": "28 Sep 2007", "body": "\nWednesdays are busy days. Thomas has a gymnastics class at 3.15, Lady has gymnastics at 4.15, the boys have an art class at 4.30 and Lady has Brownies at 6.30. Thomas has also just started Jujitsu on Saturdays with Lady. He really loved his fist class. He always gets stuck in at these things and really tries so hard. At home, the children have been playing and learning. I had a look through Lady's Brownie badge book to see what badges she might go for. It seems like she already knows enough to get most of them, or already can do the activities for the practical ones. It was quite reassuring to see, that she has picked up so much knowledge and skills. Thomas was recently reading a story with me on the  Starfall  site. Duncan came and sat behind me watching and listening. Each time we went to a new page, Duncan would read it, really quietly to himself. Thomas took a lot longer to decipher the words. Duncan seemed to find it easier to read, when I wasn't focusing on him. So I just kept on with the activities, and he kept getting everything right. He actually knew a lot more than I thought. He has been playing at these sorts of sites by himself, especially the Starfall site. I can often hear him repeating the words after the narrator. Yesterday, I overheard him practising how to say 'Jacques Offenbach'. It's really good for self-directed learning; the type he's best at. Thomas has been asking lots of questions about numbers recently. He keeps doing sums in his head. He'll come up to me and say, 'I know what 7 plus 7 is; 14.' I taught him how to do more sums, by 'putting the number in his head' and then counting on using his fingers. He picked it up right away. I can really see how just learning these things as they come up naturally works. I didn't have to sit down with a workbook and tell him, 'today you're going to learn to add'. Lady spent ages on these things at school, and we still had to re-do them when she started to learn at home. Another thing we've all played at recently, is making little films with our photos and music. I was inspired to make one about Duncan when I was sent a link to a beautiful song on a comment  here . Duncan loved the film about him and decided to make one of his own. It was a very serious undertaking. He decided what photos to use, the order the should go in, what to write on the titles and what effects to use. He's very happy with the finished product. Of course, Lady and Thomas wanted to make films about themselves too, so they each helped me make a couple more funny films. We've also had many pleasant, dry days and been able to play in the garden or the park. The children were feeling so sorry fr their schooled friends as they collected conkers and went on the swings and roundabouts on a sunny autumn morning. A couple of days ago, a woman who has just started out with home-education, contacted our local  support group. I mailed her back and after a few messages, we discovered that she lives just round the corner from me! So yesterday she visited us with her 2 young daughters and baby son and we all had such a nice time. Home-educating neighbours, how lovely!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.starfall.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/happy-days_28.html", "title": "\nHappy Days\n"},
{"date": "1 Oct 2007", "body": "\nThomas and Lady headed off to their jujitsu class on Saturday with my dad. Duncan and I picked them up when it ended. Duncan was attired in his over-sized  'Duplo train' T-shirt , Gordon's sunglasses, a top hat and carrying an umbrella. He looked very dapper. He'd not wanted to wear any trousers under the T-shirt, but I'd managed to persuade him that he'd feel too cold without them. On arrival at the leisure centre, I saw a sign advertising an American model railway exhibition. Well, we had to check that out. We piled into the hall, and it was like a dream come true to a train fan like Duncan. There were maybe 10 different model railways, all very elaborate and detailed. Loads of engines, track and carriages were on sale also. These were mostly the Hornby type; proper model stock, and costly too. Duncan managed to find a small Ziploc bag of Thomas the Tank stuff, little mini trains each only a couple of cm long. I bought them, but not the Percy engine he found later, which cost \u00a330! He had a bit of a tantrum at that, but it didn't last and we got back to watching the trains soon enough. We all enjoyed the trains and Duncan was very good about keeping his hands off, more so than the  last time we'd seen a model railway display . I did keep reminding him to just look, use his eyes, keep hands off. About 3 times, a little hand darted out to gently touch an engine or a minuscule sheep, but he knew he wasn't supposed to really. Lady and Thomas enjoyed the displays too. They stuck together while I stayed close to Duncan. Duncan got lots of compliments on his hat. He did stand out! It seemed to be older men who were running the railways, and there were little groups proudly presenting their latest acquisitions. Then there was this oddly dressed little boy, his face shining with delight, following a particular engine round the track, his face level with the engine, his eyes squinting a bit (to see more detail, I think) and squirming past them to stay with his favoured engine. I apologised a few times when he bumped someone a bit, but they weren't bothered. They said it was nice to see children enjoying it all. One fellow was so kind. He let Duncan come in behind and sit on his high stool and press a few buttons, flip the switches and turn the dials. Oh how Duncan loved that! We went to an adjoining room for a drink and snack, and Duncan brought out his bag of engines and started playing with them on the floor. A boy came up and started talking to him about them. Duncan ignored him so the boy spoke to me instead. He told me how he loves Thomas trains even though he is 10. He also told me about all his other trains in great detail, and about his sister and many other things beside, and asked me lots of questions. He was such a sweetheart. As we went out, I said goodbye and told him I'd enjoyed our conversation. His mum and I smiled at each other. We knew our boys had something in common.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/model-railway.html", "title": "\nModel Railway\n"},
{"date": "6 Oct 2007", "body": "\n I bought a cuckoo clock yesterday. Duncan has had a thing about them for a while, ever since he saw my aunt's clock during a visit to her house. I have drawn loads of clocks, and he has Googled and YouTubed. His  current favourite YouTube film  is about a quilt-shop cuckoo clock. It's so funny watching him watching this film. It's not what most 7 year old boys would enjoy! When we headed out in the car last week, he directed me to take him to the  Black Forest ! Sadly, it's not quite in the neighbourhood. He drew a lovely cuckoo clock picture on cardboard and I helped him to cut it out and make a 3D model clock, with doors and a bird inside. In his Wednesday art class, they were making things from  Fimo  and Duncan opted to make a little bird for his cardboard cuckoo clock. Thomas made a green snail and a badge for Gordon. Anyway, I saw that they had cheap-ish clocks for sale at Argos, so yesterday I thought I'd get one. The children all came to the shop with me. Duncan was oh so excited. He was bouncing up and down and laughing and saying, 'Duncan get a cuckoo clock!' We took our new precious time-piece back to the car where I had to open the box immediately so we could all get a look. Duncan was just bursting with happiness. He cradled the clock on his lap as I drove to the next part of our day's activities, the swimming pool. Now Lady and Thomas have been wanting to go swimming for ages and I kept letting them down. So we finally decided to go during the day instead of in the evening. It should be obvious right, we're home-educating and all! But I'd been a bit concerned about looking after the 2 boys alone in the pool. The last few times we'd been, Thomas was really nervous and either clung to me or stayed really close, and was shivering soon after getting in, perhaps because he wasn't moving about enough to keep warm. Also, whenever I'd said to Duncan about going he became distressed and cried, 'no go to swimming pool!' Eventually I realised what was troubling him, and I said, 'Duncan go to the swimming pool,  not  go in the shower, just in the pool.' Then he agreed to go. So we left the clock, with the bird carefully set out of the doors, and went to the leisure centre. It was fabulous. There were few other people there. I'd called up in advance and discovered that if we arrived between 12 and 1.15, there wouldn't be any school groups there. So we got ready in a family changing room and entered the water. I was astonished at Thomas. He put on his goggles, and he was off! He was jumping in and diving under and swimming a metre or 2 and had no fear at all! I don't know what had happened! Duncan loved it too. he mostly stayed in the shallow area by the steps and just splashed about and jumped and laughed. Lady did her usual crazy mermaid thing; she just loves the water. We will  definitely  make this a weekly thing. Afterwards we had chip-shop chips, the best kind, and went to visit some friends whom we hadn't seen for a while. While we were there, Thomas and Lady had loads of fun playing a a game called 'doggy tag' which involved running from a swing to a trampoline while trying to avoid the 'lick power' (Lady's term) of their 2 dogs. I had a lovely game with a bundle-of-gorgeousness 2 year old, in which he kept booing me. Also provided was the tea and chat I had required when I posted yesterday. Today Thomas and Lady went to Jujitsu. Thomas was so pleased to get his gee and looks ever so handsome. I'll have to post a picture as soon as I get round to buying a new charger for our digital camera :-( Lady said Thomas was really going for it at their class today, and a big boy who has a brown belt was supporting him at the wrestling bit they do at the end. Thomas told me that his Sensei's mum turned up and expresed surprise that he  had  a mum. The he thought for a bit and said, 'actually, everyone on the whole planet has a mummy.' After a bit more thought he declared, 'except Luke in the  Sarah Jane Adventures .' He's right, Luke was created from an amalgamation of the DNA from scans of the human guests to the Bane-run 'Bubbleshock' factory. So there.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RwfK03X4sYI/AAAAAAAAAIc/FqiWirnchCQ/s1600-h/clock.jpg", "http://youtube.com/watch?v=6K3LCq9rH3Y", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest", "http://www.beadmerrily.co.uk/index.php?cPath=76&gclid=CNGq8Oro-o4CFQ1EMAod-HmkvA", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sja/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/10/cuckoo.html", "title": "\nCuckoo!\n"},
{"date": "9 Jan 2008", "body": "\nNot for autism anyway. A few weeks ago I got a  comment  on a post I wrote about a year and a half ago. The post called   Novel Treatment for Autism , was about how Duncan's natural maturation coupled with parenting appropriate to his learning and living styles, were responsible for his development, as opposed to any 'treatment' or 'therapy'. The comment writer, Lynne, had a major problem with my attitude towards my son. She wrote (referring to my post);  This article cracks me up. The author ostensibly wants to give her child time to \"just play or ponder.\" Then cites how her child uses a TV/DVD player which he watches a lot. It's scary this mom is rationalizing letting her kid watch TV endlessly and then do video talk as an educational process. Wow. Yeah, I bet that is a lot more effective than those crazy moms who are trying to keep their child engaged. Be sure to forward this article to all the lazy moms so they can feel better about not taxing themselves or their child. No need to spend your time trying to teach your child, do like her and lock those internal doors to avoid unnecessary battles. Apparently no effort is the key to expanding a child's reading ability, vocabulary and even, diet. I doubt that Lynne, having been so scared and cracked up by what I had to say, will be back to see any reply I might make. It's odd how she makes the leap from what I wrote to calling me a lazy mum who makes no effort. She seems to have real issues with my son's use of TV as one of his learning tools. It's like this Lynne, and anyone who might think she's right. Duncan is a highly visual learner. TV and DVDs are great tools that optimise his individual learning style. The worst thing for Duncan would be for me (or a series of strangers) to sit across a small table from him, armed with a bag of sweets, training him to respond to a series of discrete trials in exchange for a reward. For Duncan, the rewards are intrinsic to the task. He wants to find films about cuckoo clocks, so he has to spell the words properly on YouTube, rewarding him with a fun film about the manufacture of clocks in the Black Forest of Germany, or whatever he digs that day. Duncan plays and ponders much. I came across him sitting on the floor of my bedroom this afternoon, dressed only in a pair of pants (he was playing at being Tarzan) and staring into space in a day dream with a pile of Lego spread out in front of him. Who knows what he was thinking about just then. I left him alone to his thoughts, and turned quietly away. He was standing beside me soon after helping me cook a fried egg. In the past few years Duncan has continued to develop and I stand by everything I wrote in that post. I no longer have to lock any internal doors. I can trust him not to stuff food or toys in the DVD player or to throw something at the expensive speakers. I have moved all the boys' toys into their own room so he can access whatever he wants. He no longer throws every single toy on the floor when he's playing. He can help me put them away at the end of the day too, though he doesn't like doing this! He now enjoys books and will frequently approach me with a book to read to him. His computer activities, including looking up his topics and characters of interest on YouTube and Google, his CD Roms and on-line games, together with a few short teaching sessions with myself have all helped him learn to read and write. Yesterday, he read a Hansel and Gretel story for me. It was entirely new to him, and he was able to decipher and understand almost all the words himself. His speech has come on  so  well. Repeating scripts from films and games has helped him make sense of different words and sounds. He used to try to say the lines, in a garbled, mixed up way. Once I figured out what lines he was on about, I would say them for him, slowly and clearly, giving him time to hear the components of the words and learn how to say them for himself. That, combined with lots of time spent together, playing and getting on with life, have given him many chances to hear words, for me to listen to him and to interpret and if needed show him how to pronounce things. I'm now finding that his writing, much of which is still using 'invented spelling' ie, phonetic spelling, is showing me what words he has heard wrong. When I show him correct spellings, he gets a better idea of how to say these words. His reading, writing and speech are all helping each other and are going to make communication much easier and more successful for him. He plays more complex games, enjoys being with his siblings and extended family as well as a few close friends. He has developed an individual and amazing ability for computer produced art, creating a few lovely pictures every day. All in, he is a great boy, loving and mischievous, clever and committed, with a love of learning about so many divergent topics. He makes me smile, laugh, worry, rant and proud, sort of like how all children affect their mum's. This process, is called parenting and education. There's no need for therapy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/neither-therapy-nor-treatment-required.html", "title": "\nNeither therapy nor treatment required\n"},

Yesterday we worked together to out his latest creations into a video. He picked the song 'Hawaiian Roller Coaster' from Disney's 'Lilo and Stitch' as his soundtrack.

I'm surprised that Thomas graded so soon after starting, but the sensei said he was ready. He answered all the questions correctly too! So well done to them! Duncan usually stays with his grandma while the class is on, and Gordon and I go to the gym. On Saturday Duncan made it very clear he didn't want to stay there, so we wandered the town together for an hour. It was really nice. We picked a few library books, and I was tempted to pay a visit to the event upstairs, where there was some sort of CAM fair with stands on reiki, aromatherapy, angel er, handling(?) and the like. Duncan was in his major buggy, and although there was a lift somewhere, I couldn't be bothered to look for it. I'd have loved to hear what some of them have to say for themselves though. Perhaps another time. But we made the infinitely better decision to buy some buns and trawl the charity shops looking for books, I found a couple of ancient Ladybird books in perfect condition. One is a book on costumes and clothes through the ages. It ends with a page entitled, 'present day clothing', illustrated with a 60's era family picnicing by their car, with father in a cravat and slacks, mother, ever so daring in trousers, and children, gay and comfortable in shorts and 'jeans'. We like it! Today,  The Golden Compass  film is released and I'm trying to organise things so Gordon and I can take Lady to watch it. She has been listening to the books over the past month, and loving them. I really like the trilogy, having re-read them recently in anticipation of the movie. I know I'll be disappointed when aspects of the book are omitted or changed, but it looks good on the trailer. We all worked out our D\u00e6mons from the website. The results were rather inconsistent; I was assigned a gibbon called Thalius. I am 'modest, sociable, dependable and fickle.' (Dependable  and  fickle!) Gordon was assigned a chimpanzee called Lysandra. He is  a 'leader, assertive, spontaneous, modest and inquisitive.' Lady got an ocelot called Persaon. She is 'modest, spontaneous, inquisitive, fickle and a leader.' A tiger called Onthany was chosen for Duncan. He was described as 'solitary, a leader, shy and proud.' Thomas was allotted a raccoon called Arphenia. He is 'a leader, sociable, modest, spontaneous and inquisitive.'

{"date": "21 Sep 2007", "body": "\nOn Tuesday I attended a lecture by Donna Williams. I was interested to hear what she had to say, and to see who would be attending and what other issues would arise from the event. There was to be plenty to think about. Ms Williams is a talented, energetic and engaging speaker. The lecture title was 'Autism as a Fruit Salad' and was outlined on the poster; What if Autism Spectrum Conditions are the combined developmental effect of combinations of things and not single conditions?  What if they are \u2018cluster conditions\u2019?  What if an Autism Spectrum condition is not like a piece of fruit but more like a fruit salad?  The combinations in those fruit salads might differ from person to person and, so, the best collection of approaches, treatments and adaptations would differ too.  One-size-fits-all-approaches that assume they address a single condition would be limited.  But, if we could identify the ingredients in each person\u2019s \u2018fruit salad\u2019, then we might have the basics for an individualised program based on the systems at work for that particular person. All people with an Autism Spectrum Condition have an \u2018information processing difference\u2019 to Non-Autistic people.  Commonly though, they may also have anxiety, mood or compulsive disorders and combinations of more 'Autistic\u2019 personality traits, each with their own set of natural motivations and distresses, which may run counter to non-Autistic \u2018normality\u2019 and which many non-Autistic people may find as 'odd', 'strange', 'abnormal' or alien as the non-Autistic person's world may look to the person on the Autistic Spectrum! This lecture will lay out the ingredients commonly found in those \u2018fruit salads\u2019 and the very different treatments, approaches and adaptations found useful in reducing the disability issues associated with each so that the abilities can more easily shine through. As I sat listening and watching Donna talking and gesturing, I wrote down a few points that struck me. I kept nodding, thinking, 'Yes! That's it exactly!' as she spoke about the effect of environment on autistic people and the difference versus deficit model. As the lecture progressed however, I was noting more things that I didn't agree with. First she spoke about cranial sacral therapy, saying it benefited her, which I don't doubt. She suggested it could benefit other autistic people too, and again, maybe it could. But as a technique, there's no evidence of any effectiveness and the claims made sound rather like, oh what's that word...quackery. She also mentioned all sorts of medical problems, and again either stated or implied (I can't remember) that these are common place in autistic people. She mentioned her own issues; salicylate intolerance, immune deficiency, gluten and dairy intolerance. She recommended that anyone thinking that their children may be affected by such issues, should investigate GF/CF diets, low sugar and low salicylate diets. She referred to the 'leaky gut' theory, stating that for many autistic people, gluten and casein can act like opiates. In fact, when one woman asked for advice on her son's habit of head banging, Donna again mentioned this, saying this is sometimes a symptom of what she termed 'brain fog', that is, undigested enzymes crossing the blood-brain barrier. What was missing from all these discussions of medical issues, both in the main lecture and while answering questions from the audience later, was any mention of doctors or dietitians. Donna mentioned naturopaths, chiropractors, reflexologists and osteopaths. These are not practitioners of evidence based therapies. In my opinion, medical issues  may  occur  along with  autism. Not all autistic people have the medical problems identified by Donna in her lecture, and many non-autistic people do. Whether your child is autistic or not, if you suspect that there's is a medical problem, I think you should go talk to your GP or paediatrician, who will take a history, order appropriate tests, and work with you to find a solution. At one stage, Donna asked any parents whose children ate tooth paste to put their arms up high, so she could tell them off, since the children are ingesting fluoride, which , she said, is used in rat poison. I restrained myself from calling out the word 'DOSE!' (Actually, I agree that it's a good idea to teach your children to spit out toothpaste, and to use only a small amount when brushing teeth. Duncan used to suck the toothpaste, but spits now. It's just another one of those developmental things.) Donna also promoted the use of glutamine supplements which is, she said, is a super brain-food. She discussed how it helps her tremendously, and she told how she has seen many autistic children make great progress while taking it, such as saying their first words, or starting to talk in sentences. She addressed a group of secondary school students in the audience directly, asking them if they ever took glutamine to help them concentrate in exams, and recommended that they do just that. She then spoke about the huge benefits she saw personally on a small dose of respiradol, and again reported that she knew of many other cases where a neuroleptic (though she didn't use that term) helped someone with autism. She discussed how she had been taking expensive immune boosting drugs for years, the same kind, she said, taken by cancer and AIDS patients. However, introducing the respiradol, which she later changed to seroquel, meant she no longer needed the immune boosting medication. She said that though parents are reluctant to use medication with their children, that these can sometimes have great advantages and she encouraged parents to investigate this option. Again, I would have been more reassured if some of the disadvantages of neuroleptics had also been mentioned, and if she had emphasised that these decisions must be made after extensive research and discussion with a doctor. There was much discussion of autistic 'cat' people versus NT 'dog' people. I wondered if she knew any autistic dog people?! After the lecture, there was a slide-show of photos of herself as a child (pre-nine years old only!) and as an adult, as well as some of her art, and she sang live. It was very touching. The questions at the end were all from parents, looking to interpret various 'behaviours' of their children and asking for her advice. I wanted to ask several questions too, but refrained, as my questions were not like any of the others. I was, to be honest, a bit nervous about standing up and querying some of the things mentioned here, and was worried it might be rude to do so. I wanted to ask in particular about the ethical issues of having autistic children take therapies that are not evidence based. Later, I was looking into some of the therapies she advocated. A search on 'autism and glutamine' came up with the 'Sunderland Protocol' which also refers to many of the other biomedical interventions Donna mentioned. I'm happy to be corrected, but I'm not aware of the evidence in favour of this protocol, beyond the usual anecdotes. Another hit was to the  Holford Watch  blog, and a post stating; Patrick Holford frequently advises people to heal their gut with the use of glutamine. He particularly recommends the value of  glutamine for gut-healing in children on the autistic spectrum . Restoring a healthy gut by supplementing digestive enzymes and probiotics is known to produce positive results in  autistic children. The amino acid glutamine is especially important in restoring the integrity of the digestive tract . Drinking 5g dissolved in water just before bedtime can help heal the gut. [Emphasis added.]   Some version of that advice appears in a number of the Holford books and websites. Oddly enough, the advice on this topic on  Food for the Brain  (FFTB) has been modified to indicate that  glutamine may be contra-indicated with children with ASD (autistic spectrum disorders) , but Holford has yet to update any of his other writings to reflect those changes.     The amino acid  glutamine is an important gut healing nutrient but may be contraindicated in autism  because some autistics have protein deamination problems leading to production of ammonia which doesn\u2019t mix well with glutamine. [Emphasis added.] ... It almost goes without saying that there is no support for the gut-healing, glutamine, autism assumption in the indexed medical journals. I can say this for sure, I don't need to take advice from Patrick Holford. It appears that to some extent, his  recommendations for 'gut healing' in autism parallel Donna's. Obviously Donna Williams knows exponentially more than I ever will about autism and I do not intend to dispute what she says about her own health and medication. I take issue with some of the advice meted out and personally disagree with that aspect Donna's work. However, the lecture was very good at getting across many positive messages about autism acceptance and working with a person's strengths and favoured learning styles. There was great advice about making simple but effective adaptations. There were moving images and beautiful singing. It was lovely too to be on the company of someone whose work I have read and who is such a respected writer.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://holfordwatch.info/2007/07/05/patrick-holford-glutamine-and-autism/", "http://patrickholford.com/content.asp?id_Content=1022", "http://www.foodforthebrain.org/content.asp?id_Content=1642"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/donna-williams-in-belfast_8133.html", "title": "\nDonna Williams in Belfast\n"},

I consented (obviously!) and they headed off for the day, to visit my aunt and others back home. Since I had only 2 children to look after, we decided to go out. A trip to the farm was the consensus decision. We had a nice time, and were all especially enamoured of a tiny Jack Russel puppy who was the last of the litter born to the farm dog to be re-homed. Lady loves all the animals; it's not a trait she's inherited from either her parents. Thomas preferred the playground so we played there for a while. We walked about and they loaded my pockets with black berries. Duncan returned, having had a grand day out with his Granada. He's had an ice-cream cone, and a new toy car (the Fat Controller's car, no less...which he adapted asap to look more like Brum). My sister returned for  a few days holiday and we went over to the home town together for a few days, leaving Gordon and the children behind. We got together with my favourite aunt and uncle  and my brother and his girlfriend for a great night out in a local restaurant. The following day, lil' sis' C and I dootered round the town, and in the evening we met up with a few cousins in a pub. That was some night! We all ended up dancing and singing. I felt like I was in the middle of that scene in  Educating Rita  where Rita is siting in the pub feeling disconnected from her husband and family while they're all singing some inane song, except I wasn't feeling Rita-ish. Although, by analysing it, maybe I am sorta Rita-ish. Anyway, it was fun. Yesterday I went to listen to a lecture in Belfast by Donna Williams. It was very interesting and I think I'll go into it more later.

Santa was very obliging, even managing to get an older edition of the book with the required orange cover, as seen on the CD Rom. Duncan knows the story off by heart, but has read it to himself loads of times anyway. He carries it about with him, taking it to bed to put under his pillow.

A friend sent him a stack of the visitor maps from England, and he's spent ages examining them. We have also had several of his wooden trains adapted to resemble the Legoland rides, we've drawn pictures and made books, googled and looked on YouTube. Last week I mentioned a new art class I was taking the boys to. They've been twice now. During the first week they painted T-shirts. Duncan wanted a Duplo train on his. I drew the outline and he filled it in. Thomas made a pattern on his shirt and both boys opted for large shirts they could wear to bed. They looked really good and Duncan has worn his a few times. The second class took place last Wednesday. Duncan had decided that this time he would paint a Sky Rider train on a T-shirt. But this time, the planned activity was to cover a page with oil pastels, paint over them and then scrape off the paint to reveal the colours under. Duncan kept asking about the T-shirts and was upset that there weren't any. I tried to explain what we were doing, and did a quick demonstration. He still wasn't interested. In the end, he dabbed a few spots of paint onto a couple of wooden trains he'd taken with him. I persuaded him to colour and paint and scrape a small page. I don't know if I should bother taking them there any more. Is it beneficial to try to engage him in a task he didn't choose? Should I just let him do the drawings and paintings he want to do at home? The class might give him a chance to try new media, and perhaps learn to take external instruction. I would like to see him join other classes and groups eventually, like his siblings. I think we'll keep going for now. The teacher tends to take a long time, talking at the start about what they're going to do. Duncan needs to get stuck in as fast as possible to engage his interest. I will help him as much as I can, making it more fun and understandable for him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/art-class.html", "title": "\nArt Class\n"},

{"date": "15 Jan 2008", "body": "\n(Thanks to  Dave Hingsburger , for bring this to my attention. It wasn't mentioned in the national news sources I follow.) Last August, Brent Martin, a 23 year old man with a learning disability,  was beaten to death  in an English city. One of his attackers is currently on trial for the murder, the other 2 having already pleaded guilty to murder. The prosecutor is quoted in a  local newspaper  as saying; \"They behaved like a pack of animals as they repeatedly punched, headbutted, kicked and stamped on Brent Martin \u2013 and that man, Brent Martin, never lifted an aggressive finger towards one of them. \"They did that to him until he was dead.\" Mr Hedworth said the 17-year-old was one three assailants who carried out the attack. The others, William Hughes, 21, of Washington Road, Sunderland, and a 16-year-old youth, who cannot be named, have each admitted murder. \"The three of them were, from start to finish, in it together,\" said Mr Hedworth. \"They did it for their own sport.\" The defendant and the 16-year-old had each trained as amateur boxers and knew the consequences of violence, Mr Hedworth added. \"They set out quite deliberately to do serious harm to Brent Martin for their own amusement and to make themselves look big in front of their friends, even inviting others to hit him. \"As the attack went on its nature, its ferocity, and its perseverance made it quite clear they were not going to be happy till he was dead. \"Subsequently one or more may have regretted they went as far as they did but at the time they had no such sensibility \u2013 no restraint, no qualms and no mercy.\" The court was told all three youth were bragging and \"seemed pleased with themselves\" immediately after the attack. This was a disability hate crime. I can only hope that sentencing will reflect the terrible nature of this crime, and the need to challenge discrimination against disabled people. I have just read that the  Scottish government plan  to update their hate crime laws to include attacks on people due to their disability or sexual orientation. Northern Ireland hate crime laws already cover attacks due to disability. I also just came across an organisation called  Respond  who seem to be doing good work (I have merely browsed their web site) and who are in favour of more recognition for the offence of  disability hate crime . They have discussed the murder of Brent Martin in their evidence to the  Joint Committee on Human Rights  inquiry into the human rights of adults with learning disabilities. What can we do about this? There are people who feel it is acceptable to harass or physically attack people for all sorts of reasons. How can we do our bit to make such behaviour less common and to promote respect and decent treatment of everyone? I've been told that I can't change the world and I should try to help Duncan (because obviously I worry about people taking advantage of or hurting him when he's grown up) progress as much as possible. Presumably this is so he stands out less and is not so much of a target. I think this attitude excuses the people who commit the crimes from responsibility. It's the same approach that says women who are raped are sometimes at least partially responsible for dressing wrong/being in the wrong place/putting themselves in danger, when really it is  always all  the rapist's fault because it is  always  wrong to rape someone, no matter what they are wearing or have been drinking or whatever. Over the few years, I have been reading about disability issues. Every time something comes up in the mainstream news sources and discussion forums, I have been appalled at the attitude of many people who would think of themselves as decent and/or liberal, but who seem to see disabled people, especially those with a learning disability as much less worthy of their respect and understanding. They talk about 'mental ages,' describe people as 'vegetables,' excuse unethical medical interventions. There's a blog I read occasionally; the author recently wrote a post explaining why he was going to continue to use the word 'retard' whenever he wanted and slagging off the 'PC brigade' who might be offended. Jeez. Now these people would not go out and beat up their neighbours with learning disabilities, but it all promotes a culture where it's acceptable to make fun of people for being different, and in which some thugs take things a bit further and do real harm. I'm like an ant shouting in a shoebox here for all the difference this will make. I can only try my best in my own life, raise my children to be respectful and understanding and challenge the discrimination when I see it. My thoughts are with the family of Brent Martin. RIP Brent.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2008/01/black-armband.html", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wear/7177716.stm", "http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Brent-killed-for-sport-court.3654118.jp", "http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.1965341.0.hate_crime_laws_to_be_tightened.php", "http://www.respond.org.uk/index.html", "http://www.respond.org.uk/campaigns/disability_hate_crime.html", "http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/joint_committee_on_human_rights.cfm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/remember-brent-martin.html", "title": "\nRemember Brent Martin\n"},
{"date": "26 Sep 2007", "body": "\nThe  Donna Williams Belfast lecture  was sponsored by a new Northern Ireland autism group; 'P2P Autism Support Group'. Their logo consists of 3 puzzle pieces, encircled by the words, 'Parent 2 parent working together to support educate advocate'. Their leaflet was handed out to everyone who registered for the lecture. It's second paragraph started with, 'Estimated rates of autism in the UK now stand at 1 in 58.' Uh oh. That sounded familiar. After the lecture, I asked some people who were part of the P2P group, where this figure came from, and was told it came from a report by the  Children's Commissioner  dated March 2007. I mentioned that it was also quoted in the  recent (appalling) Observer article . But no, I was assured that the report pre-dated that article and was available on-line if I wanted to check. (I did check the Children's Commissioner site later, but could not find this report. If anyone can enlighten me, I'd be grateful. I did e-mail P2P (p2pautism at yahoo dot com) asking for clarification of the figure, but have not yet had a response.) The information on the leaflet continued, with several good points; Those of you here today working in the education and health systems will know that you are under immense pressure at meeting the needs of most of our children, many of whom are undiagnosed and are not receiving the help they deserve. Those of you who are adults or who know of adults who have an Autistic Spectrum Condition will be painfully aware of the need  for change in terms of employment and independent living opportunities. By then I was thinking, maybe the 1 in 58 slip was an aberration, that this group really did have the best interest of all autistic people in mind, and perhaps I could get involved. The next bit talked of 'the current self-fulfilling prophesies that abound regarding Autism' and how the \"professionals\" present autism in a way that 'is often negative and sometimes soul destroying.' Then it stated that autism isn't a disease and there is no \"cure\", but that the new paradigm is that it is \"treatable\". Children worldwide are being successfully 'treated for their individual \"Autism's\".' (There were many words in quotation marks in this short document, and 'autism' was always capitalised.) What followed, clarified that this is not a group I'll be joining. Approaches such as biomedical interventions address the gastrointestinal problems our children commonly suffer from, as well as their detoxification, allergy and immunity issues, all contributing to so-called \"behaviours\". In the rest of the UK many parents together with their informed doctors are treating Autism as a medical issue, because their children have real medical problems, problems often ignored. How often must it be said, if your child has medical issues, SEE A PROPER HEALTH PROFFESSIONAL! Get it sorted, and that applies whether the child is autistic or not. Finally, the document told of thousands of books and organisations on the internet, even doctors and teachers, who think of autism as treatable. But 'this shift has not reached these shores.' (Thankfully, thought I.) Professionals were then encouraged to listen to parents, to keep abreast of currents autism research and to buy books about it. Also available at the lecture, were copies of a UK based magazine called 'The Autism File'. I was once given a stack of these, when Duncan was almost 3, and I was briefly seduced by all the miraculous 'recovery' stories contained therein. Gordon was unconvinced, and after a bit more investigation, it was clear that none of the 'treatments' mentioned had any scientific validity. I dumped the magazines in the recycling bin. However this time, I took a copy home to read about the latest trends in the UK autism biomed world. Interestingly, it contained an article by the chair of the NI 'P2P Autism Support Group', Karen Buchanan. She began by bemoaning the poor standard of services for 'children with ASD's' in NI, which she reckons is a legacy of the terrorist violence and political unrest we suffered under for 30 or so years. Here, I am in agreement. She wrote; Children with ASD's continue to be ignored, and segregated en masse into \"special\" facilities using cheap, mediocre, and in my view, damaging teaching methods. I don't know what teaching method she holds to be 'damaging', but I would agree that the education system is not supporting autistic children properly, that parents have to fight bureaucracy to get a Statement of Educational Need and to have the proper provision supplied. There is not adequate funding, training or understanding. Later she wrote; On the medical side of things, paediatricians love to dazzle vulnerable and uniformed parents with Wing's now pass\u00e9 and wholly inadequate \"triad of impairment\" explanation of autism and its concomitant \"deficits\". This is meted out with the most depressing and singular fatalism, that autism is a debilitating and lifelong \"disability\"; that parents should just make the best of what they've been \"given\" and simply get on with it. I don't doubt that there are some doctors who act as she describes. Such relics must be brought up to date. The diagnostic process needs a total overhaul, in terms of speed, who provides the diagnosis, how it is presented and what advice is given. Personally, I have met with several paediatricians, a speech and an occupational therapist, a clinical and an educational therapist since I moved here. They were all knowledgeable, helpful, respectful to my views and decisions and willing to learn from me (wrt  home-education in particular). There also seems to be a cultural difference in Northern Ireland of not wanting to bring attention to ones self and/or complain. Over and over again, I have witnessed parents of autistic children reluctant to tackle the education boards or their children's doctor for fear of \"causing a fuss\". I am originally Canadian and though I have lived in Belfast for 15 years, I find this hard to fathom, coming from a country that celebrates the \"individual\". I do not share other parents \"unhealthy\" respect for doctors either, doctors who are generally ignorant of autism, and worse, are afraid of their own ignorance. Well, it's an interesting anthropological study of the local population. I'd actually concur with several points raised. Parents  do  need to stand up for their children, and not accept sub-standard education or health care. However doctors know a heck of a lot more than others about medicine, and if I'm not happy with what I've been advised, I'll take a second doctor's opinion over the knowledge of Google. I personally didn't accept anything I was told at face value when my boy was diagnosed two years ago. I knew he was ill and he needed help fast. He has been on a biomedical intervention protocol (DAN) since the day after diagnosis. He was in an ABA (Lovass) program for 12 months. He has had AIT training, Verbal Behaviour, sensory integration vision therapy, the HANDLE method and now we are pursuing Sonrise. ... After advising my son's paediatrician that we would be pursuing the biomedical route and after asking for certain blood tests to be done, the doctor implied \"child abuse\". This doctor did not have any comment about my son's raw excema or the fact that he was constipated for weeks at a time or that he was constantly developing strange viruses. This doesn't make sense to me. It sounds like her son had genuine medical problems as well as autism. How would the doctor 'not have any comment' about eczema and constipation? Did she ask him? Doctors see these problems with children every day. Is she saying that the doctor somehow ignored her request for treatment of these things, or implied that they were somehow linked to his autism? If he did, it sounds like she should have complained, and we know she's not afraid to do so. Anyway, her son underwent a gamut of interventions, non of those mentioned specifically have any proven benefit. I'm always interested in people who drop ABA for Sonrise, since they seem to be virtually opposite approaches. (Sonrise, for those who don't know, is a USA based cult, where you go on a hugely expensive training course, and learn how to 'love' the autism right out of that child.) Anyway, the article continued; I thank God for the internet. Like so many other parents the internet has provided me with a wealth of support and information, that was impossible to access in real life. I now know parents from all over the world. It says a lot that parents must learn from their computers in lieu of their doctor's knowledge. I think the internet is marvellous too, and I also communicate with people worldwide. It's also really cool to be able to use resources like  Pubmed  when evaluating some of the absolute crap you read. Well, it goes on to talk about how P2P autism is new and fantastic and is going to shake the place up, and ends with; As a \"biomed\" mom, who only cares about what is good for my child ad for other children like him, I personally will not rest until terms like \"methylation cycles\", \"leaky gut syndrome\" and \"yeasty poops\" become part of the vocabulary of every \"autistic\" household in Northern Ireland. I also will not rest until parents like me are provided real choices about how to educate our children, and are given the means to pursue those choices. Watch out Northern Ireland, the Troubles are over, but more trouble is on the way via parents who are getting organised. Wow! Get ready, cause here they come! It's the DAN missionary, out to convert the natives to the true path of righteousness and clean guts. I can understand that some reckon this stuff has helped their own child, but why do they need to proselytise? I'll just advocate for my son, in my own way thanks.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.childrenscommissioner.org/adult/index.cfm", "http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fsites%2Fentrez&ei=9V_6RpzkE53kwgHg79CbCw&usg=AFQjCNGYqd-N53QfUgMzxs3KqP5ul-c89A&sig2=AOk09oAK6tGHRU8-uCUAzA"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/p2p-autism-in-northern-ireland.html", "title": "\nP2P Autism in Northern Ireland\n"},
{"date": "31 Aug 2007", "body": "\nI've noticed a  blog post  that kindly linked to my own post on the recent Daily Mail 'Monster Autism' story. To reciprocate the link love seems the least I can do! The writer tackles autism cures; If, hypothetically, a cure for autism existed, would you administer it?If you would, then you are a \u201ccurebie\u201d and you should expect a vehement response for your opinion. Neurodiversity, as the argument goes, is no less a valid principle than racial or gender diversity. Advocate a cure and you are no better than a racist, a chauvinist, or any other bigot. See, the thing is, that's not what I think a curebie is. There IS NO cure for autism. If somehow one was made available, I would not administer it to my son; I would let him decide  for himself  when he's old enough if he wanted to have a major and drastic change in his neurological make-up. There's a great post here by Abfh called  Defining Curebie-ism . I'd agree with her definition of the word. The blogger continues; Except we have to pause for a moment and ask who is proposing this particular opinion, and why? The answer is simple; it is High Functioning autistics and aspies, advocating it because they want to be accepted for who they are, not rejected as freaks. Damned good point. They have every right to be offended and upset by the treatment they often receive. BUT ARE THEY SPEAKING FOR MY SON? Read this carefully: NO THEY BLOODY WELL ARE NOT. There is a big difference - an enormous, fundamental difference between curing someone whose disability prevents them from understanding and adopting the social niceties of life, and curing someone whose disability leads them to smear shit all over their home, beat the crap out of their siblings, and cause sleep deprivation to the point of clinical insanity to their parents. Autistic rights and the principle of neurodiversity expires when it imposes unreasonable demands upon other people who did not volunteer, and who have rights of their own that are rejected without any thought whatsoever. I don't understand that last paragraph. What does he mean by 'autistic rights ... expires'? And why point out that parents didn't 'volunteer'. I don't subscribe to the notion that only those who can manage it are 'given' a disabled child either. It just happened, sheer chance. Just like the fact that 2 of my kids have curly hair, 2 of them are boys, one of them happens to be autistic. Then there's the link to  my  earlier post; When I read blogs like  this , with comments like this: Having an autistic child is tough and causes you to change your expectations of family life. Parents who adapt and accept this, and their children, are more likely to thrive.   then all I think of are the words \u201c glib ,\u201d \u201c patronising \u201d and \u201c bastard .\u201d   Gee, it's nice of you to care. The delightful man finishes with; Since when did the arrival of a disabled child mean that parents should renounce their own expectations of life accept the priorities of their child? It doesn\u2019t apply to parents of children with any of the other disabilities I teach - so why the fuck should autism be different?   Why? Because the service providers are ignorant, and because there are too many idiots like AFF and other \u2018autism liberationist\u2019 groups who think that their needs are best met by stamping underfoot the needs of their carers.   Wake up and smell the coffee, guys - you have a disability. It imposes burdens of care upon others that are only met by emotional bonds and goodwill. Stop taking the piss, otherwise you might find the goodwill has a short shelf life. I just find this odd. The arrival of any child, disabled or not, means that parents have to adjust the expectations of their own life and for a while at least, the child's needs take priority. It doesn't have to mean you live just for your children, that you are a slave to them. But you have to expect that things will change from the entirely different scenario of a child free existence. The author could really do with reading up on the  social model of disability  too. Oh and the blogger known as JB or FS (who called me an ignorant fuck and a despicable hypocrite on my blog) loved it, calling it a 'great post'! I was surprised that the blog I've mentioned is linked to from the  ASD Friendly  site, which I used to read and seems to have lots of useful information, and is, as far as I can tell, free from quackery.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://asdfriendly.org/blog/grumpyoldman/2007/08/23/to-cure-or-not-to-cure-that-is-the-question/", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/09/defining-curebie-ism.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability", "http://www.asdfriendly.org/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/08/disagreement.html", "title": "\nDisagreement\n"},
{"date": "31 Aug 2007", "body": "\nBut to get back to what this blog is really all about, here's a little update on the family. First, on Monday, we said goodbye to M. the wonderful young woman who has been coming round almost very week for almost a year to play with Duncan and the others. She is starting full-time work as a primary school teacher. She had bought gifts for all 3 children ( Underground Ernie  engines for the boys- very much appreciated!) and had a lovely card for me, thanking me for inviting her into our home every week. It had been entirely our pleasure. She is a delightful, kind, fun and intelligent woman. Her class is lucky to have her as their teacher. She was so open to the children, always tried hard to engage Duncan and gained his love in return. She wanted to know a bit about autism to better help any autistic children she may teach. What a special person she is, to have given up her time for free, for that, but mostly to play with a little autistic boy, and to give his mum a bit of time off on a Monday morning. We will hopefully see her sometimes on the school holidays. I hope so, because we've all made a friend. And talking of friends, Lady's best friend in the whole wide world came to stay for a few days with her mum and sister. Just like  last year when they visited , we all just went right back to familiarity and comfort with each other. This time we went to the Folk and Transport Museums, and S. took the 3 girls on the train to W5. We don't have our 7-seater car anymore so couldn't all fit. They also went to our neighbour's birthday party. Apart from that, we all talked lots and lots, and the children played, dressed-up, created dance sequences to  Mika  songs...oh my. I'm so happy that we're still in touch. I'm very fond of them all, and Lady and S. have special bond. When Gordon dropped them at the airport, Lady went too. He told me that she was craning her neck looking out the window as he drove off, and when he asked her to sit back, she had tears running down her face.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/mikamyspace"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/08/best-friends.html", "title": "\nBest Friends\n"},
{"date": "5 Sep 2007", "body": "\nMy granny died on Saturday morning. She was 95 and had been getting increasingly ill over the past few weeks. She was a marvellous woman; loving, kind, exceedingly generous, full of joy and smart as a whip up to the end. My dad was one of her 8 children, I am one of her 35 grandchildren and my children are among her 32 great-grandchildren. (I think those numbers are right; perhaps I should add error margins!) We used to all gather at her house every Sunday afternoon when I was a child. We'd run around the field behind the house, and eat beef sandwiches and shop-bought cakes; which was a treat for me since we only ever got home-made at home. Granny lived in the same house all her life. My Granda, her husband, died 4 years ago. They had been married for 64 years. Two of her brothers never married and lived their whole lives in the house with her, Granda and their family. Over the past few years Granny become more frail and my aunt, who continued to live at home when she married and had children, has taken such good care of her. Their house had an open door policy and people were regularly calling in and were always made welcome. Granny loved visitors; knowing what you were up to and where you were going. She enjoyed seeing us dressed up, always saying 'health to enjoy' when we showed off a new outfit. Most of all, she loved to see all the children who came to visit, or my aunt's own grandchildren whom she also cared for. Granny somehow managed to remember all of us and know where we were living and what we were doing with our lives. Gordon wasn't around. He's on a conference in Korea. But my sister flew in from London, and went with me and the children, back to Granny's house for the wake. Lady had been to my other Granda's wake so knew what to expect, but I explained to Thomas that my Granny's body would be in an open coffin in her bedroom and we could go in to see her. This we all did, and they were not in the least bit fazed. I was upset to see her, especially when I went into the living room and saw the empty space where  her  chair always sat beside the range cooker. Duncan didn't like the house full of people, which is only to be expected, so he spent most of the time outdoors. Thankfully, the weather was great. Lady and Thomas also ran around in the garden (which used to be the field I played in) with the other children who were there. I had lots of help looking after Duncan, especially from my Dad (as always) and my brother's girlfriend, who took all my children to her house for a few hours leaving me peace to talk to the relatives, friends and neighbours who were gathered or just paying a short visit. My sister was among those on tea duty. Endless trays of sandwiches and buns were dispensed along with a never ending supply of tea. It used to be worse; I can remember wakes I was at as a child, where there'd be dishes stacked with cigarettes for the visitors! The funeral was held the next day. The church was packed. A cousin from my mum's side of the family was kind enough to stay in my car with Duncan while he watched a DVD. He'd been crying 'no go into church' when we arrived and there was no way I was going to force him into that big, scary building. Thomas made me laugh during the ceremony; the priest said the line 'where we live forever...' and Thomas said incredulously, 'We live  forever ?!' Anyway, for a boy not used to church, he behaved wonderfully. In fact all 3 children were marvellous the whole 2 days, and I told them when we were driving home how proud I was of them. I had so many people comment on what lovely children they are. Many of my relatives delighted in Duncan too and commented on how well he's doing. I was a bit concerned by his shouting, especially when he shouted a rude phrase in his discomfort or frustration. Mostly he was very happy, if extremely mobile, and I (and my helpers) did a fair bit of running after him to be sure he stayed away from the open path to the road. It was sad saying goodbye to Granny. She was a big part of our lives for lots of us. She was always there. But I take comfort in remembering her, and knowing she was happy, in spite of the hard times, hard work and bereavements she lived through. She loved her family, loved a celebration, and will be remembered for a long time to come by great many people.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/goodbye-granny.html", "title": "\nGoodbye Granny\n"},
{"date": "17 Jan 2008", "body": "\nLike many other people who have heard of  Katie McCarron , I have been thinking about her and her family often over the past few weeks. Katie was a little autistic girl, whose mother suffocated her with a plastic bag. The jury has just announced their verdict that the murderous mother is  guilty . Katie's dad and grandparents and others in her family have spoken of their beloved child with dignity and pride. I hope that they will receive a small measure of comfort from the outcome of this trial. In my previous post I wrote of the Dr Suess book I read to my own autistic son. It contains the lines, 'A wasn't just isn't. He just isn't present. But you...You ARE YOU! And, now isn't that pleasant!' I didn't write it before, but it just made me think of Katie. She wasn't 'a wasn't.' She  existed  and it  was ' pleasant' for all who knew her, though it's oh so hard to deal with the cruel and terrible lose. She was lovely and loved. SHE WAS SHE! She will always  be , because there are people all around the world, who were so moved by her loss, so touched by the words her grandfather shared, and who will often look at their own children and hug them that bit tighter to remind them of how precious they are. Katie will be remembered for a long time to come.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pjstar.com/stories/011708/TRI_BFHBKR7R.008.php"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/katie.html", "title": "\nKatie\n"},
{"date": "27 Aug 2007", "body": "\nWe all had a marvelous time on holiday in Donegal. Even the weather was surprisingly fine. Though, last Saturday, when we arrived at the caravan park, it was fairly bleak; wet and windy. We all donned boots and rain coats for our first walk around the site. Duncan got soaked, because as far as he was concerned, when you're wearing wellies, you're  supposed  to jump into every puddle! He was running along a muddy path, through a patch of puddles, saying 'Big Thunder Mountain!' He was pretending to be the coaster splashing through the water. By Sunday afternoon it had dried up and from then on it stayed mostly dry with just a few light showers once or twice. Knowing the climate in Donegal, and given what an awful summer we've had so far, that was astounding...and welcome. The site had a great playground, a couple of bouncy castles, a climbing wall and a bungee-jump-trampoline thing. There were little go-kart bikes and a bike that the whole family could ride, with the adults steering and peddling. I also made use of the laundry; just 'cause we're on holiday doesn't mean everyones bladders last the night. Duncan loved the go-kart, and took one out for a while every day. Whoever was accompanying him had to run fast to keep up. But what was great about the place, was we didn't need to be right there at his side all the time. We could let him go off 30m or so in front of us, knowing that he was safe enough. Lady and Thomas were allowed to go to the playground without us. It was such a big deal to them, getting that little bit of freedom. Thomas made friends immediately, he just asked the other children if they wanted to play with him. Lady did as she always has, and waited for the other children to approach her. By the end of the week they both had a little gang of buddies. The site provided a sort of summer club, with organised and supervised activities for the children. Lady and Thomas went to several of these; tennis, rounders, arts and crafts, football, dance-camp etc. Watching Thomas play football was hilarious. He was all effort and no effect. He ran around lots, always making a big dramatic start like  Sportacus . The site was in the Fanad Peninsula, a stunning part of the country and we enjoyed some beautiful views driving around. Duncan was frightened when we were on the mountain roads, especially whenever we stopped the car or when there was a panoramic view over the sea. The steep inclines worried him too. He was saying, 'brakes, brakes Mr Conductor', 'I don't want to die!' and 'hold back, hold back' as well as a few other train related phrases. I held his hand and kept reassuring him that we were fine and safe, that Daddy was driving very carefully and he seemed to be mollified. We went to the beach a few times. One trip was to Ballymastocker Bay, right at the north of Fanad head. This beach didn't border a mere lough, this looked onto the wide Atlantic Ocean. We'd bought short wetsuits for the children, and they had such a magical time splashing in the sea and digging and rolling down sand dunes and clambering over rocks. It was actually warm and sunny that day (I topped up my farmer's tan). Gordon and I sat on the soft sand, away from the children on the nearly deserted beach, watching them and enjoying a moment of perfect happiness. (Image taken from the  Donegal Ancestry Centre  website; we forgot the camera that day.) Of course we all had our moments of sub-optimal temper. But we always got over it. Even on the last night, when there was a little concert organised as an opportunity for the children to show off the songs and dances they'd learned in dance-camp, Duncan was manageable. He stayed outside the barn which was serving as the concert hall and was too noisy and crowded inside for him. He passed the time riding a tricycle up and down a wooden ramp. Gordon and I took it in turn to stay outside or to stand in the doorway, so we could keep an eye on Duncan, while watching the show. Thomas and lady were taking part in the concert. In their first number, they were doing a wee dance. Thomas performed the whole thing with his back to the audience. It wasn't that he was shy, it just never seemed to occur to him to face us! He did better the next time (after I reminded him that we did want to see him!) and was so funny shaking his little booty. Lady had her big moment in the spotlight, when she and another girl took the mike to sing 'Chim Chiminee' (from Mary Poppins) and she did great! Anyway, we're home again and glad to be back. When we were leaving, lady and Thomas said they wanted to go back to the same place next year. I asked Duncan if he wanted to go there again too, he said 'Yes I did!'\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/lazytown/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RtKEp8JJ7KI/AAAAAAAAAHE/nYtrTcY3fJ4/s1600-h/Ballymastocker.jpg", "http://indigo.ie/~donances/new_web/gallery.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/08/happy-holiday.html", "title": "\nHappy Holiday\n"},
{"date": "6 Sep 2007", "body": "\nI really should know better than to take an article in the Daily Mail newspaper at face value. When  I wrote  about a recent diatribe on life with an autistic child, I took it to be the words of the mother whose name was under the headline. It was not. It was a selective adaptation from her book. The author of the book, Jan Greenman, commented on my post. She was polite and was keen to set the record straight about her son. I apologised to her for the absolutely unnecessary personal insult I levelled at her in my original post, when I thought she was the author of the actual newspaper article. Jan  wrote in my comments  section about the paper's decision to feature her book;  I was so excited, assuming that it would be in the form of a book review and give people, as my book does, the truth about Luke's life with labels. I have written a book about all the aspects of Luke's life and the book is NOT about me, although the Mail have written it from that perspective, picking out probably all the references to me in the whole book! She also wrote ;  Luke is so brilliant at talking for himself and explaining how it feels to be him. He has written tips at the end of each chapter for parents to try and understand what was going through his head when he behaved in a certain way and everyone who has read the book says that they laughed, they cried, they couldn't put it down but they understood so much more at the end of it and had so much respect for Luke. He has had the toughest time at school and I have fought tooth and nail to get him any kind of help and recognition of his differences and how they affect him. He has many sensory sensitivities and he is acutely aware of who likes him and who doesn't and acts accordingly. He wasn't diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome until he was 10yrs old, which is why I didn't understand him properly and he didn't cuddle me until he was 11. Because he was my first child, I just didn't know what had hit me and yet I loved him utterly. Isn't it a pity that these words weren't published in the paper. I had written, 'I have judged her by her words. I know this is a newspaper article and journalists can twist the story to fit the template that sells more, but she has written a book, and I can't see a single positive word from her in the whole article.' I was right about the journalist but wrong about Jan Greenman.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/09/monster-autism-in-daily-mail-update.html", "title": "\nMonster Autism in the Daily Mail; Update\n"},
{"date": "19 Jan 2008", "body": "\nI don't remember if I have ever mentioned here how Duncan is interested in logos and titles, especially for films and TV programmes. He will replay the opening scenes on his DVDs and videos many times, pausing to have a good look at the logos. Youtube has once again proved its marvellousness, since lots of other logo fans have made films of the idents and logos. Right now, I'd say his favourites are the VCI and Ragdoll production logos on his Tots TV and other BBC films. He draws these often, on the PC, on paper, on the steamed up car window and sometimes creating versions made from lego. Here's a film he and I put together of some of his most recent PC produced logo pictures. I have not yet bought him a graphics tablet (must do so soon) so he has managed to create all these using a rather wonky mouse and the not-too-user-friendly Windows Paint program. He has also drawn loads of other pictures, saving and naming them for himself. I love how he draws people, how expressive the faces are. He always draws PC pictures by first zooming into the background (usually a screen shot of his Dogz game) so the finished pictures are very small when viewed at actual size. For these films, he chose the music and told me what to write on the titles. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/more-of-duncans-drawings.html", "title": "\nMore of Duncan's drawings\n"},
{"date": "16 Aug 2007", "body": "\nI was talking with Duncan about Lady's birthday. I said, 'Lady is 9 now.' 'NO! Lady not 9, Lady is 5!' 'Oh, and how old is Duncan?' No answer 'Is Duncan 7?' 'No, Duncan is 6.' 'And what about Thomas, what age is he...what number is he?' Thomas is 1. Daddy is 4 and Mummy is 2.' Then I got it. Duncan has assigned his own Thomas the Tank Engine names to everyone in the family, and a few friends and extended family members too, and he prefers to use our engine numbers, not our ages. Here's his version; Lady - James (no. 5) Duncan - Percy (no. 6) Thomas - Thomas (no. 1) me - Edward (no. 2) Gordon - Gordon (no 4) Grandma - The Fat Controller (no number!) Granda - Henry (no. 3) G. (my step-mum) - Diesel 10 M. (NAS befriender) - Oliver the Great Western Engine (no 11) C. (my sister) - Mavis In fact, for any person I mention, he'll think for a while and then assign an engine or character name and he's always consistent in who's called what. This summer, a fun fair has set up in our local town. One of the rides is a caterpillar roller coaster for children. Duncan remembered it from last year, and is fascinated by it. We have had to go down to the fair many times this year, on little pilgrimages so he can stand in awe watching this marvelous and slightly scary contraption. He asks me to 'go to see caterpillar train...sit on bench. Not ride! Just watch.' So we go, and he delights in watching the thing, and the others run after pigeons or   circle the fountain and we usually all get a ice-cream (a 99) to make it all worth while. Last week, he wanted to go a bit closer, so we went into the fair area and stood right beside the ride. After watching it go a few times, he decided he wanted to try it so on we went. He was a bit frightened and was softly saying 'stop, stop, get off, I don't want to die.' (The line about dieing is a quote from somewhere and he uses it to mean... I'm a bit worried.) I held him and told him it was safe, it's just a ride, we go round 3 times then it stops and we get off. By the end he was sort of getting used to it but we were both relieved when it was over. However as soon as he got off Lady and Thomas ran up to hug him and were all excited that he'd done it. I was telling them 'Duncan was a bit scared, caterpillar trains are a bit fast and scary' He corrected me saying, 'not scary, Duncan is happy.' I don't think he'll want to go on again in a hurry, but he's pleased to have experienced it for himself just that once. Right now, the boys are eating cookies that Duncan and I just baked. Lady is at summer scheme for the last time this summer. And I've just answered the door to some annoying man offering to clean the gutters and making fun of the cuts on my face; 'Did you fall over? Was there drink involved?' Oh god how hilarious. Oh yeah, I fell over, and there wasn't any ice involved this time. Yesterday evening I had to ask our neighbour about something and Lady came out after me leaving the front door open. So Duncan came out too and didn't want to go home. I played a bit, running after him and pretending to 'get' him. Then I managed to lead him indoors, and he asked to ring the door bell. I know he likes to do this sometimes on his way in, so I opened the front door again. But instead of ringing the bell he dashed  off towards the gate. I ran after him; he stopped suddenly in front of me, and I just had too much momentum to stop myself in time. I ran into him and tripped up, crashing over him, bashing my face hard on the tarmac, ripping out the knee in my jeans and cutting my knee, and hurting poor little Duncan's side as he was trapped under me. It all hurt a lot, and Duncan was so annoyed to see me bleeding. He said, 'Mummy no cut. Bleeding tomorrow. New skin will come.' He was kissing and fussing me, even though he'd been hurt himself. Anyway, the children were all so sweet and Lady told me to lie down and they tidied up. Gordon came home and doctored me, buying steri-strips to seal the still bleeding wound. But flipin' 'eck, I'm not used to this pain. How do kids cope with all the cut knees and whatnot they get?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/08/engines-caterpillars-and-falling-over.html", "title": "\nEngines, caterpillars and falling over\n"},
{"date": "8 Aug 2007", "body": "\nA few weeks back, Gordon and I went to London for 2 nights while my dad and step-mum minded the children. Gordon was to be awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians; pretty impressive! We arrived on Monday afternoon and stayed in a nice hotel near the Natural History Museum, so obviously we went to see the dinosaurs. In the evening we met up with my sister and had a lovely evening chatting and having cocktails and noodles. The next day we walked around some of our old haunts, then along the river, stepping into the Tate for a while. It'd have been nice to see the Dali exhibition but having Dim Sum in the Harbour City took priority! Then we got dressed up and went to the award ceremony for an afternoon of pomp and splendour at the Royal College. It was a short and surprisingly (to me) interesting event. The president spoke to Gordon straight after, complimenting him on a talk of his he'd heard a few months back. (Look, I boast about the kids often enough, so just allow me this!) That evening we ate in a super fine Indian restaurant in Knightsbridge called Amaya. We were seated close to the open kitchen, and saw the racks of kebabs and the variety of grills and ovens used. The food was lovely, and included the tastiest potato dish ever. The clientele looked like what used to be known an yuppies. Though to be honest, for a while there, I was one of those NIPPLES myself (New Irish Professional Person Living in England). Walking back to the hotel took us past the convoys of Lamborghinis that some of the ultra rich London dwellers seem to think of as the perfect city vehicle. On our last morning in London, we dressed up again and went out to enjoy the highlight of our trip; lunch at the Restaurant Gordon Ramsey. This seemed to be a good spot for a celebratory meal. It was the most delicious meal I have ever eaten and we lingered for two hours. Forget FRCP,  this  was why we'd come to London! We'd time to kill before heading out to the airport so we went to the Science Museum, still all dolled-up. I discovered I now have a much deeper appreciation for and understanding of, the steam engines on display, thanks to Duncan. We had a quick walk round the 'History of Medicine' display too. There was a bit written about fMRI and autism, including some typical misinformation about how those with the 'disorder' lack empathy, as well as something about developing cures. I should have photographed it. It's something I should investigate further, and perhaps some pressure could be put on them to change the wording. We got home quite late and learned that the children had all been great. Lady had started summer scheme, Duncan and his Granda had spent a lovely long afternoon on the beach together, and they'd all been treated to trips to the park and ice-creams and the kind of loving attention only grandparents can give.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/08/london-trip.html", "title": "\nLondon Trip\n"},
{"date": "14 Aug 2007", "body": "\nA few weeks back, the NAS were promoting a small survey they'd commissioned about Thomas the Tank Engine and autism. It was mentioned in the  Guardian , and on the  NAS site . A PDF of the report is available  here . Not surprisingly, given the names on our blog and what any regular reader knows about my son, when I saw the questionnaire on the NAS site and in their newsletter, I decided to respond. I'd imagine many others also took part because their autistic children are so into Thomas, so it's not exactly unbiased! Anyway, it's interesting to read and here are a few quotes from the PDF report. The research A survey with parents of children with autism under the age of 10 was launched on the NAS\u2019s website in April 2007 with nearly 750 people taking part. Ten telephone and face-to-face interviews were also conducted with parents of children with autism aged between four and nine years old. Four parents in England, two in Wales, two in Scotland and two in Northern Ireland took part. Summary of research findings Some of the main findings are: \u2022 In a comparison with other popular children\u2019s characters, Thomas & Friends was the most popular, with nearly 90% of children liking it \u2018very much\u2019. \u2022 Many parents felt that Thomas & Friends played a significant part in their child\u2019s early learning and development \u2013 in particular numbers, colours and language. \u2022 Some children in the study have been able to learn basic facial expressions and emotions from Thomas & Friends. \u2022 Parents have been able to use Thomas & Friends\u2019 \u2018language\u2019 to communicate with their child where ordinary language has failed. \u2022 Almost 39% of parents reported that their child\u2019s interest in Thomas & Friends lasted over two years longer than siblings\u2019 interest in the character. \u2022 Highly important aspects of the relationship for parents were the feeling of safety and security Thomas & Friends provides for children and its calming effect. Some, well seemingly many, autistic children  just really like  the Thomas stuff and learn from it. This is intrinsic learning in action. It demonstrates that you don't need to have a marketed therapy to get through to your child, you just need to see what interests them and go from there together. Now if anyone tries to market 'Thomas Therapy TM' I'll scream! Some of the quotes in the report include; \u201cThomas & Friends has definitely been one of the elements that has helped him to recognise human facial expressions and to label his own emotions.\u201d Parent of seven year old with autism. ... Their intense interest in Thomas & Friends seems to have been of some help in enabling children with autism and their siblings to interact, even if this is only that they watch a Thomas & Friends DVD together. \u201cR will play alongside his brother and sister with the trains and tracks. His sister will tell a story with the trains and sometimes R will join in but I don\u2019t think he really understands. He prefers to go over the same stories from the DVDs. He does like to crash the trains into each other with his brother though!\u201d Parent of seven year old with autism. ... Communication connection Interestingly, some parents have found that they can communicate with their child and manage their behaviour using Thomas & Friends\u2019 language and terminology, where \u2018ordinary\u2019 language has failed. \u201cWe use lots of Thomas language to communicate with B and get him to do things, such as a \u2018washdown\u2019 for a bath, telling him he\u2019s \u2018really useful\u2019, \u2018chugging up\u2019 to bed, and \u2018red light\u2019 or \u2018the signal is up\u2019 for no or stop.\u201d Parent of four year old with high-functioning autism Any of the above sound familiar! :-)  I like that last quote too, it's stuff that we do.

Lady wanted to have her party on Saturday and have a family day on Friday. We all went for lunch at Mc's (her choice) then on to one of those indoor play centres. They scampered and climbed and jumped for an hour. Duncan really resisted going in at first, since we'd never been to that particular place before. I asked him if he wanted to just go in to watch Lady and Thomas, which he did. Then he saw a 'Tweenies' ride on toy, which he examined for a while, then a vending machine, reminding him of the vending machine on one of their PC learning games, since he repeated the dialogue about 'entering the exact change'. Soon he was off running, though he stopped every few minutes beside the vending machine, and before we left I gave him some money to buy a bag of sweets. He knew just how to use it too! That evening, the 'summer ball' (ie dinner and disco)  organised by some gregarious folk at Gordon's work was held. We both went, and it's the first time I've met some of his colleagues. It was a good night out too. I think a few people were somewhat surprised to see Gordon dance, having pegged him as some kind of swotty professor type (which he is) but he's also big into his music. It's not as easy to categorise people as it might appear! We had several friends over for the party on Saturday, and the children all enjoyed themselves, despite the rotten wet weather. (Lady was out dancing barefoot in the rain by the end of the day!) A new friend she met at summer scheme was the only child there not home-educated. Two sets of school going friends couldn't make it. Some of our grown up (well they act that way most of the time) friends were there too so we wiled the afternoon away, eating and chatting. I especially enjoyed playing with little A, just turned 2, and utterly gorgeous. We took it easy on Sunday, after all those revelries. We went out for a walk on Sunday only to be caught in the rain. No surprises there! In the evening, Lady and I went ice-skating. We last went about 2 years ago and she never made it onto the ice at all. Now however, she was great. I however, fell over 3 times and drove home with a wet backside! There were more celebrations on Monday. Gordon's mum was 80, though she really doesn't look it. We went into Belfast for dinner at the Merchant House hotel. The restaurant there is bonkers! It looks like a bit of Versailles in the middle of Belfast; gilt and cherubs and a huge chandelier. It was fabulous. E. loved it. Moreover, the meal was wonderful, so it was a lovely, special night. I'd made a little cake which the children helped me to decorate, so we did the cake ceremony in her house before going home. M, our NAS befriender, babysat. Also celebrating her birthday yesterday, was my step-sister G. She lives in England, and is due to have her much longed for baby any day now.

The massive charity,  Autism Speaks , was founded just over 2 years ago by Bob Wright (formerly chairman and CEO of NBC Universal)  and his wife Suzanne. They have raised and spent millions, with charity walks and huge celebrity-soaked galas; the latter tending to cost more than they raise, but hey, it's all about awareness right(!) Their extravagant use of funds is evident on a  2006 tax return  (pdf link). Autism Speaks are proud to have James Watson quoted on their web site saying, \u201cAutism is the worst thing that can happen to a family.\u201d (Link; http://www.autismspeaks.org/inthenews /wrights_cold_spring_harbor.php) I will never understand that. This organisation are also responsible for the infamous 'Autism every day' film, in which a group of mums whine on camera about how hard their lives are because they are raising autistic children. The film was staged, and deliberately set out to make things look as bad a s possible, yet it was selling itself as an honest look at the lives of everyday folk. One fabulously wealthy mum spoke on camera about how she considered murder/suicide with her daughter, while that daughter was in the room! The mission of Autism Speaks is displayed on their web site;  At Autism Speaks, our goal is to change the future for all who struggle with autism spectrum disorders. We are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments, and cure for autism; to raising public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families, and society; and to bringing hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder. We are committed to raising the funds necessary to support these goals. Autism Speaks aims to bring the autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis. It is our firm belief that, working together, we will find the missing pieces of the puzzle. Autism Speaks. It's time to listen. It should be clear to anyone reading the above, that when they call themselves 'Autism Speaks' they really mean, 'anyone aside from autistic people speaks.' This extremely wealthy charity is concerned solely with the prevention and cure of autism and not with ways of helping people live  with  autism. Many people opposed to the aims and methods of this monstrous organisation have supported a petition,  Autism Speaks: Don't Speak for Me . I would urge you to sign it. Recently, a 14 year old created a low key parody web site called 'NT Speaks' lampooning the ridiculously mis-named objectives of Autism Speaks. How did this huge and powerful charity and lobby group react; why they sent the lawyers after her! Yes, the charity who want ' to bring the autism community together as one strong voice' have made it very clear they do not want to hear the voices of  autistic children  who disagree with them! The bully tactics employed included a letter signed by 30 lawyers  suing her for $90,000 for copyright infringement, funds lost and loss of supporters. This is how a multi-million dollar charity spend their income. When they realised her age, they dropped the monetary claim, but insisted that she destroy the source code and give up the domain name. The girl felt compelled to comply and the site has been destroyed. What this child had done was entirely legal and Autism Speaks had no right to bully her in this way. Under US laws, parody is not considered a copyright violation. They have also threatened to sue anyone else who uses their logo or trade marked material;  sites like this . So anyone considering supporting this group in the future, or any celebrity thinking they're doing a good turn while getting themselves exposure and brownie points for doing some charity work, think about where the money may be going.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/01/autism-speaks-silences-autistic-child.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/docs/d_200705_AS_Form_990_-_2006.pdf", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/ntspeaks/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/autism-speaks-charity-bully-autistic.html", "title": "\n'Autism Speaks' charity bully autistic child\n"},

I left a comment which will probably not be published. I have left critical comments before on Mail articles, (autism and MMR junk usually) and they have  never  been published. So I wanted to copy the comment here instead. 'My son is a monster with autism' By JAN GREENMAN  I wrote; This is a very disturbing article using horrible language; 'monster', 'the end of safety, normality and reason', 'I have felt, at times, like killing Luke when he has hurt her.' There are no words of love or understanding for her son's needs and differences. I have an autistic son. I have worked hard to understand his needs, his sensory preferences. Perhaps the boy destroyed the M&S coat as it felt horrible to him? Did this mum try to make things easier for him, for example, offer him a quiet room or headphones when his baby sister's crying was bothering his extra sensitive hearing? He is absolutely aware of she feels about him and it will no doubt have caused him so much stress. Having an autistic child is tough and causes you to change your expectations of family life. Parents who adapt and accept this, and their children, are more likely to thrive. Good luck to Luke in his new school. Be proud of yourself, and you'll find a community of people like you out there to embrace you. There I ran out of characters. But I did so want to say,  '*edited bit.  Go read a bit about your son's condition, learn from people who's brains are wired like his (NOT 'wired up wrongly in many ways'). Have you ever heard of the concept of  diversity ?

{"date": "24 Jan 2008", "body": "\n The Quackometer  is an excellent blog where the claims of quacks, con-artists and pseudo-scientists are evaluated and dismantled. Last autumn its author was forced by a legal threat from the Society of Homepaths to  remove a post critical of them . Once more, someone from 'Big Quacka', this time a character called  Joseph Chikelue Obi , has used legal intimidation on the same blogger, whose ISP have again caved in to baseless threat and removed the page. The Google cache is available  here . Here's an interesting section of the nasty letter his lawyers sent to the blogger's web hosts; Kindly note that  Google has already blocked  the highly defamatory material from appearing on  its search engines in the Republic of Ireland , and is currently in the process of extending the ban to other countries. (My emphasis.) They can do that?! What the hell is wrong with the world. Obviously like loads of other people interested in free speech and fair play and not bowing to bullies, I'm going to repost the article. I missed it first time round so am grateful to  Joseph Chikelue Obi  for his actions and his efforts which have served to ensure that many more people all over the world will have a chance to learn exactly what his reputation is. More people will read the  Irish Independent  article detailing his fictitious Dublin-based  Royal  College of Alternative Medicine (heh!), or  this article  describing his frankly freaky claims of intimidation, or will realise he was  stuck off the GMC register  for \u201cserious professional misconduct.\u201d He has a raft of blogs and web pages, nothing less than gloriously, outlandishly pompous and bizarre. If you're in need of a laugh, cut'n'paste these links (he'll get no Google juice from me); www.josephchikelueobi.com/ www.royalcam.org/ But for lots more about this \"doctor/provost/strongman/activist/ Qualified Wellness Consultant/ World's Most Controversial Doctor\", read below the line for a copy of the Quackometer's post. Irish readers will enjoy the bit where he claims some crank post at \" a highly respected International University in one of the British Commonwealth Protectorates.\" I think he's talking about Dublin there. Did you all know  Baile \u00c1tha Cliath  is in a British Commonwealth Protectorate? Mad stuff this! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Right Royal College of Pompous Quackery - Dublin Thursday, September 28, 2006 I had to share this with you. Following on from my recent Quack Word \u2018 Doctor \u2019 blog, I came across the Royal College of Alternative Medicine ( RCAM ), a Dublin based - well, I'm not sure quite what it is... What caught my eye was just the shameless aggrandisement of the site. It is quite hilarious, if not a little repetitive at times. Calling yourself \u2018Doctor\u2019 is somewhat pompous when all you have done is paid for some international postage. However, the man behind RCAM has absolutely no shame and titles himself as the: Distinguished Provost of RCAM (Royal College of Alternative Medicine) Professor Joseph Chikelue Obi FRCAM(Dublin) FRIPH(UK) FACAM(USA) MICR(UK) Wow! Probably, just Joe to his mates. Naturally, when you Google the qualification FRCAM(Dublin), there is only person who appears to revel in this achievement. I'll leave the rest as an excercise for the reader. The distinguished provost looks like he is just another pseudoscientific nutritionist, his spin being \u201cNutritional Immunomodulation\u201d. This is obviously a lot more clever than Patrick Holfords mere \u2018Optimum Nutrition\u2019, but having only one \u2018omnipill\u2019 is probably a poorer commercial decision that Patrick's vast range of supplements. Obviously, Professor Obi has had a few problems with what probably amount to bewildering comments about his site as the legal threats and press releases concerning his \u2018ethical\u2019 responses to criticisms cover more space than anything else. \u2018Ethical\u2019 is a favourite word on the site. The most recent press release states, 7th September 2006 : The Distinguished RCAM Provost, Professor Joseph Chikelue Obi FRCAM(Dublin) FRIPH(UK) FACAM(USA) MICR(UK) has formally accepted appointment as Chief Professorial Examiner for the Doctor of Science (DSc) programme in Evidence Based, Alternative Medicine (EBAM) of a highly respected International University in one of the British Commonwealth Protectorates. This new qualification is primarily aimed at Medical Graduates, Physicians, Surgeons, Pharmacists, Dentists, Osteopaths, Chiropractors, Opticians, Wellness Consultants, Herbalists, Acupuncturists, Naturopaths, Healers, Podiatrists, Chiropodists, Scientists, Healers, Therapists, Homeopaths, Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Nurses wishing to ethically upgrade their current Qualifications in Alternative Medicine over an exceedingly intensive 12 - 36 month period of study. British Commonwealth Protectorates? Could that be Dublin? I really have no idea what this organisation is all about. But it looks like it could be getting quite big soon... RCAM currently has International Vacancies for One Million (1,000,000) \u2018Foundation Fellows\u2019 (\u2018Movers and Shakers\u2019); who will independently play a highly pivotal role in diligently mentoring (and regulating) its future Global Membership. So if you really think that you seriously have what it takes to become a \u2018Leader\u2019 in Alternative Medicine, then (perhaps) RCAM may definitely be exactly what the Doctor ordered for you. One million. That's a lot of quacks! And they are just to mentor (and regulate) the wider quack membership! This man has ambition. The Big J really hates real doctors. This is his most recent press release... RCAM would like to warmly commend the various Chieftans of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom for ethically and appropriately ignoring utterly misguided calls (from a rather amusing Group of thirteen Clinical Yestermen) to compel Hard-Working (and Tax-Paying) British Citizens to additionally pay for Life Enhancing Alternative Medicine Interventions out of their very own pockets - rather than get such treatments free via the NHS. RCAM would like to also categorically state that such exceedingly flawed \u2018G-13\u2019 demands that the National Health Service of the United Kingdom expediently abandon Alternative Medicine altogether (in total favour of Conventional Medicine) be diplomatically treated with the very utmost contempt which such unguarded verbal flippance duly deserves; as none of these 13 \u2018Eminent UK Scientists\u2019 behind such calls has professionally attained Globally Acceptable Fellowship Qualifications in Alternative Medicine and as such cannot be deemed competent enough to make such sweeping \u2018Shilly-Shally\u2019 statements about the noble independent specialty of Alternative Medicine. RCAM therefore publicly advises the General Public to lawfully go about their normal Wellness-Seeking Behaviour as usual - without any unwarranted prejudice or fear resulting from such highly self-serving, morally unethical, abjectly crude, totally unprofessional, utterly unstatesmanly, morbidly barbaric, wantonly uncivilized, profanely undemocratic and unspeakably sacrilegious perpetual affronts on the therapeutically formidable institution of Alternative Medicine. Now, I do not have \u2018Globally Acceptable Fellowship Qualifications\u2019 in Santa Clause Studies to know he does not exist. But hey. I must be a morbidly barbaric and profanely undemocratic, unethical duck. So, struggling around the acres of pomposity I find one place where Prof Joe might be making some money. You can call him to seek his wisdom, after pre-booking an hour's slot (and handing over your credit card) for a mere \u20ac300. Alternatively, you can pay by the minute on the contact line for a trifling $10 per minute. It's going to cost you $20 just for Joe to say Hello and to read out his numerous titles, qualifications and names. Not bad \u2018ethical\u2019 work. Ethical Quackery, the Monarchy and Kate Moss Thursday, October 12, 2006 No, this is not about our Defender of Quackery, our Quack-in-Chief His Royal Quackiness, Prince Charles, but about the Distinguished Provost of the Royal College of Alternative Medicine, Professor Joseph Chikelue Obi. And yes, it is just a rather lame story written solely to get a picture of Kate on my blog. I've written a rather lazy blog on the distinguished professor  before  that was just a bit of a gawp at his quacktastic  website  and what looks like a health phone-line scam. Well, I've done a little more digging with Google and it has revealed a few quack gems. It has been pretty hard work, since Google returns some 6,000 pages, the vast majority just appears to be Prof Obi's self-promotion. However, if you persist in digging a few interesting facts turn up. So, what has the little black duck found out about the \u201cmost Controversial Retired Physician and \u2018A-List\u2019 Medical Celebrity, Dr Joseph Chikelue Obi\u201d? Here we go... The Irish Independent  reports  that his college does not exist at the Dublin address given on the web site. There's a surprise! It's just a front. The Independent goes on. \u201cIn January 2003, he was suspended by for serious professional misconduct at South Tyneside District Hospital. Among the allegations made were that he failed to attend to patients, wrote strange notes about colleagues and at one point gave a dating agency phone number to a psychiatric patient.\u201d He was being  investigated  by the police for taking thousands of pounds off a 58 year old woman to in order to cure a long standing illness. The GMC strike Dr Obi off their register for \u201cserious professional misconduct\u201d. So much for him being retired. On another tack, Dr Obi has been involved in a little  cyber-squatting . This looks as if it took place while he was a doctor - always after a few quid! Since then, now self-titled Prof Obi, a few new avenues have been opened, including trying to entice  Kate Moss  away to one of his \u2018safe-houses\u2019 in Ireland. Hat's off! He is quoted as saying: \u201cUnder the European Convention on Human Rights, Miss Moss still has fundamental rights, just like anyone else out there, and as far as I am concerned, she is not guilty of anything until an  Ethical  Jury says so.\u201d (I mentioned  before  that \u2018ethical\u2019 was one of his favourite words.) Prof Obi has been developing a  Penis Enlarger  (watch out Kate) that his own Royal College has now endorsed. At least one person (out of the targeted million) has paid Prof Obi the fees for his college to accredit him. Dr Michael Keet ( 8 Canards ) of the  Central London College of Reflexology  handed over \u2018 hundreds \u2019. Do we feel sorry for out-quacked quacks? I guess we ought to. For those of you wanting to see behind the grand titles and see the real human being, Joseph lists his interests as  Comedy in London, Whole Food Nutrition and Christian Music . On this \u2018Meetup\u2019 site, he describes himself as \u201cJust a very ordinary guy...\u201d. That's nice. His name appears very often on the blog  Abolish The General Medical Council (GMC) , often reporting something he has got up to. The blog describes itself as: An  ethical  blog for those who publicly feel that the General Medical Council (GMC) should be Statutorily Abolished in favour of a Medical Licensing Commission (MLC) to solely register and revalidate Doctors who practise Conventional Medicine in the UK. The Blog also recommends that the GMC/MLC hands all disciplinary functions over to an Independent Clinical Tribunal (ICT) in keeping with the EU Convention on Human Rights; to avoid (both) Institutional Bias and Multiple Jeopardy. Oooh. There is that word \u2018ethical\u2019 again. And \u2018European Human Rights\u2019. No name is given for the blog author but the avatar is a portrait of the queen. Another apparent obsession of Prof Obi - royalty. Could the author be none other than the Professor himself, a little agrieved for his ticking off? I hope you all click through to the blog. Maybe we will show up in his stats and whoever the writer is can get in contact and confirm one way or another. I rather hope he is, as the final thing I turned up would just be fantastic... Is the Distinguished Provost of the Royal College of Alternative Medicine, Professor Obi now selling ethical  ring-tones ? I do hope so. Watch out Crazy Frog! Here comes the Crazy Provost... Postscript It does look like Prof Obi has read this blog. He claims on the blog \u2018Abolish The General Medical Council\u2019 the following... And now we have the GMC sending the \u2018half-wit\u2019 Quackometer Bloggers after me, who (by the way) don't even know the very meaning of the word \u2018Quack\u2019. Excellent. So I am a GMC Shill now to add to my credentials. Black ducks are not that clever, but half-witted is a bit harsh. And I don't know the meaning of the word quack. As usual for a quack, not a shred of evidence to support his claims that I have anything to do with the GMC. I have a feeling this story will re-appear. But first, I must download that ringtone... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.quackometer.net/blog/", "http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/tm_objectid=14557214&method=full&siteid=50081&headline=shamed-doctor-probe-name_page.html", "http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:uzJ65Z7cWI4J:www.quackometer.net/blog/2006/09/right-royal-college-of-pompous.html+dublin+quackery&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=uk", "http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/tm_objectid=14557214&method=full&siteid=50081&headline=shamed-doctor-probe-name_page.html", "http://www.independent.ie/national-news/banned-doctor-claims-to-head-college-that-does-not-exist-266728.html", "http://icteesside.icnetwork.co.uk/ic/sundaysun/tm_objectid=12504218%26method=full%26siteid=50081-name_page.html", "http://icteesside.icnetwork.co.uk/ic/sundaysun/tm_objectid=12504218%26method=full%26siteid=50081-name_page.html", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2006/09/right-royal-college-of-pompous.html", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2006/09/quack-word-3-doctor.html", "http://www.royalcam.org/", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2006/10/ethical-quackery-monarchy-and-kate.html", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2006/09/right-royal-college-of-pompous.html", "http://www.royalcam.org/", "http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&si=1388027&issue_id=12415", "http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/eveningchronicle/eveningchronicle/tm_method=full&objectid=14557280&siteid=50081-name_page.html", "http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2000/d2000-0922.html", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/9/prweb288934.htm", "http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2006/09/right-royal-college-of-pompous.html", "http://autoclassic.news.prweb.com/releases/2005/6/prweb255354.htm", "http://www.quackometer.net/?suspectquack=Dr+Michael+Keet", "http://www.reflexologyschool.co.uk/about.html", "http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&si=1388027&issue_id=12415", "http://comedy.meetup.com/45/members/1934916/", "http://abolishthegmc.blogspot.com/", "http://books.lulu.com/content/251773", "http://www.lulu.com/obi"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/dublin-based-quack-threatens-blogger.html", "title": "\nDublin based quack threatens blogger\n"},

{"date": "9 Jul 2007", "body": "\nI am riled. Yesterday, I was having a nice morning, espresso and chocolate croissants for breakfast, chatting with Gordon about stuff. He started to read The Observer online and shared the top story with me;  New health fears over big surge in autism. I initially wondered what the new 'health fear' was. Had someone identified a link between autism and some illness or other? As we read, it became clear that autism  was  the health problem. The article subtitle sets the agenda right away; \u00b7 Experts 'concerned' by dramatic rise \u00b7 Questions over triple jab for children It was to be an MMR story. I was fully expecting the testimony from the USA vaccine  litigation to be revealed, since it's so recent and so relevant. The  expert testimony of Dr Stephen Bustin  (blogged so well by Autism Diva), destroyed the credibility of those claiming to link MMR to autism, via the 'evidence' of measles virus in the tested children's guts. Dr Bustin examined the lab responsible for analysing the samples, and was able to prove that they had only ever detected false positives. There was no evidence of measles in any of the samples, whatsoever. Also in the same trial,  the evidence of Dr Nicholas Chadwick , showed just how far Wakefield went to misrepresent and just plain lie about his data. Dr Chadwick worked at the Royal Free with Wakefield, and analysed the samples taken from the poor autistic children. (Don't forget, these samples were from gut biopsies taken under general anaesthetic, and from lumbar punctures; how the hell did Wakefield get ethical approval for that?) At the trial,  Chadwick testified as follows ; Q.  So you personally tested while you were in Dr. Wakefield's lab gut biopsy material, CSF and PBMCs? A.  Yes, that's right. Q.  And all the results were either negative, or if they were positive it always turned out that they were false positives? A.  Yes, that's correct. Q.  Did you inform Dr. Wakefield of the negative results? A.  Yes.  Yes. I assumed the journalist, Mr Campbell, would have done at the very least a quick Google news search that would have pointed to some of the recent articles on the issue, like Dr Michael Fitzpatrick's article,\u2018 The MMR-autism theory? There's nothing in it .\u2019 which tells how Dr Bustin has been prevented by the failed but drawn out UK MMR litigation, from making public his findings on the lack of measles in all the samples. Clearly, this was all too difficult for Mr Campbell. So on to the article. The number of children in Britain with autism is far higher than previously thought, according to dramatic new evidence by the country's leading experts in the field. A study, as yet unpublished, shows that as many as one in 58 children may have some form of the condition, a lifelong disability that leads to many sufferers becoming isolated because they have trouble making friends and often display obsessional behaviour. This is rubbish. Firstly, the study is unpublished. Next, as  Public Address  has pointed out, it refers to a screening questionnaire called the  CAST (Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test) , a tool designed not to  diagnose  autism, but to flag up children who  may  turn out to be autistic. So to have screaming headlines about 1 in 58 children having autism, is just plain dumb. I'd also take issue with the claim that this study was performed by the UK's leading autism authorities.  And could journalists please stop calling people with certain conditions 'sufferers' as it really annoys them! Seven academics at Cambridge University, six of them from its renowned Autism Research Centre, undertook the research by studying children at local primary schools. Two of the academics, leaders in their field, privately believe that the surprisingly high figure may be linked to the use of the controversial MMR vaccine. That view is rejected by the rest of the team, including its leader, the renowned autism expert, Professor Simon Baron-Cohen. So here we have the MMR link. The study mentioned had absolutely nothing to do with MMR, but Mr Campbell manages to shoehorn it into the article all the same. What marvelous journalism. The two 'experts' mentioned who privately believe that autism is linked to the MMR (but not all that privately, or we wouldn't be reading about it in a major broadsheet) were both paid large sums by the claimants in the failed UK MMR litigation. They are Dr Fiona Scott and Dr Carol Stott. Guess who Dr Stott now works for, oh yeah, Andrew Wakefield, in his Texas autism  treatment shop , where he charges vulnerable and gullible parents loads of money for non-proven 'therapies'. For a fun bit of background reading on Stott, read  Bad Science , where it's also revealed that Dr Scott is not happy about the leak. Later (much later, you'd almost think it's been given less prominence  on purpose ) in the article we read; ... Professor Baron-Cohen, director of the centre and the country's foremost authority on the condition, said he did not believe there was any link between the three-in-one vaccination and autism. Genetics, better recognition of the condition, environmental factors such as chemicals and children's exposure to hormones in the womb, especially testosterone, were more likely to be the cause, he commented. 'As for MMR, at this point one can conclude that evidence does not support the idea that the MMR causes autism.' The other thing that is not discussed, is how the uptake of MMR is falling, while the numbers of children diagnosed with autism continues to rise. So how is there a link? Then we get a potted history of the MMR story, and the line, 'The medical and scientific establishment denied Wakefield's claim, described research he had co-authored as 'bad science', and sought to reassure the public, with limited success. ' Why are there quotation marks around the words  bad science ? It  was  bad science! It all becomes clear.  This is a propaganda piece, designed to make people think that there is some sort of autism MMR link, just in time for Andrew Wakefield's GMC disciplinary hearing later this month. Wakefield and two former Royal Free colleagues are due to appear before the General Medical Council next week to answer charges relating to the 1998 research. The trio could be struck off. With any luck they will be struck off. The article also advertises a book due to be released by a GP who is cashing in on the unfounded parental fears of MMR by selling single jabs.  Perhaps he's the journalist's cousin or something and he wants to give him a wee leg up. A book to be published this month by Dr Richard Halvorsen, a London GP who provides single vaccines privately to babies of parents concerned about MMR, will fuel the controversy. It will present new evidence of children allegedly being damaged by vaccinations and linking increased autism to MMR. It all ends with some good advice, tucked right in at the end; But Dr David Salisbury, national director for vaccines and immunisation at the Department of Health, said last night: 'The evidence is absolutely clear. No published study has ever shown a link between autism and the MMR vaccine. It is absolute nonsense to suggest otherwise.' Hear hear Dr Salisbury. Mr Campbell writes a loving and  respectful piece on Wakefield in the same paper, giving the disgraced doc loads of column inches to defend himself. It's entitled, ' I told the truth all along, says doctor at heart of autism row .' Of course you did Andy. That's why the  GMC  are investigating the following allegations (quotes below from GMC documents); It is alleged that the three practitioners were named as Responsible Consultants on an application made to the Ethical Practices Committee of the Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust (\u201cthe ethics committee\u201d) in 1996 to undertake a research study involving children who suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms and a rare behavioural condition called disintegrative disorder. The title of the study was  \u201cA new paediatric syndrome: enteritis and disintegrative disorder following measles/rubella vaccination\u201d. The Panel will inquire into allegations that the three practitioners undertook research during the period 1996-98 without proper ethical approval, failed to conduct the research in accordance with the application submitted to the ethics committee, and failed to treat the children admitted into the study in accordance with the terms of the approval given by the ethics committee. For example, it will be alleged that some of the children did not qualify for the study on the basis of their behavioural symptoms.   It is further alleged that the three practitioners permitted a programme of investigations to be carried out on a number of children as part of the research study, some of which were not clinically indicated when the Ethics Committee had been assured that they were all clinically indicated. These investigations included colonoscopies and lumbar punctures. It is alleged that the performance of these investigations was contrary to the clinical interests of the children. Oh, so  that's  how they managed the issue of ethical consent for dangerous, painful and invasive procedures on small children. The list of wrong doing continues; The research undertaken by the three practitioners was subsequently written up in a paper published in the Lancet in February 1998 entitled \u201cIleal-Lymphoid-Nodular Hyperplasia, Non-Specific Colitis and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children\u201d (\u201cthe Lancet paper\u201d).   It is alleged that the three practitioners inaccurately stated in the Lancet paper that the investigations reported in it were approved by the ethics committee.   The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield and Professor Walker-Smith acted dishonestly and irresponsibly in failing to disclose in the Lancet paper the method by which they recruited patients for inclusion in the research which resulted in a misleading description of the patient population in the Lancet paper. It is further alleged that Dr Wakefield gave a dishonest description of the patient population to the Medical Research Council.   The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield and Professor Walker-Smith administered a purportedly therapeutic substance to a child for experimental reasons prior to obtaining information about the safety of the substance. It is alleged that such actions were irresponsible and contrary to the clinical interests of the child. The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield was involved in advising solicitors acting for persons alleged to have suffered harm by the administration of the MMR vaccine. It is alleged that Dr Wakefield\u2019s conduct in relation to research funds obtained from the Legal Aid Board (\u201cLAB\u201d) was dishonest and misleading. It will be alleged that Dr Wakefield ought to have disclosed his funding from the LAB to the Ethics Committee but did not.   The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield ordered investigations on some children as part of the research carried out at the Royal Free Hospital from 1996-98 without the requisite paediatric qualifications to do so and in contravention of his Honorary Consultant appointment.   The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield failed to disclose his involvement in the MMR litigation, his receipt of funding from the LAB and his involvement in a Patent relating to a new vaccine to the Editor of the Lancet which was contrary to his duties as a senior author of the Lancet paper.   The Panel will inquire into allegations that Dr Wakefield acted unethically and abused his position of trust as a medical practitioner by taking blood from children at a birthday party to use for research purposes without ethics committee approval, in an inappropriate social setting, and whilst offering financial inducement. Those are some serious allegations. This little ploy of redirection and resurrection of the stinky cadaver of MMR-autism causation, is not going to detract from the GMC investigation. I hope the originator of all this gets what he deserves.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2121521,00.html", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/omnibus-hearing-ward-and-bustin.html", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/omnibus-hearing-chadwick-and-brent.html", "ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/transcripts/day10.pdf", "http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/3562/", "http://publicaddress.net/default,4331.sm#post4331", "http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/tests/cast_test.asp", "http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/thcfc_treatment.htm", "http://www.badscience.net/?p=445#more-445", "http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2121522,00.html", "http://www.gmcpressoffice.org.uk/apps/news/events/detail.php?key=1958"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/07/autism-and-mmr-bovine-excrement.html", "title": "\nAutism and the MMR; bovine excrement.\n"},
{"date": "29 Jun 2007", "body": "\nIt was my birthday on Monday. Gordon booked a night in the  Slieve Donard hotel  in Newcastle, and arranged for my dad and step-mum to come and babysit. We had such a nice time. We were away for just over 24 hours, but it was a wonderful break. The hotel was beautiful and our room (paid for with Tesco vouchers, yippee!) had views of the sea and the  Mourne Mountains  from all 5 windows. Dinner in the hotel wasn't great; not what we'd expected. Breakfast was perfect though. If there was a world contest to see what country made the best traditional breakfast, Ireland would definitely win! We spent time in the health spa (why's it called a  spa ?) on both days. There was a 20m pool with huge windows along one side, with views of the mountains sweeping down to the bay. It was all so luxurious. I didn't bother with any of the 'treatments' though. I'm far too tight for one thing, but for another, it's such nonsense. Me and Gordon were cracking up, when I was reading the leaflet in our room, describing the 'Hot Stone Therapy'. Hot Stone therapy has been used for thousands of years for harmonising, cleansing and relaxing the body at its deepest level. Volcanic in origin, Basalt lava stones are rich in minerals and can be heated and used for deep body massage and intensive energy work. They may be placed on specific energy points or Chakras to help the body clear blocked energy centres and help relax and dissolve stress, drawing excess hyper-energy away from over-stimulated areas, bringing new energy to depleted zones. Different mineralogy in cold stones may bring a cooling, clearing effect when placed on the eyelids. Isn't that fantastical? Rich in minerals eh? Minerals must be good. But isn't arsenic a mineral? And what are the benefits, how are they absorbed? And how do you relax at 'the deepest level' and my favourite bit of all, the new physics described, whereby  'hyper-energy  is drawn away from from over-stimulated areas, bringing  new energy to depleted zones .' But anyway, we loved the place. After checking out, we drove around the mountain roads, stopping off for a peaceful walk in the Silent Valley. It was a special birthday, and the best thing about it was the company. We arrived home just after 5, with a little gift for the children who had, as always, enjoyed their time with their grandparents. They'd been to the park and had ice-creams and everything! Also, my dad had mowed our seriously overgrown garden, he's such a good Daddy!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hastingshotels.com/index.cfm/website_key/5/", "http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mournemountains.com%2F&ei=F-SERum5JouuwAGhlpUL&usg=AFQjCNFTrGN2HuXFg0zx_1vWiddzz8bORA&sig2=cgOBILeNiOO05z3iD-kgNQ"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/06/minerals-and-mountains-and-my-birthday.html", "title": "\nMinerals and Mountains (and my Birthday)\n"},

Do not presume to think his worth can be measured on how social he is, how much peer pressure he succumbs to as he gets older, how much he is able to network.

{"date": "22 Jun 2007", "body": "\nLast Friday, I went to my cousin's wedding. Gordon wasn't able to go with me; work commitments. Instead I travelled across to the west with my dad and step-mum.  Gordon's mum came to our house to mind the children for a few hours, and then M. (our NAS befriender friend) came over to stay until Gordon got home. Both baby sitters said the children were no trouble at all. Phew! I had a lovely day. My little cousin was looking utterly beautiful, as all brides must! It rained all day, but she never stopped  grinning , and was a like a wee ray of sunshine all day. In between the service and the reception, we went to a cafe for a snack; my belly had been rumbling throughout the service, bloody embarrassing! Then we visited my 95 year old granny, whom I haven't seen for far too long. She was on great form too. The reception was terrific. We shared a table with one of my aunties and a few cousins and their spouses. One cousin had just had a baby so I enjoyed a few cuddles. Actually, whenever we all get together, it seems that someone has always just had a baby or is about to get married. I suppose it goes with having a large family. As always at these things, I enjoyed the crack, chatting and catching up and reminiscing about good times and also the hard times we've shared. The bride's father, my uncle, had died when she was only 8, in a work place accident, leaving her mother to raise 4 young children alone. Her eldest brother walked her up the aisle, and later gave a short, moving speech, though he was obviously nervous. And then we danced! Nothing beats the dancing at a wedding! Sunday was Father's day and Lady had made a cool card. She drew a picture of her dad with a big head and a tiny body topped by a light bulb in a thought cloud. On the back she drew another version of Gordon, with a speech bubble and the words \"BAX...BAT...apoptosis...mitochondria\" (words he uses often at work) which went down very well! Since then, it's just been same as usual round here. Lady has been reading about the Greek Myths, and started to write and illustrate a few of her own  short  stories such as; The Magic Eye One day the king Eurystheus saw that he was getting old. He wanted to see his grandchildren  but he couldn't see them if he was dead. The king had a daughter called Aneena. She was beautiful, but she didn't want to give birth. She liked the palace and she did not want to get married. This made the king cross. So one day the king put Aneena in a box and sent her away. THE END I asked her if she thought she'd get married, she said she might but not 'till she's much older. She wanted to travel around the world and go diving and go to the Great Wall of China, like her aunt C! Thomas and I were talking about letters and their sounds. I asked him if he could think of any words starting with the letter 'P' and he said 'pee, like you do in the toilet' so I agreed, that was one such word. Then he thought on and said, 'pee, like what goes under your bed'. I didn't understand this one, so he pointed to the mattress (we were in my room). I said 'that's called a mattress.' He said, ' I mean the thing that goes under it, and the loads of mattresses go on top, and then the princess has to climb up the ladder to go to bed'. Ah,  pea ...how was I missing what should have been so obvious! We also had a very interesting talk about evolution, when he asked me about dinosaurs being the scariest animals and I told him that people were never on the earth at the same time as dinosaurs. He asked me who made the first people. He liked the ape story! Thomas has worn his dad's stripy tie every day this week. He now ties it himself, wrapping it round many times so it resembles a cravat. Lady was worn a red silk scarf on her hair, topped with a pick woolly hat. She likes the way it makes her look like she has long red hair. No uniforms here! Duncan is going through a major Thomas the Tank phase again. I investigated the lead paint on engines toy recall, but none of those we have are affected, thank goodness. He and Thomas have spent hours each day setting up the 3 different types of track and telling stories. Duncan also lost his 2 bottom front teeth, and was pleased to receive money from the tooth fairy, which was exchanged for, well guess what, a 'Shiny Sir Handel' train.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/06/stuff-from-week.html", "title": "\nStuff from the week\n"},
{"date": "20 Jul 2007", "body": "\nThere's definitely an air of Harry Potter fever around here. I'm hoping it stays dry tonight as Lady and I are planning to queue up outside the bookshop at midnight to buy 'The Deathly Hallows'. We are very excited to see how it all ends, having enjoyed and discussed all the previous books in great detail. Lady has been telling me some of her latest theories, most of which involve Poly-juice potion. She's convinced Snape is evil, while I'm of the opposite opinion. Can't wait to find out! I'll read lots of it aloud tomorrow, so we can enjoy the story together. We all went to see the 'Order of the Phoenix' film the day after it was released. (We couldn't go on July 12th, since that other Order, the Order of the Orange, were having their wee walks around various towns and we just stayed at home well away from it all.) The film was great. We went to an early show and there were only a few others in the cinema with us. As I write, Lady and Thomas are playing the HP PC game. Duncan has been customising his trains. He keeps painting them with the watercolours paints. He wanted the red trim at the bottom of each engine to be lighter, so he mixes a bit of red and white to make it just right. One of his favourite toys these days, is a wipe clean drawing board, that scrolls between 4 screens, and allows for a short commentary on each screen. Duncan just uses it as a dictaphone. He keeps recording little songs or phrases and playing them back. It's hilarious! He has made the rest of us speak into it too, telling us what to say. Lady had to repeat the expression 'G for gow, G for gow, ow, ow.' What it means or where it came from, I've no idea. There's a song he sings, it's either, 'I'm a robber man' or 'I'm a rubber man'. But he shouts it really loud in this harsh rock star voice. As expected, there've been several word perfect recordings of classic Thomas The Tank Engine stories too. Duncan's speech continues to improve. He now gives me more complicated instructions like, 'Put the 2 keys in the cupboard downstairs, now.' It's a far cry from when he was almost 3, and I got all excited because he looked at a plane flying overhead and muttered something which sounded like it may have been the word 'plane'. He only knew about 10 words when he was 3. He's commenting on stories I'm reading. I was reading Snow White, and he kept looking at the picture of Snow White's mother, then one of the evil queen. After a lot of thought, he told me that 'the nice queen turned into nasty queen.' He got upset when I read about the woodcutter's instructions to kill the girl, saying 'no die! No Snow White die!' and was relieved when she got away safely. He tells the story back now, with a bit of prompting, and always emphasises that Snow White does NOT die. Thomas was talking about something peculiar Duncan did, and said he was a bit like an alien. He didn't say it in a mean way at all. It seemed he was trying to find words to express the differences between Duncan and himself and other boys. I said, 'Duncan's not an alien. He's a boy  like you. He's autistic and just does some things differently to you because of his autism.' We'll just keep talking about these sorts of things as we go. There won't be any need for a big conversation, a big revealing of the family secret, because everyone is growing up knowing about and accepting of, autistic differences.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/07/stories-and-speech.html", "title": "\nStories and Speech\n"},
{"date": "30 Jan 2008", "body": "\nWe headed off to W5 (cool science play and exploration place) yesterday with a few other HE families. The children enjoyed their day out. Thomas was so excited when he woke, wanting to leave immediately to see his best friend J. whom we haven't seen for a while. While there, I stayed by Duncan as he explored where and when he wanted, while Thomas and Lady hung out with their friends and the other families. Occasionally our paths crossed. Duncan enjoyed filming himself in front projected images of a hurricane or volcano. Mostly, he pretended to be flung around by the 'wind' but he kept breaking into song;  Kooks  by David Bowie, as heard on his  picture video . He doesn't get the pronunciation quite right, but what he's singing is instantly recognisable. He particularly likes the lines, 'And if you ever have to go to school, Remember how they messed up this old fool. Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads, cause I'm not much cop at punching Other peoples dads.' He hears the word 'cads' as 'cats' and it always makes him giggle. We had lunch in the pizza restaurant and Duncan ate ice-cream. He got really loud and angry when my friend's 2 year old son was upset, he frightened the little boy, which made Duncan more worried and aggressive behaving, shaking me and shouting. He calmed down quite soon and I had to reassure him multiple times that A. (the 2 year old) was OK. He has for a while now become very distressed when he hears anyone crying. It can be tricky when we're out somewhere and he's near a crying baby or child. He has also become more anxious and worried about things in general. If he hurts himself he asks over and over, 'Duncan will be fine, Duncan not die?' He asks the same if he hears Lady or Thomas hurt themselves. A few days ago we were playing and he scratched me by accident, causing the skin to break. I told him he had hurt me and he said sorry and went to kiss me better. But them he noticed the mark and became really distressed, running off and getting tissues and a cloth and rubbing the mark and crying. He didn't want to see the (tiny amount of) blood and it took repeated statements that I was fine, I would not die, the new skin will grow, to help him settle. Since then, he's regularly checked the progress of healing on the little mark. He's also stared to worry about the house burning down, especially if he's spilled something, and asks for reassurance about that regularly. I have noticed that he seems to feel compelled to tap twice with the side of his fists, whenever he makes a mistake in setting up his toys or if he drops something. That doesn't bother him though so it doesn't bother me either. I am concerned about his anxiety though. I'm looking forward to more daylight and nicer weather and getting outdoors more. I think we have all been inside too much over the dark winter months and fresh air and exercise will do everyone good, but especially Duncan.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/anxious-days.html", "title": "\nAnxious days\n"},
{"date": "31 Jan 2008", "body": "\nI happened to pick this up in the local library. 'Daniel Isn't Talking' by Marti Leimbach, is a mother's story. It features the typical account of the mum, this time an American in England, sensing something about her child just isn't quite right, followed by the quest to gain a diagnosis and explanation from a cold and unfeeling medical profession. Even worse, her husband and her hostile mother-in-law are adamant there is nothing amiss with the child saying the mum is worrying unnecessarily. \n \nSo anyway, I'm just going to go ahead and reveal the plot of the book, because to be honest, it's not exactly a page turner, and I wasn't enamoured of the whiny Melanie, nor convinced by the astonishing, no, miraculous intervention of the handsome rascal,  Oirish  therapist, of whom she has to say, 'He makes me laugh and he fixes my kid.' This roll-up-smoking, sexy maverick falls for the mum; ethical qualms about sleeping with your client's mother be damned. Anyway, he's presented as a far better catch for her than the uptight, cheating Brit she's married. That's the gist of it anyway. \n \nSo what about the depictions of autism and disability in this novel? Well they pissed me right off. The author has every right to create her character and make her think and say what she wants, but I'm also entitled to react as I see fit, and I didn't like it...with one exception. \n \nChapter 5 starts, \"Do everything you can in life to avoid ever visiting a developmental paediatrician, especially one in the NHS.\" \nShe then tells of the unattractive car park, the imperfect decor of the hospital, and even worse the \"posters about various conditions - dyslexia, Down's syndrome, schizophrenia - until you enter playrooms full of  badly damaged children . These children do not often smile, cannot easily speak, play not with each other but with objects that are not toys.\" (my emphasis) \n \nIn chapter 7, she visits \"a supposed centre of excellence for autistic children\" and is asked if she wants her son enrolled in their programme. The readers have just been given a precis of the flawed theories of  Bruno Bettleheim , and the programme in question uses psychotherapy, so is obviously useless to her, and brave Melanie tells the smug shrinks just that. I wonder why she bothered meeting them in the first place. Later she writes a letter to Bettleheim; \"I didn't know I could love so much as I have loved my son, my daughter. Why do you insist this isn't the case? Why do you openly despise me, despise all mothers of children with autism? \n... \nI would give my life publicly if I thought I could lift from my baby this  appalling diagnosis . If it were that  he could be normal  - just ordinary like other children - I would climb the scaffold myself...\" (my emphasis) \nNot that Bruno will ever know her thoughts, him being dead and all. \n \nThere are many references to the role of vaccines in this novel. Melanie feels guilty for having vaccinated her son and is convinced it contributed to his autism. But, it's a work of fiction, and she can invent causes of autism if she wants. If I was the author, I'd have had my character worrying about eating grapes in pregnancy or some other random and non-related event. (I recently read online somewhere, some tool's theory that children who watch cartoons are made autistic!) \n \nOne of the silliest parts of the novel, if we are to think this is based on what might happen in a real life situation, is the meeting between Melanie and a speech therapist. The speech therapist says all sorts of daft things  like, \"If I were you, however, I'd be thinking about special school and about respite care. You  really have no choice .\" (my emphasis) \nI just couldn't imagine any SALT worth their salt (I know, that was pathetic, but I'm not a writer) even saying that. But it gets worse: \n \n\"I'm telling you for a fact this is a big one, autism. Regular speech therapists like me can't even touch it. \n... \nI'm not qualified to treat this kind of thing.\" \n \nThis speech therapist, we are led to believe, has no advice or recommendations to give the mum. Nothing. \n \nThis is just bollox. \n \nI know it's a work of fiction, and set in a parallel world where it is likely that vaccinations cause autism, so it's just as likely in such a world that a SALT would have zero advice for the parent of a non-verbal 3 year-old beyond 'put him in a special school.' \n \nBut the speech therapist is really just a plot device to introduce us to the lovable Irish rogue and ABA therapist, Andy. He's going to  draw Daniel out of his autistic state  and fall for his mother. He's expensive, but he's worth it. \n \nMelanie says, \"Autism turns out to be an expensive condition. That is, if you treat it.\" \n \nBut what is it she's paying for; ABA therapist, a therapist for herself, a cleaner, bills for private doctors, homeopaths, kinesiologists craniosacral therapists, oh and gluten and casein are excluded from Daniel's diet. Obviously.  The only thing in that list of any proven benefit, is a cleaner. Thankfully Melanie can raise cash to waste by selling some of their stuff and she happens to have a spare country cottage. \n \nThe book is set in England where the NHS provides free health care so why is she forking out for doctors? There are also free schools and nurseries for those who want them and disability benefits are available though the claims procedure is a nightmare. \n \nAt least Melanie did buy Daniel the 'girl's' buckle shoes he wanted, though the dragon-lady sales assistant was over-done. \n \nSo I didn't like this book, didn't like how autism is portrayed, the 'devastation rhetoric' used, the disablist language, the improbable love story, the way it's assumed that autism is not just an evil thief of innocent children, but an expensive one at that. \n \nWouldn't it be nice if there was a book where the child happened to be autistic, which caused challenges and meant that the family had to make choices they might not otherwise have made, but where there was fun and silliness, where education and parenting are deemed all that are necessary to ensure the autistic child's optimal development and where expensive unproven quack therapies are scoffed at, not embraced. \n \nThere's a line in the book; \"Other people don't have children with autism. They're not entitled to have an opinion.\" \n \nWell I do, and I am.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.neurodiversity.com/bettelheim.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/daniel-isnt-talking.html", "title": "\nDaniel Isn't Talking\n"},

{"date": "5 Feb 2008", "body": "\nHere's something we knew already, the MMR vaccine doesn't cause autism. It prevents measles, mumps and rubella, which is nice, but it's as likely to cause autism as living in a a house with a south facing garden, i.e.  not at all ! The latest study, gratifyingly published  in the front page of today's Guardian , involved testing the blood of 250 children, all of whom received the MMR, for traces of measles virus. No differences were found between the children diagnosed as autistic and the typically developing children. No signs of bowel disease were discovered either. This will not convince any of the die hard believers, for whom it's a matter of faith to keep deluding themselves that Wakefield cared for the children he scoped, that all the energy and fight they invested into backing up Wakefield's random  notion  must be true. Never mind that when you make an extraordinary claim like that, you need some damned good evidence to back it up, and none...zero evidence was forthcoming. Did the Wakefield faithful read this Daily Mail article last December,  \"\u00a3500,000 for boy left fighting for life after being used as MMR guinea pig.\" How was Wakefield  caring  for Jack Piper, whose bowel was perforated in more than 12 places during surgery at the Royal Free Hospital in North London in 1998? According to High Court papers, Jack's surgery was 'not clinically indicated or justified' and was principally performed to further research into links between autism and bowel conditions. I can only hope that this study will help reassure parents deciding how best to protect their children from infectious diseases. It would be great if some of those convinced that their own children's autism was caused by the MMR, would reconsider, would stop seeing their children as damaged or poisoned. Too many people have been fleeced by irresponsible charlatans claiming to 'heal' via the various silly or even dangerous methods they employ, from chelation or homeopathy to unnecassarily restricted diet combined with a host of useless supplements.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/feb/05/health.children", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/healthmain.html?in_article_id=500611&in_page_id=1766&ito=1490"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/say-it-loud-mmr-is-not-linked-to-autism.html", "title": "\nSay it loud; MMR is not linked to autism\n"},

Ah well, if you read this, and it bores you, too bad. When I was 7 and making my first communion, I wanted to be a nun like my teacher. When I was 33 or so, I came to accept that I just don't believe in god any more. (I blame  Bertrand Russell .) I clean our toilet about 4 times a day. It comes from having little boys with imperfect aim. I like things to be clean, but am not too worried by mess, well as long as it's not out of control. As a child, I lived in the countryside, surrounded by fields and cows. I used to like singing to the cows. They'd always walk to the gate to look at me, weird thing that I must have appeared. When I was 7, my nun teacher used to frequently tell me off for walking around with my hands in my pockets. She said I'd get badly hurt if I fell over. I'm doing the best job in the world right now. My co-workers are wonderful people. The pay sucks though. I have a very big family. I have 5 siblings and both my parents came from large families. Unusually for Irish families, non of their siblings left the country, so I grew up with bucket loads of aunts, uncles and cousins.

{"date": "15 Jun 2007", "body": "\nMom26children has a  post  which got me thinking. When I introduce my children, I do not introduce them as Autistic children. My children are individuals who happen to be autistic. I am lucky, they do not misbehave in public..they learned very early that they would be removed from situations if they could not behave appropriately in public. Even Caitlin and Kiernan know this. Just because you have an Autistic child does not give them free reign to disturb others in a public situation. If that was the case, we could allow any person to disrupt any situation. If you want your Autistic children to be taken seriously, you must take your Autistic child seriously. How can we prepare our Autistic children for their future and being accepted by society if we allow them, as children, to act inappropriately in public? Just because your child was given the diagnosis of Autism does not mean you have to stop parenting your child....   I agree that you have to keep parenting the child. I don't agree that I cannot allow him to act inappropriately in public. Not if acting appropriately means emulating what would be expected from a typically developing child. My son often behaves in ways that would be described as 'bad'. I don't doubt that his behaviour disturbs other people too. For example, last week I took the children to the zoo and met with several other home-educating families. Duncan wanted to sit in his Major buggy (large pushchair thing) which is good because it gives him somewhere to go and hide under a coat when he wants some peace. We passed the playground and most of the children went on the equipment. Duncan sat in his buggy for about 10 minutes watching them, though I asked him a few times if he wanted to play. Suddenly he jumped out and climbed the steps of the popular and crowded climbing frame/slide. He screeched happily as he went. When he came down the slide, he didn't want to get off. He wanted to climb up the slide. I told him that children were coming down, climb up the steps. He refused and started to cry hard. I had to hold him to stop him from climbing up while the others were coming down. I tried to comfort him, telling him we'd see the animals. He just got into a major state. It was unexpected. He screamed and thrashed. He hit at me, though as always he held back from actually hurting me. It would have  looked  bad though. I sat on the ground beside him for about 15 minutes while he got settled again. The place was packed with school groups and loads of little kids were staring at us. The teachers were staring too, but more discreetly. See, he kicks off some times. He tantrums or makes noise or flails his arms around. It looks bad. Gordon gets really upset when this happens in public, but I don't. I'm getting better at helping him, he's getting better at calming down. People can stare and tut and whatever all they like. I don't have the same expectation of him as I do of his non-autistic siblings. I would be horrified if either of them had a outburst like he does sometimes. This is part of his autism. It's part of his developmental disability. If he were unable to walk, I wouldn't expect him to run. If he were blind, I wouldn't expect him to see. He's still learning the skills to regulate his behaviour. He gets overwhelmed. He can't explain what it is that is upsetting him, or what it is he wants. It feels to him that his world is falling apart. While he was upset last week, I was trying some of the stuff that I've said before to help him. I empathised with his mood, told him that I knew he was angry. I told him I would help him. I tried to playfully ask him to 'take the grump out and throw it away' (it helps sometimes!) but he wanted to be angry. What eventually helped was my telling him that he is angry today, he will be happy tomorrow. He often refers to any time in the future as 'tomorrow'. That seemed to make him realise that this feeling would go away. I seriously considered dragging all the children back to the car and home. Is that what is meant by removing them from the situation? But that would have been unnecessary and Duncan wouldn't have learned anything from it. I have cut events short before, but it wasn't warranted then. Afterwards, the day was lovely and we all had a fantastic time. I find it hard to parent Duncan at times, harder than with his siblings. It's not impossible though. It just doesn't come so easily to me. I'm definitely on a learning journey. We both are.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://survivingmotherhood-mom26children.blogspot.com/2007/06/parenting-is-not-so-difficult.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/06/parenting-is-not-so-easy.html", "title": "\nParenting is Not So Easy\n"},
{"date": "5 Feb 2008", "body": "\nI've got the best job in the world. For some reason, my 3 children are all total snuggle monkeys. They like nothing better than to climb into our big bed in the mornings for some hug time. A few nights ago, I finished reading the latest chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to Thomas, his choice of bedtime reading, and tucked him in. He asked that I lie with him for a minute to chat and cuddle. He said that he just loved hugging me, he was 'the king of snuggling mummies.' We always have the best discussions at the end of the day. We discussed, as we so often do, life, death, birth and growth. Thomas is jealous of his best friend J. whose mum is pregnant and wants to know why he can't have another brother or sister, after all, J. already has a little brother. He also informed me that he will love me for a trillion years. I told him that we wouldn't exist for that long, but he said he'd love me anyway even when he's dead. So the questions started about what it's like to be dead, and I said that no-one can know, but it must be like how it was before you were born, except the people still alive remember you and think about you. So he started on about what he remembered from before birth and decided it wasn't a lot. He wanted to know how he managed to grow inside me, so I told him about how my food was used to make all the bits of the growing baby, just the way the food he eats now gets changed into bits of hair and blood and bones and all the bits of growing boy. I'm sure that the main way in which he and Lady learn, is from the many conversations we all have about everything under the sun. I don't know the answers to many of their questions, but we always know where to look for them. And anyway, Gordon's quite good at that science and ting. (Boast time, he just was awarded an NIH grant.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/king-of-cuddles.html", "title": "\nKing of cuddles\n"},
{"date": "31 Jan 2008", "body": "\nLast autumn, I read 'The Speed of Dark' by Elizabeth Moon, and just last week, I borrowed 'Daniel Isn't Talking' by Marti Leimbach. Both are works of fiction with an autistic character, but they are very different in style and tone, and I much preferred the former novel. 'The Speed of Dark' is set in the near future, and all genetic disorders are prevented or cured in early childhood. (This fictional future is like the realisation of all the fondest dreams of the wealthy organisation,  Autism Speaks . Its co-founder Suzanne Wright has said she hopes for a future when autism is merely \"a word for the history books.\" ( link: www.autismspeaks.org/sponsoredevents/new_decade_for_autism.php ) In a  recent interview  she said, \"we try to stem the tide and ultimately eradicate autism for the sake of future generations.  If we continue our current trajectory, we\u2019ll get there in my lifetime.\" That'd be about 20 years from now.) Our protagonist, Lou, is a young autistic man, born just too early to be cured of his autism so he and his work colleagues are among the last generation of autistic people alive. He underwent intensive training as a child to help him conform as much as possible to the non-autistic majority. He works for a pharmaceutical company, in a small section where all the employees are autistic, and where their autistic strengths, like pattern recognition and attention to detail,  are used to benefit the company. A few work place accommodations including a trampoline in a recreation room and allocated parking spaces, help to keep these competent employees content and productive. However, the company is promoting a novel treatment for autism and is pressuring their autistic employees to opt for the surgery. I enjoyed the insight into Lou's inner life, his friendships, enemies and interests. I cared about this character, though I didn't find some of the other characters so convincing, especially those depicted as all good or thoroughly rotten. The ending (and this is a bit of a spoiler) was horrific and chilling, to me anyway. It jolted with the rest of the book, but that may have been the author's aim. It certainly was not what I expected, and I found it just so upsetting. Others may differ and consider what was depicted as the best possible outcome.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2008/edition_01-27-2008/Autism_Changes_Everything"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/01/speed-of-dark.html", "title": "\nThe Speed of Dark\n"},
{"date": "6 Feb 2008", "body": "\n On Duncan's treasured  Green Eggs and Ham  CD Rom, there's a sample of a story called  Stellaluna . He took an interest in this, and looked it up on Google video, finding a film of a  woman discussing the book , which he watches and quotes from frequently. Since he loves this book so much, I ordered him a copy. He was delighted when the postman arrived with his parcel. He immediately started reading the first few pages, then listened as I read the rest. I'd never heard of Stellaluna before and it's a really lovely story, about a baby fruit bat who is separated from her mother, then sheltered and fed by a bird family. She has to quash her bat ways, of flying by night and sleeping upside down and behave 'properly', like a bird. Eventually she is reunited with her own mother and rest of the bats. She wants her friends, the baby birds to enjoy the ripe fruit and thrill of night time flying, but they all realise that's not the best thing for birds. The birds and bats discuss their differences and similarities and conclude that in spite of everything, they are good friends. Duncan has referred to himself as Stellaluna many times, and says I am the mother bat. Then he puts on a small, high voice and says, 'mother, where are you?' and I have to swoop down and wrap my arm-wings around him. He has also pretended to be the mother bat. He put on Lady's dressing gown, tying it tight around his waist, then he stuffed a few soft toys under the robe and wrapped his flappy sleeves around them. If it wasn't for him, I'd never have heard of this book. I'll just add it to the list of things he's taught me about.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511pw3tNzHL._SS500_.jpg", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stellaluna-Janell-Cannon/dp/0152062874/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/202-7834978-4227046?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202300152&sr=8-1", "http://www.expotv.com/videos/reviews/4/52/Stellaluna/93966"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/stellaluna.html", "title": "\nStellaluna\n"},
{"date": "7 Feb 2008", "body": "\nYesterday's Irish Independent contained a story about a family with two children who \"suffer from autism.\" Both our beautiful boys have autism How we have coped since discovering that ... County Wicklow parents Cian and Yvonne O'Cuanachain had battled for 68 days in the High Court for the State to provide Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) education for their son, Sean, who is autistic. Last week they lost their \u20ac2m fight. The courts ruled they had produced insufficient evidence to prove their case, and said they must meet their legal costs.       Their's was regarded as a test case, so the verdict spells bad news for    thousands of other parents round the country, including Ken and Janice Berry    from west Dublin. These people were not claiming that their son deserves a good, suitable education. They were claiming a very specific style of therapy, one which is often erroneously claimed to be the only treatment for autism with any scientific validity. The Berrys, in common with many parents, believe that ABA    is essential for the educational and social development of many autistic    children.  I take issue when a parent's 'belief' is taken as evidence that vaccines caused autism, or that homeopathy helps autism. I take issue with the statement above too; where is the proof that \"ABA is essential to the educational and social development\" of  any  autistic children? The ruling also places a new question mark over over the future of    their son, Aaron. How? Are they claiming that without ABA his future prospects are diminished? The article then details the \"tragedy\" of two autism diagnosis in the family, and the delay in attaining these so that they lost, \"valuable time in each case.\" The boys are 6 and 5 years old. The 6 year old was diagnosed 17 months ago and the 5 year old, 6 months ago. Since the parents noticed signs of developmental delay in their first son when he was only 2, it is disgraceful that they had to wait so long. The boys' father says;  \"Around the age of two, Cathal went into    regression,\" he says. \"He had been speaking, he had been saying    'Mammy', 'Daddy', 'Mammy, drink', then suddenly silence, he began to cover    his ears as if he couldn't bear sounds,\" says Janice.       I'm not sure if this can be described as regression. It seems to be to me to be typical of the way autistic children develop, but correct me if I'm wrong. They learnt the hard way that parents of    children with autism have to wait for everything, including assessment, and    the waiting list then was two years plus. Now this is where I think money should be spent. The Irish health authority, rubbish as it is, needs to take responsibility and start supporting these families early, helping them get the paediatric assessments they need as early as possible, so the parents are not left wondering just what is going on, and will be able to adapt their lives to best support their children. The elder boy, Cathal, was assessed at a centre opened by a voluntary organisation, Irish Autism Action. The article continues; \"We were told that Cathal had mild autism. He could go to mainstream    school, and needed six hours of special needs assistance at school, as well    as occupational therapy and speech therapy. For me, it was like getting the    prescription. It was a great relief, like: 'Thank God, I have the piece of    paper; now we can do something, we can get on with it',\" says Ken.      \"I was floored. It was pure misery and I found it very hard,\" says    Janice.       I'm not sure  what  was \"pure misery\" to the mum, but I'll assume it was dealing with the educational authorities. So their 6 year old attends a mainstream primary school and has a special needs    assistant with him in the classroom for five hours a day. His parents have also converted their attic into a classroom where they work with him using flash cards and educational toys, and they pay for a private teacher teaches him \"life skills\" four hours a week. At a reassessment of their son last December, he was diagnosed as having \"high-functioning autism.\" But meanwhile, the unthinkable had happened. A year    after Cathal's assessment, their second son, Aaron, was diagnosed with    autism, in a more severe form than Cathal's.      Aaron has little or no verbal communication, he also needs speech and    occupational therapy, but educationally, he will not benefit from mainstream    education. Many children with autism do much better in an educational system    called Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), and Aaron's diagnosis pointed in    this direction. \"I mourned Aaron. You mourn the child you will never    have,\" said Ken, as Janice nodded in agreement.      Aaron sounds a lot like Duncan, my own autistic son. As for mourning, I can understand that when your child is autistic, most parents are sad at first, since the overwhelming image of autism in wider society is of a condition that is  the closest thing to bereavement on this earth , a terrible  burden ,  a dead soul in a live body ,  devastating , causes  80% of parents to divorce . Oh my. I think this is a good time to promote the essay by Jim Sinclair entitled,  Don't Mourn for Us . The Irish Independent article continues; ABA, a behaviourist approach to children with autism, was pioneered at the    University of California. ABA teaches behaviour modification, speech    therapy, social skills training, using short intensive teaching periods,    with lots of reinforcement and measurable goals. Such early intervention    before the age of five and lasting two years  seems  to greatly help some    children with autism both socially and intellectually. (my emphasis)    All the above is true, but the key word is  seems . ABA is just one way of teaching autistic children, but because something seems to help is not a good enough reason to insist on state funding for this particular method. The article informs that the younger son, Aaron, qualifies for a home tutor for 20 hours per week. \"It    is just a matter of luck that she has ABA experience, and because of this,    Aaron is coming along well. She has Aaron dressing himself, cleaning his    teeth -- she works one-to-one. The bad news is that we will lose her in June    and we have no guarantee that her replacement will have the ABA experience.    As far as we are concerned, this will make a huge difference to Aaron's    progress and development,\" says Janice.       I don't understand why they are so concerned that the tutor has ABA training. More important, I'd have thought, is that the tutor has a good relationship with their son, is good at finding teaching moments and caters to their son's learning style, whether that be very structured or not, and that their son enjoys spending time with the tutor. I think they have also underestimated the abilities of their son in saying that the tutor 'had' him making all the progress. They say they can well understand marriages coming a-cropper where there is    an autistic child in the family. \"It takes its toll on every single    aspect of the relationship. Here is the obligatory reference to autism's awesome powers of destruction. Kevin Whelan, CEO of Solas,    Ireland's first national diagnostic centre for autism, says \"It has been proven worldwide that early    accurate diagnosis, coupled with early intensive intervention, increases the    child's opportunity for positive development and success. Up until recently,    families were waiting 18 months or more to receive a full diagnosis from the    HSE, and longer for an assessment of educational and medical needs. This    represents very valuable time lost, which can never be regained.\"  I'd like to see this myth quashed. There is no time window for intervention, after which the damage is irreversible. Autistic people, like anyone else, will continue to learn and develop throughout their lives. For reasoned critique of the over-hyped claims of the ABA lobby, read the many articles by  Michelle Dawson , a researcher in autism. She recently  blogged about a UK paper  in which the progress of 28 children receiving intensive home-based ABA intervention was compared against that of children attending an autism specific nursery. All the children were autistic and after over 2 years of the various interventions, there were no significant differences in outcome. She also addresses the claims that there is good scientific evidence for the effectiveness of ABA, among other places,  here .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/parenting/how-we-have-coped-since-discovering-that-1282476.html", "http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/we-lost-our-son-to-autism-but-now-he-is-finding-his-way-back-to-us-1166478.html", "http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/Nov/22/hes-a-burden/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/womenfamily.html?in_article_id=90643&in_page_id=1799", "http://www.iol.ie/%7Eisa1/aib_award.htm", "http://www.autismtoday.com/articles/How_You_Look_At_It.htm", "http://web.syr.edu/%7Ejisincla/dontmourn.htm", "http://www.sentex.net/%7Enexus23/cv.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/08/autism-and-aba-in-uk-controlled-trial.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/01/mr-dohertys-science.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/irish-autism-advocates-obsession-with.html", "title": "\nIrish Autism Advocates Obsession with ABA\n"},

Optional: Proudly display the \u2018Thinking Blogger Award\u2019 with a link to the post that you wrote.   When I started blogging at the start of January 2006, I was simply intending to have a kind of online diary, that only a few friends and family would ever choose to read. The emphasis, I felt, would be on home-education. It transpired that I probably focus more on autism. I do mostly just record what we've been up to, but every so often, I get on my soap box and give out about the state of the world. My blog stats show that I'm certainly no big player, but a heck of a lot more people read this stuff than I ever expected. In my favourite blogs, I would read something that inspired and affected me, challenging my assumptions and giving me better insight into the issues of autism, disability and home-education. It's hard to limit the selection to only 5, but made slightly easier if I do not tag those blogs I know have already been chosen for this award. As for these others, there's a chance they will have been tagged without my knowledge, but in that case they should revel in the admiration!

These women opened my eyes to the sh!t autistic people have to deal with, explain the rampant disablism, describe what can be done to improve things and every post produced by each is an absolute must read.

But sure, I'll put her down anyway. This woman is a ruby. She is clever, dogged, unfailingly polite, thorough, fair, compassionate, dedicated and whatever the highest award available to bloggers is, she should get one. She writes about autistic advocacy and anti-scientific theories of autism causation and 'treatment'. My favorite home-education themed blog at the minute is by Dani and Allie, and is called  Green House by the Sea . As well as writing lovingly about their really cool children and their path of autonomous learning, their contemplations on education and parenting are always thought provoking. And Finally, I give you,  Diary of a Goldfish , whom I've only been reading for a short time, since she arranged the terrific Blogging Against Disablism Day.

{"date": "4 Jun 2007", "body": "\nIt's been a while since I last posted. I've been busy, and did much reading and thinking over the weekend. However, life has gone on and there are several things I want to make note of before I forget them. Like, our trip to the playground last Thursday, when we met up with a gang of other home-educating families, with some old friends and some new ones. It was wet and often cold, but the children still had fun. Lady has at last mastered the art of swinging, and she played most of the time with another 8 year old girl whom she really likes. Thomas paired up with his best buddy, and I rarely spoke to him for the few hours we were there. He was much too busy playing! Duncan enjoyed it too, although he did keep running to the exit at first, saying he wanted to go to McDonald's (we'd passed one on the way there). Eventually he got into the swing of it too, climbing and sliding and having a grand old time. He was on great form, and although I stayed close and kept a careful watch on him, I rarely had to intervene. He did catch me out somewhat when he slid down the slide, ran to the grass verge, and stood to pee. But it was a heck of a lot more socially acceptable than doing it while up the climbing frame! Also, once he approached a man who was holding his daughter's toy Woody (from Toy Story) and was reaching out to touch the toy. I told him it was the little girl's toy, and he left it at that. I explained to the man that Duncan is autistic; he smiled and was perfectly nice. Our friends came to the house after and the children continued to play while we had tea and a chat and warmed up again! In the evening I was reading to Thomas, a story about a dog taking another dog's bone. I asked him what it's called when someone takes what isn't theirs, he said 'it's called, rude!' Fair enough! Duncan has continued to draw loads. I took photos of all his most recent art works. I like to see the progression in his ability. I've put them on Flickr  here  (they're public). Lady has been marvellous lately. I am so proud of that girl. It's so nice to have an 8 year old daughter about the house, especially when she can make a fine cup of tea! Earlier she showed me a marvellous Superman story she's written. As she was leaving, I asked her for a hug and told her how much I love her and that she is a bright light in my life. She said, 'Thanks! But so is Duncan and so is Thomas!' She always wants to have them included too. So much for the 'poor damaged sibling of the disabled child' theory. On Friday night, Gordon's Mum babysat again. She is such a star! We went to a dinner dance, (or ball, if you're feeling posh.) I got the tickets from a woman who goes to salsa class with me, and proceeds from the evening were going to the charity that pays for Gordon's research. We had such a good night out. The food was terrible and the wine was rough, but that was not why we were there. (And also, we are both far too fussy these days! I've been spoiled by Gordon's good cooking.) But there was a live, 2-man band, playing fun, wedding-type music, and we chatted and danced, and I even did a little bit of salsa. Though, I now realise that strappy sandals are not best suited for this. Duncan was enjoying the  Pixar  site today, especially the short film  Knick Knack . He's been singing the Bobby McFerrin music from that film for the past few days, and we've all joined in. He sings, 'do-be-de do-be do-be do-be-de,' and we go 'wa-wa, wa-wa wa wa-wa-wa-wa.'

They have a school and a farm, grow vegetables organically and are more than 60% self sufficient.\nGlencraig had been set up in 1954 as a place where children with special needs could be educated and looked after. Today, it is a community that has grown to include all ages. \nI live fairly close to Glencraig, and I knew it contained a school where most of the children were autistic. So 2 years ago, I went to look around the place on its open day. I had not realised that the children  live  at the school. Obviously, that alone meant there was  no way  Duncan would be going there.\n\nBut the ethos of the place did not appeal either. It was all very  nice , the staff seemed kind, the farm was well tended and impressive, the building's colours were muted and calm and there were wax pictures and candles and handwoven rugs in abundance.\n\nThere were teachers who also had roles as house parents, as the children and adult residents lived on-site in homes of about 15 people, together with the co-workers; mostly students on a gap-year after leaving school.\n\nBut where were the computers, the augmentative communication devices? How free were the residents to come and go as they pleased? Were they really helping each person develop to the best they could be? How did the children cope without their parents?\n\nThe article continues;\n\n\n \n \nI later discovered that Glencraig is a place where some very precious words are never preached, but practised every day: 'Love thy neighbour as thyself'.\n\nAnd it was only later that I got the opportunity to make a film about Glencraig, a film that might also prompt us to look at the way we live our lives. \nThere is no doubt it is a nice place and the people choosing to work there want to help others and create a peaceful environment. Several of the staff spoke of how they were a community, how they learned as much from the residents as they taught them. I may be overly cynical, but was it more than platitudes? I wonder if there is still bullying, if some residents are miserable. Is any place free from such problems? Do the staff have any concept of the advocacy movements by people with Down Syndrome and autism? Are they interested? They said that everyone has a say, but can the residents make decisions about anything more important than what to have for dinner?\n\nOne of the staff describes how they assign tasks so everyone has a role to play;\n\n\n \n \n\"If someone is autistic and can only push a wheelbarrow that's OK,\" said Paul. \"We need someone to push a wheelbarrow. Someone else can pick the peas. Someone else can pack and process them.\" \nWhile watching the film, they showed a young blind woman. A co-worker told talked about this woman's role in the laundry, where she does no work, but brings cheer and light to the room. The same woman was shown playing music (a lute, I think) beautifully, with deep concentration and skill. I wondered, (accepting that I don't know anything about her beyond the short amount shown), how in a place that values the work of each person, they couldn't find a more active role for this woman.\n\nThe article finishes;\n\n \n \nAnother truth was that in a world that has mostly lost its relationship with the earth there was a huge respect for it and for the rhythms of the day and of the year. The seasons were very important at Glencraig and the life of the community revolved round them and were cherished and celebrated.\n\nAnd then there was the truth of the light. The candle. A simple symbol that the\nfounder of Camphill, Dr Karl Konig, loved. It was hard not to notice the candles\nat Glencraig, especially at festival times, gentle and tender and bright and everywhere.\n\n\"We do not label people,\" said John. \"Labelling people diminishes us. Everyone is equal here. Everyone is special. There is a light inside every human being.\"  \nI wondered if all the residents enjoy all the ceremonies, the candles and singing and joining of hands on the lawn. Were all the autistic residents really happy with that? I also disagree with the idea that a label diminishes anyone. Autism, is not an add-on, but an integral part of a person. Duncan's autism is a part of him and how he perceives and interacts with the world. To ignore his autism would not help him.\n\nI'm not at all sure that I'm being fair here. I hope that everyone at Glencraig is truly happy, fulfilled and cherished. It is a lot better than many of the alternatives, and without it, the residents might well be much worse off. But it did come across to me as a nice, Steiner-y prison.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.glencraig.org.uk/", "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2612444.ece"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/06/many-children-came.html", "title": "\nMany children came\n"},
{"date": "10 Jun 2007", "body": "\nIt's Duncan's 7th birthday, though he insists he is still 6. He's had a nice day. His Granda came around yesterday with a present; a Brio train set, with a  level crossing ! He set it up immediately and played with cars crossing the tracks. Late in the afternoon, the whole family took him to his favourite toy shop so he could choose his gift. He picked a fancy station for his 'noisy trains'. He and Thomas played with it for hours when they got home. When I'd asked him last week what he wanted for his birthday present, he said,'Percy runs away, Ladybird book. Henry stuck in the tunnel, Ladybird book.' So I ordered them from Amazon and hid them in my room. I gave them to him this morning, still in the brown padded envelope, which I know is much more exciting to him than wrapping paper. He was delighted with his books and I had to read the oh so familiar story of Percy the cheeky engine, right away. It was warm and sunny today, and the paddling pool was out. The children from next door came round, and Gordon's mum joined us in the afternoon. I'd made a chocolate cake, and decorated it with an icing train track, then stuck his toy Percy on top, and jutting into a pile of the chocolate icing. This was to recreate the scene in 'Percy Runs Away' when Percy runs into a bank of earth. Duncan thought this was marvellous. We all sang happy birthday, he sang loudest of all, but covered his ears all the same! Gordon wanted to take his photo, and Duncan negotiated with him, agreeing to pose only if he could also hold his new Ladybird book. So the first few photos were of the book covering his face, then he lowered it for, what I'm sure you'll agree, is a very lovely birthday photo! He's my gorgeous boy, and I love him so much.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.flickr.com/photos/thevoyage/540274792/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/thevoyage/540274670/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/06/duncan-is-7.html", "title": "\nDuncan is 7!\n"},

Lady is writing a letter (long overdue) to her best friend in London, and I've just spent some time with both boys in turn, doing a little phonics practice. I'd printed out the 'disks' from this  free phonics resource  years ago when Lady was learning to read. Duncan has not sat down to do phonics before, but he got the hang of it right away, and just flew through the words! He did 7 pages, before I saw he was getting a bit bored. He was able to decipher all the words, though I had to listen hard as he insisted on whispering them. I was very impressed. Then I repeated the exercise with Thomas. He only did 3 pages, he was much less interested! Anyway, I'm not too worried. We will just do a few minutes each day, and avoid potential tantrums, from all 3 of us! Lady goes to Brownies tonight and I go to salsa class. I arranged today to take Thomas to a gymnastics and trampolining class on Friday afternoon. I'm going to let Duncan try the class out too, even though it's for 5 year olds. It might be better for him to do something with younger children. The woman I spoke to sounded supportive, so we'll just have to see how it goes. The other thing is, Duncan has decided that he now wants to go to Disneyland Paris! We went out to a nearby playground on Sunday evening, and he was convinced we were all going on the aeroplane! Oh boy, just a few weeks too late! Anyway, we were only in the park 10 minutes when a pair of men came to close and lock it up. They were so grumpy, giving the children real cross looks- Duncan in particular! Duncan was protesting, he didn't want to leave when we'd just arrived, but I wasn't aware it closed as early as 7pm! These fellas were like characters from the Beano! Anyway, I reckon I will just have to go back to Disneyland with Duncan, leaving the other 2 with Gordon.

{"date": "12 May 2007", "body": "\nLast Saturday, I took the boys to meet up with 2 of my brothers and their families, at the zoo. It's the first time Duncan has been in over a year; our last visit to the zoo together was very difficult. This time I planned more carefully. I made a little book showing exactly what we'd be doing, went to the shop on the way to ensure I had enough drinks and snacks, and brought some money for the inevitable ice-cream van. Duncan decided that he wanted to go in his Major buggy, which was a heck of a lot easier for me than having to carry him on my back on the hilly zoo paths. We ended up having a lovely time with friends and relations, and everyone benefited from my big bag of snacks. There was a nice group around for dinner after the zoo visit (M&S curry; very nice) and my youngest brother stayed overnight with his girlfriend and daughter. We don't get to see them anything like often enough since we all live so far apart. My sister phoned when they were all here and was jealous to be missing out. That's the problem with living in London. Hopefully she'll move back eventually, (ah go on C!) The Belfast Marathon took place on Monday. My SIL was running the whole damn thing, her first ever marathon! What a woman. I went out early with Lady and Thomas, hoping to see her and her sisters and cheer them on a bit. But I missed them, they'd either ran past before I arrived or when I'd left. Unfortunately, Thomas was too cold to stay for any longer. At least I recognised  one  of the runners. The other spectators were just standing around silently when we got there. I started clapping (to Lady's embarrassment) and thankfully a few people joined me, so I didn't feel like such a plonker. But for god's sake, those runners deserved a bit more than stony-faced observation as they stomped the windy streets of Belfast for 26.2 miles! On Friday, the boys had their 2nd gymnastics lesson. It's a class for 5 year olds, and I had agreed with the manager that Duncan could try it out, and that I'd stay with him. Thomas loves the class. He has been wonderful too, really putting every effort into whatever they're doing, and following all instructions and requests. It shows that he didn't need to go to nursery or school for a few years to be able to line up and take turns and follow a class. His little face was shining with excitement and joy at one stage, when they were dong some stretching exercises and the teacher was asking them to pretend their fingers were spiders running along the floor in front of them. He was showing off a bit on the trampoline too, but not too much. That's my boy! Duncan was frightened when we went there at first and sat beside me looking around. Then he started to explore and soon he was running around the whole room. He mostly ran around doing his own thing, jumping and climbing and leaping into the foam pit. But a few times, and much more so during the 2nd class, he joined the other children and copied them, especially when they were doing a little circuit of activities. The teacher has just recently moved from the region of London we used to live in, and taught a class of autistic children there, so she's very open minded and flexible about Duncan. She agrees that he's better off getting familiar with the place and equipment at first, and we encourage him to join in as much as possible, rather than try to compel him to do so. Anyway, both boys are enjoying the class. Lady quite likes it too, since she stays with Duncan to help him and look after him (though I have my eagle eye on him at all times too, and have to do a wee bit or redirection now and then). Lady also has had permission to have a go on the trampoline when the class are finished with it! Today, I'm busy helping Lady and Gordon prepare for their week long holiday in Toronto. Gordon's Mum is also going. This trip is our 80th birthday present to her! They will be meeting up with Gordon's cousin who lives there, and Lady is especially excited about meeting his daughter, who is exactly her age and whom she hasn't met before. We've been reading about all the various things to do and see in Toronto. It looks like a great city and they are all guaranteed to have a marvellous time. I'll miss them, but knowing they are all enjoying themselves so much, and that Lady and Gordon will have a good chance for some father-daughter time together, means I'm not going to be jealous. Well not  too  much!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/05/zoo-gymnastics-and-toronto.html", "title": "\nThe Zoo, Gymnastics, and Toronto.\n"},
{"date": "29 Apr 2007", "body": "\nGordon's Jamaican cousin is over from England for the weekend with her 1 year old daughter. The baby is so gorgeous and we've all loved playing with her and making her laugh. She has such a smile, wow, it's really precious. I got lots of cuddles, especially when her mum was away briefly with Gordon. I got a good fix of baby girl deliciousness! But the big story is, Thomas was 5 today. We had such a nice time celebrating his birthday. Dad and G. came out for a visit yesterday to give him his present, a pair of light sabres (or light savers, as he calls them!) They weren't able to come today. So today, after breakfast, he got some more presents; 5 pots of play dough from Lady and Duncan, and a Pirates of the Caribbean dressing up outfit, and a few Doctor Who toys from us. J (Gordon's cousin) bought him a talking Tardis money box. Gordon's mum joined the gathering, as did U, the girl from next door, so we had a small but happy group for the celebration. His cake was also a Doctor Who creation. Oh we're all big fans of the Doctor here and are really enjoying our Saturday night fix. (Lady much prefers Martha to Rose, for one thing, she looks more like her ;-) but she reckons Martha is cleverer, asks more questions and screams less.) We all headed to the beach and had a nice walk and Duncan drew sand pictures and chased dogs. It was all simple pleasures, and when I was kissing Thomas goodnight, he told me he'd had a really good day. He's such a star. I'm really crazy about that boy!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RjZyuoRqakI/AAAAAAAAAG8/P9xdjblGmfA/s1600-h/IMG_0991b.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RjZvFIRqajI/AAAAAAAAAG0/XkIf4upPLBQ/s1600-h/IMG_1790.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/04/thomas-is-5-today.html", "title": "\nThomas is 5 today!\n"},
{"date": "27 Apr 2007", "body": "\nSo here's my memories of the last 3 days of our holiday. Wednesday I'd arranged to have our breakfast in the park ( Good Morning Fantasyland  they call it!) and the restaurant we ate in was done up to look like Gepetto's cottage; Lady and I spent the whole time trying to remember what the little black cat from Disney's Pinocchio was called. We both noted that had Duncan been there, he'd have been able to tell us! The Park had opened to everyone by the time we'd finished breakfast, so we weren't in the mood to tackle the rush to get on a ride. As we wandered around the corner, we saw lots of the Disney characters out for their meet and greet sessions. The children had their photos taken with Snow White and her Prince. Next we meet Mary Poppins, who blew kisses on Thomas's 2 cut knees- he's fallen over when we were rushing over to breakfast. Anyone who knows us also knows we have a habit of being late...quite often. There were a few scrums (which we avoided), to meet the more popular characters. We had decided to take a trip into Paris and were making our way to the station, when we passed Alice and the Mad Hatter, standing in prime spot, with a nice orderly queue of only 2 families. So the children waited their turn, and got to meet Alice. They were great, the Mad Hatter in particular interacted so well with them, and expressed deep regret at having missed Thomas's tea party the previous day! Thomas thought Alice was beautiful, and tells me she was his favourite person in Disneyland! Gordon was determined to visit Paris at some time while we were there. Lady also was very keen to see the Eiffel Tower. The train station is right at the Park entrance, so we bought our tickets and boarded the Paris bound train. We weren't too sure where to alight, and I asked a woman sitting near us, who was part of a group of Yorkshire people, if I could borrow her tourist map. She was kind enough to let me keep it, so we were able to figure our route. We got out at Charles de Gaulle \u2014 \u00c9toile. Lady was surprised to come up the metro steps to see the Arc de Triomphe right there. We walked towards the Eiffel Tower, stopping at a pharmacy for some anti-histamines (my face had broken out in a painful rash after using a new bottle of sun screen that morning) and more pleasantly, we stopped at a Boulongerie for a few wonderful cakes. We all enjoyed a picnic with a view of the tower, though to be honest, Thomas was more impressed with the steep stone ramps alongside the steps, which he kept sliding on. After crossing the river, we joined the queue to buy our tickets to ascend the tower. And phew, that was quite a queue. The children did great, though Thomas was a bit too cold at times and I was carrying him now and again. He amused himself by clambering on the railings, and playing 'Fingerman' with Gordon (in which Gordon's index finger becomes, 'Fingerman' who tickles a small boy and plays various tricks, to the delight and entertain said boy.) At last we got onto the tower and went straight to the 2nd floor, which felt high enough to me with my jelly legs. We ate some horrible croque monsieur at the cafe (avoid!) then joined another queue to continue our trip to the top of the tower. Well, going up in that lift was a scary experience. It felt like we were moving for such a long time. Eventually we got out, and felt very proud of ourselves, well me and Gordon did; the children felt it was no big deal to go so high! After taking a load of photos, we joined the 1st of 2 more queues to get back to ground level! I was knackered after all that standing about, so we walked back across the river and took a table outside a cafe. Now, we've been in Paris once before and we were skint. We weren't able to afford to eat at one of these places, yet here were these 2 young children settling down to hot chocolate and lemonade like they were royalty! Gordon ordered a cake with his coffee, which we shared. We agreed it was probably the  best tasting cake  either of us had ever eaten. It was getting on, so we went back to Disneyland, and braved going straight back to the park. It was just half an hour before closing time, but in that time we manged to see Honey I Shrunk the Audience (a great 3d show) and to go on the Star Tours simulator and the carousal! There was zero queueing, thankfully since we'd all had our fill of lining up for the day. Dinner was at Planet Hollywood, bringing back memories of student days in London when going there was a big treat. We all had a lovely meal. Thursday It was yet another beautiful day, and when walking to the parks, we noticed that the  Panoramagique tethered  hot-air balloon was taking on passengers, so we hopped on for a wonderful ride 100m into the air. Next, we'd decided to spend a bit of time at the Studios Park, and started off with the Tram Tour, which I'd known nothing about, and which was a very pleasant surprise! Over the next few hours we went to the Cin\u00e9Magique show (absolutely don't miss this, it's excellent!) and the fantastic stunt show and the children were able to meet loads more characters, including Mrs Incredible (another of Duncan's favourites) and the main man, I mean mouse, Mickey himself! Amazingly, there was no-one else anywhere near him, so the children chatted and played with him for ages! In the afternoon we went back to the Park, and over the course of the afternoon we manged to ride on Autopia (little cars, Thomas loved being in control of his car), watch the brilliant Tarzan show (with a very buff Tarzan, iykwim!) and ride on Big Thunder Mountain (Oh Duncan, you'd have  loved  it darling!), Space Mountain (making use of baby swap), the Mad Hatter's Cups and the Pirates, Buzz and Small World rides (again). Oh, I forgot to mention, the park was open until 10 o'clock.   We had eaten at the Blue Lagoon, billed as Caribbean cuisine and with a nice sounding menu. This however was very poor quality and hugely overpriced for the 2nd rate canteen food we were served. It was a nice location though, and apart from the food, we had a nice time! Friday So at last, our last day arrives. We packed our bags and handed them into the hotel luggage store before heading off for a few more hours of fun. I cannot believe how much we have managed to see and do. We were all missing Duncan, but were happy to know that he was having a great time with my Dad. When I phoned, I only heard about how well he was getting on and how easy he was to look after! There were a few items on the park maps which we still wanted to tick off, 1st being the  Animagique  show at the Studios Park. This was, like all the other live shows we'd seen, wonderful, really top quality stuff. Thomas keeps singing the little song 'Laa, laa, la la la la, animagique, c'est fantastique!' We also watched the Art of Animation show, which was not so good, especially the bit when the narrator competes with the sound from the multi-language head-phones and all you hear is babel. I hope it's not like this at the UN. The  Armageddon  experience wasn't all that special either. Anyway, we all went on the Flying carpets ride too, again, with less than 5 minutes to wait in line. The Studios parade was on, and we had a great spot to watch it from, so although it's much less spectacular than the main Park parade, we interacted with the participants more and enjoyed it better. We went back for one last time to the main Park, where we rode the Fairytale boat ride (zero queue) and Casey Junior (5 mins queue). Obviously we took photos of Casey Jr for Duncan. I was only sorry that I couldn't find any toys based on this ride in any of the shops. We strolled around Alice in Wonderland's Labyrinth; Thomas was disappointed now to see pretty Alice there. Then we took the Disneyland train to Frontierland, and had a great meal at the Cowboy Cookout Barbecue (which also has some of the cleanest toilets in the Park!) Next we went to the Pocahontas Village play area for a while before finishing up at the Pirate play ground before heading back to the hotel. Thomas shouted 'au revoir' to all the children as we went! Our taxi came on time, the flight went smoothly, we picked up the car and got home just after 10. Duncan was asleep, so Lady wrote a postcard telling him we were all home (it had a picture of Big Thunder Mountain on it!) and left it on his pillow. Early the next morning, he cam into my room and found the Disney bag with all his presents. He had Buzz Lightyear laser blaster, a Zurg car, a toy Big Thunder Mountain train (hooray!) a Winnie the Pooh lolly and a Mickey Mouse T-shirt. It was marvelous to see him again, he loved looking at all the photos, and as always when you go away, it was great to be home. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/04/disneyland-next-3-days.html", "title": "\nDisneyland- The Next 3 Days\n"},
{"date": "1 May 2007", "body": "\n Today, is  Blogging Against Disablism Day , hosted by  Diary of Goldfish , in which lots of people; write about disability and rail against the discrimination that disabled people continue to face...from discrimination in education and employment, through health care, parenting, family life and relationships, as well as the interaction of disablism with other forms of prejudice. Like most people, disability issues didn't concern me much before my own disabled son was born. I was aware of the social model versus medical model issue and of the ways language can be used, ie 'wheelchair user' versus 'wheelchair bound' (NO!) but I did still consider people with disabilities to be somehow 'other' to me. And now, I'm not disabled, my child is. But I realise more than ever, that my own situation could change at any time, if I was to become sick or have an accident, or as I age. Disability issues do or will affect most of us. My son is autistic. It's an integral part of him, like his gender, eye colour, racial background, etc. It affects how he learns, how he experiences the world and how he interacts with others. It is no less valid a way of being than a non-autistic life. He is a wonderful boy,  just as he is . I want him and his siblings, to develop and grow to adults with the desire to learn and the ambition to realise their potential. I want them to have empathy and respect for others, to have confidence and self-esteem. I want them to develop a health conscious life style, the skills to solve problems and the flexibility to deal with modern life as well as they are capable. These goals are in the educational philosophy I have written for each of my children. And although I have the same wishes for all, they will not end up doing or achieving the same things and they will have different levels of independence. That's fine too. All we, their parents can do, is raise them the best we can, in an atmosphere of love and acceptance of their differences, difficulties and strengths. Discrimination on the grounds on disability is no more acceptable than discrimination due to race or gender. It's endemic in our society, and there are many great voices out there challenging this, working to reduce disablism. I see disablism in the language used about autism in the media, the 'devastation rhetoric', the desire you hear expressed to rid the world of autism. Autistic people have a right to exist and have a right to be treated well by society, as do all disabled people.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2007.html", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/05/blogging-against-disablism.html", "title": "\nBlogging Against Disablism\n"},
{"date": "7 Feb 2008", "body": "\nThe Irish Independent is really  working those autism stories  this week. I just read another  in-depth family interview , this time with the parents who just lost their High Court case to have state funding of their son's ABA programme. The journalist starts by describing the little boy whose educational provision is being decided, and claims that the Education Minister would \"melt to his giddy charms and be humbled by his brave attempts to enter a world that often seems so foreign and frustrating to him.\" His Parents face a possible \u20ac2m legal bill, but the boy is unaware and sits playing a computer game \"with a concentration remarkable for an autistic child. He he! Doesn't the journalist, Gemma O'Doherty, know anything about what is and isn't remarkable for an autistic child! Playing computer games well is not exactly uncommon!  He is said to be able to speak using single words, but his parents say that his speaking at all is a dream come true. The article continues; This week, they faced what many ordinary families would consider their worst nightmare -- the prospect of losing their home to pay off a staggering legal bill accumulated in their struggle to force the State to pay for a form of education for Sean known as ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis). But instead of dwelling on worst-case scenarios and the prospect of financial destitution, their over-riding priority in this never-ending battle with the Minister for Education is as it has always been: the future of their only son and a determination to save him from a life-time of institutional care.   How dare they imply that without ABA, autistic children will face life in an institution? That is utter nonsense. Brave dad Cian says;  \"They can take the shirts off our backs. We've already had to remortgage our home and that's all we have. We don't have off-shore bank accounts or any other assets. Of course it is a huge anxiety hanging over our heads but our focus is on getting the right education for Sean and that will always be the case. Why Cian, are you insisting on this specific form of schooling for Sean? Why does it have to be ABA? Couldn't the education budget be better spent providing excellent schools for all autistic children, with appropriate levels of staffing, well equipped with learning resources, toys and computers, with speech and occupational therapists available to work with the children? Why pay for expensive ABA training from whatever organisations offer it? It is not the best form of education for autistic children. There is no evidence to say it is. So then we have the inevitable depiction of Sean's descent into the hell of autism (sarcasm); During that time, they have watched their little boy slowly emerge from the shell he crawled into when he was just eight months old.  The early signs were ominous. Sean changed from the happy-go-lucky baby he had been in the first months of his life to a withdrawn toddler increasingly making strange in the world around him.  He stopped making eye contact with the people he loved, and the simplest tasks, such as getting into the car or having dinner, turned into tantrum-filled episodes that took their toll on family life.  He dreaded people touching his hair, and became aggressive, banging his head off concrete walls and glass windows. At 18 months, Sean could no longer respond when he was called. At the age of two, he was diagnosed with autism, but the help Cian and Yvonne presumed would automatically kick in never came.   So many autism cliches do these paragraphs contain, autism as a shell - check, ominous signs - check, becoming increasingly withdrawn, lack of eye contact, tantrums, toll on the family, aggressive, head banging, - checkity check. Sean was diagnosed as having \"mild autism\" but was sinking deeper into the autistic state, no matter how much they tried to \"pull him out of it.\" How much easier would it have been if instead of trying to pull him out, they had tried to meet him where he is? Well anyway, we're informed that he \"moved from having mild autism to moderate\" and his parents were suckered by the claims of the ABA promoters. While critics argue that its success is over-hyped and it places a financial strain on education budgets, ABA is internationally proven to be effective in giving autistic children the skills their peers have by teaching them everything step by step. At least one in two children with autism reaps results from ABA and many go onto mainstream school.   Where, I wonder, is the evidence for this international proof of effectiveness. Where, in particular, is the evidence for the astonishing and new to me claim of that last sentence? Is it possible this refers to the 21 year old Lovaas paper, which relied on physical punishment? We learn that Sean had 5 hours a week of \"autism-specific training\" later increased to 15 hours, provided by the Department of Education. He then went to an ABA school which was threatened with closure due to funding problems. The parents claim that ABA was responsible for all sorts of great leaps in Sean's development. They sound like exactly the changes my own son has made in the past few years; increasing abilities, able to go into supermarkets and even on holiday which would have been difficult when he was younger. How much of that can be attributed to ABA and how much to natural progression? I don't doubt that a good individualised education is crucially important, but it doesn't have to be ABA. So the O'Cuanachains went to court in 2006; The 68-day hearing, which was seen as a test case for future provision of education for children with autism, became the longest of its kind in the history of the State. But it produced the worst possible outcome for the O'Cuanachains.  Although the High Court awarded the family \u20ac61,000 in damages for the State's failure to diagnose and treat Sean's condition when he was a toddler, it found that the Department of Education had no obligation to continue funding ABA units but could continue to follow its own \"eclectic\" approach to autism, which involves a number of different techniques.   I really pity this family. They have done all this because they really believe it's the best course of action for their child, but without evidence, there is no reason for the education department to do anything else. The mother says; \"No one comes in and interferes with you about the sort of education your child needs. The Department makes it look as if this is something we want for Sean rather than something he desperately needs. It's like saying someone wants heart surgery when they need it to survive. He has been assessed by experts and they have said this is the most appropriate form of schooling for him.\"   No, non-disabled children do not get to choose what type of state funded education they receive. They just go to one of the local schools, or they pay for it at a private school, or like us, they home-educate. That's the ultimate way of making sure no one interferes with the kind of education your children get. And no, Sean does  not need  ABA in the same way a person with heart disease  needs  surgery. That's an unfair comparison. Who are these experts who have said ABA is most appropriate? They say they are considering \"emigrating to a country where Sean's educational needs would be better met.\" Oh where could this be I wonder; Canada? - they wouldn't take them, Canada's autism \"advocates\" have ensured that autism in Canada is such a feared and unwanted condition, that autistic people are barred from emigrating there. Would it be the USA? They think Ireland has expensive health care, whew. The UK? There are even fewer, if any, state funded ABA schools here. The mum says she fears \"that everything Sean has achieved will be taken from him.\" How? He's not going to go back in time. He will keep learning as he gets older, and if they concentrate on teaching him and living with him, he'll keep gaining skills and attainments. \"If Sean was a seven-year-old in Norway, he would be getting ABA no big deal. If he lived in New York state, it would be mandatory.  \"Places like that have woken up to the fact that early investment saves so much further down the line.    Oh how I hate that, 'invest now and save later' argument. It's meaningless since there's nothing to back it up with. It ends; \"We have spent almost all of Sean's life begging and pleading for services that should be his automatic right, but we have no regrets. How could you regret fighting for your child? Anyone would do it. We are no different from anyone else.\" They are right. He does have an automatic right to an education. But not to ABA. Edited to add; there's a post up at one of  my favourite blogs , about the pros and cons of ABA. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/we-foolishly--thought-the--state-would--respond---but-we--know-now--that-special--needs-children-are-treated-differently-to-other-irish-children-1279614.html", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-on-aba.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/aba-for-autism-at-irish-high-court.html", "title": "\nABA for Autism at the Irish High Court\n"},

It's just me and the boys at home. Thomas helped me to bake some cakes with icing and sprinkles. As I was stirring the icing, he was arranging the cakes and counting them, when he told me 'I know what 4 and 4 make, 4 and 4 makes 8!' Now he's playing in garden and Duncan has taken a break from drawing and writing (his main activities these days) to play the  Home on the Range  DVD on their computer. I've just done my traditional Saturday mega-clean of the kitchen while listening to the erudite and eloquent  Mark Kermode film review show . It was our wedding anniversary yesterday. 11 years of wedded bliss... I'd rhapsodise the fella but he wouldn't like that so I'll just say that I'm very glad we met all those years ago when I was but a wee cuddy fresh from the Tyrone countryside...sort of. Anyway, he came home from work a bit early and we took the children to the Transport Museum. Not surprisingly, we have annual membership for this place. This time we went to the Flight experience bit and all had a go in the flight simulator. I was a bit concerned about how Duncan would enjoy it, especially as he has a fear of going on an aeroplane. This didn't look anything like a plane of course, and I told him it was like a computer game. We got in and saw the big screen. I told him we'd see a film all about aeroplanes and flying and the seats would move and shake a little. He was a bit uncertain but didn't ask to leave or seem frightened so we gave the lady operating it the nod to close the door. We all enjoyed the experience and will probably have to go every visit now. We called in at the supermarket for a bit afterwards for a few things. As we were waiting to pay, Duncan started to sing the opening bit from Gwen Stefani's  Sweet Escape  'woo-hoo, yee-hoo!'  We were a bit concerned that he was too loud but he was happy so we relaxed and let him be. We'd had a nice day despite a few episodes of the usual squabbles and tantrums and a curly haired boy running around like a rocket. That's not what I remember though. My mother-in-law came over at night to babysit and Gordon and me headed into Belfast.

{"date": "18 May 2007", "body": "\nI've read in a few places lately about early autism diagnosis and the (debatable) importance of early intervention. There was an interesting discussion on the Autism Parents Forum  here . Then there have been some thoughtful blog posts by various people including the always astute  Abfh  and one by  Joey's Mom . As well as that, I've been reading more and more in the Irish media and on Irish blogs, about the campaigning by an Irish ABA lobby group called  Irish Autism Action  (IAA) and the recent court action by the parents of a 6 yo autistic child, who wanted to force the state to pay for 30 hours/week of ABA therapy. They lost the case but the state has just been ordered to pay them \u20ac61,000 in costs, to cover the delay they faced in gaining a diagnosis, and because the boy was denied any services until he had a firm diagnosis. The story is reported in the  Irish Independent . In the same paper, is an article about a grubby little ad by the aforementioned IAA, which was  banned by the broadcasting agency . The Irish general election next week, has seen all sorts of people, journalists and politicians in particular, talking about autism. The only game in town, as far as they seem to be concerned, is ABA for the children. Alternative educational methods are ignored, as are the needs of older autistics. For us, as far as early detection and intervention are concerned, I suspected Duncan was autistic when he was about 18 months old. I looked up 'autism' in a paediatrics book, and it didn't describe Duncan at all, since the symptoms listed were things like 'total disregard of other people...highly resistant to being held by care-giver...' When he was 2, I thought about autism again and this time I turned to the Internet. I came across  CHAT  and after a few short minutes, I knew for certain that he was autistic. Over the next few months, what I read convinced me that I had to go into action, get him loads of ABA and hound the education board to pay for it. Then after hours of therapy a week, when he was 4 and going to school, he be in a mainstream school. I did not want a child of  mine  going to one of those special schools. I got over that. After a while I investigated ABA further, and attended a talk by a provider in London (LEAP). I was not impressed. I knew that ABA, at least how that organisation were offering it, was not for Duncan. For one thing, it was prohibitively expensive, and the likelihood of getting the education board to fund it was very low. But mainly, I knew that the way the programme was explained to me, it would have made Duncan very miserable. Also, the more I heard them focus on the Lovaas claim that the children could be made 'indistinguishable form their peers', the less I trusted them. They kept harping on about a study published in 1987. Was that really the best 'evidence of effectiveness' they could offer? Instead I discovered an nursery for children with autism and related conditions, which Duncan attended for 4 mornings a week for over a year. They used aspects of  TEACCH , the  Hanen approach  to promote communication, and some  PECs  . One of the 2 main teachers was an excellent speech therapist and she helped Duncan tremendously. The focus there was on learning and play, but mainly on helping the children to communicate. The  NAS EarlyBird  parental training programme also helped me gain knowledge of how to help Duncan. And now he's learning at home full time, he's speaking perfectly well enough to let us know what he wants and needs, and to give orders now and then (as when he told me yesterday after we visited my brother and they were our car ready to go home; 'Mummy, get in the car, now!') He's learning to read, both by using the computer to find films and characters etc, and via phonics lessons with me. He's learnt how to draw beautifully (I think, though I'm biased!) on paper and using computer art programmes. Earlier he drew a Percy Engine on Microsoft Paint, not the easiest of programmes, but his choice recently. It was fantastic. I actually had some little tears of pride and surprise when I saw it, but even though I saved it, he cleared it and saved over the file. So what I'm getting at, is there is no reason to think that it gets harder for anyone to learn as they get older. There is no 'window of opportunity' after which the child is damned. ABA is not necessary, though if it works for someone else, fine. I don't understand however why all these new-style ABA programmes that people talk about are still called ABA though. Is it just shorthand for 'eclectic mix of speech therapy, occupational therapy, play, child-led learning, with a hint of discrete trial training'?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/index.php?topic=146.msg1101#new", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/05/whats-wrong-with-early-intervention.html", "http://joeyandymom.blogspot.com/2007/05/objections-to-early-intervention.html", "http://www.autismireland.ie/", "http://www.independent.ie/national-news/little-hope-now-for-others-who-are-in-despair-678204.html", "http://www.independent.ie/national-news/shock-as-ad-on-autistic-children-banned-655650.html", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=128&a=2226", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=297&a=3630", "http://www.hanen.org/Hanen2002/pages/SpeechLanguagePathologists/HanenPrograms/HanenPrograms.htm#MoreThanWords", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=297&a=3642", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=142"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-is-so-great-about-aba.html", "title": "\nWhat is so great about ABA?\n"},
{"date": "24 Apr 2007", "body": "\n Tuesday I'd had to take an early slot for breakfast the following morning. At 7.30 (yikes) we were downstairs partaking of the breakfast buffet. This was lovely, I thought. There were piles of good croissants, plain and with chocolate, as well as the usual continental breakfast ingredients. Thomas and Lady were in heaven at the prospect of unlimited chocolate croissants! We filled our bellies then had a little walk around the hotel. A while later I took the children to the swimming pool while Gordon went to the gym. This wasn't such a success. The water was very cold and far too deep for the children. Thomas was shivering, so after braving it for a few more minutes we gave up and got out. Anyway, it was almost 10 o'clock and we had better things to be doing! The first thing on our to do list, was the Buzz Lightyear ride, so I collected 4 fast pass tickets (meaning we could get on a while later and skip the queues) then we joined the line for the Orbitron (rocket like rides). It was about 25 minutes before we all got on the ride; this was the longest we ever stood in line at Disneyland. And though we all enjoyed the rockets, we decided that it wasn't worth our while to queue for ages for anything again. We took our turn on the Buzz ride straight after, walking right through and onto our carriage where Lady and I helped defeat that evil Emperor Zurg and all the baddy aliens. Obviously, we were all thinking of Duncan so much then, and Gordon made a few films especially for him to see when we gt home. We ate lunch in Cafe Hyperion, and I collected the free, instantly available tickets to see the Lion King show. I hadn't known what to expect of any of the shows we saw while we were there, but they were all excellent. The sets were wonderful, the music was, of course, terrific, and it was an unexpectedly great event to experience at such close range. It lasted only half an hour, just right for the attention span of younger children. After that little break we were ready for more action. A wander round the park brought us into the path of a mini parade, the Casey Junior Character Express. This little train is (no surprises here) a big favourite of Duncan's, so we took a few snaps to show him later, though he turned out not to be very impressed since it wasn't the correct colour! Lady was keen to see inside the castle, and Thomas wanted to explore the dungeon and see the dragon, so we did both. Next we visited the area known as Adventure Land, and went right to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. We all thoroughly enjoyed this. There's nothing like a glimpse of plundering and pillaging, arson and death to brighten up a nice family day out! The children had a bit of a play around the pirate ship and caves and tree houses. These areas are great when you want a break from rides and shows. There's so much to see as you wander round the parks too. There are a hundred or so shops and stalls, most of them selling the same stuff and the children were mightily interested in spending the money they'd each received from their Granda when we were leaving. Next up, Frontier Land and for some reason we decided to visit Phantom Manor. After a not too bad queue, we entered the hall of the building, crowed beside a few too many other people. The room descended, plunged into darkness and Lady joined the other sensitive souls in a good old scream! The ride itself was in these creepy old looking black carts, and was nice old fashioned ghost ride, with new fashioned effects. Lady was creeped out and declared that she wouldn't be dong  that  again! We dootered back to the castle area, where we were just in time to watch the 'Once Upon a Dream' parade, which was unbelievably well done. These Disney folk are  very  good at this sort of thing! I'd booked a character tea party, and since Thomas is 5 in only a few days time, I'd arranged to make it into a birthday party for him. This was terrific. We had loads to eat, then the nice Disneyland people brought out a load of birthday cakes for all the children celebrating their birthdays, and we all sang Happy Birthday. The Disney characters started to arrive and circulate the tables. By the time they'd met Mr Smee, Tigger, Captain Hook, Pluto and Goofy, as well as some creature I didn't recognise, the children were a lot more comfortable with meeting and even hugging the characters. Thomas really enjoyed his tea party. We just had time for a ride on  It's a Small World  (so sweet!) before going back to the hotel for dinner and a relatively early night.

I just booked to take all of us to Disneyland in Paris for 3 nights at the end of April. We'll be there on Thomas's 6th birthday. Unlike  last year , Duncan is as keen as the others to go. Since the Disneyland hotels don't sleep more than 4 people to a room, and we'd have to book 2 rooms if we want to stay on-site, I decided to ask Gordon's mum if she would like to come with us and share a room with Lady. She does, so all 6 of us will be going. Duncan sat with me this morning and we looked at all the photos from last year's holiday. We took pictures in the airport, climbing the steps of the aeroplane, on board the plane and in the taxi. We talked about all these stages of the journey, and he seems to be content to do it all. I think the photos help him; seeing familiar faces in those situations may reassure him that it's quite safe. The children have made a paper chain to count own the days, and I got one of those twee ticker things to stick here too. Just to get into practice for the forthcoming experiences, Lady and Thomas turned our upstairs hallway into a fancy French restaurant. They put out tables, covered them with tablecloths, added pots of flowers, fixed sheets of shiny paper on the wall in blue, white and red for the French flag, and wrote out menus. They all ate their dinner at the restaurant. Lady dressed up (at Duncan's behest). Duncan decided to do things properly, so he got a button down shirt from his wardrobe, and a stripy tie requisitioned from Gordon's collection months ago (for Doctor Who costumes) because he wanted to dress up like the people in  Ratatouille ! He chose chicken soup from the menu. Notice the sign on the wall - 'non fumer'! Lady wanted to write 'no smoking' in French, so asked how to write 'smoking'.

{"date": "12 Feb 2008", "body": "\n Today, February 12, is  Darwin Day , a time to commemorate the life and work of Charles Darwin, born on this day 199 years ago, and the first person to explain and providence evidence for, the complexity of life on earth via evolution and a process of natural selection. It's also a day to celebrate how the process of science has contributed to human knowledge, understanding and advancement, including a more rigorous, modern theory of evolution. I had seen this fish image, on the blogs of a few USA homeschoolers and discovered  The Evolved Homeschooler Wiki , a list of blogs and web pages by and for home-educators interested in promoting rational explanations for life on earth. I thought it would be an apt image for this day in particular. It never struck me before that I should explicitly indicate that my children would learn about evolution; it's obviously the best explanation of life available and nothing else comes even close to providing a viable alternative. But in the past year, there have been a few instances of encroaching  endarkenment  in Northern Ireland public life, like a  local council voting to write to all their secondary schools , advocating the teaching of creationism (aka intelligent design) and a request  to the Eduction Minister, that children  will not be penalised for answering science exam questions with creationist answers . Which  creation myths  would be acceptable, I wonder? (I do teach my children about various creation myths, but would not expect them to be mistaken for science.) Funniest of all, is the group, with support from some politicians here, who claim that the famous  Giant's Causeway rocks were formed about 4500 years ago , during Noah's flood! Science for my family, is mainly just another aspect of everyday life. It's in the many, many questions the children ask, only a small portion of which I can answer fully from memory. When I don't know enough, everyone knows some of the other places to look; the internet, our books, the library, their Daddy. The children are natural scientists. They try things out, use all their senses, see what happens when... We use the language of chemistry when we cook together; the solid butter melts, the water boils, steam is a gas, the ingredients, like everything else, are chemicals, the food we eat is broken down by our digestive system and used by our bodies. Physics too is everywhere, in playing with a ball there's momentum, energy, gravity, in the sky there's sunlight, blue sky, rainbows, distant stars, and the only way to explain these phenomenon is by science. Duncan doesn't really ask questions. With him, right now, it's all about experiences. I talk to him and tell him things but mostly, he learns by watching and doing things for himself. He is curious, but doesn't think of me and Gordon as having the answers. Well, except about things like where the chocolate might be hidden. He wants to discover things for himself, so I have to make resources available for him to do that. So far, none of them have picked up the notion that science is 'boring' or 'hard'. I don't know if any of them will choose science based careers but I want them to know how to apply rationalism in their lives and to know enough to make good and safe choices.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scientificblogging.com/darwin_day_2008", "http://www.darwinday.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/R7G9ganBSDI/AAAAAAAAAKE/uOTM2Af6XBc/s1600-h/evolved.png", "http://www.odonnellweb.com/wiki/pmwiki.php", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/aug/15/endarkenment", "http://www.lisburntoday.co.uk/news/DUP-CALL-FOR-SCHOOLS-TO.3233193.jp", "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/education/article2999003.ece", "http://www.magictails.com/creationlinks.html", "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/article3210680.ece"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/darwin-day.html", "title": "\nDarwin Day\n"},
{"date": "24 Apr 2007", "body": "\nI've been trying to find the time to write a post about our fabulous holiday last week, but keep getting stuck with stuff like washing, cleaning, helping the children to learn and catching up on what happened in blog land and in real life while we were away (bloody awful stuff). So I'm splitting my telling of this tale into sections, otherwise it'll never be posted. It's sure to bore the t... or whatever off most people, so read on at your peril. Monday The big day arrived. I had time to pack and tidy and organise stuff that had to be organised, before Dad and G (my step-mum) arrived at 3. I'd written a story comic strip for Duncan to reassure him that we would be returning. He was ecstatic when he saw his grandparents. He knew they would be looking after him and he was obviously very happy and excited. We all kissed and hugged and said goodbye then Gordon, Lady, Thomas and me drove to the airport. The journey was smooth. We'd each taken a small bag or case and carried them on-board. The flight left on time and the children enjoyed it. I'd booked a taxi to take us to Disneyland from Charles de Gaulle, and the driver was waiting in the terminal holding a placard with my name. About 30 minutes later, we were pulling up to the hotel. The Sequoia Lodge hotel looked nice, lots of wood and stone. It's supposed to resemble a lodge from the great national parks of the USA. As I was checking in, the children spotted Minnie Mouse in the lobby. Some children were with her, but Lady and Thomas were too shy to approach her yet. A minute later my shoulder was tapped, and it was Minnie. It was obvious then that this was no ordinary hotel, this would be no ordinary holiday. The children then said hello to her, though Thomas was still uncertain about the big creature person. We dropped our bags off in our room which was perfectly nice. I hadn't booked a room in the main building as that cost a bit more and I didn't see the benefits, but we'd been upgraded anyway...which was nice! So, it was then just after 9 pm, but  Extra Magic Hours  meant guests of the Disney hotels could stay in the park for 2 hours after closing on a few days each week. So we headed to the park. It was a scenic and gentle walk round the lake, passing through an area called the Disney Village, which was a collection of shops and restaurants, then going under the pretty Disneyland Hotel to the park entrance. And wow, it really was something special. I know this is a big corporation, but man, they are good at creating magic. It was beautiful. We scoffed a few hot dogs to stave off the hunger pangs and set off to try a few rides in the short time before closing. Thomas had always said he wanted to try the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride 1st, so we went there, and queued for only about 10 minutes. Straight afterwards we went to the Peter Pan's Flight and got onto our 'flying' ship right away! Both rides were so much fun, and the children talked about their favourite bits for ages afterwards, We were all hungry for something more substantial then, so even though it was after 10 we went to the Rainforest Cafe. We just shared 2 large starters, and Gordon and I had a cocktail each. A short dander brought us back to our room, where the children instantly conked out.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RixlNblVxLI/AAAAAAAAAGM/l8GH2q2FpD8/s1600-h/IMG_1420.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RixlirlVxMI/AAAAAAAAAGU/mbZ9ydF3lNk/s1600-h/IMG_1436.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/04/disneyland-day-1.html", "title": "\nDisneyland Day 1\n"},

(It's a Harry Potter thing, for those not in the know!) It's all a perfect example of child directed learning, or personalised education or whatever jargon term takes your fancy. I have to admit, I was astonished at the two pictures he produced, entirely indepentently, and which I have included below. He completed and cut out the Pinocchio picture and brought it to me, so I would put a string on it, making it into a puppet. He then started dance it about and sing 'You've Got a Friend in Me' (from  Toy Story ). I love the detail of his picture; the bow tie and the little black waistcoat are both included. The following day he drew a picture of Harry Potter. Like the Pinocchio picture, this was done from memory, and shows the character from behind which is how he's usually seen in the HP games. Notice the nice little pink ears peeking out! I'm going to have to buy a job lot of marker pens to keep up with him. He still hasn't got the hang of putting the lid back on the pen when he's finished with it and then gets frustrated when the particular colour he wants has dried out. I find it amazing though, how this has just suddenly started, when for ages he really resisted picking up a pen or pencil at all. In the 2 or 3 weeks since he started drawing and writing, he has made lots of progress.

He'd written the letter 'B' on his page, and wanted to write 'biscetti', (spaghetti; all 3 of my children called it biscetti for a while). He then decided that 'pasta' was easier to write, so after a bit help with ' stuh',  he put that down and handed it to me requesting that I cook some. Another classic Thomas moment from a last weekend; it was Mother's Day and Gordon's mum came round for lunch. Thomas wanted something, can't remember what it was, but he obviously felt he wasn't being taken at all seriously enough. So he left the room, telling us all that he was going to leave home and go to live in my friend D's house. I asked how he intended to get there (since they live about 20 miles away) and he announced that he would just get a taxi. So there. Now I know that D is very fond of Thomas, and she is one child down right now, (since one of her boys is on an exchange visit in France) but I'm not sure if she up to adopting another 4 nearly 5 year old!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/03/classic-thomas-moments.html", "title": "\nClassic Thomas Moments\n"},
{"date": "3 Mar 2007", "body": "\nI  wrote  a few days ago about the questionnaire I received asking about the impact of autism on my family and my health and stress levels, and also about the impact (benefit) the NAS befriending service is having. I've since spoken to the NAS employee who organised the study. She's hoping they will be able to show that there is a real need for these services, and totally agrees that we have a responsibility not to misrepresent autism. I also had a prompt e-mail response from the research team at Queen's University, and have had permission to quote from it. The inference that by asking about \u201cneed\u201d across a range of dimensions we were suggesting that all families of children with autism have a wholly negative experience was certainly not intended. As you will have seen, all questions (about positive and negative outcomes) invite participants to either agree or disagree. Thus varying experiences are accommodated. This said, I do agree that it would be preferable to have instruments with a better balance of negative and positive statements with which to agree or disagree. This was one consideration when the research was being passed from an ethics point of view. However, if our research was to have any validity and scientific credibility we had to use standardised questionnaires which will allow us to make sense of participant responses with respect to population norms and data pertaining to parents of children with other disabilities, which it has already been used for. Most fundamentally, this research is about establishing and highlighting levels of need out there, in order that a credible case may be made for resources. I'm very grateful that they both took the time to reply to me and explain the reason for using these particular questionnaires. I know nothing about psychology and had been concerned that this questionnaire might in itself, exacerbate feelings of despair. Although you can disagree with the statements, the fact that the vast majority of them are negative, would appear to invite a more damning response. We know the attitude that is very prevalent in most media reporting of autism and many autism charities (not the NAS or Autism NI), is that autism is  always  a devastating disorder that prevents children from  ever  having a happy or fulfilling life. For example,  SPEAC  based here in NI campaigns for ABA as the best therapy for autistic children, and on their homepage you find the quote, (emphasis theirs) Autism tries to rob me  of a life, of friendship, of caring, of showing interest, of using my intelligence, of being affected. It tries to  bury me alive ... I will control Autism... It will not control me\"    Williams, 1994 I'm aware of so much negativity about autism. This same negativity really affected me when I 1st learnt of my son's diagnosis. I did feel devastated, I did worry that our family life would be ripped apart, and mainly because that is what I read everywhere I looked, that seemed to be the expectation. It becomes a self fulfilling prophesy. But thankfully, I found some other writings, by autistic individuals and by parents who were able to accept their child's condition while striving to do their best for them. I truly hope that the befriender service will gain the funding it needs and deserves. There is nothing like enough funding to match the demand. I know that many charities are competing for funds, and often  shock tactics  are used to try to emphasise the need for donations. I hope that this campaign is successful  and  ethical.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.speacinfo.org/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6247725.stm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/03/that-questionnaire-again.html", "title": "\nThat Questionnaire Again\n"},
{"date": "13 Apr 2007", "body": "\nWhat happened to the 1st half of April? We'll be off to Disneyland Paris on Monday, and everyone is very excited. Duncan is just looking forward to getting his present when we get back again. He's going to stay at home with his grandparents, as he wanted. But Lady and Thomas have been deciding what to pack and talking about what rides they'll try and have even been practicing a little bit of French. Easter weekend we spent with my brother and sister-in-law in Leitrim. The children had a great time with their 2 little cousins and we all enjoyed a few days of being well looked after. My brother did all the cooking, and damn fine food it was too. My other little niece visited last week one day with my dad and step-mum. We walked through the country park, the children all pretending to be jungle princesses and princes...or something. Lady gathered a handful of leaves and pine cones to pretend to cook when they got back for their 'forest feast'. Some of the leaves, she told me, smelled of garlic. They looked familiar so I Googled  wild garlic , and that's what it was. It's quite safe to eat, and tastes good, sort of peppery. The guinea pigs really liked it! They've been loving all the fine weather as they're getting on in their run on the grass every day. Gordon had a few days off work so we all dossed about a lot and occasionally managed to cross a few things off the always growing to-do list. On the Monday, after we drove back from Leitrim, I took Thomas and Lady into town to buy them shoes and a small suitcase. The traffic was terrible as we approached so I parked in an outer car park and we walked in. It turned out that we'd just missed a parade of some sort. I'd naively (hopefully) assumed it was some sort of Spring festival for families and was sorry we'd missed it. I found out later it was a Orange Order thing and a bunch of low yahoos had been causing trouble so it was no loss. And that's an understatement. Anyway we got what we wanted and went home. Yesterday, Thomas and Lady were playing on the street (well, the pavement) out in front of our house while Duncan and I were on the computer together watching videos of Disneyland parades on Youtube- oh I wish he had wanted to come with us! Lady came in all excited with a little Yorkshire terrier that they'd found in our garden. They took him into the back garden to play with Duncan, who had immediately named him Pippin after Auntie Mabel's dog (it's a TV show he likes). I went out front and walked up and down the road to see if anyone was looking or calling for their dog. I went to ask the lady who lives across the street if she recognised 'Pippin'. I knew she owned a dog herself and people often know the other dogs in their area. Now I'd never spoken to this woman before, and I'm so glad that we've now met. She's a lovely woman, who has lived here for over 50 years. We stood talking for ages and I told her all about the children and she's going to come over for tea some day when we return from France. It's funny how it takes an unusual occurrence to get you to meet your neighbours. Another neighbour, whose house backs on to ours didn't recognise 'Pippin' either, but he gave us a little bag of dog food in case he couldn't find his owner soon. I kept an eye out on the street while the children played in the back garden with this adorable little dog. Eventually a woman walked past who was able to tell me where the dog lived, so I called into the right house and the owner came to collect him. The children were so disappointed. They'd been hoping that we'd be able to look after him for a while longer. Hopefully they'll be be able to see him now and then. It's certainly re-opened the dog debate here again. Though one senior member of the household is adamant that there will be no dog! Ach, sure we'll see!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/04/april-adventures.html", "title": "\nApril Adventures\n"},
{"date": "3 Mar 2007", "body": "\nYesterday was another good day. The children dootered* about (*it's similar to pottering) drawing, reading, playing, learning on the computer and eating. They all played a few games of tag, and a game of their own invention called 'Middle Customer', which appears to involve all 3 of them spinning round while holding hands, each taking turns to be in the middle (the Middle Customer). At one stage Thomas picked up the workbook that held no appeal previously and asked me to show him how to 'do the games'. So I did, and he enjoyed a few simple exercises aimed at improving pen control. Then I did a bit of baking; a batch of buns (almost all eaten - but then they're so much better hot) and a big pile of muffins with oats and raisins. My Mammy would be proud! At bedtime I read to Lady;  The Horse and His Boy  by CS Lewis, with Duncan cuddled beside me. Gordon returned late from Belgium (with chocolate, mmm). Duncan continues to draw and write for his own pleasure. He needed a bit of help yesterday and asked me 'Mummy get Barnstormer on Google film.' I didn't understand what he meant, and went to the computer, asking him if he wanted me to write 'barn'. But he insisted that he wanted barn-storm-er, and he had tried to type it; bastomer. He told me it is in Disneyland, so I wrote the word he wanted, though I didn't recognise it at all. It turns out to be a roller coaster for young children. He knew  exactly  what he wanted all along. Right now, Gordon has taken Lady to Jujitsu. She told us that some of the children in the class have been mean to her, making fun of her when she got the moves wrong. I've encouraged her to tell the Sensei if anyone is bullying her or others. I told her, if anyone is saying stupid or hurtful things, to keep thinking to herself that she does not care what that person says or thinks, and to tell them so. Anyway, she's bound to get the moves wrong sometimes as she's learning. She should see how many times I get it wrong at my salsa class! Gordon is going to watch the class today to see what's happening.

Our CD Rom has gone missing, but we still have the case, and Duncan will often carry it round in his little Brum bag with a few other select treasures. A few days ago, he wanted to make an Adiboo book, so he cut some paper for the book, and I drew Adiboo. I asked him if he wanted to colour it in himself, and he did. I left him to it, and the next day I found the tiny book again. He had coloured it in and written the word 'Adiboo' on the cover. Inside, he'd drawn 2 more Adiboo pictures, but also drawn the weird brown monster character from the game and the yellow, one-legged, bouncing dog thing. He'd written 'Adiboo' again, and 'Big Thunder Mountain' sideways, in yellow. The letters are a bit disordered since he ran out of space. On Friday, he designed and produced an Adiboo costume. He wore his little cap inside out (to make the visor bit stick up). He coloured a page in light red (achieved by colouring in yellow, then going over it with pink...got to get it just so!) Then he cut that out and stuck it to his top. He covered a few pages in yellow and stuck one onto his tummy with sticky tape (ouch!) and cut some holes in another to make a mask. The look was pulled together with a pair of tiny blue swimming trunks and his red wellies. And voila, Adiboo! Now  that's  imagination!

{"date": "16 Mar 2007", "body": "\nDuncan has been playing the Harry Potter computer games quite often recently. He's figured out all the tricks and techniques and has managed to work his way through most of the games. It's impressive; I had difficulty with them when I had a go, though admittedly I've never been much good at that sort of thing. It's opened up a whole new set of characters and symbols for Duncan. I've had to draw pictures of Harry Potter, a dementor, a few broomsticks and yesterday Lady adapted a book into a  Monster Book of Magic . He's also drawn 'Voldermort's snake' and lots of the spell symbols himself, and the 3 children adapted a square of leftover carpet into a Spongify Tile. I made some biscuits with the boys yesterday. Duncan pulled a chair up to the cooker to sit and wait until they were cooked. However, as he always does these days, he kept opening the oven door to have a look. He's also started recently, to reduce the time set on the oven timer, since he knows the rule that when the beeper goes, the food is ready. I made a little comic strip story about it all: Sometimes Mummy makes cakes and biscuits. Duncan likes to eat cakes and biscuits. Mummy puts the food into the oven. Duncan wants to open the oven. He wants to eat the food. But the food is not ready yet. Duncan must wait. When Mummy says the food is ready, then Duncan can eat. He sat with me and read the whole thing. He needed help with some of the new words, but figured many of them out phonetically. He coloured in the pictures, then sat reading it until it was time to eat. He obviously gains from having things written down. He got angry when I told him I would finish my tea and toast before helping him on the computer, but when I wrote it down and helped him to read it, he was more settled. His reading is getting better, and most of the reading we do together is these little notes and stories I write on the spot. A few days ago, Thomas wanted to read the Magic Key reading scheme books. So he took out the easiest book and read it from memory, looking away from the page to show-off that he could read it, without even looking. Hmmm. Then Duncan picked it up and read it properly, touching each word and figuring it out. It's very encouraging to see. Oh and one last thing I want to record. Last night after dinner, we were all sitting watching this celebrity singing contest thing on TV. A woman was singing (badly) a Beatles song, and Duncan, who was cuddled in beside me, started swaying his arm in the air from side to side. He was copying the TV audience, and he kept it up for the whole song. It was very cute. I just love how he feels like doing these things and does them. Right, my brother should be arriving soon, on his way to London to see our sister.

Right now, Duncan isn't going to any organised classes. I dropped the art class as it was too inflexible, very expensive, and clashed with Lady's gymnastics class meaning we had to leave early each week. So we do art at home. The gymnastics didn't work out for him either. He's just not ready to take instruction in that way. I'd love for him to try Ju Jitsu when he's older. I'll just have to see what he wants and is capable of. The 'Saturday club' for disabled children he went to twice, has been postponed indefinitely due to lack of funding and staff. It was only held once a month and it's disgusting that it can't be guaranteed; something like that should by rights be on a few times a week. But even that, which is set up so that the parents leave their children for just over an hour, wasn't entirely suitable for Duncan, since I was told after the 2nd class, that I'd have to stay with him in future. They couldn't understand, or perhaps cope with him. But that's OK. He does fine with us and a few other adults who have been able to get to know him well, like my sister and my dad. He is looked after by Gordon's mum for an hour many Saturdays while the rest of us go to the gym. He enjoyed staying with one of my cousins for a few hours before Christmas, though he did boss her about a bit, insisting that she lay on the sofa while he played trains on the floor. And we do get to do various things together. We go for walks in the forest park, and when it's not too windy, on the beach. We swim every week which is a real highlight for us all. We visit the supermarket a few times a week and while this can still be a bit of a struggle, it's so much easier than it was even a year ago. We get together with family and friends often, and visit lots of cool places like W5 and the Transport Museum. Now that the days are brighter and slightly warmer, I can take the boys to the playground while Lady has her lessons, and they play so well together. In afew minutes, we're all going to the nearby animal rescue centre to walk a dog, trying to get some practice in for when (if) we get a dog for ourselves. I keep in mind that Duncan is still so young, he is learning loads, he is developing at the pace that's right for him, and as he develops, his own natural interests may lead him to seek out more formalised learning settings.

So Friday, it was a cold crisp sort of day. I took the children to a big Tesco supermarket. I had to buy markers for the  budding artist  and the big sets sold by Tesco are the best we've had. I took a trolley, and feeling a bit like I was about to invite a bull into the  Belleek  show room, went into the shop. Thomas rode in the trolley and I'd asked Duncan to hold on and help me push. He dashed off right away to look at some comics, but came back when I called him. I'd told him we were buying markers and doughnuts with pink icing (the best kind, apparently) so he knew he was about to benefit. We passed a display of Thomas trains and again he went to have a closer look. We examined a few engines, then I asked him to put them back and...he did! No problems so far. Next we picked up the doughnuts then Duncan and Lady helped me put a few other items in the trolley. Duncan was singing as we went, 'I want you back' by Take That. Lady told me proudly that some teenage girls were smiling at him; she reckons they thought he was cute! We didn't buy much,  I didn't want to temp fate by going beyond Duncan's comfort limit. But I was so pleased with how well he managed to deal with all that temptation, to choose to stay beside me and to even help. Afterwards, we went to a lovely little playground, overlooking Belfast Lough and the children had fun and I played chase to keep warm. On Saturday I took the boys to another playground for a run around, while Gordon and Lady went to the sports centre for their Saturday gym/Jujitsu sessions. I called into a shop with Thomas and Duncan and this time had much more difficulty controlling Duncan. I wondered afterwards if it was having the trolley that he could push and hold on to, that had helped him to stay calm the previous day. Well, we called up to see Gordon's Mum for a while. She looked after the children while Gordon and I escaped for a quick, grown-up lunch at a nice wee cafe. I do like it when we have a little break like that. My brother called to see us on Sunday. The second he came in the door, Duncan ran up to him saying 'chase me!' Obviously that's what big uncles are for. It was a lovely sunny day and the children played in the garden for ages. The children from next door care over and Lady and her friend disappeared upstairs. I heard them giggling in the bathroom and my special trouble sniffing sensors were alerted. They had the guinea pigs and our digital camera, and Lady had taken loads of photos of their exploits. She had decided she wanted to send in a photo to one of those little-girl comics, since they're always publishing photos of cute children with their pets. There wasn't much point in her denying any wrong doing, since there was a load of evidence of what they'd been up to on the camera! Also on Sunday, my sister abseiled  down a 40m high building in London, to raise money for the Macmillan cancer charity. She's a Macmillan nurse herself. She was terrified, it was windy and lonely (she told me after) but she did it. I'm so proud of her.

{"date": "18 Feb 2008", "body": "\nFor much of Saturday, we were all in the car traversing the country in a south westerly direction. It was a beautiful, crisp day and somehow, amazingly, everybody was on great form despite the long journey. The clan was gathering to attend my nephew's christening. We arrived at the church about 10 minutes late, but after having travelled for over 150 miles, much of it on windy, narrow roads, that wasn't too bad...for us. Duncan expressed his desire to go directly to my aunt P's house (she has a nice cuckoo clock and his favourite little dog) about 100 times as we drove. I'd told him that we would go there another day (she lives about 100 miles from our destination), or later, or soon, though he tried hard to pin me down to giving him a more accurate and desirable response. As I'd expected, he wasn't best pleased when we stopped the car beside a big old church. I went in with Lady and Thomas, leaving Duncan with Gordon in the car. Duncan wanted to come inside to see me shortly after. He came in with his Gameboy, its volume set slightly too loud. He objected when I told him to turn it down, saying loudly 'I'm a bad Hopper' ( Bugs Life  reference) and 'I'm Cruella de Vil'. I'd expected that the service would only last for about 10 or 15 minutes longer. The priest had other ideas, and was treating the ceremony as a re-education opportunity for all (though it's doubtful how successful this was). He informed the congregation that we'd be there for 40 minutes yet. Yikes! Gordon wisely opted to take our noisy and uninterested boy out again and they went off for a walk. The other two enjoyed waving at their cousins, and eventually we were released to the comfort of the small hotel across the street, for a buffet meal, drinks, chat and for the children, loads of play. It was a great afternoon. Duncan couldn't stop thinking and asking about the cuckoo clock he had on his mind and looked all over the hotel for one. But he was still out with everyone else, getting more familiar with and to his extended family. He played with Lady for a while, and my sister took him out for a walk, and my dad as always, played with him often. I was holding the baby for a while with Duncan sitting next to me, kissing and and stroking him so gently. I asked if he wanted to sing to baby D. and suggested a possible song. Duncan however opted to sing  You'll be in my heart , from Disney's  Tarzan . It is, after all, sung to a baby. Gordon and I really enjoyed the crack (or craic...just for you Miche) of hanging out with the family. They teased me about my blog award nomination; a nomination for 'scowling' (meaning scolding), they called it. Trust your siblings not to let you get conceited! Lady did her usual Pied Piper thing with all the younger cousins. She had them all playing schools at one stage, (cause she's such an expert on those!) which evolved into a 'Harry Potter' game. They hung out in a small lounge (the Gryffindor common room) drinking lemonade out of bottles, like I used to as a child, on the rare occasion we went to a hotel.

{"date": "1 Mar 2007", "body": "\nI'm snuggled on the sofa, Duncan's just fallen asleep beside me, all wrapped in the red blanket and clutching a collection of Magic Roundabout toys. Gordon's away for the night in Belgium (looking forward to some good chocolate!) and I've just had a dose of silly Thursday night TV ( Hotel Babylon - fluffy, ridiculous and entertaining). We've had a good day. I wasn't  too  grumpy, and the children weren't  too  irritating. Lady and Thomas only argued about 3 times, and Duncan was in excellent spirits. Wow! At one stage, we were all gathered around the kitchen table, Gordon was working on his talk for tomorrow, Lady was drawing an elephant and a koala bear from her  Draw Write Now  book and reading about them in an animal encyclopedia, I was drawing a Soldier Sam (from the Magic Roundabout film) for Duncan and Thomas was playing  Starfall  on the computer. After a while I tried to interest Thomas in doing some activities in one of the many learn-to-write workbooks we have lying around. He was totally uninterested, and insisted that playing Harry Potter PC games was his work. So I left him to it, but then Duncan started filling in the workbook. There were several pages, with all the letters of the alphabet written out in rows, with 4 letters for the child to trace over, and then a picture and word of something starting with that letter. Duncan picked out a light red marker pen and carefully traced the 1st 'a', then chose a blue marker for the 2nd 'a', then the 3rd he traced in green, then for the 4th he used yellow. Next he asked me to colour in the apple, and he started on the letter 'b', again using red, blue, green then yellow. He did the same for all the letters up to k, when he tired of this activity, and decided to write 'big thunder mountain' along the bottom of the page. He named all the pictures but didn't recognise the word or picture of an igloo. I said 'it's an igloo; Pingu lives in an igloo', he told me, 'Duncan lives in an igloo, Duncan eats fish.' So he knew what I was on about. And that reminds me; the other big thing is that he has discovered a love of fish. We had salmon for dinner last night and he gobbled it up, with loads of potatoes and peas. He wanted more fish today and since we had no more fresh, wild salmon (delicious but dear) I offered him some sardines from a tin, and he liked them. Again, wow! I don't know whether this sudden and welcome addition to his diet will last, but for now, I'm happy about it. Duncan has also been doing more drawing for himself. First he drew a copy of the front of his Zurg toy's costume and stuck it onto his pyjamas with sticky tape, the next day he drew a great copy of the old Ragdoll logo (as in the production company behind Teletubbies and Brum). This was his first ever solo and unasked for attempt at drawing a face, and it's good. Today he made his own 3-D copy of the Thunder Mountain train, with only minimal input from me. I'm so glad to see him gain the confidence or whatever it is to do these things for himself; not least because I'm lazy enough to hope that perhaps he won't be asking me to draw  quite  so often.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.drawyourworld.com/drawwrite.html", "http://www.starfall.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/03/few-wows.html", "title": "\nA few wows\n"},

Mind you, these weren't ordinary fish and chips, these were award winning (Millars in Newtownards) and were well worth the price of stinking up the car a bit. On Monday, M. (NAS befriender) came round bringing a few big cardboard boxes with her.  Right away, Duncan was instructing her on how to make a Big Thunder Mountain train, which I was able to finish off later, to his delight. This is his Big Interest of the minute, and he spends ages looking at pictures and videos of it on the web, then asking me make lots of little paper trains. He has also busied himself with writing the words out on paper and yesterday I came across him making a really nice picture of the mountain and tracks using the Paint program. He's also singing, 'She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes' very frequently, complete with dancing and clapping. He liked my version, 'He'll be coming round big thunder mountain...' though he usually asks me to stop singing if he hears me. Today though he found this poster, and wanted me to draw it. Well, fine, it wouldn't look as good as the original, but I was willing to have a go. I carefully wrote out the words and was colouring them in when a little insistent voice starting telling me to 'fix it, need a Huh, put in Huh' and I saw that I'd written 'TUNDER', but my smart and observant boy wasn't going to let that go by uncorrected. The poster (with THUNDER spelt correctly) is now hanging on his bedroom wall. What is that thing about following their interests again? It's such a pity that he won't come with us to Disneyland Paris. I think he'd just love to see this first hand, but he knows best what he is and isn't ready for, and for now, flying is just too big an aversive. Both boys have been making progress in their reading ability. I can see how reading is already helping Duncan to figure out the words that he hears but can't quite make out. It's also clear that he is using phonics to decode unknown words. I was surprised by that, but it's so interesting to see.

{"date": "21 Feb 2007", "body": "\n On Sunday, my brother and his family here visiting along with Dad and G (my step mum). My niece C will be 5 next week, so I made a birthday cake. Gordon made a vat of chili, I made some guacamole. (Lady was eating this, along with a few tortillas, and wanted to know if it was Irish food!) Then I brought out the cake which was demolished so fast that poor Gordon, busy making everyone coffee, didn't get any. He needs to learn that if he's eating when my family are around, he needs to move  fast ! It was such a nice day. The children  amused themselves all day, playing on the trampoline and in the house. Duncan spent a good part of the day in his room playing with his trains, or on the computer. he was quite content. He and my dad went for a little walk together too. Dad was so pleased to hear Duncan's great reading, and to see the nice little train he's drawn recently. Here's the two of them, playing a kissing game. The next day, Duncan was quiet and drowsy. He lay beside me or on my lap getting loads of cuddles while I read to him. He has a cold, as do Lady and now me. I was a bit concerned that he's be too ill to go with us on Wednesday, on our trip to the  Exploris Aquarium , but he was fine. I just wrapped him up warm and packed a lot of tissues. Wednesday was an unusually warm and sunny day. I really enjoyed the drive down the Ards Peninsula, past the beautiful Strangford Lough, on clear roads and in my shiny, new car. There's a special light in Ireland, the colours were clear and bright; green hills, brown ploughed fields, blue lake. It was gorgeous. I stopped to take a photo on my way home, and Thomas decided I should take one of him running, so voila! The aquarium is a great place to visit, though I had to do a lot of running after Duncan, calling to him to STOP...as usual. He remembered that when we were last there, about a year ago, there was a cafe where he'd eaten a pink donut. So of course, getting back to the cafe was his prime objective for the whole time we were there. We arrived in time for a talk at one of the touch tanks and Lady and Duncan were able to stroke rays, hold a starfish, and pass around a dogfish egg. Thomas didn't want to touch anything. We passed the other tanks and went to watch the rescued seal pups. They will all be released back to the sea when they're old enough to fend for themselves. They were very obliging though, swimming right up against the viewing window in their pool and showing off for us. Trevor the Traction Engine (as shown with Duncan) enjoyed the trip too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RdwzLrsn1wI/AAAAAAAAABc/mHC8CElF850/s1600-h/IMG_1284.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/RdwzMLsn1xI/AAAAAAAAABk/WApco6juinQ/s1600-h/IMG_1288.JPG", "http://www.exploris.org.uk/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Rdw4z7sn1yI/AAAAAAAAAB0/mYYG6sODKCc/s1600-h/IMG_1305.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Rdw40rsn10I/AAAAAAAAACE/QONg8U7p7SM/s1600-h/IMG_1302.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/Rdw8hLsn12I/AAAAAAAAACU/E36oArKvps0/s1600-h/Untitled+2.bmp"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/02/few-nice-days.html", "title": "\nA few nice days\n"},
{"date": "16 Feb 2007", "body": "\nI've been trying to write this for a while. It's gone through several drafts and I'm not sure this will express it properly either. I'm having a hard time knowing how to best help Duncan in some ways. There's so much shouting and wailing and shrieking when he's unhappy. We're all getting overloaded, and each of us, at times, adds to the high levels of noise and anxiety in the house. At some stage every day, Duncan is in floods of tears because of something he wants to be given or have done or because he's just had too much stress. A few times this past week, we were both sobbing, sitting hugging and crying together. There's so much that I'm grateful for, and every day we have fun and connect and develop, so I'm not in any way ranting about some 'terrible affliction' here. I'm trying to see if writing it down, will help me see what's actually causing this or what I can do or change. For example, something that's been happening increasingly often, particularly when other children are around for a play, is that Duncan ends up chasing someone, shouting and angry and swatting at them. The other child will shriek and keep running away from him, winding him up even more. I have tried to explain to them all, that they shouldn't do this, that they make him upset and worried and cross when they run away from him. I've asked them to try to stand still and say to him 'don't hit me, that hurts' or even to look really sad or pretend to cry. Duncan always holds back, never tries to  really  hurt anyone, and hates the idea of making people sad. Many, many times over the past few weeks, I've had to intervene and separate them, often taking Duncan to another room to calm down or to try to distract him. Sometimes it's difficult; he just wants to strike out and I've been the one he vents with. A really lovely little girl has moved in next door. She and Lady have become great friends and she comes over after school most days. She's been really nice to Duncan and sort of mothers him, which he likes. Her younger brother has been round a few times too. They all get on well and my children are delighted to finally have neighbours to play with; that house having lain empty for over a year. But yesterday I had to tell Lady that unless they could try really hard, to stop setting up situations where they all start to run away from Duncan, they'd have to play over at their house more often. Yesterday they started playing a game, which I think was instigated by Duncan, where one of them was running after him, saying 'let me see your top', (don't ask!) which he was much happier with. He definitely prefers to be the chased rather than the chaser. The schools are closed for the half-term break, so another family we're friends with have just been round. The children were playing in the garden, running round getting mucky. Duncan though was with me and my friend, colouring a sheet of paper pink, which I then had to make into a 'Tubby Custard' bowl. He then went out to join the others, and all was well for a while as they bounced on the trampoline. Soon though, Duncan was shouting angrily and running after Lady trying to hit her. The same sort of thing kept happening and he was frustrated and cross. They have just gone home, and Lady and Thomas have gone to their house for a while. It's nice and quiet now, and Duncan and I are chilling out together. I want to reduce the stress he's under, without stopping them all from having fun. I also need to help him find other ways of dealing with these big feelings, that aren't so upsetting for himself and everyone. We all need to calm the heck down a bit. autism northern Ireland \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/02/big-feelings.html", "title": "\nBig Feelings\n"},
{"date": "21 Feb 2007", "body": "\n Today I received a letter from NAS NI, asking me, as a user of their befriending scheme, to fill-in a questionnaire about the impact of ASD on family life, and a Parental Stress Index. They are funding the research, to be carried out at Queen's University Belfast, to assess the influence of the befriending scheme, and to 'highlight important issues to prospective funders.' Now, I'm not too happy with this questionnaire. It's very much skewed towards showing what a horrible thing it is to be saddled with an autistic child. Every single question on the Parental Stress Index, is about negative traits, feelings and expectations. For example; I find myself giving up more of my life than I expected to meet my children's needs. Since having this child, I have been unable to do new and different things. My child is not able to do as much as I expected. The Family Impact Questionnaire is much the same (emphasis mine), eg; Nobody understands  the burden I carry . Fatigue is a problem for me because of my child's condition. This condition has placed a strain on the relationship between me and my partner. Now to be fair, some questions (5 out of a total of 65 questions counting both parts of the questionnaire) ask about the positive effects of having an autistic child, in terms of how it may have brought the family closer, and 'learning to manage my child's condition has made me feel better about myself.' There are no questions about the benefits of the child's autism, as being a lovable, quirky and integral part of your child. The only good thing that's possible, as presented here, is a sort of 'strength through adversity' effect. I think these sort of questionnaires, can shape how someone feels about things. If the only options on offer, are devastation and despair and problems, you could have a more negative attitude than you otherwise would. I wonder if this questionnaire would ever be considered appropriate for the parents of children with other disabilities, like Down Syndrome or Cerebral Palsy. I'm not saying that having an autistic child is all sunshine and roses; it's hard work at times, can be frustrating, difficult, tiring. Thankfully, we don't have to deal with the most common case of stress for autism parents; dealing with a failing education system, since I'm taking care of that at home. I'm not having to do the fight for access and services that many must do; not yet anyway. The only thing that has caused me trouble from 'the system' lately, was applying for Disability Benefits, which is an unwieldy and flawed process in need of a serious overhaul. But I object to the way this questionnaire presents my autistic child as being the likely source of all or most of my problems. And that just isn't so. I haven't decided what to do about this. I won't fill it in, but I think I will write to the NAS to explain my feelings. I have recently joined this organisation, because it mostly is working as a force for good, and I know some really good people who are helping to make it even better.

They had bridesmaids and flower girls and the whole shebang. About 100 of their friends and relatives attended and it was nice to see so much support for them both. In a week when I read a report that Northern Ireland is the  most bigoted place in the world , it's good to see that the homophobes didn't get in the way last Friday. I know that many of our relatives from the older generation who attended, all of whom are devoutly religious, were a bit saddened that it wasn't an ordinary wedding, but they were still all able to accept that this is how it is and to support their niece/granddaughter. As always, I had some mad crack with my cousins, caught up with one of them I hadn't seen in years, drank vodka for the first time and managed to get a bit of a boogie too. So it was a proper Irish wedding. I stayed at my dad's place that night, and we left before the fighting started. Nah, only joking, it was a nice, well behaved crowd, in spite of all the Derry people there ;-) I haven't been blogging or reading other's blogs so much lately. First I was spending my computer time researching our holiday and for the past week, I've been looking at cars. We've now decided to exchange our 6 yo Alhambra for a 2 yo Vauxhall Vectra. We'd bought the 7 seater thinking that we'd be taking Gordon's mum out with us often, but that hasn't happened. But then when I did catch up on news or blogs, it was often just depressing. Like the report mentioned above, or the news about the  couple jailed for disgusting abuse  of their 4 yo child with cerebral palsy. What the hell kind of world is this? I got an e-mail from the  Aspies for Freedom  group, saying that the  Autism Speaks  (spit) group are making inroads in Britain. We don't need this fervently anti-autism, miss-named gang here. AFF are asking those who support autism rights to sign their  petition ,though only UK citizens can do so. To top it all, the UK government is currently re-thinking its position on elective home education, and it's expected that we will be subject to much more regulation at the end of it, which would compromise our ability to provide a customised education suitable to each child and their individual needs. A recently formed campaigning group,  Ahed , is seeking to limit the potential for a reduction in our freedoms. I mean, right now, I'm writing this, supervising Lady's work on her maths, helping Thomas get into his superman suit and drawing a Legoland map for Duncan at the same time (it's just taking a long time!) The vocabulary Duncan is using is amazing; he's telling me where we are going and what we're doing on the map.

I suppose the garden birds will be glad! I took Duncan's Major buggy and he sat in it for short periods. Mostly he ran so, as usual, I had a mini-workout too. We all had a lovely time. Thomas and Lady enjoyed seeing all their buddies and they all ran and climbed and explored. We ate our packed lunches in a building which Duncan described as 'a big house, old house...Hogwarts!'

Some locked and unlocked wards were recently amalgamated at Muckamore and that has meant about 20 adults now find themselves locked up - even though they have never been assessed as needing secure accommodation.

Lady and I were laughing at how cute Duncan sounded and he said 'ha, ha, ha. It's funny!' It was wet and windy but we're hardy. We started off in the Folk section, and walked...did I just say we walked...no, we don't  do  walking, we ran round the town and in and out of various old buildings. We saw our friends and I spent about 5 minutes in their company, before Duncan splashed through a puddle getting his socks and trousers wet. He wasn't happy with that, and was about to sit on the wet, muddy ground and strip off. I took him into one of the cottages and we sat in front of a lovely turf (dried sods of peat) fire where he did take off his wet things, and I dried them by the fire. It was really pleasant actually. We sat in the warmth, chatting and I told him some stories (about a little boy falling in a puddle). He enjoyed the rocking chair, we're going to have to get one of those for our house. I let him go upstairs alone, expecting him to come back straight away. When a minute had passed, I went up to find him lying in one of the grotty, old beds. Eventually we went out to find the others, as I had abandoned Thomas and Lady. They were all happy, but cold, so we went over to the enclosed transport section. The children all had such a great time and Duncan was pleased to see that Percy was back in place (in the model train display case). Thomas is so funny when he gets together with his buddies, he acts all silly to try to make them laugh.

It just felt like one of those days when I wished children came with an off switch, or at least a pause button.

A few times I stalled and told him I'd help him soon and he then grabbed my hand, telling me to come on and to wake up. I told him he was hurting my hand (he was squeezing hard and my hands are sore anyway at the moment) so he kissed them both, walked round behind me, and started pushing my back in the direction he wanted. Dad thought that was so funny. Duncan always does that, or when I'm having a meal or a cup of tea and he's waiting for me ('cause I always tell him I'll help him when I've finished eating/drinking) he sits watching each mouthful, encouraging me, sometimes putting the cup to my lips. On Monday we went to the Transport Museum and met up with M. our NAS befriender. A large room full of steam engines ensured Duncan was a very happy boy. He did get a bit worried as the Thomas and Percy trains were not in their usual position in the model train display case. He kept going back to it and looking for them. I said that they might be at the works. I said perhaps Percy had gone into the water (as in the story,  Percy Takes the Plunge ) and had to be mended. He didn't agree with this assessment and decided they were stuck deep inside one of the tunnels. He thought hard and searched in his mind for the right words; 'Not at the works, Thomas is...underneath...inside...in there.' I remember a speech therapist telling me about the difficulty she was having helping him to understand such concepts as  under, over, beside  etc. Many hours of playing trains together have sorted all  that . At home he impressed me by completely independently taking a piece of paper and some markers and drawing a huge number 6. He copied it from his 'Percy' engine, so it was yellow and red and green in the middle. He then covered it with sticky tape, asked me to cut it out and stuck it down his trousers a bit so it sat against his side. Then he ran chuffing round the house. It was bedtime soon after, and I was able to do my Fat Controller impression and instruct all the engines that at the end of their busy day, they all had to go to the shed for a well deserved rest.  Somehow, the little engines responded to this, and  I had one of the easiest bedtime sessions for weeks. Our slightly more structured schedule is working well for Lady. She's working well and getting through a lot. Thomas still just writes little notes when he wants, draws rainbows, plays computer games and with his toys. Well, they'd be able to play with a few more toys if I could find the key to our spare room. Most of the toys are stored there and locked up, so they aren't all pulled out at once and it's easier to tidy up. But we can't find the blasted key or any of the spares. If it doesn't turn up soon, I'll have to seek Anthony's intersession.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/01/something-to-laugh-at-every-day.html", "title": "\nSomething to laugh at every day\n"},

So for the past few days, we have been gathered round the kitchen table, looking like a magazine picture of a home-ed family, withs books spread out and 3 little heads bent and busy. Well, there was a period of about 10 minutes when it looked like that! I'm asking Lady to do some maths from the CGP book every morning, then an English task (either a story or letter or blog entry). She has never been able to finish this sort of thing and we have loads of half written letters and stories lying around. I'd also like to see her gain confidence at getting things down on paper. She can tell these long convoluted stories when she's playing with the boys, but dries up when faced with a blank page. It's been fine these past few days. Lady sits beside me while she's working at her maths, Thomas mostly plays PC games, but he's been colouring in, drawing mazes and rainbows and writing with the stencil. Duncan decided that he wanted to write some numbers too, and wrote in an old maths workbook. Apart from that, we made our pictures and books and he was quite content. We're going to start using the BBC schools radio programmes again, starting today. We'll be listening to a  music  programme and a  drama  one. Lady has also started back at her Jujitsu and Brownies and I had another Salsa class last night. I've moved up into the intermediate class, and I spent much of it feeling out of my depth and just going wrong over and over. But right at the end, I stopped thinking too hard about the moves, and just allowed myself to be led (there are plenty of men in the intermediate class, whereas in the beginners it was almost all women) and I was getting it! It felt great. I'm glad I started this and look forward to it every week. But right now, I'm cooking some chips for Duncan.

I'm so pleased that I have recorded some of the little stories of my children growing up; things that I will be grateful to read again for years to come. The interactive aspect of blogging is great too, I feel honoured to be part of 2 great blogging communities; the home-education ring and the Autism Hub. I'm going to rewrite my 2nd ever post here, which was about why the blog was called  The Voyage. Because when Gordon and I first became friends back in '91, I lent him a Christy Moore tape called 'Voyage' which he listened to while travelling to Jamaica to see his Dad. It's something we shared right back at the beginning of 'us'. I really like the song 'The Voyage'. It's simple and true and as time goes by and we have made a family, it means more. Life is a journey, and love is its boat, On troubled waters, it keeps us afloat, When we started this voyage, there was just me and you, Now gathered round us we have our own crew. Isn't that sweet... Anyway, then the children were 3, 5 and 7 and Duncan was still at school. They are all learning at home now and very happy we are with this set-up. They have all grown so much since I started. Lady is even taller, more knowledgeable, mature and sensitive  and into Jujitsu and Harry Potter. Duncan has progressed more than I would have believed possible. He talks more, makes himself understood, is interested in loads of things, is learning to read and just recently started writing and drawing too. Thomas is no longer the just out of babyhood cutie. He's a proper boy, independent and smart (but he's still Mummy's little darling first thing in the morning and last thing at night.) I think I'll keep this up for a while yet. It's part of my life now. So to anyone who ever reads my wittering, thanks for dropping by and especially thanks for when you've felt like leaving a comment.

Is doing something that isn't common in your location and culture, weird? Well anyway, the best I could come up with is this; My right pupil is always a bit smaller than my left. When I met Gordon (in university halls of residence) we were friends for a few months, before he wanted to know if we could, well, be more than friends. His method of finding this out, was to generate a multiple choice questionnaire, all nicely printed out, and push it under my door. While it might seem that that's more of a weird thing about  him , I thought it was great. We also used to write equations and draw graphs in our letters to each other when we lived apart. I mean, is it any wonder we've produced a neurodiverse child. I sucked my thumb until I had children of my own; then I finally decided I'd better quit. Lady started sucking her thumb the day she was born and still does. I'm not in the least bothered by this. I've never smoked and never tasted so much as a sip of any alcoholic drink until I was almost 30. (The fact that Duncan was born the year before really  isn't  related to this!) I had good reason to believe that I would need a little pharmacological kick to ovulate, when I wanted to start a family, so I was on a waiting list for a year to see a fertility specialist. During the appointment, the doctor asked me for a urine sample, which he took  into a little back room where I could hear him rattling about for a while. After about 5 minutes he came out to announce that I was already pregnant. Probably the easiest job he'd ever had. This went round the Autism Hub a while ago, but then it was only 5 weird things people were listing, and not 6, so I'm going to leave it at that. I could go on, but some things are just  private  ;-) If anyone wants to enlighten us with what is weird and wonderful about them, and has not been tagged already, then go right ahead.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.notsheep.net/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/01/but-im-not-weird.html", "title": "\nBut I'm not weird!\n"},
{"date": "8 Jan 2007", "body": "\nNow I've got that (previous post) off my chest, I can get back to normal. I'm still drawing loads of tiny, detailed pictures as requested by Duncan. He did however, ask me to stick 2 A4 pages together to draw a really big rocket, which he told me to roll up round a cardboard tube. I then had to tape the rocket to the back of his shirt, and he pretended to blast off and whiz around. I knew then that he'd had the final product in his mind all along, he just fed me little bits of information as needed. I had been wondering for a while how to persuade Duncan to draw for himself. He has always become upset when I've tried before, he wanted the finished products to look exactly like what's in his mind, and he reckons I'm more likely to achieve that than he is. But I just had this great idea; I could encourage him to draw,  whilst  I'm making whatever it is he wants. It worked right away. As I was drawing a picture of some 'fire bursts' (like those emanating from Buzz Lightyear's laser weapon), he drew a few pictures of our faces, then he drew round his hands and feet, then he copied some writing, then he spontaneously drew his own laser fire-bursts which he was so happy with, that I was asked to seal it with sticky tape, cut it out, and stick it onto his sleeve. His writing is so precise. I was amazed, I mean, he hasn't picked up a pen to do anything since he left school. On Sunday I overheard him running water in the kitchen sink and muttering to himself that he would 'clean it'. I went in and watched him rinse a cloth and use it to wipe our (newly painted) wall, where he'd written, most beautifully, 'Big Antz.' (He's been watching a trailer for the film  Antz  quite a lot recently.) I had to turn away to hide the huge, proud smile on my face, and get the disapproving look in place. Well, we had a discussion and he's said he will not write on walls, just on paper. We'll see. I'll have to buy water soluble marker pens again, I think. He absorbs information from many sources, but the main way right now, is the PC. He likes to watch Youtube films; recently he's enjoyed films people have uploaded of their pets, especially their dogs. He plays lots of CD Roms and uses children's websites. He was listening to a story on  Cbeebies  yesterday;  Don't Wake the Baby . He thinks this is hilarious and always follows the words with his finger as they are read. He did a quick Google Image search just after, typing in the word  baby . He can type loads of words; Toy Story (and all the character names), 101 Dalmatians (he copied it from a book the 1st few times, but it's off by heart now), Pinocchio, (ditto), Ace Monkey, Adiboo, Magic Roundabout, and of course, all the Thomas the Tank Engine names. We have so many little games we play together. He instigates most of them and tells me what character I'm playing. Quite often I'm Auntie Mable and he's  Pippin  the dog, or I'm the evil emperor Zurg and he's Buzz Lightyear. (Him -  You killed my father . Me -  No Buzz, I am your father . Him (pretending to fall down the stairs) -  Aaaaaagh! We still make lots of little home-made books; he, dictating the story and I, illustrating it according to his instructions, He then learns how to read them. On Saturday, we walked to the postbox together. He put my letter in his little backpack and we went off, hand-in-hand along the road. We chatted as we went, and an old man greeted us, saying 'hello'. I said hello back, and Duncan instantly helloed him too! He is progressing so well, and in a way that works fantastically for all of us. I was wondering whether Lady and Thomas should go back into school, so I could have more time to focus on Duncan. He is calmer and much easier to look after when it's just the 2 of us. Gordon often suggests that we might all benefit if Duncan was home-educated alone. A friend of Lady's came over to play with her on Friday. When her mum was picking her up, she was talking about how much homework her children get, especially her 10 year old son. (He's doing the 11+ next year, that most unfair judge of children's abilities and future expectations, that is still so much in favour in Northern Ireland.) That isn't what I want for them. I don't see the point in a system that has the children in school for almost all of the day, then sets homework to eat into what little time the family has together. I'd reckon that many children who do well at school, do so because their parents put so much time and effort into helping with the homework. Anyway, I just believe that to continue as we are is best for everyone. I'm happy that all 3 children are growing up together every day. They are such good friends, and I don't want to separate Duncan from his siblings. It's good for him having them around and vice versa. Today, they were having a great time playing 'Toy Story'. Duncan was just one of the gang. I also still think that the children will all get a better education at home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/razzledazzle/onceuponatale/wake_baby/index.shtml", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/funandgames/comeoutside.shtml"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/01/implicit-learning-of-autistic-boy.html", "title": "\nThe Implicit Learning of an Autistic Boy\n"},

{"date": "9 Jan 2007", "body": "\nI don't usually write about anything other than my family and our experiences. I was just so shocked about this case, the coverage it was getting, and most of all, the huge bias in blogs and media commentary in favour of the 'treatment', and even worse, how many people were actually expressing views that she 'would be better off dead'. I'm inexperienced at writing about disability advocacy and especially at writing about feminism; but this whole thing just seemed to me to be so clearly an affront on the rights of women, children and people with disabilities. Many people seem to be saying that we have no right to judge the parents, we don't know the exact particulars of the case, we don't know what it's like having to care for a child like Ashley. I agree with the last 2 points, but I think that it  is  important to judge this case, and I suppose by disagreeing with it, then I will be, by default, casting judgement on the people behind it. I would blame the doctors and ethicists involved and not the parents, who should, I feel, have been strongly advised against this. And although we don't know all the details, we can discuss what we  do  know, from the paper published last autumn by the doctors who performed the 'treatment' and from the long  blog post  written by her father. Others have defended this by pointing to the '3 month age' functioning of the child, as if this means she looses all her human rights. Her father addresses this too saying; \"If people have concerns about Ashley\u2019s dignity, she will retain more dignity in a body that is healthier, more of a comfort to her, and more suited to her state of development as George Dvorsky, a member of the Board of Directors for the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, alludes to in a related article: \u201cIf the concern has something to do with the girl\u2019s dignity being violated, then I have to protest by arguing that the girl lacks the cognitive capacity to experience any sense of indignity. Nor do I believe this is somehow demeaning or undignified to humanity in general; the treatments will endow her with a body that more closely matches her cognitive state \u2013 both in terms of her physical size and bodily functioning. The estrogen treatment is not what is grotesque here. Rather, it is the prospect of having a full-grown and fertile woman endowed with the mind of a baby.\u201d\" This is the ethics advice they have received. Oh dear. It was interesting to read the comments on my own post. I was entirely unsurprised to see that all the Autism Hub writers who commented, were also very concerned about this and thought it was completely wrong. The main voice of dissent (here anyway) ended up sounding very extreme and irrational. I want to point anyone interested in the direction of some of the great blog posts I've read over the past few days. First, there's  Thirza's  post,  Growing Up with Sky , where she writes lovingly about her disabled sister, and gets pissed off about the 'Ashley treatment'. She addresses in particular, the concept of mental age and how this applies to her sister's life. Wheelchair Dancer  has written again about this, and quoted the  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , including; Article 17 - Protecting the integrity of the person Every person with disabilities has a right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others. I think that says it all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ashleytreatment.spaces.live.com/blog/", "http://fitofpique.blogspot.com/", "http://fitofpique.blogspot.com/2007/01/growing-up-with-sky-skys-my-sister-shes.html", "http://cripwheels.blogspot.com/2007/01/human-rights.html", "http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2007/01/bit-more-on-ashley-x-treatment.html", "title": "\nA  bit more on the 'Ashley X treatment'\n"},
{"date": "4 Jan 2007", "body": "\nMy head is spinning. I've just been  reading  about 'Ashley X', a disabled 9 year old girl from the USA.  Ashley has static encephalopathy, and she cannot walk, talk, keep her head up in bed or swallow food. Her parents have taken some extreme measures which  they say  will enable them to care for her better. From the Guardian article; In discussions with doctors at Seattle Children's hospital they devised the treatment: removal of Ashley's uterus to prevent fertility, excision of early buds on her chest so that she would not develop breasts, and medication with high doses of oestrogen to limit her growth by prematurely fusing the growth plates of her bones. The parents insist that the treatment, carried out in 2004, was conceived for Ashley's benefit and not their own ease or convenience. With a lighter body and no breasts, Ashley will have fewer bed sores and lie more comfortably. And a smaller Ashley can be cared for and carried. \"As a result we will continue to delight in holding her in our arms and Ashley will be moved and taken on trips more frequently instead of lying in her bed staring at TV or the ceiling all day long,\" they write. Most of the comments I've read on the  BBC  site  are backing the parent's decision. Lots of people are saying that unless 'you have walked a mile in their shoes', you cannot criticise their decision. I'm wondering if anyone is willing to put themselves in Ashley's shoes? On the Guardian blog, there are all there are several clever-sounding and highly disablist comments like the  following ; Human rights are concerned with the individual, preventing harm to the individual, preventing violation of their wishes and preventing the removal of their freedoms of choice. The child in this case has no wishes to violate, and the action taken will not limit her freedoms of choice for the same reason. The child's psyche will not experience the moral indignation we might jump to, but she will certainly be able to feel pain. If the bedsores explanation is medically correct, the right for the child to remain in comfort and free of bedsores is justification enough. I have left a comment of my own on the BBC site but can't be bothered to engage with the 'superior' beings who write on Comment is Free. I managed to see an interview on the BBC News 24 channel with a woman from a UK disability organisation (I didn't catch which one) and a doctor from the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. They both spoke against what has been done to this child, the woman gave a brilliant interview making all the points about how Ashley's human rights had been disregarded, how technology is available to enable many people to move and communicate. I think this is horrible and I have tremendous pity for this little (and staying that way) girl. I dislke the name they've given her; 'Pillow Angel'. I wonder if there is any evidence showing that women get more bed sores than men? I say that she has been mutilated in a way that should shock anyone who cares about human rights, particularly the rights of disabled people and women. If the parents are concerned that she could be impregnated, contraceptive pills exist. There are even Pills that prevent menstruation, though I personally don't see why dealing with bleeding once a month would be such an issue. They say that; Unlike what most people thought, the decision to pursue the \u201cAshley Treatment\u201d was not a difficult one. Ashley will be a lot more physically comfortable free of menstrual cramps, free of the discomfort associated with large and fully-developed breasts, and with a smaller, lighter body that is better suited to constant lying down and is easier to be moved around. She is only 9 years old. Who can say what her outcome would have been? I would agree that the parents, and all those caring for children who need so much help and attention, deserve to have all the support and access to enabling technology they need and that really doesn't happen now, either here or in America. But this is just wrong. And yes, I am entitled to judge. For a good analysis of the issues, read  Wheelchair Dancer .

It's a plastic thing, bought a few years ago when I came to the realisation that a fresh smelling pine, elegantly draped with lights and beautiful glass baubles, really wasn't the thing to have in the house with a couple of curious children, and lets be honest, one of whom who seemed to be in training for a career in the demolition industry. So each year we dust off the fake tree, and hang the cheap plastic baubles and all the wee decorations that the children have made over the years. One of my favourite things on it is a photo-bauble of Duncan wearing a Santa hat, looking straight at the camera with his tongue poking out. It was made in his old nursery, and he looks such a picture of mischief and fun. The children had a lot of fun dressing the tree and I managed not to get too crabbit about mess and malfunctioning lights etc. Duncan was especially excited about the whole thing. He was jumping around and marching up and down the kitchen, wrapped in a length of tinsel. singing  Jingle Bells ! I can see that this is the first year when he understands and shares in the excitement of Christmas. He tells people who ask him what Santa (or Santy as they say here) is bringing him, that he's bringing a present, a 'Thomas real water tower'. Well, we shall see if the old man in the  North Pole got the e-mails Lady sent him. There have, funny enough, been a few parcels delivered from Amazon over the past few days. Duncan did notice them, but I managed to  convince him they were all for Daddy. One large package arrived containing  a Major buggy. I'd forgotten that it had been ordered for him by the OT. It's a large stroller, designed for disabled children, and we decided to try it out right away. We took a trip to the beach. Duncan  enjoyed sitting in it, he had a huge grin on his face and his arms in the air. He got out for a good run around on the beach with Lady and Thomas. When we were going home, Thomas wanted a turn in the buggy but Duncan didn't want to get out so Thomas just sat on his knee and Duncan put his arms around him and held him tight. They looked so cute together, but it was kinda hard going up the hill so Thomas got out after a while. I was pleased that it worked so well for Duncan though, I think we'll make plenty of use of this. It beats having to carry him on my back when we go for a walk and he gets a bit overloaded or tired.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/12/other-stuff-on-homefront.html", "title": "\nOther stuff on the homefront\n"},

So, I tell the children that I'm going to book this trip, probably during March. Right away Duncan protests, he tells me he is not going to Disneyland, he is not going on the aeroplane. I don't try to convince him, but I find some on-line videos of the park and various rides. He really enjoys watching these, especially the footage of the aforementioned Big Thunder Mountain train and the Buzz Lightyear ride. But, he still doesn't want to go.  I ask if he wants to stay with Granda while all the rest of us go away without him, and he says yes. No matter what way I put it to him, no matter how I try to reassure him that he'll be with Mummy on the plane and we'll be happy together, or how there are lots of fun things to do and see in Disneyland, he's just not going.

He pushing a new toy train (it puffs steam and chuffs and there's a tiny red light in the funnel) up and down his bed and chatting to himself. It's been a good day. It's been a nice few days. The highlights for me; When I was tucking Thomas into bed on Christmas eve, he hugged me and told me he'd love me forever. Lady drew a beautiful picture of herself and her brothers for Santa; Santa liked it so much, he wrote her a little message to tell her so. Thomas wrote a letter to Santa, which he read as, 'Dear Santa, I would like 5 presents please. I like you, from Thomas.' I may have seen a random selection of letters, with his name written perfectly in the middle, but Santa understood perfectly. Duncan asked me to draw a picture of Santa, so I did. Then he wanted a Santa book. So I made a book, stuck the pages together, and he dictated the story and told me what pictures to draw, then we read it together. There's no doubt now that for the 1st time, he understood exactly what was gong on this Christmas. At 6.30 this morning, we were all downstairs and everyone was delighted with their presents. Duncan was so excited and happy. He was shouting 'hooray!' and kept hugging me tight and squashing his face next to mine and kissing me saying 'cuddle you' and 'thank you!' Thomas gave me one of his chocolate coins 'for being a very good adult'. Lady looked so beautiful in her new pretty combat trousers, you know the cute ones with loads of pockets and a bit of pink embroidery so Action Man wouldn't be seen dead in them. I played a new  Harry Potter  Cd Rom with Thomas and Lady; Santa decided against getting a Nintendo DS etc. We had visitors; Gordon's mum, my dad, step-mum and her 2 sons and we all chatted, drank bucks-fizz and ate crisps. Gordon did all the cooking while I washed-up and peeled vegetable and played with children. Our meal was wonderful. Gordon's desire to improve the taste of Christmas dinner each year has obvious benefits. The rum-soaked Christmas cake I'd made was bloody excellent. I alternate each year between soaking the fruit in rum or in whiskey to celebrate our family's Jamaican and Irish roots. ;-) Doctor Who (the only telly I watched) was great fun. I thought back to Christmas 3 years ago. Duncan was 3, and because he often had his hand down the front of his nappy, he'd sometimes (or often?) inadvertently smear, well you know what. That Christmas day, I remember washing a whole box of wooden trains and track, hosing him down in the shower, and Gordon getting out the carpet washer and getting to work. Wow, we've come a long way. Anyway, like Shane says, happy Christmas yer arse.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/12/christmas-day.html", "title": "\nChristmas Day\n"},
{"date": "21 Dec 2006", "body": "\nMy sister C. flew in from London last weekend for her Christmas visit. I picked her up on Friday evening, then on Saturday afternoon, we went with Lady to do some Christmas shopping before driving all the way to my brother's house way out west. Lady stayed the night with them; she and her cousin A. are great friends. Then C. and I went over to another brother and went out to a pub in town with him and his girlfriend. It was such good crack. I chatted to a few people I knew from way back when I was at school, and to a few others I'd never met before. So much bullshit spoken in one short evening, well...not so short since we didn't leave until about 3am. I'm always on my worst behaviour when I go back home! I'd booked a room in a restaurant for Sunday lunch so I could join all my siblings, our partners/spouses, our children and Dad and G (our step mum) for a Christmas party. I cannot actually remember the last time we were all together. I have 1 older brother and 3 younger brothers and 1 younger sister. So there were 13 adults and 9 children at the party. The restaurant is situated right in the middle of northern Ireland, so even though we were driving from North East and South West, no-one would have too far to go. My dad and step mum had picked up Gordon and my boys since I was away in our car. Lady travelled with my brother and his family and I met them all in the restaurant. I had wondered how Duncan would deal with the situation and when he first saw me, he was upset and crying asking for a \"Christmas train\", whatever that is! We all went into the room and a large table had been nicely decorated for us. The children were able to run around a bit and play together and Gordon and I took turns doing 'Duncan duty'. Someone had to stay right by him all the time since twice, he slipped past us all and into the kitchen, which really wasn't the safest place for a curious, agile, autistic boy. He enjoyed going outside for little walks or pushing buttons on a couple of game/gambling machines in the bar area. We all ate our meal; plentiful and fairly typical pub-grub standard. Then we all exchanged presents. We had decided to buy one gift for each adult and child, sort of a secret Santa thing, except 2 of my brothers had already bought gifts for all the children by the time I'd told them abut this plan so the children all ended up with a pile of gifts. We all truly enjoyed ourselves. It was marvellous just to have everyone in one place like that, and getting along so well because we really do. We may have driven each other mad at times when we were children, but as adults, it's just great to be part of a large family. Our children range in age from 9 (nearly 10) to 3 and they had so much fun together. I'm so glad Duncan was happy enough to just do his own thing even though we did have to be apart from the main group often when we were looking after him, but that's OK. After a few hours, we packed up the bulging gift bags in our respective cars and drove off, each to their own corner of the country. My sister had to go back on Monday evening, so we just had a nice quiet day until then. We've all agreed that we will do this again regularly.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/12/all-together.html", "title": "\nAll together\n"},
{"date": "12 Dec 2006", "body": "\nWe arrived in Barcelona around midday on Tuesday. The airport bus dropped us very close to our hotel so we dropped off the bags and walked down La Ramblas to the harbour. Our hotel was right on this, the most famous street in Barcelona, a great location, thronged with people at all times of the day and night, home to bird sellers and flower stalls. I'd been warned by so many people to be wary there at night, but it never seemed that risky to me. Like anywhere, you just have to be careful and alert. We had lunch by the sea, and although it was the middle of December the temperature was 20 degrees (C, obviously), so a nice change from chilly, damp Ireland. Gordon picked the restaurant. He'd eaten there before when he was in Barcelona on business, and he'd been wishing then that I was with him, so this time, I was! After we'd eaten, we wandered round the city, going wherever we felt like and ended up in a food market off La Ramblas. It was amazing, hundreds of stalls of fish, meat, offal, fruit and breads. We bought some cakes (passed on the entrails) and returned to our room. The hotel was terrific, the room was clean and comfortable and the staff were so helpful. In the evening we wandered around for an hour or so, keeping an eye out for somewhere good to eat, but enjoying the sights too. Then I started to feel too hungry and tired and demanded to be fed (I don't do well on an empty stomach) so we went to a restaurant we agreed looked good. It was a wonderful meal, with lots of fresh fish and a nice bottle of cava which all left me feeling good! We didn't even leave the hotel next day until 12, and headed across the street to a cafe for breakfast. I loved that at that late hour, we were automatically handed the breakfast menu! It was pouring, but we borrowed a sturdy hotel umbrella and were perfectly protected under it.  To escape the rain, we went to the Picasso museum first. That man's work is fascinating. I was almost completely ignorant about him, and seeing the progression in themes, ideas and styles all together like that gave me a real appreciation for just why he is so revered. Like so many great artists, he was BIG on perseveration! In the evening we took the metro to Gaudi's church, probably the most renowned Barcelona landmark. It was one of those moments when the splendour of what you're seeing just hits you in the guts. I looked round when coming up the metro steps and caught my first sight and although I have seen photos of Sagrada Familia, it was something else to behold it for myself. It looked like stone that had come to life, columns went into the ground like triffids, steeples looked like honey comb; it just appeared so organic. I loved it. Across the road, there was a Christmas fair. Rows of stalls and almost all of them selling figurines and for the crib, all different types and sizes of Marys and Josephs etc., and others specialising in moss, bridges, gravel in various colours (to recreate the Bethlehem road network?) animals and little battery operated fake fires for the stable. Wandering around were loads of families with young children and there was such a happy, festival atmosphere. Even late into the night, there were many children out and about with their families. For our final meal, we decided to eat really late, so we'd be out as Gordon's birthday began. So we went to a restaurant called  7 Portes , for some Catalan food. We didn't arrive until 11. 15 and I was worried that we'd be turned away, but no, they were still seating diners at midnight. It's different in Barcelona! The food we had was great (a bit salty for me, but perhaps that's the Catalan way?) One irritating thing though; our lovely waitress brought our meals to the table, announcing in Spanish (or Catalan, I couldn't tell though they're quite different) what they were. I'd ordered a stew of monk fish, Dublin Bay prawns and potatoes and Gordon was having Paella. We both paused to admire the plates, before getting ready to eat. Suddenly a sour faced waiter swooped over and snatched my plate away without a word. He went on to berate our waitress who'd obviously given me the wrong thing. I felt a bit guilty because she had said what it was, and I, who only know about 10 words of Spanish (most of which are found on Mexican food menus) didn't realise it wasn't what I ordered, it just looked about right! Anyway, apologies were made, we waved them off, I had my meal and we tipped her well at the end because the nasty waiter had left her almost in tears. But anyway, we were able to see in Gordon's birthday together and enjoy some good food in a great setting. I was feeling on such a high, my face was hurting later from chatting and smiling so much! We managed to have breakfast in a local cafe again before going to the airport and getting back home. I was so happy to be back. The house was, as expected, a bit of a mess. All 3 children had a great time with their grandparents. My Dad told me that my step-mum enjoyed spending that time with them getting to know them better. So Barcelona, we really enjoyed our short time there. It was great to be away from the children for a while and do things on the spur of the moment, and not have to keep tabs on some small people. But best of all, was going home and having all 3 of those small people run up for a hug and show or tell how much we missed each other.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/12/barcelona.html", "title": "\nBarcelona\n"},
{"date": "25 Feb 2008", "body": "\nOn Sunday morning, we went to the animal rescue centre to walk a dog, something we've done a few times now and which Lady in particular, just loves to do. Duncan wasn't in the mood. He was irritable and insisted on being carried, so I had to walk him back to the car while Gordon carried on with the other 2. It probably didn't help that he was dressed in shorts. He had utterly refused to wear long trousers. He's going through a Noddy phase, so besides the shorts he had on an orange top and a Santa hat; the closest approximation to a Noddy hat in the dressing up box. So he sat in the car listening to  High School Musical  songs on my MP3 player. He likes  Get'cha Head in the Game  best. I think he's going to be using this device more and more, as a nice way of blocking out excess information and keeping, (altie term alert) centred. He didn't want to get out of the car when we got home, so I stayed with him for a while and he let me know how angry he was with all his 'baddest' characters. I reminded him that I'm Kala (the kind gorilla who rescued baby Tarzan in the Disney film, a role he assigned to me) and I sang \"You'll be in my heart\" to him. He climbed into my lap and calmed right down, ready to go back inside to play Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Later Lady and Thomas and I walked to the beach to attend a dog show, Scrufts, especially for mixed breed dogs. It was a cold but clear day, and the green in front of the sea is such a pleasant spot. Hundreds of gorgeous dogs were around, and no dirt! See, dog owners can do right. The compere was pantomime dame type character whom I've never seen before, but apparently is a local celebrity. We enjoyed the sheep dog display, with ducks. It was good until some ejit's unleashed mutt ran into the ring scattering the ducks and trying to pin one down. Anyway we were cold and hungry so we bought ice-creams (naturally) and went home. In the afternoon, I was helping Duncan with his RCT3 game. I noticed that he had laid a load of paths to make the words \"Disney home video\"! He had placed a water ride next to it, this apparently was the sea for the Little Mermaid. He had placed entertainers on the letter paths, all dressed up and representing, to him, various Little Mermaid characters. He is such an independent thinker. The same trait that leads to difficulty, when he doesn't get his way with things he wants to have and do, also leads to these ideas and ways of adapting games, toys, furniture or whatever to fit his vision. He knows exactly what he wants to achieve and how, and it bugs him when the rest of us, who have the power sometimes, don't just do what he wants us to! Lastly, I was amused and pleased at his revelation last night after he'd been to the loo. \"Thin chips,\" he said, referencing the frozen fries he'd eaten earlier, \"turn into poo...in the stomach.\" This is good. He was saying it mostly to himself, but it shows me, what I may have underestimated, that he is continuing to make links, take in information and learn about the wider world. I credit Lady for having imparted this crucial information. They have a \"lift the flap\" human body book and greatly enjoy the page on digestion. When I told her about Duncan's announcement, she laughed and said it was because she'd shown him the book and its page about the \"regime of eating a pear.\" I think she meant \"process\" but at least she's trying out her extended vocabulary!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Musical"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/02/his-own-vision.html", "title": "\nHis own vision\n"},

When she came home with Gordon, Thomas ran over to hug her and congratulated her; it was really nice. Apart from that I had a great morning out alone having my hair cut at a fancy place and I'm really starting to look forward to our trip away now. Yesterday morning we all went to see  Happy Fee t at the cinema. I enjoyed it at first, it was all very sweet and a bit  Moulin Rouge  like, and the cute, odd penguin dancing to Stevie Wonder was fun to watch. But, I wish we'd all left at least half an hour before the end; it  really  dragged on, Robin William's voice-over was annoying and some characterisations were kinda racist and the whole environmental theme was way over the heads of almost all the children watching.  Why can't more children's films just be pitched at, what do you call them again, oh yeah - children! It would have been better to preach just one worthy message while entertaining with a nice story. Oh and one more thing, at the end (sorry if this spoils it for anyone) the humans decide to quit their destruction, because of how cute the dancing penguins are, so basically, the elephant seals, who can neither sing nor dance and nor look anything close to cute, well they're totally effed! Anyway, while we were watching it, my own little Mumble was wriggling about, walking up and down the side aisle (the cinema was only about 20% full) and he kept dancing along, doing the jiggly feet thing and all! It was funny to see his timely demonstration that some children dance instead of singing; we  did  like the neurodiverse penguin thing. He also lay in the aisle for a bit and then as it went on for far too long and he (and Thomas) lost all interest, he ran to the exit and started to chew his top before stripping down to his vest. I did move about the cinema a fair bit to stay near him. Later Gordon went shopping and came home with an inflatable punch bag (oh, and the eggs, milk, juice, tea etc. too!) That was a big hit (boom boom!) Lady started demonstrating her martial arts skills; I haven't seen her do it for a while and I was well impressed at how good she looked, but then, she is a yellow belt now ;-) Thomas and Duncan just enjoyed bashing the bejaysus out of it. Duncan for some reason keeps trying to lie on it and quoting from Finding Nemo, specifically, 'swim down, swim down.' I'm not getting the connection at all yet. So anyway, I'm lying in bed typing this before starting my day. I've got to tidy and clean like crazy, make it appear half decent for my dad and step-mum who, like angels, are looking after the children when we go away - tomorrow.

Lady got stuck into her maths book, and worked really hard. Thomas mostly played PC games, especially  The Polar Express  and  Timez Attack , a free downloadable game. He's played it so often now that he can answer many of the multiplication questions himself. He also read for me;  Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?   We're going to make our own version of that book today. He might even decide to draw something other than a rainbow (the only thing he currently will draw) to illustrate it! While the others were busy, Duncan and I remade his 'Trevor' book on the computer. We Googled images  and he chose which ones to use. He also picked photos of me and himself, then instructed me on where to place everything on the page and what size to make them. We're very proud of our efforts, so I'm sticking it on here! In the evening, I took Lady swimming. She went in and I watched from the side. I have never seen her swim before, she swam the width of the pool, and has never had a lesson, but splashed about lots with her friends at her summer scheme. I'll go in with her when my hands heal again (my intermittent eczema problem) and help her develop a better style. It was lovely going out alone with her though. She is such a great girl, so happy and positive. The town was lit up for Christmas, and she declared everything to be gorgeous! Then in the pool, she kept catching my eye and giving a little wave, before diving under the water! And now, our book! Duncan wants a new train. Duncan wants a Daniel\u2019s Trevor train. Mummy buys a Trevor train on Ebay. The man in the train shop puts Trevor into the parcel. Then the man brings the parcel to the Post Office. The postman puts Duncan's parcel into his bag.

She said that I should write, 'I don't mind autism because Duncan wouldn't be Duncan without autism and he's a nice boy, he's very funny and he was a cute baby.' She wanted me to include her opinion, so there you are. She also asked me to include a photo of Duncan as a baby and just to show off my gorgeous children, I've put up pictures of each of them. Another brother and SIL and their children came for a visit on Saturday. Lady and her cousin A (who's just over a year older than her) had a great girlie time together, playing with the guinea pigs, dressing up, making up dances and acting out Harry Potter games. Thomas and my only nephew were together all day, Duncan joined them in building a huge train track in the living room. Gordon had to work in the morning but joined us for dinner, and Dad and G. came in too to get a chance to see everyone. It was another nice, family day. It didn't hurt that the Irish rugby team roundly defeated the English...in Croke Park! On Sunday we went to a Potato Fayre; why its spelt like that I don't know. But anyway, there was a donkey, who was coping admirably with hundreds of small children feeding him hay, a horse and trap jogging around and stalls with hundreds of potato varieties. A band was playing, and Lady and Thomas had a go at chucking a welly boot as far as they could, each winning a prize (pens and rulers) for their efforts. I'm making it sound a bit like the fair in  Father Ted  (the world's worst funfair) but it wasn't quite that bad ;-) We walked down to the beach after, all the children eating ice-creams in spite of the low temperature and drizzle. Duncan was fine until he saw all the dogs out walking and then he got upset that they wouldn't tickle him! He (and Lady) desperately want a dog. I'd consider it and could possibly be persuaded, but not Gordon. I recently read about how the  Irish Guidedogs  charity have been training assistance dogs for autistic children. It appears they have been very beneficial for these children. Now if someone was to offer us a well trained dog like one of those, I'd be pretty keen.

{"date": "29 Feb 2008", "body": "\nAn Irish anti-vaccination spokesperson has popped up in the  letters page of the Irish Independent . He's hoping to cash in on their  recent focus on autism  to promote his own crank theories: In respect of the report that certain TDs are demanding special education classes for autistic children, I recall that some years ago, the Irish Independent reported that the National Adult Literacy Agency claimed that more that 400,000 people in this country had some level of difficulty in reading and writing and that the problem is causing an amount of alarm.       Included were an increasing number of brain-damaged autistic children    euphemistically classed as \"slow learners\".     Autism is still on the increase worldwide, and nobody is asking why.     We should be concerned about prevention and not education and we no longer    can ignore the pharmaceutical link to autism and other infant disorders    since the dangers of mercury in infant vaccines have been known for decades.    In the US, where vaccination is compulsory, autism is now an epidemic with    an increase of 1,354pc and $90bn (\u20ac59.4bn) annual health care costs.       In 1976, one in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism. By the year 2004    the figure was an one in 166.       Mercury is extremely dangerous to vulnerable infants. We need to bear in    mind that when the Hep B and HiB vaccines were added to the recommended    schedule of infant jabs the cumulative amount of mercury to which infants    were exposed nearly tripled.       At the 2004 Autism One Conference in Chicago, Jeff Sell, the personal injury    trial attorney on behalf of vaccine injury litigants, produced a copy of an    email written on June 29, 1999 by a former scientist for the US Food and    Drug Administration (FDA), Peter Patriarca, which stated:       \"I will raise questions about FDA being 'asleep at the switch' for    decades, by allowing a potentially hazardous compound to remain in many    infant vaccines, and not forcing vaccine firms to exclude it from new    products. I will also raise questions about various advisory bodies'    aggressive recommendations for use.       \"We must keep in mind that the dose of ethyl mercury was not generated    by 'rocket science'; conversion of the percentage of Thimerosal to actual    micrograms of mercury involves 9th-grade algebra.\"        PATRICK J CARROLL   I dashed off a quick comment, working to keep it less than 1000 characters as mandated by their software. 1. Autistic people are neither 'brain damaged' nor necessarily, 'slow learners.' 2. The evidence shows that actual autism rates are not increasing. 3. The diagnostic criteria for autism were widened between 1976 and 2004, meaning more people are eligible for the autism label. 4. The proponents of a vaccine link to autism have no evidence to back this claim. Many large scientific studies have failed to make such a connection. The 'Archives of Disease in Childhood' Feb 2008 paper by Baird  et al  shows no evidence of an MMR-autism link. 5. Thiomersal is no longer used in childhood vaccines in Ireland, or in the USA. It has never been used in the MMR vaccine. 6. The ethyl mercury in thiomersal, is quickly excreted. (see Paediatrics, Feb 2008) 7. A 9 year old email of questionable veracity is of no relevance to these issues. 8. Mercury poisoning bears no resemblance to autism. 9. More children are getting preventable infectious diseases as vaccination rates decrease. Sadly, some die. If space had allowed, I'm sure I'm sure I could have come up with more. But perhaps it's best I didn't get the opportunity to express what I really think of Mr Carroll's correspondence.

He loves it!  He keeps carrying it round with him and reading it over and over. I have to improve the little pictures a bit every so often too; he'll stare at one for a while, then ask me to, for example, draw in a wooden floor, complete with knots in the wood, or the bricks in the wall of the house picture, alternating bricks in brown and orange. It's so important to him to get it right, and he works so hard finding the words to communicate what's in his head. His ability to read has taken a huge leap forward over the past few days too. I remember someone telling me that it seemed her child became more difficult to deal with when he had a surge in ability with some other skill; perhaps that's what is happening here. Anyway, he has been pointing to each word, reading it clearly, skipping the few words he doesn't know yet, and carrying on with the story. I have never seen him do this before, he never seemed to recognise that they were all individual words before. Gordon watched him with me on Friday, and was so proud of him (and a bit misty eyed too!) The big news for Thomas, is he now wears glasses. He is slightly short sighted and really only needs to wear his new glasses for stuff like watching TV. Thomas is so proud of then though, that he wears them all the time. In fact, he's decided to start sleeping on the bottom of their bunk beds, so he can get into bed, pull his duvet over himself, and then finally, he removes the glasses, puts them carefully into their case and places it on his chest of drawers. He walked around on Friday and Saturday, with a zig-zag scar drawn on his forehead, so he looks more like his hero, Harry Potter. On Friday night, he and Lady both spent the night at their friends house. It was a sleep over for his 12th birthday, and there were, oh, about 20 or so children sleeping there. Thomas was so excited when I'd told him he would be staying, and immediately went to pack his bag. He had a great time, hanging out with his best little buddy, and apparently, he's a dab hand with these DS electronic games now too! Lady loved it too. They watched a bunch of exciting movies, and she slept with the 2 big girls also staying over. The best bit, she told me, was when she and another girl, were on an exercise bike belonging to D (the very brave Mum hosting this whole gang). They both raved about chocolate birthday cake, pizza and pop, and were all fast asleep by 7.30 the following night. Thanks D! (Update, the new 'Daniel's Trevor engine' has just arrived in the post, exactly as described in our story!  Hurrah!)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/11/good-and-bad.html", "title": "\nGood and bad\n"},
{"date": "21 Nov 2006", "body": "\nSince there's been a man painting in our house for the past week, we've been spending every day out. It's been costly, stressful, tiring, enlightening and fun all mixed up. On Thursday, we went to my Dad's apartment for the day. The children love it there. Lady and Thomas played snakes and ladders and 4-in-a-row, and Duncan checked their cupboards for sweet things/looked through the Argos catalogue/played with trains. My step-mum encouraged me to go out for a while, so I took the opportunity of meeting up with Gordon for lunch at a (quite upmarket) restaurant. It's clientele was mostly men in suits and elegant ladies, with hair that's 'done' once a week. We had a really nice meal, and when Gordon went back to work, I went off and spent some of his hard earned cash on some clothes for me. I got back to the children after a couple of hours away feeling like I'd been on holiday. This is certainly one of the benefits of living quite close to your parents! On Friday, it was my mother-in-law's turn to put up with us for a while. I had to leave Duncan and Lady with her while I took Thomas to the optometrist for an eye test. He was so solemn sitting there during the test, and even when he couldn't make out the test letters, he always had a guess- he'd never admit to not knowing! So, he is a bit short-sighted (not surprising since Gordon and I both are) and we went off to choose some frames for him. He's delighted of course, bring him closer to his goal of looking like Harry Potter. After that, my MIL had to go out, so to use up some more time, I took all the children to the transport museum. I asked Lady to stay with Thomas and make sure he was OK so I could stay with Duncan. At first, Duncan was 'stuck' in the cafe, crying for cakes or chocolate bars, but I knew he wasn't hungry as he'd just eaten before we arrived. He also had a hard time getting past the big display case of with the model railway and a Percy and Thomas train in there too. He kept trying to open the glass door, while I tried to distract him with something else, and threatened to take him home. After a bit of noise, he started to run off to look at some other things. A group of men were setting up some model railways for a one day exhibit the following day. I was right beside Duncan, with my hand on his shoulder, making sure he didn't cause any harm to the intricate, lovingly arranged sets. He did reach out and touch one signal post, even though I was whispering to him to 'just look, not touch.' One of the men setting up snapped at me, 'don't let him touch anything.' Duncan was struggling to get away from me again, and I thought 'grumpy ould f.' and called Lady to tell her we'd have to leave right away. Duncan cried and said he wanted to go on the big engine, so I relented and took him to climb into the cab of one of the steam trains. And that was the turning point, from then on he was great and we all had a lovely time. About 20 minutes later, the man who'd spoken to me earlier came past. I avoided eye contact, feeling very offended and all, but he came up and apologised for snapping at me earlier. Wow, I wasn't expecting that! I did appreciate it though. I told him that I did have to stay close to Duncan who's autistic and loves trains, but could inadvertently cause damage. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if Duncan joins their group in 10 years time! The rest of that day was spent having lunch in the McD place, running about in the forest park (we all patted a beautiful Great Dane) and watching part of a DVD in the car while it rained. Yesterday we went to the local indoor play area. We arrived at 11.15 but couldn't go in as they only can let preschool aged children in before 12. So we had an early lunch, more junk food at the drive through, then went back for 12 on the dot. The children had the place entirely to themselves and made the most of it. Thomas was brave enough to go down the huge, high, inflatable slide with Lady, and Duncan went on a bouncy castle for the first time. He spent more time in the ball pool though. We then drove back to my Dad's apartment for the afternoon and Duncan did some reading practise using the Argos catalogue; he can now read all sorts of important words like 'busy time Thomas' and Grrr, Roar, Ding and Toot.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/11/our-week-out.html", "title": "\nOur week out\n"},
{"date": "14 Nov 2006", "body": "\nOn Sunday, the whole family went for a walk down to the beach, then we drove to the drive through at you-know-where. There were happy faces all round. We're having our hallway and kitchen painted this week, using a  washable  paint. So, we're getting out during the day so the man doing the decorating can get on with it, without lots of little helping hands. Yesterday Gordon took time off work and we went to W5. Lady and Thomas stayed with Gordon while I looked after Duncan. We managed to run around every square metre of that 5 floor building. Who needs a gym? I don't! In between all the running (and chasing) lots of things captured his interest for long enough to warrant a pause for further investigation. My favourite bit, was when we played with some plastic dinosaurs and and made some frame-by-frame animation films of them bashing into each other - as you do! Suddenly Duncan decided to move on to something else, so he ran off, and as I went after him, I heard him say, 'that's it, that's a wrap!' I have no idea where he heard that before, or how he was able to say it in such an appropriate setting. He uses lots of expressions from the  Green Eggs and Ham  book now too. It's great for expressing a disinclination to acquiesce, like, 'I do not like it here or there' or 'I would not, could not'. When I turn off his light at night, he says 'Not in the dark!' And he sometimes follows up with the rest of the line, 'not in a tree, not in a car, you let me be!' I think it's magical, seeing how he adapts all these scripts in his head, chops and sorts them and uses them in such a logical way! Today we spent the day with some friends. (I had warned my friend D to 'brace herself' for our arrival!) We all had a great time and us mums had a good natter. Lady and Thomas have become very interested in a boy band from a children's TV show set in Belfast. It's called  Bel's Boys , and I keep hearing snippets of their songs, mostly sung by Thomas when he's sitting on the floor building a puzzle or whatever. He wants a guitar for Christmas (so does Lady). She also told me that when they were at W5, a teenager said Thomas was cute and he responded with 'I'm not cute, I'm a singer and I do rock!' So there!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.citv.co.uk/page.asp?partid=14&src=http://umguk.vice-versa.info/v-v/061004162655"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/11/thats-wrap.html", "title": "\nThat's a wrap!\n"},
{"date": "7 Nov 2006", "body": "\nYesterday, the whole family enjoyed a walk in the country park, with the low sun coming through autumn trees. Lady walked alongside Thomas, and I smiled to see her arm protectively on his shoulder when were on the narrow path along the road. Duncan rode on my back until we reached the forest and he dashed off along the beech leaf strewn path. It really was beautiful. We passed under the viaduct, just missing a passing train, and carried on to the waterfall. Duncan was in front all along, and I was running after him calling for him to stop or slow down. He didn't want to go home, and wanted me to carry him again when we were back on the road. Gordon and I tried to get him to walk; I walked on ahead and he sat on the ground crying. Soon, he ran up to me and I gave in (as usual) and picked him up again. We will be getting a buggy for him soon, so perhaps this particular issue will hopefully be sorted out, but... This is a recurring thing round here, Duncan cries long and loud enough, and I cave in. It's not right. There are some things that are causing problems, that have built up over time, and I can see now that I have set up these situations Oh, it's not all the time, I can distract him most of the time, and I don't even mind the low level whining for things that he does when we're at home. What is the biggest issue of all, and what I would most like to change right now, is the problems we have about going out. Everywhere we go, he knows where there are sweets and cakes available. And worse still, are the trains, oh god the trains!! Every time we are driving home, having gone out anywhere in the car, he starts shouting and crying asking for whatever train is next on his wish list and saying 'No go home!' I used to buy one every week when I took Lady to drama, and had to wait around in the town for an hour. That wasn't too tricky as they were cheap and easily available. But now, he's looking for engines which aren't available anywhere except via the internet. I've bought a few, to give him as presents when (for example) Gordon returns from a conference, but sometimes he's just had them from the postman as they are delivered too. Oh dear, this is very boring to explain. But if anyone is still reading at this point, how can I get us all out of this. I don't want to punish him when he starts shouting. He's not doing it to be naughty; he's learned that there's a good chance that he'll get what he wants from that kind of behaviour. I don't usually use reward type systems with the children, but perhaps this is what is required now. Gordon and I were talking about some sort of way to let him build up credits to earn the toy he wants, so he knows that they would still be available, just not because he's shouted at me. I would not punish him for doing the wrong thing, he takes really badly to being told off, so if I was to remove stickers (or something), he'd be freaked out. I need to go off and analyse my behaviour now ;-)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/11/do-reward-systems-help.html", "title": "\nDo reward systems help?\n"},
{"date": "10 Nov 2006", "body": "\nThese were taken in W5, when our friends were over with us a few weeks ago. Don't I have some fine children! (See, who's playing with toy trains in behind Lady!) Then there's Thomas looking oh so grown up! Last Sunday, Duncan finally persuaded me to make this cardboard Percy train. He'd seen a photo of something similar (only much more professional looking!) when he'd been Googling his beloved engines, and kept asking me to get 'cardboard, green paint, red paint, yellow paint, black paint.' I pulled them all out of my seldom used art box and we all went to work, with Duncan directing proceedings 'yellow number six, that size  (and he shows us with his hands)  goes there.' He loved it when it was finished. Gordon has been away since Tuesday and will return on Saturday; another conference, this time in Prague. Nice work eh! We've been getting along fine, We had friends over yesterday. Thomas was delighted to hang out for ages with his bestest buddy and Duncan loves the  Crazy Frog  music toy we were so kindly given. Lady and the boys were playing some macabre game that involved at one stage, leaving some of the bits of Gordon's plastic teaching skeleton (the one we store in the closet) in a corner of the garden, sprinkled with strawberry milkshake mix ('it's supposed to be blood'). They had a load of fun, and I had, as always, a really nice chat with my friend. Today, they boys took turns on the PC. Thomas played his  Jojo in Numberland  game all the way through (showing some pretty advanced maths skills) and then Duncan took over. He called me over to help him, and I looked at the screen. He had typed 'fiorence magic roundabout' into Google. He learned how to write 'Magic Roundabout' by himself yesterday, and I had written the word 'Florence' down for him a few days ago. He was obviously typing it from memory, just mixing up the  i  and  l  keys.

{"date": "2 Mar 2008", "body": "\nI won at the  Irish Blog Awards ! Yes! This thing you're now reading, is officially the  Best Specialist Blog in the Irish blogosphere .  Don't ask me what I'm a specialist in... I'm guessing it's something to do with the autism stuff. But anyway, I'm a winner. I'm just going to take a minute to gloat. That's better. SO last night, the Irish Blog Awards were held in a Dublin hotel. I went down from Belfast on the train with my cousin Miche. Though I really didn't expect to win, I was sure it'd be a good night out and a chance to meet a few cyber buddies. It was very well organised, and we were pleased to see that proceeds from the entrance charge went to an epilepsy charity. We took our seats feeling a bit out of place at first. It seemed that many other people there already knew one another. I wondered how I'd ever know who was who, not knowing what anyone looks like. The only way to tell was to gawk closely at the name badges perched on chests and since the place was packed with close to 400 people, that wasn't going to be easy. It was all hosted by a proper radio DJ and blogger,  Rick O'Shea , and each category was introduced by George W. Bush in a series of witty video things. Each winner received a really nice cut glass trophy, champagne and a DVD player. Not a bad haul of booty! Eventually I got chatting to a few people sitting near me,  73Man  and the  Dublin Community bloggers , and got them to promise to cheer for my blog when it was called out, as I was a bit worried that no-one there would know it, leaving only me and Miche clapping. I'm shallow enough to worry about such things.  But when my time came, they did me proud, and amazingly and fantastically,  this  actually won. I gave a very garbled speech, thanking my children for providing me with lots of material together with the media for writing so much rubbish about autism. I don't think it came out the way I meant it to... I forgot to pose for my photo with the sponsor of my category, iQ Content, and had to go back up. Ah well. At least then, the few people there who do read my ramblings knew what I look like, and  Heidi  and  Bock  were both nice enough to come say hello and be ever so lovely about my win. I have to say, as a person who has never won anything, never been singled out for particular praise, winning an award for writing this, is such a wonderful, delightful thing. I love blogging, especially so today! As the night went on, I got chatting to more bloggers and everyone was so lovely and enthusiastic. I got to meet  Hangar Queen , and  Maman Poulet , and I was able to question  Twenty Major  about his naughty language and thank the organiser  Damien Mulley , for going to so much effort to make us northerners feel at home, (the stage was decked in red, white and blue bunting, and looked like parts of Belfast in July, though the intended effect was a USA presidential rally). Miche and me sat with the Dublin blogger crowd, a smart move as it turned out, as they were great company. It was especially nice to hang out with  Red Mum  who, it turns out, is herself a Belfast woman. We even had a bit of a dance since it all ended with a disco. In the end, I staggered both proudly and a wee bit woozily to bed.

{"date": "2 Nov 2006", "body": "\nA few days ago, when we were coming back from a walk, a woman was walking past our gate when she stopped and gestured to me to come over. She told me that she had been driving past the house a few days ago when my little boy was out on the road, waving and standing in front of her car when she was driving. I was surprised, as I couldn't even think when that might have happened and explained that he's autistic. She told me she already knew, she'd spoken to his Granda previously (my Dad knows my neighbours better than I do!). She said that she saw him run back to the house, so I suppose she felt it was safe enough to leave him then and not inform me at the time. As she was talking, Duncan came out again in his bare feet. I asked him to go get some shoes, and he pointed at her and said 'Go away!' Lady was around and she said,  'he's saying that to Mummy because he wants her to get him something.' She was obviously trying to prevent the woman from feeling bad, but Duncan came right up to us, looked straight at the woman and told her 'Go away woman', so there was no mistaking his meaning. I apologised in a sort of general way, and she looked pityingly at me and said that it must be very hard on me. I was well flustered by then (thinking about what might have happened to Duncan that day, wondering how it happened etc.) that I was only able to mumble something about him being a great boy, but one with limited understanding at times. I soon figured that it must have happened the day the cavity wall insulation and loft insulation were installed. The men kept coming and going and leaving the front door open. I kept Duncan engaged with stories and as many little 3d pictures of trains as he wanted. But I had to go upstairs for a moment, and Lady came up to tell me that Duncan had gone outside and was climbing up the ladder. I ran down and brought him back inside straight away, but the road incident must have happened just before that. Thankfully we live on a very quiet road; only vehicles going to the houses on the street need come down it. As I've thought about this several times in the days since, I get a shiver of fear for what might have been. Aren't children great at doing that to you? I also can't help thinking that if I'd been in her position, and I saw a young child I knew was autistic (and therefore developmentally delayed) out on the road, I'd get out of the car and make sure he got home and tell his parent about it at the same time. Perhaps I'm trying to offload some of my own guilt onto her though. But I just can't forget the pity thing either. I know it's harder raising a child like Duncan than children like Lady and Thomas. But I don't know if people realise when they say that, how it upsets me to see him singled out as a source of pity for his mother. He is my son, and brings me more joy than I can express.

{"date": "1 Nov 2006", "body": "\nSo where are we; halloween, family parties, children learning stuff and making mess, ah life as usual. Last Friday, Gordon's Mum came over to mind the children for a few hours in the evening and Gordon and I went out for a meal. It was the first time we'd been out together for ages, and it was lovely. Then on Saturday night I was gallivanting again. This time Gordon stayed at home and I went to the home town with Dad and G for my cousin's engagement party. I always have such great crack when I get together with all my cousins and aunts and uncles. The bonus was, I was asked by yet another cousin to help pick the fancy dress winners in the party he had organised downstairs from our party; the power, the POWER!! (For the record, the grim reaper won, with 2nd and 3rd places going to the naughty policewoman (she must a' been foundered) and the gangster.) I stayed the night in my Dad's place, and had a  long  lie in the next morning. It was bliss. On Monday, we started the day with a walk to the beach. I should really have prepared for the wet trousers and socks that ensued, but I hadn't, so Thomas had a cold, wet walk home. Duncan had removed his trousers, socks and wellies and strode into the sea with his two skinny pale legs sticking out from his big winter coat. He insisted on being carried most of the way home which was knackering. I'm hoping to get a Major buggy for him soon. The occupational therapist has ordered one. Then when he's feeling overloaded or tired, he can just sit down and hide behind a Thomas book or something, instead of wanting to be carried. For the rest of that day, we all worked really hard, with everyone concentrating mainly on reading skills. Lady took one of those reading tests and although she had a score which was just the same as her chronological age, it was clear that she simply guessed lots of the words, when I knew that she would be able to 'sound them out'. So we did a bit of the 'Toe by Toe' phonics reading book we used when she was younger then she read some of her 'Pippi' story aloud. She really loves the Dorling Kinderly 'explorer' CD Roms we have. Both she and Duncan played the World Explorer one quite a bit recently. Duncan particularly likes the bit about the Pacific Ocean; he recites chunks of it now! We took Duncan over to spend some more time with his Granda, and the rest of us went to the folk museum where there were special events for Halloween. Lady had dressed up as a witch; I had painted a (crude!) web and spider on her green face, and she wore some deep red lipstick. It looked good actually. Thomas wore his Harry Potter quidditch costume, not really scary but he liked it! They both had small toy brooms, and Thomas sat on his and rode the whole way rounds the museum. Lady began to feel self-conscious as she was the only child with her face painted and she started to get grumpy and negative about the whole thing. Everything was starting to wind down by the time we arrived too, even though there were 2 hours to go before closing time. It was cold and windy so got back in the car to go get Duncan. We decided that we'd buy a spooky DVD, go home, cook the burgers I'd bought earlier and have a home movie night. The film we choose was 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and we all snuggled on the sofa to watch it. (The film was OK, funny in parts but far too long; the kids liked it though, especially the ghoulish bits which would have freaked the bejesuz out of me and my equally wimpy siblings when we were their age.) So now I'm all caught up again!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/11/halloween-and-all-that.html", "title": "\nHalloween and all that\n"},
{"date": "18 Oct 2006", "body": "\nOn Monday, I was in the charity shop dropping off a load of stuff and then in TK Maxx buying Lady a winter coat. Somehow I also ended up with a load of new CD Roms for the children. One was  Green Eggs and Ham  (a bargain at \u00a32) which I thought the boys might like. Well, Duncan just loves it and spent ages playing it yesterday, following the story, repeating the words. I had to draw the train (obviously). I've also had to cook many fried eggs (no yellow bit) for the boy, so more benefits there. I never liked Dr Seuss as a child, but I know now it was because I never heard the books read aloud, I was trying to read them to myself quietly, and they just don't work that way. Oh, I've seen the paper linking TV viewing to autism. It's a joke, it has to be a spoof. I'm hoping the authors will come out someday soon and say, 'see how easy it is to sucker you all with some dodgy theory.' Just stick in the word autism and the media opens up to you. Sorry, strike that, they'll ignore most stuff like studies on autistic cognition and studies flagging up the errors in the earlier 'measles in autistic guts' stuff, but come out with any hare brained idea of what the cause of autism is, and they're falling over themselves to give you column inches. Gordon has gone to Chicago for the week. Yikes! Thankfully, we are having guests this week. Our much anticipated visit from some really good friends from London. Lady in particular is very excited; her best friend in the whole wide world is coming! I must go help her now.

{"date": "5 Mar 2008", "body": "\nMy daughter is nine years old. She is the most considerate and thoughtful of children. She adores her brothers, though she gets fed up with them when they bug her at times. It seems that Thomas causes this reaction more than Duncan, but mainly because they spend so much time together. As the oldest of three, and the big sister to a disabled brother, she has more responsibilities on her strong, young shoulders than many children. I rely on her to help me gather the clan to go out places, find the right shoes, fetch the car keys, keep an eye on Thomas while I concentrate on Duncan, that sort of thing. She has had a deep, intense bond with Duncan, ever since he was born and she was just under two years old and unable to pronounce his name properly. She has always just accepted him as he is. She has explained him simply to many of her friends who have come around and been puzzled at the odd behaviour of her little brother. She has never exhibited embarrassment or unease around him, nor has she taken on any aspects of the \"poor deprived sibling\" mantle, often mentioned in discussions about disabled children. Her  views on her brother's autism  were published on the NAS \" Think differently about autism \" site, though that section has since been removed. As far as I could tell, hers was one of the few \"insights into autism\" which wasn't entirely negative. It was however, entirely honest. As well as straightforwardly explaining his differences to her friends, Lady has always been of so much help whenever the children have been looked after by other people. Our main babysitters have been my sister, dad and Gordon's mum. Each time, Lady has been on hand to offer advice and to interpret for her brother. This weekend, while I was in Dublin, Gordon's mum looked after the children for the afternoon and evening until Gordon returned from a day-trip abroad. Lady sorted out all Duncan's meals for him, and helped settle him at night. He opted to sleep at the bottom of her bed like a little puppy, wanting to be close to his wonderful big sister. I'm so proud of that girl. Here's what she wrote about Mother's Day; It was Mothers day yesterday and it was fun. My Mum's name is Sharon and she is thirty six and is very funny. If my room is not tidy she will go mad. When I was five I'd think she was going to morf [morph] into a monster but she didn't. I love to go shopping with my Mum and I love to play with her too. On Mothers day I gave my Mum a card which was home made and I gave her some flowers. I will sometimes give her some chocolate or some fudge. I love my Mum a lot. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/03/ode-to-lady.html", "title": "\nAn ode to Lady\n"},
{"date": "24 Oct 2006", "body": "\nOur friends arrived from London on Thursday. It was wonderful to see them, the girls whom I'll call Annie and Clarabel and their mum S. (It's OK S., I promise not to call you Bertie here). S. and I met at antenatal classes meaning Lady and Annie were born a few weeks apart. They've been friends since they were babies and have a real close sister-like bond. Clarabel is a 5 year old, cute little imp of a girl. I miss seeing them, as we used to spend a lot of time round their house and they in ours, and we were always available to mind each others children when necessary (though I was easily the main beneficiary of the free child-minding!) The children clicked back to being together instantly and spent hours playing with dolls and dressing up and reading and watching films and drawing. Me and S. did OK too, we managed to find plenty to chat about, heh, no problems there! My Dad drove over on Thursday and took Duncan off to stay with him for the day. He'd only been away for 20 minutes when he phoned me. I worried that something might  be wrong, but no; he wanted to let me know some of the cute things Duncan had done on the journey. First he'd pointed at some cranes in the city (Belfast is laden with cranes right now) and said it was the harbour ('cause of Cranky the crane in the Thomas stories) then he pointed out the hospital where he'd been recently and told his Granda it was the dentist. Also, my Dad was singing to him and playing an opposite game. He said, 'do be do be do!', Duncan replied 'do be do be  don't !' So Duncan spent a few hours with Dad and G. in their apartment. They took a trip to the pet shop, and just had a lovely time. He was able to communicate all his needs perfectly, even when a tiny train picture I'd made earlier was binned by accident, Duncan let them know so it could be retrieved again. Oh, another first too; when he went to the loo, he said to Dad, 'Go away, no adults.' I didn't even know he knew that word! It's clear that spending time with his Granda is really good for him, and I know Granda and G. enjoyed it too! At 6 o'clock, he gathered up all his toys, packing them into his bag, went to the door and announced 'I must go home.' So, he did. While he was away, we had a trip into town and had a hoke round the shops. That night, the girls took ages to fall asleep, preferring to natter into the night. Eventually they dropped off, only to wake at 4.30 am, put the lights on and come ask me if it was morning! Well, nooo my darlings... On Friday, we went to W5, obviously. It's our favourite place to go. Annie and Clarabel loved it. They had an exhibition of some of the sets from the  Wallace and Grommit  movie. The detail and humour in these sets is stunning. I made the mistake of looking at something Annie wanted to show me for, oh all of 15 secs and when I looked back to check on Duncan, he had gone. I asked the 2 women on the door of that room if they'd seen a small boy with curly hair whizz by; they had not, but that didn't mean much. I had them warn the person on the main exit to make sure he didn't go out (they all have walkie talkies) then ran down stairs to look for him in the cafe area and sweet shop where he usually goes. He wasn't there but I found him minutes later in another area. He'd only been out of sight for about 4 minutes. After that, I was kept very busy tailing the boy as he explored and investigated. All very nice for him but knackering for me! At least the girls and Thomas all went off to sleep early that night. Duncan was still buzzing 'til after 10 though. Yawn! On Saturday, my Dad came out to our house on the train and once more, he took Duncan off with him for the afternoon. They went to the park where Duncan spent all his time in the sand pit, barefoot (in Northern Ireland in October?) and happily digging and piling sand. Afterwards, they stopped at a shop for ice-cream. Duncan tried to get out of the car via the front door and G, my step-mum, had to hold him until Dad got back. He fought and shouted, and when he was settled again he apparently looked at my Dad and said about G, 'I don't like that woman!' Thankfully she wasn't offended! And she was able to buy her way into his affections again by being the one to hand over the ice-cream; good move! This time, the rest of us went to the zoo. There were few other people there, which was a new experience for our London visitors. We all had a nice time and a good work out going up and down those hills. The highlights were the penguin who flirted with everyone through the viewing window into their pool, and the elephants. Our guests went back home on Sunday morning leaving us all alone again. We'd had such a nice time together, especially Lady who I was delighted to see, gets on with her friend just as well as if they'd never been apart. They really do love each other like sisters, and I know they will always be close. Gordon returned from his conference in Chicago on Monday afternoon, feeling utterly exhausted. I am too, and hope we can get things back to normal again soon. Having him away for so long is hard, though it wasn't so bad this time having friends here and so much help with Duncan. I have been a bit low though and need to get my routines in place again, and hope and pray the boy starts going off to sleep a bit more easily soon.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wandg.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/10/annie-and-clarabel-arrive.html", "title": "\nAnnie and Clarabel arrive\n"},
{"date": "10 Mar 2008", "body": "\nOh dear. The latest source of nonsense and misinformation has reached this side of the Atlantic Ocean. I noticed this headline yesterday, from a UK local newspaper (Newcastle's Sunday Sun), \" Court links MMR to autism .\" This little piece of fiction is attributed to Phil Doherty; FAMILIES who blamed the MMR jab for their children\u2019s autism may be vindicated by a landmark court case. The Government has denied a link between the immunisation and autism, but a US court ruled that a girl did develop the condition after a series of jabs. No it did not. The child in question, Hannah Poling, was found to have an extremely rare, genetically acquired metabolic disorder affecting her mitochondria. The case was heard by the  USA Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, which requires a much lower standard of evidence than scientific or medical procedures would require. This is so as to make it easier for plaintiffs seeking damages in those rare cases when it is more likely than not that there is a negative reaction to a vaccine, no matter what the specific injury is. As  Hannah's father himself says ; Proving the link legally is quite different than proving it scientifically, Poling says. \"When you are talking about the courtroom vs. science, the burden of proof is different,\" Poling tells WebMD.       \"We showed there was a plausible mechanism, we showed that an injury occurred shortly after her vaccination. Her growth curve went flat for months.\"       To prove something scientifically, rather than legally, he points out, only a 5% possibility (or one in 20 chance) that something happens by chance is allowable. The case documents have been published on an anti-vaccination propaganda site. www.ageofautism.com/2008/02/full-text-autis.html The court ruling states; In sum, DVIC has concluded that the facts of this case meet the statutory criteria for demonstrating that the vaccinations CHILD received on July 19, 2000, significantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder, which predisposed her to deficits in cellular energy metabolism, and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder.    These show that the court have agreed only that the vaccinations  \u201csignificantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder\u201d resulting in a brain disorder \u201cwith features of autism spectrum disorder.\u201d That is  not  the same. Mr Phil Doherty, as stating she \"did  develop the condition [autism] after a series of jabs.\" Moreover, the ruling mentions that she has \"features of autism spectrum disorder.\" It is not confirmed anywhere that she has a diagnosis of autism, which requires that many different aspects of the diagnostic criteria, be met. Many people have \"features\" of autism but are not autistic. To continue the Newcastle Sun article; The vaccines reacted with a DNA defect in her body . . . a defect found in 38 per cent of those with autism. Excuse me, but WTF? Where on earth is he getting this figure from? This one, flawed sentence, is the only reference to Hannah's underlying mitochondrial disorder, in the whole dodgy article. I would exhort Mr Doherty to learn from the great university in his city, who have a helpful section on their website about  mitochondrial disease . They might be able to help him with his statistics. Ah well, lets take a look at the rest of this astonishing article; The ruling was made last November but \u201csealed\u201d \u2014 or not made public \u2014 until a compensation figure was agreed. However, details of it have been leaked to the Sunday Sun, and we understand there are a further 4900 similar cases to be heard in the US. Oops! Who'd a thought, it's another mistake. This documents has not been leaked to just this newspaper as if they got some great scoop. The document has been published in several places online. There are not 4900 similar cases to be heard. This family had been part of the Autism Omnibus hearings, a large cohort of people who feel that their children's autism had been caused in one of 3 ways; by the MMR vaccine, by the thiomersal that used to be in some vaccines, or via a combination of these two. However, the Pollings removed themselves from the Omnibus. They are not in any way, representative of the rest of those claimants. They were unable to show that thiomersal caused autism in their child, so they settled for the more likely scenario, vaccinations may have aggravated the pre-existing mito disease leading to brain damage and some autism like features. I'd like to continue examining the Sun article; It\u2019s thought the disorder in the girl was triggered by the existence of mercury, used to make the vaccines more efficient. I almost pity him. The MMR has never included the mercury containing compound thiomersal, so the headline's way wrong. Also, thiomersal was used as a preservative in the vaccines. Mercury has now been removed from child vaccines in the UK but many parents whose child developed autism when it was in use will feel the case backs up their suspicions. UK parents have had their day in court. \u00a315 million of tax payer's money went on Legal Aid fees to lawyers and \"expert\" witnesses, in an effort to link autism with vaccination. It failed, and the children received nothing. This effort was also entirely unrelated to mercury. Paul Shattock , regular speaker at the DAN! conferences is quoted; \u201cNo one has ever claimed vaccines caused all autism, which can have many different routes, but around seven per cent of parents say their child was developing normally until they were immunised. \u201cThere is now a link to vindicate their view and this has been proven in court.\u201d One wonders if Mr Shattock is aware of the child's mito diesease. There's a bit of a history of Andrew Wakefield, and his MMR baloney, then there's this; After the ruling, the US Government said it wasn\u2019t the vaccines which caused her autism, but a DNA defect in those who were inoculated which was triggered by the jab. According to research, just 0.2 per cent of the general population have the defect, compared to at least 38pc of autism patients. I can't actually understand this. What DNA in \"those who were innoculated\" is he talking about? And again, there's the strange and obviously wrong figure of a condition (the mito disease) affecting just 0.2% of the general population but somehow rising to 38% of autisic people?! Actually, although Mr Doherty hasn't been open enough to source these numbers, I am aware that they come from David \"autism is mercury poisoning, no it's environmental toxicity, no it's general toxins in vaccines, no it a misdiagnosis for mito disease, no it's [fill the gaps as time progresses and new theories emerge]\" Kirby. The figures have been masterfully deconstructed by SL on the Left Brain/Right Brian blog  here . Mt Doherty then quotes a Jabs (\"a support group for vaccine-damaged children\"; no, it's a frighteningly off base anti-vaccination propaganda group) who was thinks it is \"vital the Department of Health put in a screening programme for this defect before children are given jabs.\" Just to refer people back to  Newcastle University's Mitochondrial Disease  site, where the process for diagnosing this disease is outlined, and involves analysis of samples of blood, urine,   cerebrospinal fluid, (via a lumbar puncture) and muscle (via a muscle biopsy). The condition is rare, and can be very serious, even fatal. It is a whole lot more worrisome than autism, and more research is required to understand it and help the people affected. Finally there is a short injection of sense in a quote from a  Department of Health spokesperson; MMR is the safest and most effective way of protecting children from measles, mumps and rubella. This issue relates to one child with an extremely rare metabolic genetic condition. In the US, rates of autism have continued to rise since mercury was removed from its vaccines. This case has no relevance therefore for vaccination in the UK. Inaccurate and irresponsible reporting such as this, is frightening more parents into forgoing vaccinations for their children. Already in the UK,  the number of measles cases has risen 30%  and at least one child has died of this disease.

{"date": "13 Mar 2008", "body": "\nI have breakfast early with Gordon before he goes to work. As usual, Thomas is the first of the children to rise, but then, he's always first to fall asleep too. After I've opened their curtains and hassled them both a bit, Lady and Duncan manage to drag themselves out of bed at 8.30 or so. They have breakfast, then Thomas goes to play  The Simpsons  Wii game, which he desperately wants to finish; he's going well too. Lady heads upstairs to get dressed and tidy her room, then she has to feed her guinea pigs. Duncan settles in front of the PC to watch YouTube films (mostly Noddy) and to play Roller Coaster Tycoon. He's getting very good at it now, and designs all his own coasters rather than using the pre-set selections. While they're occupied, I tidy up and do a few chores. For the rest of the morning, the boys each do some reading with me, Lady works on some maths then does some work on the BBC schools website. In between, I check my mail, read a few blogs and the paper, and sort the laundry. I don't remember that there were any significant 'behaviours' (don't you just hate that word?) from any of us. We have a quick snack before leaving the house just after 12 to go to the swimming pool, like every other Tuesday. I always try to park the car so there is no need to cross the car park to get to the leisure centre. Often when we arrive, the children in the school beside the car park, are in the playground on their lunch time break. Perhaps because of the noise they're making, Duncan may ask me to carry him. A few times he has been so distressed at this little transition, that I have had to carry him for a bit, but usually I can make a game out of racing to the door, and persuade him to walk or run. Once inside the leisure centre, I pay for our swim, and the children look at the trophy cabinet, or if you're Duncan, at the jar of jelly beans beside the reception desk. Often, Duncan makes a lot of noise here, enjoying, perhaps, the echo effects of the large, sparse room. They all wait until I have paid, and as soon as I say lets go, they race down the stairs, full of enthusiasm. Duncan wants to take the stairs going the other way to the fitness centre. He is upset and refusing to go the right way. I ask him if he wants to swim, and say that we need to get changed. He says 'no monsters' pointing to the changing rooms and I assure him that there are none. I playfully say that  I  scare the monsters away! Another time, he was walking down these stairs, when he stopped beside a woman leaving, touched her carrier bag and, full of admiration, said it was a 'Disney bag.' She said no, and told him what shop it was from, and I said, 'it's a colourful bag, it's like a Disney bag.' We always change in one of the 2 changing rooms for disabled users, allowing us to stay together in one room. In the pool, Duncan grabs a foam float, and walks up and down the shallow toddler pool, falling forward and drifting for a bit. He jumps in from the steps. He splashes and watches the patterns. He closes his eyes and jumps, laughs, shrieks and feels the water. He is loving it. Thomas dons his orange goggles and swims with more determination than style, and Lady goes over water and under water, swimming, jumping and pirouetting. They mostly stay together, and I focus on watching Duncan, though he often sends me away if he wants more space. Whenever there are other children around, I pay even more attention to what Duncan is doing. He is not usually interested in anyone else there, just myself and his siblings. He will walk right through a group of people if they're in his path. He doesn't bump or splash; he just carefully passes through. He doesn't have the same sense of personal distance that many have. A boy, about 4 years old, is wearing Spider Man armbands. Duncan goes up and touches one. The boy's mum looks a bit annoyed. I am right beside Duncan, and say 'it's OK, he's wearing nice Spider Man armbands.' I'm not sure who I am talking to, the mum or Duncan. I try to smile at her but she avoids me. When it's time to leave (because a school group comes in just after 1) Duncan takes my hand and we go to the changing room. Duncan shivers but will not take a shower. There's a shower in the disabled users' changing room, which is handy. I help Duncan get dressed while Lady and Thomas shower. On our way out, I return the locker key and the boys huddle round the jelly bean dispenser, fussing about who is going to turn the handle. The woman working on reception calls over to tell them they are very noisy. I am taken aback, and just look at her without saying anything.  They get a few beans now, and I save some for when they're in the car. Duncan decides to run to the car. I keep him in my sights. When he's getting close to the car park, I catch up with him and take his hand, fearful that he will run in front of a car. We all get safely into the car, everyone puts their own seat-belt on, and the remaining jelly beans are dispensed (after Thomas answers the sharing sum!) As a treat, we stop off for some chips, and eat them in the car. Duncan prefers the thin, crispy ones. Then I am required to go to the other nearby town, where Duncan lost a home-made Noddy book the day before in the Tesco shop. He had been very distressed by this, and I'd promised we'd go back when it was open to look for it. I ask in the shop if it had happened to be found, but explained it was unlikely as it would look like litter to anyone else. (They weren't to know how much time and effort a little boy had put into those words and pictures.) The woman on the till, remembers us from the previous day, I wonder how?! But, as I expect, they don't have it and Duncan is upset. This leads to lots of scripting, of angry film characters. I've learnt that the worst thing I can do is to ask him  not  to shout. Instead, I engage with what he's saying. For example, if he's shouting about Cruella de Vil, I ask about her, and he changes tone to tell me that she is nasty and wants to catch the puppies. I ask if he wants to visit the charity shop to look for a video, so we do. He chooses a few Disney films, and finds a Noddy book! How lucky was that! Thomas is very pleased to discover a Doctor Who 2006 album. Charity shops are great. We go home then, and in the afternoon, I help Duncan to make a new Noddy book. He writes out the story as before; Noddy's Toyland Adventures Noddy and the warm scarf Won day it was a chilet One day it was chilly. No longer Jorafes! Giraffes! Stop stop Mr Plod. I can understand his concern over the loss of his earlier manuscript! Anyway, I think that's enough. I wanted to write this out, as it was a typical day, involving time out and about. When Gordon asked me later how our day had been, I was able to tell him, as I usually do, that we'd had a great day and to tell him all the funny little things they'd said, and the adventures we'd had. This is what our lives are like. It's nice, most of the time, though we have our down times too. So I get irritated when I read articles like,  Living with autism - the harsh reality faced by one mother , in a local Irish newspaper. The mum interviewed  has  had unnecessary obstacles to deal with, due to inadequate state health and education facilities. That is shameful, and I would back their claim to much better services. But, and there's always a but, why is it, that the needs of the autistic people who are  no longer children , never seem to be mentioned? And why do these interviews with parents always focus on the negative? His behaviour has become aggressive and inappropriate, he had become more withdrawn and the temper tantrums have escalated to the point where it\u2019s proving almost impossible for his family to cope. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this behaviour in him before. He\u2019s very aggressive... the temper tantrums leave him inconsolable... he hits me and behaves in a way that isn\u2019t age appropriate. He wants to stay at home the whole time, it\u2019s impossible to get him out of the house because of his rituals and routines,\u201d said a devastated Ann. As you can imagine, this places enormous strain on normal family life making many of the things we take for granted like shopping, family visits, holidays or simply leaving the house impossible for Ann and her family. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to cope with and very embarrassing and stressful when it happens in public,\u201d said Ann, agreeing that because he looks like a normal child, people can be very unforgiving. It's not her son's fault that people are 'unforgiving' and the public need to be educated to tackle these disablist attitudes. Keith Duffy, Ireland's own 'autism advocate' celebrity, is in the  media again this week . He describes the day he realised his daughter was autistic; \"Afterwards as I drove home I cried like I hadn't cried in years. That was the worst ever day of my life.\" His wife joins in, \"I felt utterly cheated and I was very angry,\" says Lisa Duffy. \"I had this beautiful boy [son Jordan, 11] and then I had this beautiful girl and I felt that this cannot be happening to us.\" That line reminded me of the 'attitude of entitlement' explored in  this post by Club 166 . Mr Duffy's daughter, as he has told us  before , had bucket loads of ABA treatment. I listened to the linked radio interview, and he says she was at an ABA school from 9 to 3.30 every day, when she was only two years old. She's now at a mainstream school, which they describe as a 'miracle'. I am fed up with these descriptions, but they seem to be accepted, no...expected in discussions about autism. All these parents follow the script, and reveal, in 'emotional, honest and affecting detail', how awful their children are, or how hard they are to deal with. I'm no super hero, I'm an ordinary good enough mum, a bit lazy, but fascinated by these creatures temporarily in my care and enjoying their company enormously. I don't have any special qualities that make it easier for 'someone like me' (as I have, irritatingly, been told before) to cope with a non typical child. Basically, I decided to have children, so I just have to take what I get and make the best of it, and there is a lot of good to be had.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["httphttp://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/news/story/?trs=mhmhqlidmh&cat=news://", "http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0312/duffyk.html", "http://club166.blogspot.com/2008/03/its-not-our-fault.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/03/day-with-autism.html", "title": "\nA day with autism\n"},
{"date": "18 Mar 2008", "body": "\nIt was Paddy's Day, which I don't much care about any more to be honest, but the steam train in Downpatrick would be running for the first time this year, so we jumped in the car and drove down. Since there was a parade in the town, we parked at the small station on the outskirts, and rode the train from there into town. We were just in time to board, paid our \u00a320 return fare, (pretty steep for a pair of 6 minute journeys but it contributes to the upkeep and restoration of the museum) and took our seats for the journey. Duncan and Thomas stood by the open window all the way, blinking at the smoke a few times, and starting at the loud whistle. In town, the parade was just about to start. Gordon stood with Thomas and Lady to watch, and I walked up and down the pavement behind the crowds with Duncan, stopping off to buy some sweets as soon as the packed shop cleared of customers. For part of the time, he rode on my back because I'd not been wise enough to take his buggy. He wasn't much interested in the parade, and was probably a bit stressed out by the loud speakers and crowds. After a while we retreated to a low stone wall set well back from the main throng, and there we happily waited for the others, while enjoying the now not-too-loud music and glimpses of parade components. Then we made our error. The parade ended and like many, many others, we gathered on the small platform in the town railway station to take the train back to the country station where we had parked. We waited at one end of the platform where it was slightly less busy, but when the train pulled in, we were standing in front of a guards carriage that we couldn't board. Duncan was obviously panicked that we wouldn't get on the train and was desperately trying to push his way past the crowds waiting to get on the 3 small carriages, while I was just as desperately trying to hold him back and settle him down. Eventually we got on an already packed carriage. There was one seat and knowing Duncan wouldn't settle in an aisle seat anyway, I asked Gordon to sit there and take Thomas on his lap. A family of 4 was taking up a couple of seats (that would easily have sat 2 more people if they'd bunched up a bit) and I asked if they minded letting Duncan stand at the window between them to look out. Duncan was distressed by what had happened, and was shouting more than usual. On the way back, I was so very relieved that they journey was short. It was unpleasant. I tried my best to distract Duncan, stop him from shouting, and I had to prevent him getting past me to try to run up and down the aisle where a few other people were standing. But what affected me more, was that which I can usually ignore; the censure of strangers. Always when we are out, I am aware that my almost 8 year old child is not performing to the accepted norms of a child his age. He often shouts and wails, gets upset when he doesn't get what he wants, or reacts in unexpected ways to situations. Just at the periphery of my senses, I am aware that some people are disapproving, via their looks and posture, but I refuse to acknowledge them. I do not look directly at them and deny them the opportunity to condemn us explicitly. I do not care what they think of my family, of my child. Yesterday, as I was stopping Duncan from pushing past people on the platform and as he was shouting in the confined space of the train, it was harder to ignore, and a few times I let them catch my eye and show me what they think. I tried and mostly succeeded to maintain my usual composure, the stance that says, this might look bad to you, but we're just fine really, and anyway, screw you. But I blamed Duncan. I was angry with him when he were walking to the car and I held his hand just too tight and told him off for having been a bad boy on the train. He said he was sorry, said \"Don't call the police, Mummy is not angry, Mummy likes Duncan!\" I reassured him, at least a bit, and got in the car feeling thoroughly wrung out. As we drove home, I briefly cried quietly at the whole mixed up situation. I felt responsible for having put him in too difficult a situation, and I failed to handle it well enough. The censure crossed the boundary on Friday too. We went with friends to W5, and were having a marvellous day. In the afternoon, Duncan was standing in  front of his favourite bit, the camera with the blue screen where you can record yourself giving weather reports. I took my eye off him for about 2 minutes to talk with my friend's son about another exhibit just 2-3 metres from where Duncan stood. I was roused by a woman saying crossly, 'excuse me, is this your child' to see Duncan holding the arm of another slightly younger boy, in front of the camera. Duncan was trying to make him play with him, in what he intended as a rough and tumble way, but which had, not surprisingly been interpreted as fighting. The mum was angry, as I would if I though another child was trying to hurt my child. I immediately apologised and said 'he has autism, he was trying to play with him, I'm sorry, are you hurt?' (spoken to the boy). He said no, but that Duncan wanted to fight him. I assured them that he thought he could play with him like he does with his brother. The mum said, 'well OK, I thought he had  something ' the unspoken end of which was clearly, something wrong with him. I wish I had prevented that whole thing. I talked to Duncan about it afterwards, trying to explain that he mustn't grab children; it can hurt them and make them sad. I must in future watch him more carefully when he's using that particular device, because he has watched the other children and they always bash into each other and jump about there, so he thinks that's what you're supposed to do. I wish I hadn't immediately offered up the excuse, 'he has autism' but it was out before I'd stared to think properly. I sometimes think that we have a little light around us, and outside that is the fog of people who don't know and don't care. Sometimes I suppose my light isn't bright enough and the fog spreads inside our protective bubble. What should I be more worried about, trying to change Duncan to make him more acceptable, or trying to give more people lights to hold with us? By that,  I do not mean pity !!! I do want Duncan to be the best he can.  I would love to see him better able to control his impulses and the shouting. But a few more lights in the fog would be nice too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/03/censure-of-strangers.html", "title": "\nThe Censure of Strangers\n"},
{"date": "12 Oct 2006", "body": "\nLady and Thomas have been badgering me to get them a new baby brother or sister, in a similar way to how they'd ask for a new bicycle. Lady took Thomas to her room yesterday for some 'baby training'. They had the dolls out and were pretending to feed and change them, that way, they'd be able to help me when (their word) their new sibling arrives. Well, it's nice of them to make major life changing decisions for me isn't it! Lady was also teaching Thomas about the solar system yesterday. We read part of a new book I found in the charity shop (great places those). It's called the  Great Big Book of Knowledge  and is full of  facts . She loves it. She also did some French on the computer, and some writing. She did her maths and science -reproduction just happened to be the next topic on the CGP workbook we use, so that was very interesting! Duncan played with trains, browsed BBC schools online, being very taken with  this song  especially, and he watched a few more Thomas films on YouTube. He enjoyed the film of Thomas set to  Firestarter  by  The Prodigy , so that's music appreciation covered! Duncan and I have a new game. He was quoting some Thomas the Tank lines one day, saying 'You will, I won't' which comes from a conversation between Edward and Thomas, or so he tells me! I joined in saying in a deep voice, 'You will', he laughed at me and answered, ' I won't !' We repeated this a few times then I said, 'You can', he paused for a few seconds, then giggled and said, ' I can't '. After a few more turns, I said, 'You do'....' I don't .' 'You are'...' I'm not .' Last night Thomas woke up while we were all in bed and shouted out in fear from his bed. I hurried to comfort him, calling out as I went to reassure him. He told me that he was frightened of the spider on his bed. Earlier, there had been a big spider in Lady's room and I'd put it outside. I told him that it was definitely outside now so he wasn't to worry. He said 'OK, then I'll just go back to sleep' then lay right back down. It made me laugh how he went from terrified to fine so easily. Later though he called out again. This time he thought there was a lizard on his pillow! I said there were no lizards in our house and climbed up to hug him. I dusted some crumbs off the sheet and he said 'Oh, the crumbs must have been in the shape of a lizard then!' That's rationalisation Thomas style! Just to note, while I was writing, Thomas came downstairs with his toothbrush and some 'adult' toothpaste. He wanted to use it to brush his teeth but wanted to know if it would make his nose go on fire (obviously Lady had warned him it had this side-effect!). I told him it was safe so he went off to brush. Duncan was at the time sitting beside me, but playing on the computer and apparently not listening at all. He turned to me, fixed me with that special look, thought hard and said, 'Thomas no fire on teeth, no fire on nose!' So that's 2 autism myths busted right there! He's paying attention to his environment even when it appears he's not, and he empathises.

{"date": "5 Oct 2006", "body": "\nGordon and I took Duncan along for a one-off speech and occupational therapy assessment session yesterday. I'd been asked by the clinical psychologist I saw with him last  March  if I wanted this assessment. Again, I thought there would be little to gain by going, but I wanted to be able to write on his DLA application that we were waiting for the assessment. You need to have input from the professionals to get the benefits, and the money would all go into savings for him to use when he's older. (Although, we still haven't had a decision on the claim we made in June due to some cock-up in the benefit's office.) So, the others were again sent off with a grandparent (Gordon's mum this time) and we set off. I'd drawn a little cartoon book for Duncan, showing that we were going to the 'nice hospital' (where you can play with all the toys) as opposed to the 'nasty hospital' (where they pull your teeth out ;-0). The occupational therapist (OT) had set up a marble run and Duncan sat down and started playing with her right away while we talked to the speech therapist (ST).  I had nothing but positives to report. They had a copy of his file from the OT and ST at his old school, and it's clear that he is much more capable than he was described on those old reports.  I explained my methods of working and playing with him, using his interests (that'd be trains to anyone not in the know!) as a way of  making all sorts of connections and discoveries. I told about his ability to type the train names on Google to find pictures, and how he'll get a book to copy  the names he doesn't yet know how to spell. I told how he knows that even when he's looking for pictures of 'James', he needs to type 'James Thomas Tank' to narrow the search criteria. He did a few picture puzzles, and named the objects. he picked up all the marbles and puzzle pieces when requested to and packed them away. He drew pictures of me and his dad, giving Gordon a nice head of curly hair! He was focused and happy. They had him do a game in which he lay on a skateboard on his tummy, went down a small ramp, them got off the board, picked up a picture of some clothing (i.e. 'red hat') from a selection spread out and put it on a picture of a boy. I couldn't see the point of the exercise, and neither could Duncan. He enjoyed rolling down the ramp though, letting Brio Percy freewheel in front of him! He did the picture things though, so he could go back for another go down the slope. In all, it was clear to them that he was thriving, they couldn't really think of anything else to recommend. Gordon was impressed with me. He saw that this is  what I do . There is a point to all this reading about autism. It helps me know better how Duncan is thinking, what his motivations are, what the potential pitfalls are and gives me ideas and strategies to adopt. We still have problems to tackle, it's far from being all rosy round here. There are the tantrums, the shouting and crying when he wants something that I can't or won't give him. But I can re-direct him much more often now. It's tiring some times; when he's at his most challenging and the very noise he's making is grinding me down, then I have to be at my most imaginative and (when appropriate) playful. The Voyage is ongoing, but now we have much better charts, and the crew are gaining more experience as time passes too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/10/duncans-assessment.html", "title": "\nDuncan's assessment\n"},
{"date": "8 Oct 2006", "body": "\nI have been feeling really pissed off this evening. I got involved in a local forum, where I felt duty bound to challenge a  autism = horrible disease to be cured  view, also charlatans like DAN practitioners were being heavily promoted. (Some USA residents have joined up now to tell all these Irish mums that their children are mercury poisoned, never mind that we never had mercury in any vaccines here...)I haven't done this personally much before and I found the experience of trying to converse with people denigrating the opinions of autistic people and twisting my words to make me appear to prescribe doing nothing to help children in need, wearying and depressing. I should be stronger and stand up to it, but I've had enough. I just want the warm embrace that comes from conversing with people who are on the same level as you, who can talk about people in a respectful and appreciative way, who can share my delight in all my children for their unique talents and personalities.

{"date": "10 Oct 2006", "body": "\nWhat a great day we had yesterday! The boys came  for a snuggle in my bed and Thomas and I played a game of sakes and ladders on my laptop. Straight after breakfast they gather round the computer to play the 'troll in the dungeon' game aka  Timez Attack . Well, Lady played it and the boys looked on. It's good fun, and you have to answer multiplication sums to defeat the troll, so it's educational too. Honest, it is. Later my friend D rang to say she could come over. Thomas and Lady overheard and were all excited; they love to have visitors. I told them that we'd be meeting the French boy who is staying with D's family for 6 months. Thomas immediately decided that he should be Lady's boyfriend. So they came over so we had a great gang of kids running round. We had a nice lunch together and it was a pleasure to meet the new arrival. D had a tiny Mrs Incredible toy thingy attached to her mobile phone, which she'd placed on the high window sill in our kitchen. Obviously Duncan caught sight of this and went to have a closer look. He just calls Mrs Incredible 'woman'. D kindly gave him the tiny character; she knew it was just the kind of fiddly detailed thing he loves. He was delighted with it and played with 'woman' all day; singing to her and having her dance, making her run fast, then go slow, putting her inside trains and carriages, and just looking and looking, holding her right up to his right eye with his left eye closed. Unfortunately, 'woman' wasn't designed for so much handling and by 7 o'clock, she'd been decapitated. Duncan brought her to me and asked me to 'fix it'. He looked at me intently, the way he does when he's trying to figure out how to communicate something new to him. He said 'woman's...' then paused, touched my neck, then said 'fix woman's...' so I filled in the gap, ' Fix the woman's neck '. 'Yes, fix woman's neck. Fix a head. Poor woman, poor head, poor neck. Woman go a hospital.' What!!!! He said all that!!! Yes, he sure did. We had another visitor yesterday too. A woman just finishing her teacher training has come out to play with Duncan, via the NAS befriender scheme. She's been coming for a few weeks now and is making great friends with all the children. She plays chase and tickles with Duncan, chats with Lady and plays snakes and ladders with Thomas. Yesterday, Thomas showed off his (rather fine) trampoline moves, and she got on for a bounce with him. When she was leaving, Thomas begged her to stay for one more game. I told Thomas that M. had to meet her mother in town, 'and we don't want her Mummy left waiting for her.' Thomas saw the logic in that, 'Oh yes, 'cause her Mummy might be worried that she's been eaten by a monster!' I picked Duncan up to say goodbye to M too, he asked to kiss her! I told her she was highly privileged, I don't think he's ever asked to kiss anyone before, except immediate family. But then M is very attractive! It's early, but so far today has been magical too. Duncan came into my bed at 7.30 and lay chatting to himself, 'summer,  no  summer,  yes  summer' then he asked about the 'woman' and the state of her neck, then he talked about Daddy. 'Daddy not go away, Daddy come back.' I assured him that Daddy would be back from England soon. Thomas joined us and started talking about feeding babies and why they drink mummy-milk and asked again how they're made. I told him about how they grow in the mummy's uterus. He asked how it gets started, yip he really did. I told him that there's a special sort of seed, a sperm, which joins the mummy's tiny egg and a baby starts to grow. He asked if we had any sperm in our house, I told him only Daddies have sperm, so he decided that after breakfast Daddy should give me some so we could get a baby. Oh lord. Sadly, Daddy's away right now! Lady came in to join the throng, before we all got up for breakfast. It's a good job no-one's at school. I love our chilled mornings.

{"date": "29 Sep 2006", "body": "\nThe bad tooth came out today. We were nervous about how it would go, but tried to prepare Duncan as much as possible. I'd made a little book about it, showing how we'd end with a trip to the toy shop, so he knew there would be something to look forward to. We'd practised putting an imaginary mask on our faces, and we had taken a hospital identity bracelet home to play with. Gordon dropped me and Duncan off at the children's hospital, then left Lady and Thomas with my dad and step mum. As soon as we arrived in the waiting room, we were shown to the ward, where a bed was prepared for Duncan. There was a portable DVD player, with a Thomas film already going, and a selection of Thomas books and toys. Gordon had briefly mentioned to the nurse on Monday, how Duncan likes trains. The other families all remained in the waiting room. Duncan was happy and relaxed, holding his new Brio Percy toy train (which I'd ordered from Ebay, and had thankfully arrived the previous day). The anaesthetist talked to me about the option of administering a mild sedative, and we decided to opt for this. So just 5 minutes before he was due to go into theatre, the nurse gave me a spoonful of Nurofen, with a small quantity of ketamine, and Duncan took it without too much trouble. Then he was wheeled in on the bed to theatre. I held him on my lap while the anaesthetist gave him the nitrous oxide. That was difficult. He struggled when the gas started to flow, but I'd been warned just in time and was able to hold him for the few seconds it took to take effect. He drifted off so quickly, was put on the trolley and we went out to wait. I was tearful at that stage, seeing him struggle, then so helpless was distressing. About a minute later, the dentist who wasn't operating came out to say he'd had just one tooth extracted (already!) and after a few more minutes, we went back to the ward where we was already awake. He was disoriented, upset, bleeding slightly in his mouth and thirsty. I cuddled him, he had some juice, and more quickly than I could have imagined he settled again in my arms. He started asking for his Brio Percy. We couldn't find it, though he'd been holding it as he went to theatre, and the nurse remembered putting it on the trolley. Everyone started looking all over for it; they all recognised how important it was to Duncan. But we just couldn't find it and Duncan was most upset. We had to leave, though the nurse promised to have a good look for it again later, and to let the cleaners know to keep an eye out also. She told me that if it didn't turn up, she had one at home that her sons didn't play with much, and she'd send it to us. How nice is that?! But while we were waiting outside for my dad to pick us up, Gordon was called on his mobile; the train had been found, wedged in the trolley wheel! Hurrah! We made a quick trip to the toy shop to buy a  Thomas Aqua Draw , then on to the apartment for some bacon rolls, before Gordon went to work and the rest of us came home. Duncan was sleepy and quiet. After playing with Lady and Thomas for a while, he started to get a bit cross, so I took him upstairs to lie down with me for an hour in my bed. We had a nice snuggle, and Brio Percy was rolled up and down my shoulder. He just jumped up again, wanting a drink. Lady and Thomas have been great throughout all these events. They love going to visit their grandparents, in fact, when I woke Lady early today, she said, 'Oh fantastic, this is the best day of my life since I went to Jamaica, or since Duncan and Thomas were born!' She does go in for hyperbole! She also wanted to see the damaged tooth, and reckons the tooth-fairy will throw it on the reject pile. Thomas was worried about Duncan when I told him what was going on. He said, 'I don't want my brother to be sick.' Wee sweetheart. As on Monday, my dad and step mum were amazing. There were a few posts on the hub recently about wonderful, understanding and helpful grandparents. I can totally identify with that. My dad and Duncan have a really special bond. He knows exactly how to engage him and as soon as they got together, they start playing. Dad revels in Duncan's achievements, and tells everyone about all the funny and clever little things he does and says, just as he does for his other 7 grandchildren. That love is returned as all the children adore him too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tomy-Thomas-Friends-Aqua-Draw/dp/B0007ZEZ22/ref=sr_11_1/026-6705794-9284403?ie=UTF8"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/09/extraction.html", "title": "\nExtraction\n"},
{"date": "26 Sep 2006", "body": "\nWe managed to get a pediatrician to examine Duncan today at the children's hospital dental department. It was awful and wonderful. Duncan was highly stressed and didn't want to go into any of the rooms. He just kept shouting out, saying he wanted a 'Brio Percy' (his latest train request) and I was desperately and uselessly trying to distract and entertain him. We were asked into the examination room very shortly after arriving, and I had to prise is fingers from the doorway, so adamant was he that he wasn't going in. He was literally terrified. I held him on my knee and the doctor was able to stick the little mirror into his open mouth and in less than 30 seconds had seen enough to know what treatment was needed. By this stage I was actually in tears, so I took Duncan into the corridor while Gordon had a quick word with the doctor. I was feeling a bit embarrassed (with myself) and very, very sorry for my poor boy. He was crying, telling me he was so sad, shouting out that he was finished. I started spelling out train names on an alphabet poster on the wall as I sat on the floor holding him. He noticed what I was doing and helped me finish a few words and was then over the outburst. Now I said earlier that it was also wonderful. What I mean is, the staff were amazing. They were so understanding. It turns out that Duncan's molar is dodgy, it developed incorrectly, but it isn't decayed and the rest of his teeth are in excellent condition. He does need an extraction though, and he has been fitted into their Friday list which is excellent. The doctor assured us that Duncan would be seen first (as usually there can be a 1 or 2 hour wait) and to cut back on the hassle on the day, Gordon was able to fill in most of the nursing paperwork today (after Duncan had calmed down and was happily eating nuts and watching TV in the waiting room) and he will not be put through a further examination, which usually takes place before the procedure. We need to arrive at 8am, he should be seen at around 9 and we were told we'd be leaving at 9.15. I felt close to tears again when I saw how much they were willing to do to cause as little trauma to Duncan as possible. Gordon was moved by their caring attitude too. Duncan wasn't impressed though; when the consultant came to talk to us in the waiting room, Duncan put his hands over his ears and very directly told him to go away. While we were at the hospital, Lady and Thomas were being looked after by my dad and step mum, who live close to the hospital. The children all love going there to visit and having an appreciative audience to show off to. Thomas took a few dressing up clothes and his trusty snakes and ladders board. My dad is so helpful. He dropped us off at the hospital and picked us up again to save us needing to find a parking space, then (after we'd all eaten some of their delicious home-made vegetable soup) he drove Gordon back to his hospital as he had to go back to work. It's all rather stressful and I'm dreading Friday, because no matter what, it is going to be hard on him. But we'll get through it together. He's a tough boy. He's my darling angel, who right now, is lying beside me on my bed, having just fallen asleep with his arm around me as I've been typing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-on-dentists.html", "title": "\nMore on dentists\n"},
{"date": "20 Mar 2008", "body": "\nI  wrote recently  about a terrible newspaper article entitled \" Court links MMR to autism .\" \n \nLast Sunday's edition contained my letter of complaint about that article; \n \nLAST Sunday, Phil Doherty wrote an article titled Court Links MMR to Autism. \nThe USA Vaccine Injury Compensation hearing did not link autism to the MMR. The child under discussion, Hannah Poling, has an extremely rare, genetically acquired, metabolic disorder affecting her mitochondria. \nThe court, which requires a much lower burden of proof than scientific or medical procedures, has agreed only that the vaccinations \u201csignificantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder\u201d resulting in a brain disorder \u201cwith features of autism spectrum disorder\u201d. \nThat is not the same as stating she \u201cdid develop the condition \u2014 autism \u2014 after a series of jabs\u201d. \nMr Doherty wrote: \u201cThe vaccines reacted with a DNA defect in her body . . . a defect found in 38 per cent of those with autism.\u201d \nIt is pure fiction to suggest that 38pc of autistic people have the same rare DNA defect as Ms Poling. The MMR jab has never included the mercury containing compound thiomersal, which was used as a preservative in some vaccines. \nInaccurate and irresponsible reporting such as this is frightening more parents into forgoing vaccinations for their children  \n \nThe newspaper addressed some of the points my letter raised, but it began with a straw-man argument; \n \nSunday Sun says . . . are you saying that, even if a vaccine was described as aggravating an underlying condition, it has in no way contributed to it? \nI did not say this. \nIf your article  had  accurately said that \"a vaccine was described as aggravating an underlying condition,\" there would have been no reason to complain. But instead, the headline of your 9th March article was, \"Court Links MMR to Autism\" and further, Mr Doherty wrote that she \"did develop the condition \u2014 autism \u2014 after a series of jabs\". \n \nSecondly, research into mitochondrial DNA disorders in the population, which says 38pc of autism patients have it, has been peer tested and published in respected medical journals. \nThis is not true. \nDr Poling, Hannah's father, has co-authored a paper called \" Developmental Regression and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in a Child With Autism. \" \n \nI presume this is the peer reviewed published paper you refer to? It is a case study on Poling's daughter. It is also a retrospective study of the levels of an enzyme, creatine kinese, in a group of autistic people, 38% of whom were shown to have elevated levels. The paper concluded that, \"further metabolic evaluation is indicated in autistic patients.\" \n \nThe paper  does not  say that 38% of the autistic population have \"mitochondrial DNA disorders.\" Raised creatine kinese  is not diagnostic  of the rare condition of mitochondrial disease. It can be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction,  but also can be linked to  such conditions as inflammation of the heart muscle, stroke, muscular dystrophies and lung tissue death. \n(Thanks to S.L. at  Stop. Think. Autism.  whose  work here  I've nicked for the above paragraph.) \n \nWe agree that the majority of child vaccinations are safe. However, even the Department of Health admits that a number of children will be damaged by inoculations. We never said Mercury was in the MMR vaccine in the UK . . . we said it was found in other vaccines in the UK. \nThe Polings were claiming that the mercury in thiomersal in Hannah's vaccines was what aggravated her condition. Yet your headline, and the line I quoted earlier, both attempted to implicate the MMR. \n \n \nSince our story, we have received an emailed letter from Hannah's father, neurologist Dr Paul Poling, saying that his daughter does indeed have autism. \nShe may well have autism, but the US government's court documents state that she had \"features of autism.\" Even if she is autistic, it doesn't follow that she was made autistic by the vaccines. Remember, this child has a rare, genetically acquired mitochondrial disease. Her father is on record saying that her mother has the same condition, though presumably to a much lesser degree. \n \nYesterday I received an email from Phil Doherty, author of the original, flawed article. His letter is said to be his personal opinion and not to represent the views of his employer:\n \n \n \nI have been asked to respond on behalf of the Sunday Sun. \nI would like to point out there are 4900 cases before the vaccine courts in the US from families claiming vaccines damaged their children. Whether these are the result of underlying Mitochondrial dysfunction or thiomasol or something else would be up to the law court and medical experts to establish. \n \n \nWrong again. As I have already informed these people, the Polings were for a while among the cohort of 4900 people in the Autism Omnibus hearings, who claim vaccines caused their child's autism. But the Polings dropped out of that group and pursued an individual claim, that vaccines aggravated a pre-existing condition. In fact, as Kathleen Seidel has shown, the Vaccine Injury Court have paid out before to children with a pre-existing physical condition who have been  diagnosed with autism or related conditions after they sustained documented, verifiable vaccine injuries . It is only fair that compensation is paid in those very rare but sad times when a vaccine does result in one of the known, negative side effects. \n \nThe Autism Omnibus is trying to prove something different, that vaccines directly led to autism. In spite of the thousands of cases available to choose from, those selected to be heard as test cases last year, presumably the most convincing among the cohort, had very poor arguments easily refuted by scientists called by the US government's representatives. It is very unlikely they will win their cases. \n \nAccording to Hannah Poling's doctors, her parents (one of which is a doctor) and other experts she has autism. \nTo say some one has features of autism is not-surprising disingenuous double-talk by the US government. As you will be well aware autism is not one disease as such but a set of symptoms that together are classed as being on the spectrum. As an expert I have spoken to this week put it - if you have features of autism you have autism whether those features are mild or severe. \n \n \nThe doctor who diagnosed her, not the US government, said she had 'features of autism.' \nPerhaps she does have autism. I'd certainly consider her as autistic, politically. I'd love to see her and her parents tackle the ignorance and prejudice about autism, and help promote the rights of autistic people, starting by tacking the myth of vaccine poisoning. \n \nThe expert you spoke to isn't much of an expert. You wouldn't want to name him/her would you? \nActually, many people have features of autism but are not autistic. These issues are explored further  here . \n \nWe never said in our article that mercury was present in the MMR jabs in the UK. \nHowever - it is in two of the vaccines Hannah received and was used widely in US vaccines - including the earlier versions of the MMR. \n \n \nIn the US, anti-vaccers blame mercury for causing autism, and in the UK they blame the MMR. \nYour headline and article were written in such a way as to lead readers to assume that the court had conceded that the MMR caused autism when it did no such thing. Since the MMR is the big bogeyman in this part of the world, thanks to some shoddy work by Wakefield, and years of credulous reporting by the media, you knew that emphasising the fact that she's had the MMR would catch people's attention here. \n \nIt might have helped you sell a few more newspapers, but at what cost to children's health? \nAlso, the MMR has never contained mercury, not even the earlier versions. \n \nAs for your assertions that there are no peer tested research on the issue of Mit dysfunction in autism sufferers. I suggest you refer to a study by Daniel Rosignol and Jeffrey Bradstreet. In their study you will find that some studies have found up to 43 per cent of autistic sufferers have mit dysfunctions and 35 per cent were found to have classical mit disease. \n \n \nThanks for the suggestion. I appreciate it when Senior Reporters with such an obvious aptitude for science offer advice on these matters. \n \nI have read the  article  (pdf link). It has been  expertly analysed by S.L. \n \nThe authors confuse mitochondrial dysfunction with mitochondrial disease, make unproven assumptions about (shudder) 'toxins' causation. They are DAN! practitioners whose preferred option for dealing with autism is the whacko DAN! protocol, an abusive, unregulated , experimental 'therapy' inflicted on many autistic children. It includes Chelation, yes really! That practise killed an autistic child, but these guys still promote it. They promote their own favourite, Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Reasonable people realise that this is crazy, outlandish and cruel. \n \nIs that really who you go to for information about science? \n \n \nYou end your argument saying that just because Hannah has autism doesn't mean that she got it from the inoculations - why did the US Government pay out compensation then? We both know that unfortunately some children do get damaged by inoculations. \n \n \nSeriously? You need to ask? \nThe court ruling stated; \n \n \nIn sum, DVIC has concluded that the facts of this case meet the statutory criteria for demonstrating that the vaccinations CHILD received on July 19, 2000, significantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder, which predisposed her to deficits in cellular energy metabolism, and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder. Therefore, respondent recommends that compensation be awarded to petitioners in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(ii). \n \nThe court paid compensation for the reasons given above, but not because she \"got it [autism] from the inoculations.\" \n \n \nWe both agree that vaccinations are the best way of protecting the vast majority of children from the harm that these terrible disease can do to them. \nHowever, we are a newspaper with a public duty to bring such issues to the forefront for debate. \nThis may not play very well with medics or the Government - but I'd like to point out that these same institutions have told people that medicines and other practices were safe when they blatantly were not (Thalidomide, vCJD etc - medical science moves all the time and new knowledge shifts our understanding). \n \n \nYou have a duty to report accurately on these issues, and not to misinform, either from ignorance or a deliberate mission to sensationalise and sell more papers. \n \nAnd seriously, you're using the thalidomide story as an example of nasty scientists? This is one of the alternative medicine brigade's favourite lines! Surely you can do better than that. Drug testing practices have changed since the effects of thalidomide in pregnancy were discovered. Finding out what happens when drugs are used and publishing the results, that's what doctors and scientists do. \n \n \nAt this point in time we feel that entering into any further correspondence on this issue would not be to anyone's best interests. \nYours sincerely, \n \nPhil Doherty \nSenior Reporter \nSunday Sun \n \n \nHow honoured I am to have been written to by a Senior Reporter. \n \n \nMore what is probably the fullest and best explanation of this case and the attempted rebranding of autism, from 'mercury poisoning' to 'general  toxins in vaccines and the atmosphere' to 'mito dysfunction' see  this by the ever-excellent Orac . \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaysun/news/tm_headline=court-links-mmr-to-autism&method=full&objectid=20587416&siteid=50081-name_page.html", "http://jcn.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/2/170", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003503.htm", "http://stopthinkautism.blogspot.com/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=744", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/148/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=748", "http://www.scipub.org/fulltext/ajbb/ajbb42208-217.pdf", "http://stopthinkautism.blogspot.com/2008/03/evidence-of-mitochondrial-dysfunction.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/the_hannah_poling_case_and_the_rebrandin.php"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-on-autism-mmr-trash-story.html", "title": "\nMore on the Autism-MMR trash story\n"},

It's one of his baby teeth that's been affected and we've been told that for first teeth, only extractions are performed under GA. We are hoping to get him dealt with in the next few days. He will definitely need a GA, it would be much too frightening for him to have the procedure under  local anaesthetic. Thankfully, all our medical needs are met by the NHS, so I don't need to worry about insurance, and the local children's department is excellent. Poor Duncan has been very unwell over the past 3 days, with a slight fever, pain in the tooth and swelling in his jaw. I tried to give him some ibuprofen with limited success at first. He hates taking medicine, so I had to hide it in his drink and get the medicine:juice ratio just right. For 2 nights he cried and whimpered in pain almost all night, and I had to lie right beside him. He was so confused by the whole experience that he didn't know where to put himself and flitted from one bed to another, desperately trying to get comfortable. Last night, I managed to give him a bigger dose of pain killer before bed and he slept right through. I'm glad to see that the swelling has reduced a bit too. As usual when he's ill, he is very cuddly, and lies beside me or on my lap and gets upset when I leave his side. Yesterday he was feeling well enough to play with his trains and watch Thomas films on YouTube. Gordon spent the morning fixing Lady's computer which I had messed up completely by deleting a system file, then trying to fix it using a Windows disk I found lying around and then I ...well, I just cocked the whole thing up and he had quite a job sorting it all out from scratch. Afterwards, Lady spent ages playing with a French CDROM. Perhaps she's trying to learn a some French for when we meet up with our  HE friends  and their long-term guest. Thomas and Lady spent ages on the trampoline yesterday too. They are both very good on it. Thomas can do all sorts of fancy manoeuvres. I must see if I can get him into a gymnastics class or something, if he's old enough. I think he'd enjoy that. While the children were all occupied yesterday afternoon, I started teaching Gordon some of the Salsa moves I'd learnt at my class. He was doing great at the end and the magical music by the  Afro-Cuban All Stars  helped. His Jamaican and Cuban roots were certainly in evidence! It did me the world of good too, since I'd been feeling bad about Duncan and my liability in what happening to him. I also have been reading too much stuff about autism in the media, and that's always guaranteed to wind me up since there's so much balderdash printed. Though I read a lovely article today which counters the prevailing attitude;  Understanding Autism  by  Kevin Leitch . I hope lots of people see it and reconsider what ideas they might have formed about autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.notsheep.net/", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Toda-Gusta-Marcos-Afro-Cuban-Stars/dp/B000024EM3/sr=8-1/qid=1159218668/ref=sr_1_1/026-5037784-0093255?ie=UTF8&s=music", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/page21.pdf", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/09/duncans-dental-situation-part-2.html", "title": "\nDuncan's dental situation; Part 2\n"},

I'm just going to name them (for blog purposes) Belle and Sid, and their children, Edward and Emily. Their real names are, as always,  much  nicer! Belle and I were at UCL together, we met on the first day of classes and have been friends ever since. (I was going to write  'studied  together', but since we did as little of  that  as possible, I thought it would be dishonest!) She is smart, funny, passionate and compassionate, and happens to be beautiful too. She was my second bridesmaid 10 years ago, then she married a wonderful man 5 years ago. They now have 2 gorgeous children aged 3 (almost 4) and 1 (almost 2). We now live on either side of the Irish Sea, so we were delighted when they announced they would be coming to visit us. They arrived on Sunday afternoon, and straight away the children went off together to play. Thankfully, Edward loves trains as much as my children, so he was perfectly happy. Little Emily stayed safe in her Daddy's arms for a while, and when she was ready, she went off with Lady to play in the garden. She liked the guinea pigs, especially Daisy, and busied herself feeding them grass. The children all bundled along together for the 3 days they were here, sometimes building tracks, sometimes watching TV, sometimes playing outside. Lady and Edward invented a game in which they were secret agents protecting a precious ruby. Belle was amazed at how seldom she even saw her son; he was too busy doing his own thing with his friends. We went on outings to the transport museum and W5, 2 places our family visits often. Our guests were very impressed and everyone really enjoyed themselves. Gordon joined us on our trip to W5, and we all ate at the pizza restaurant. That occasion was the 1st time our whole family has ever sat down to eat together in a restaurant, and it was a most successful meal. Each night, when the children had all gone to bed, we adults sat and enjoyed a lovely meal courtesy of Gordon's great cooking skills. I usually provided desert and bread. We so enjoyed our time together. They left for the airport yesterday afternoon, and we were sad to see them go. It was a special time. Belle is one of the 3 people I miss the most since moving back to Ireland. Duncan was perfectly happy dealing with extra people in the house. He just carried on as usual  and enjoyed having a few more adults to tickle and cuddle him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/09/our-friends-come-to-stay.html", "title": "\nOur friends come to stay\n"},
{"date": "15 Sep 2006", "body": "\nWe had another day out at W5 yesterday, meeting with a few other HE families. As ever when we're there, we spent most of our time in the section with the huge wooden train set, the balls and water splashy area, and the house construction play area (complete with a crane and foam bricks). Lady and her friend J went off together around rest of the centre. Duncan tried to grab the controls for the crane from another little boy, about 2 years old, who was not happy about this interruption and bit Duncan hard on his arm. His mother was affronted and apologised as I comforted Duncan, who was upset but not crying. We all headed to the pizza restaurant for a noisy lunch. Lady ate loads, I can't believe the appetite that girl has sometimes. But she is always on the move too, so is lean and strong. Duncan ate some ice-cream, scooping it up with some toy chattering teeth Lady had just bought him. He was all excited about the purchase of 'false teeth'; he's had a thing about false teeth for a while now. When Gordon came home, I asked Duncan to tell him what the 'naughty boy' had done in W5. Duncan said, 'naughty boy, bite' then demonstrated on his own arm. He showed Gordon where the injury was (there's a small bruise). We were happy that he was able to tell a story about some previous event, as he hasn't done that before. There have been new additions to Duncan's repertoire of language. It might seem that I'm perseverating on this topic, but I find it helpful to record it here. On Wednesday, in reply to something I asked (don't remember what) he responded with 'No indeed'! When Gordon asked him last night as he was going to bed 'do you love me?' he replied, after thinking for a few seconds, 'yes  I  love  you .' Gordon said, 'do I love you', some more thought, then the answer, 'yes,  you  love  me .' That was the 1st time ever he used you, me and I correctly in such a sentence. What a star! The other new phrase, is 'yes, I am' which is used interchangeably with his other mode of assent.

{"date": "31 Mar 2008", "body": "\nWe went to my brother's house in Leitrim for Easter. Lady and Thomas played with their cousins, Lady mostly played up with 6 year old C. and Thomas with 4 year old E. They get on really well together. Duncan preferred to ride a trike around outside. He had a notion to buy a toy bow and arrow (or \"boanarro\" as he wrote on his first trial on Google) and didn't really accept my explanation that toy shops are closed on Easter Sunday. Well, copious quantities on chocolate helped settle everyone, and we adults enjoyed good food, a few drinks and much chat. Lady and Thomas stayed for 3 extra nights with their cousins, which was, by all accounts, a very successful event. They went swimming in a super duper, waves and slides pool, then they all won medals in some children's races at a 10k race my SIL ran. The village they live in seems to be populated by a strange breed of Irish folk who all run. Well, there are worse vices than could inflict them. It was odd having just one child. Gordon and I took Duncan into Belfast on the train. We visited the Disney store to buy his much wanted bow and arrow toy, then we ate at Nandos in the newly opened and very posh Victoria Square shopping centre. Duncan was marvellous. He had his shouty moments. He always does, but so what. He was as happy as a boy can be on the train. Watching him, we talked about how fantastic we think he is, and how glad we are to have him. Having autism enter our lives was unexpected, unwelcome at first (before I figured out that autism=Duncan, which is obviously all good) and something that shook us right up, leading us to make choices in nearly every aspect of our lives that we might otherwise not have made. But mostly, Duncan is just so blinkin' adorable, with his big eyes, his big tooth, his curls and all his games. Duncan too had a night away from home at my dad's apartment, leaving we adults home alone. We ate out that evening, and then to be even more decadent, went out again for breakfast. In the afternoon we all drove around to pick up the travellers, so had our wee family back together again. Since then, I can't quite remember what we've done. Lady went to a holiday activity scheme at a leisure centre a few times with her friend from next door. The children's usual classes and activities were off for the school holidays, so even though we're home-educators, the children were in holiday mode and we were (even) more disorganised than usual. I do remember yesterday though. It was our 12th wedding anniversary. I don't know how that's even possible seeing as I'm still 24... My dad and step-mum took the children for a few hours and Gordon and me went for lunch at the Mourne Seafood Bar in Belfast. Rather romantically, among the songs playing softly in the background, was what we choose for the first dance at our wedding party. (OK, pass the sick bucket!) More importantly, the food was fabulous, and it's somewhere we'll definitely be back to. My youngest brother and his family had also come up to Dad's place, so we enjoyed seeing them for the first time since his baby's christening. Both Thomas and Duncan were delighted with baby D, sitting beside him stroking his little head, though Duncan was a bit worried about D's touch of cradle cap, saying he had to sort the 'creepy crawlies', referencing what I tell the boys when I'm checking them over for nits! So it's back to normal today, or at least what passes for normal here.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/03/some-decadent-days.html", "title": "\nSome decadent days\n"},

Duncan is sitting on the floor beside me playing with, well would you believe it, he's got the trains out! We haven't done anything remarkable since Friday, when I took the children to a big playground not far from here, and we met up with a few other families whose children  learn out of school. It was a lovely sunny day and  they all had a great time.  I was required to play several games of 'chase-kiss' with Duncan, so I had my work-out too! A few times, I felt it was necessary to explain Duncan's actions or limited verbal understanding to other adults there. He wasn't doing anything wrong at these times, as he was actually on great form. I wondered if I should get him something visible (like a T-shirt with a message or a badge) that would explain in a non-condescending or pitiful way, that he won't understand them if they start jabbering away to him; especially for those times when I'm not right there. I don't mind telling people he is autistic. (Though I have problems with saying it when his behaviour is poor, as then it would just reinforce people's negative perceptions. For example, when he has a tantrum in public, I rarely make eye contact with people around us; I just shut them out and concentrate on Duncan and his needs.) Anyway, I don't know if it would be a good idea or not. Thomas would have started school this term had he been going. Compulsory education here (not schooling mind) starts the autumn after the child turns 4. So what are we doing about this- well nothing. What happens right now works well,. The boy is happy and learning loads in his own way. Why mess with the perfect recipe! Just to finish, I wanted to note, that right now, Duncan is engaged in his favourite pass-time, watching Thomas themed YouTube videos. He's found a corker; Thomas meets 50 Cent!)

She was very accommodating, and Duncan was frightened at first, but we managed, with him sitting on my lap, to allow the dentist to have a good look round his mouth. It turns out that one of his molars is decayed. He will need either a filling or to have the molar removed. I think it would be less invasive if he had a filling. However, there is no way he could have the procedure under local anaesthetic, so he will need a general anaesthetic, or to be sedated. I'm worried about the risks here. I'd like to know, if anyone has any advice they could share on similar experiences they or their children have had.

When you ask him if he wants something, he'll answer with either  yes  or  no thanks , followed by the subject of the question. So I might ask if he wants some soup; 'no thanks, soup', or if I ask if will say goodbye to Daddy when he's going to work, he says 'yes, bye-bye Daddy.' He also uses this when he doesn't want to do something, so I might ask him to tidy his trains at night, and he says 'no thanks, trains in box.' It's such a polite way to refuse! There was an incident yesterday when Gordon, Thomas and Lady returned from the shop. Duncan was crying and stopping them from opening the front door, because he wanted a new toy train, and I think that he knew they wouldn't have it and wanted to put off the certainty of dealing with his disappointment for as long as possible. Anyway, he tantrumed, everyone was cross about all the noise and fuss and for a while I felt so overloaded myself that I started to cry for a few minutes. Duncan was sitting right beside me at that point, and was crying himself, but he immediately noticed what I was doing, he stared into my eyes and started stroking me and kissing me in a most concerned manner saying 'kiss it better' over and over. He said, 'Duncan so sad, Mummy happy.' And he did make me happy again. Later, the children all had a bath (and played with the new squeezy Thomas bath-toy) before bed. Duncan was tired and wanted to lie in my bed for a while. I tucked him in, and hugged him tight, saying 'I love you', he spontaneously responded with, 'yes, I love you.' Then he said 'Mummy cuddle Duncan.' So I did, but not how he wanted, so he clarified, 'Mummy and Duncan lie down, Mummy's bed' So I lay beside him for a few minutes to hug him properly.

One thing was to learn to dance, and last night, I went to my 2nd Salsa dance class. After only 2 sessions, I'm hooked. It's great fun, I've enjoyed chatting to the other people there, and I get to dance without needing to wait for someone to ask me to their wedding! This morning, I took all the children out in the car with me. I went to the dump (as I'd cleared out our garage yesterday) and then we went to the shoe shop and they each got new trainers. I had a bag of mini-marshmallows to dispense when needed, and we managed fine. I was impressed at how smooth it went actually. Lady was great at looking after Thomas. He is always worried about going down unknown stairs, and Lady let him ride on her back so I could keep close to Duncan. Lastly, we called into a charity shop and left with a cuddly rabbit toy, a teddy-phone and a Muppet video (Duncan recognised it from a trailer on another video and asked for 'Pig falling in the water.') There's been lots of learning happening here. Lady has worked hard at some maths  worksheets  I wanted her to do. When left to her own devices, she's played with her 'Human Body Explorer' CD ROM, watched her new DVD, ( Bugsy Malone) , invented endless new outfits for her dress-up wooden doll, drawn pictures and filled in her Brownies book, told stories to the boys using the trains and various props, composed a poem about the guinea-pigs and played outdoors on the trampoline. (She's learnt how to somersault-the other day she wanted mustard on her hot dog; she carried it outside, turned a somersault, and told me it was to shake the mustard!). Whew! That's not half of it, but what I can remember for now. Thomas and Duncan pootle along as usual.  Yesterday, I overheard Thomas asking Duncan to play a  Pingu  game on the computer with him; 'Duncan play Pingu falling in the water with Thomas? Yes play Pingu?' Duncan obviously thought that was a good idea as they were chuckling away together later, while gathered round the computer. Duncan has been inputting all the train names into Google and YouTube by himself. I stay close by when he's doing this, to check the YouTube stuff especially. There are hundreds of Thomas The Tank films on YouTube. Yesterday, he was really getting into a film someone had made, with Thomas set to  Bohemian Rhapsody  by Queen! Thomas loves the set of  Magic Key  books I got and asks me to read them regularly, then he gets all excited doing the 'game' at the end of each story. Sometimes I try to be clever and get him to read some words, or notice rhyming pairs, but he snorts in derision and says 'just read the story Mummy!' Fair enough. He is recognising all sorts of words now though, and wrote a letter to his friend in England (who really is called Thomas) ;  I LUV YOU THOMAS . I had to spell  you , he spelled  luv  himself, and he copied  Thomas  from a DVD.

{"date": "1 Apr 2008", "body": "\nI watched the new BBC NI programme  Blueprint  last night. I rarely make an effort to watch TV as it happens now, preferring instead to watch the few shows I like online via the BBCi player or something. But this I wanted to see properly, and it was well worth it. The show described how the land we live on has changed over millions of years, how it's position on the globe has changed, how 2 sections of the island were formed from land masses that were once thousands of miles apart. I was fascinated to learn about the Caledonian mountain range stretching across North America, Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia, and which in these parts, now comprises the rolling hills of the Sperrins near where I lived. I never knew this land was once a baking desert, or covered by a tropical ocean. See what a good school education can leave out. It was great to see such a well made, local science programme. The special effects looked good. I liked the sand world map on a Sligo beach to demonstrate plate tectonics. William Crawley is an engaging presenter, though I did wonder why he was wearing pale coloured trousers as he kept having to tramp through mud. But guess what, there have been complaints to the BBC about the programme. I was reading the  presenter's blog  and came across a comment I assumed was a parody; \"I, along with many others are disgusted that the BBC is using license payers money to spew out this filth over the airwaves. It is evolutionary nonsense, which is in complete opposition to the Biblical account of Creation.\" Eh?! That can't be for real...can it? Unfortunately I soon saw a link to a  group criticising the programme  (I've broken the link) and its makers for not covering their notion that somehow, the bible should be accepted as a  literal  interpretation of the earth's formation; In it [Blueprint] they will teach the theoretical 600 million year history of the island of Ireland. No reference will be made to a Creator or Intelligent Designer and no reference will be made to important biblical events such as God's 6-day creation or the worldwide flood of Noah's days as recorded in the book of Genesis. ... I am very angry that the BBC, yet again, is siding with evolution in the debate about the origins of the world. These programmes are about to launch a massive attack on the Christian values of our country and I hope Christians can be persuaded to make their voices heard with the BBC. I think this is the most dangerous TV series in NI for years. If possible, I would like to see Christians gather in prayer outside Broadcasting House in protest at this insidious attack on our society's foundational values. They even suggest a form of letter to use in complaining to the BBC about this \"massive/insidious attack\"; Dear Mr Crawley,    In relation to the upcoming series of BLUEPRINT programmes I wish to register my protest to the BBC NI about this offensive abuse of the licence fee money of the many Christians in Northern Ireland who accept God's account of His own Creation as recorded in His Word in the book of Genesis.    I would ask, for the sake of balance, that BBC NI expend a similar amount of finance and give a platform to Scientists, who are Christians and 'Biblical Creationists' to explain the visible scientific evidence that concurs with their beliefs on the origins of the island of Ireland.

{"date": "4 Sep 2006", "body": "\nYesterday was one of those magic days that grace us every so often. We just had an easy time and enjoyed each other's company. I knew it would be a good day from the start. We ate breakfast together; Duncan doesn't usually want to sit with us. Yesterday he wanted bacon and eggs (like in  Thomas Comes to Breakfast ) and ended up eating 4 eggs (no yolks). He's still so thin and wiry that I'm happy to see some protein getting in there. Later I had a long bath, and was joined for a while by Thomas, who, as usual, had a great philosophical conversation with me. He's still very interested in the whole topic of life and death and has loads of questions about it all. He was also talking about how he'd be a daddy when he grows up. I asked him how many children he would have, he said, '42...or maybe 3.' He decided that if he had lots of children, he have to buy a castle to live in and then he'd be 'King Daddy.' For the next few hours, the children played with the trains, Lady watched  Bugsy Malone , I read a few stories to the boys and Gordon cooked a big batch of tomato sauce. Late in the afternoon, we drove to a shopping centre and Gordon bought some clothes for work. I got a large bag of cashew nuts and Duncan stuffed handfuls into his pocket and ate them on the go. We had a look in the toy shop for the Thomas wind-up train he wants. They didn't sell it. He was disappointed, but I told him I would get it on the internet and he was happy with that. Then we went to Mc D's and Lady wanted a meal with the toy so she could get this little music player thing. It plays just one song, but she thinks it's so cool. She said she's now 'a girls-out-loud' fan, (they're usually known as  Girls Aloud ). On the way home, we stopped off at a playground. It's right beside the beach, and there are great views over the lough. We were in time to see a massive cruise ship sail by. It was windy, and getting late by then, so there weren't many other people around. For the last 10 minutes, we had the place to ourselves. Gordon and me so wished we had taken the camera. The children had a fantastic time. They all went on the aerial runway, and they're strong wee scoots. Watching them whizz along with a huge gin on their faces and the wind in their hair, I was so happy and proud of them. As we went back home, we talked about what a great day we'd had. The words of that great Van Morrison song,  Coney Island , came into my head and I said to Duncan, 'did you have fun today?' ' Yes, fun today .' What else do I need to know.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/09/wouldnt-it-be-great-if-it-was-like-this.html", "title": "\nWouldn't it be great if it was like this all the time\n"},
{"date": "26 Aug 2006", "body": "\nThanks  Ann  for tagging me. 1. One book that changed your life? Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. I first read this when I was not much older than Charlotte when we first meet her. I can still imagine her terror in the 'red room' and the first time I ever cried while reading, was when her friend dies beside her at Lowood School. It was the first time I really felt the magic of escaping into another world. I had to read it a few more times to appreciate the choice of a small, plain and poor heroine, who knows her mind and carves her own path. 2. One book you have read more than once? * by Jane Austen! 3. One book you would want on a desert island? The complete works of William Shakespeare, should keep me going 'til my rescuers arrive. 4. One book that made you cry? Most recently,  Memoir , by John McGahern. 5. One book that made you laugh? Oh, right...well I've read a fair few of  Marian Keyes  books and they're all funny, smart and a great escapist read, even the one about a recovering drug addict. So lets  say,  Watermelon . 6. One book you wish had been written? I can't answer this question. 7. One book you wish had never been written? The Contented Little Baby Book, by Gina Ford. So  sue me ! 8. One book you are currently reading? Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad. (I got a box of 'banned' books for Christmas and am working my way through them.) 9. One book you have been meaning to read? Portrait of a Lady, by Henry James; I started this about 5 times but keep putting it down in favour of something easier. I'm tagging  Amanda ,  Autiemom ,  Esther ,  Kristina  and  Hazel .

{"date": "30 Aug 2006", "body": "\nWe've had a busy few days. One of Lady's summer scheme friends came over on Thursday and another visited on Monday. We had more friends round yesterday too. At the weekend, we went to the cinema and rode the miniature train. Duncan has been temperamental recently. He keeps shouting and bursting into tears. When he is loud, I may ask him to talk in a quiet voice. He always responds by telling me he is ' not  happy.' I say, 'I know you are not happy, but can you be angry and quiet.' He will then say, 'not quiet, ever again.' He's also told me a few times, 'not happy, ever again,' and that he is 'fed up!' ' Fed up ' is one of my phrases (such a stupid thing to say, I know), but I don't know where he heard ' ever again '. This morning, he woke and was in a bad mood from the start. He shouted at me to get him a drink, then threw his cup of juice down the stairs (it has a lid, so only a little went on the carpet). I told him off and was very cross, so he burst into tears, said 'I'm sorry' and told me over and over that he was very sad. He sat on my lap with his arms tight round my neck, and I hugged him as I ate breakfast. I was feeling a bit frustrated, at his behaviour and mine. Lady and Thomas went upstairs to play with the toy lorry (it opens out to make a town with lots of tiny cars) and Duncan went outside to play on the scooter. He raced up and down, happy and smiling, with a couple of trains in each pocket and I turned on my computer. I had a look to see what's new on the autism hub, and read Abfh's post  Another Autistic Child Murdered . As reported by the Cincinnati Enquirer, three-year-old Marcus Fiesel's foster parents, Liz and David Carroll Jr., intentionally left the boy locked in a hot closet with no food or water for two days. They burned the body and then reported to police that Marcus, who was autistic, hyperactive, and prone to wandering, had gotten lost in a park. Oh how it breaks your heart. At least this time, the killers have been roundly condemned and no-one has tried to play the 'mercy killing' card. There are many difficult days when you're raising children, but there is never, ever an excuse for this. You know what I'm going to do right now, I'm going to go up to my sons' room, hug them all tight, and read some Thomas the Tank Engine stories, then probably draw some trains.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/08/another-autistic-child-murdered.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/weve-had-busy-few-days.html", "title": "\nNo excuse\n"},
{"date": "24 Aug 2006", "body": "\nAt 6am, Duncan came bounding into our room and jumped into bed beside me, wrapping his skinny wee naked body around me, and squashing a Percy train, a Thomas train and Bulstrode the barge, in between us. He'd obviously wet his bed, so he was clever enough to shed the wet pyjamas and choose a nice, dry bed to lie in. He entertained us with some choice moments from the Thomas stories for half an hour before asking for the fan heater (which he loves to crouch in front of like a cat) and some cheese and carrots and apple juice. Thomas intercepted me as I tried to go downstairs and I was obliged to return to my bed with him for our morning hugs. That done, we were able to go down to eat. Thomas and I played a marathon game of snakes and ladders over breakfast. I never played the game for so long before. Lady got busy fixing breakfast for Crookshanks and Daisy, the guinea pigs. They are really part of the family now; I mean, I even dreamt about them the other night! She put them in the run which they spend every dry day in, then cleaned out the hutch and washed it down with water and vinegar. Thomas was fighting to get a turn with the scrubbing brush too. Right now, they (the children that is) are playing with my (little used) spools of thread and all the buttons, making a model of a chocolate factory. Like you do. Duncan has a few new phrases. A few days ago he was muttering to himself as he played beside me, when he suddenly took hold of my face in both his hands, looked at me intently and said in an earnest manner, 'It's all right Harry, He's home, you both are.' After a bit more muttering he came out with 'He's back, vol-em-on's back!' I asked him what film it was, he said it was Harry Potter. That one cracked me up. One other night, I was watching a bit of  Doctor Who  with Duncan snuggling on my lap. He didn't appear to be paying much attention to the TV, when something happened on screen that made him grin and shout the line 'don't touch the baby!'. He said the word 'baby' in a funny faux-English accent, sounding like 'bai-bay'.  (Can anyone who happens to read this figure out the esisode?) This line has entered our repertoire of things to say when playing chase, I shout 'don't touch the baby' and he runs off, laughing delightedly. I need to fix Lady's hair now. She wants to look good as one of her summer scheme friends is coming over this afternoon.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/new-lines.html", "title": "\nNew lines\n"},

{"date": "21 Aug 2006", "body": "\nOnce again, things are looking up around here. Lady and Thomas are outside, bouncing on the trampoline, playing with the guinea pigs, riding bikes and scooters and whatever else they may be up to. I was thinking of asking Lady to do some sitting-at-the-table type of work, but I think they're much better off enjoying the few remaining days of sunshine together. There'll be time enough for desk work when it's cold and miserable outside. Duncan is sitting beside me, using his own computer to watch Thomas the Tank Engine videos on  YouTube . We have only just started using this amazing resource. Yesterday I helped Lady to search for Harry Potter related videos (there are lots that are inappropriate/plain weird, and she's been told not to use the site unsupervised). We all enjoyed a  Harry Potter spoof  made for Comic Relief. Gordon spent a few hours last night sitting with a big grin, watching videos by some of the electronic music artists he enjoyed as a youth; YMO, Thomas Dolby, Human League, Kraftwerk, that kind of thing. Yesterday, Lady alerted us to a bit of a nature battle played out by our back door. A wasp and a spider were tussling on a web; the spider won and we were able to watch it wrap the (still live) wasp in silk, then haul it up to a corner (its larder) and leave it to dangle. It was a fascinating sight I'd never witnessed first hand before. Thomas had a great discussion also about when he was a baby and how he's getting bigger and then he told me about how he was 1, then he was 2, then he was 3.......all the way up to 100 (though he skipped the 80's; 79 straight to 90!) then at 100 he will die and I will get a new boy. He asked me where he came from, so I told him, the he asked how he got out, so I told him. He just said 'ohh', and went to the next issue. He suddenly realised that  I  am not 100 yet so  I  must be growing too. I told him that I stopped getting bigger when I became an adult. He said that if I was still growing I'd be a giant and I'd have to sleep in the  Giants Causeway ! We've also been having a few big conversations about our plans for the children in the coming year. Gordon still worries about Lady's education  in case she has fallen behind her schooled peers. I have greater expectations from her now; she's older, much more mature and interested in learning about the world, loves to read and just needs some more structure and dedicated time to work. I am aware of things like the National Curriculum guidelines, but mostly I compare her against herself and track the progress she makes in her own development. We also talked about Duncan. He has been having lots of outbursts, shouting and crying to get what he wants. We talked about how his disability affects  him , as that's all that matters when looking at an individual. (Autiemom has a great post about these issues  here .) His difficulties are all due to his very limited communication ability. We need to find more ways of helping him communicate without his feeling the need to shout/squeeze my arm/cry quite so much. I try to help him to label his emotions, so as not to deny him the right to feel and express different things, but to be able to show it in more suitable ways. I am learning all the time, and have a long way to go.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSM1D2Gkdts&mode=related&search=", "http://www.giantscausewayofficialguide.com/home.htm", "http://autiemomspeaksout.wordpress.com/2006/08/20/it-all-depends-on-what-you-mean/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/our-weekend.html", "title": "\nOur weekend\n"},

{"date": "11 Apr 2008", "body": "\nFor all my bluster here, I recently realised something worrying; Duncan never had the second MMR vaccine, probably due to an oversight when we changed from a London GP to our local one several years ago. I was looking through the children's health records when I made the discovery, so I contacted the health centre, spoke to a GP, and arranged a time for him to catch up on this important vaccine. My sister was spending a few days with us, so she stayed with Lady and Thomas while I took Duncan to the doctor. He ran into the health centre quite happily, but wanted to go back to the consulting room he'd been in the week before, so I had to hold him back while waiting to check in with the receptionist. He was shouting various angry/worried film lines. I kept asking him what film what he was saying comes from, then he'd calm down just long enough to tell me, and perhaps a few minutes more, then he was off again. The health visitor came put to ask me how we could best approach the mechanics of the vaccination for Duncan, and I asked that it all be done as quickly as possible. The GP was wonderfully considerate. Duncan yelped in pain and surprise as the needle went in, but wasn't half as bothered by it as I'd worried he would be. He had to have a look at his bottom to check he wasn't bleeding later (he worries that he's bleeding after every little knock or bump, and if a kiss doesn't cure his pain, a plaster is almost sure to do it), but there was only a tiny mark. To reward him, I said he could buy a new toy. He choose to go to the charity shop rather than the standard toy shop. He has been collecting old videos recently, mostly to examine their cases and the idents shown before the films. On that day, I found him a really old BBC video of a cartoon called \"Ivor the Engine\" and he was so happy later to see it had one of his favourite idents; the BBC stars. He has invited me to snuggle beside him to watch it many times since, and I've obliged for the sheer joy on his face. He also found a toy Big Ears (friend to Noddy) which has had lots of play this week, while he dressed himself as Noddy. So anyway, he's caught up on his vaccinations. I just didn't want to risk exposing him to measles. One MMR dose wasn't enough, and there are  far too many cases of measles  among children these days. I was particularly worried about the possible risk of infection when we go to Disneyland later this month.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/R__hbO1O0iI/AAAAAAAAAKk/MMS8Kxm8UoE/s1600-h/BBCVideo85a.jpg", "http://www.eurosurveillance.org/edition/v13n15/080410_1.asp"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/04/no-measles-here.html", "title": "\nNo measles here\n"},
{"date": "4 Apr 2008", "body": "\nKathleen Seidel, owner of the  Neurodiversity website  and  blog , has been served with a subpoena in what appears to be a craven attempt at intimidation. The website is one of the best, most extensive online resources on autism and more general disability issues.  The blog provides a masterclass on what the very best bloggers can achieve. I choose Kathleen for the Thinking Blogger Award last year, and as I  wrote then , \"She is clever, dogged, unfailingly polite, thorough, fair, compassionate, dedicated and whatever the highest award available to bloggers is, she should get one. She writes about autistic advocacy and anti-scientific theories of autism causation and 'treatment'.\" Kathleen Seidel has  blogged  about the activities of the Rev. Lisa Sykes and her husband Seth Sykes, who continue to claim, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that their son's autism was caused by mercury poisoning via vaccines.  Sykes is suing a several pharmaceutical companies , alleging her son was damaged by their vaccines. Among the lawyers representing Sykes, is Clifford Shoemaker, about whose earning from vaccine litigation  Kathleen wrote  just before she was  served with a subpoena , (issued by Shoemaker) to produce extensive, personal documents and records for the Sykes' suit. Kathleen has written (what looks to my ignorant-of-law eyes) a great reply to quash the subpoena, detailing the many reasons against it's validity. Among these she writes; I am not a party to  Sykes v. Bayer , and have had no personal acquaintance or contact with any of the parties to it. ... http://www.neurodiversity.com  is not a legal entity, an organization or a business; rather, it is an Internet domain name that I own. My website is a one-woman labor of love, creativity, conviction and conscience. ... I have not otherwise been paid by any person or organization for developing or maintaining the website, for writing, or for my political advocacy or charitable work. ... Even if the subpoena were not unconstitutional, illegal and barred by the journalist\u2019s privilege, it is excessively intrusive in its terms. Plaintiffs and their counsel seek not only to rummage through records that they suspect pertain to themselves, but also through my family\u2019s bank records, tax returns, autism-related medical and educational records, and every communication concerning all of the issues to which I have devoted my attention and energy in recent years. I have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to this material. It would be wholly inappropriate for the court to compel me, a nonparty to this civil action, to subject myself, my family, friends and acquaintances to the hostile scrutiny of plaintiffs in order to enable them to argue some point that would not even help to prove their case. ... WHEREFORE , Kathleen Seidel prays her motion to quash this unconstitutional, unreasonable, irrelevant, excessive, invasive, burdensome, frivolous, and clearly retaliatory subpoena be  ALLOWED . I have glanced over the  subpoena , and there is no indication that Kathleen is being accused of having done or written anything in any way illegal. It does ask for all correspondence between Kathleen and \u201creligious groups (Muslim or otherwise), or individuals with religious affiliations,\u201d  as well as most of the people whose blogs are on her blogroll, including this one! What purpose could all this possibly serve? And what on earth is that bit about religious groups supposed to mean?! I find this action against someone who has always been so fair and scrupulous in her activities to be reprehensible. I also think, like every previous attempt to  persecute a blogger  without just cause, this will go badly against Sykes and Shoemaker. Haven't they heard of the  Streisand effect ? Why would they want a judge (or whomever is responsible for deciding on these matters) to read all of Kathleen's work which shows their claim for what it truly is. She also details Sykes'  involvement in the Griers IRB  which approved their \"research\" on chemical castration agent, Lupron, as one of the cornucopia of supposed treatments foisted on autistic children, among them, the  son of Rev. Sykes . As someone in the comments section of Kathleen's blog wrote, as far as this goes, and in the tone of Kubrick's famous film, when someone goes picking on one of our own, I am Kathleen. All these others are Kathleen too ;-) Let me know if I've missed anyone out. (There are comprehensive lists at  I Speak of Dreams  and  Holford Watch  too; they've most likely got links I missed.)

{"date": "14 Aug 2006", "body": "\nWe've just had a weekend of birthday celebrations. Lady took some little cakes to summer scheme on Thursday and she had a little birthday party with some of her friends there. She also went on a trip to W5, and had great fun dressing up in a lab coat to make flubber. When I went to pick her up, she was whispering to one of the little boys. She told me they'd been discussing who fancies whom. Apparently she fancies Sammy, Andrew fancies Jessica and Erin fancies someone else...she's only 8, is this for real! Gordon's Mum came over to have dinner with us. We had Lady's favourite, a Chinese takeaway, and I'd baked a small chocolate birthday cake. On Friday, we all went to the Folk and Transport Museums. Gordon's Mum came with us and she thought it was all great. Everyone enjoyed the day; Duncan ran lots as usual! In one of the museum cottages, there is an open fire below a huge chimney. Duncan stood staring at the fire and looking up the chimney for ages, then he started reciting some lines and pretending to sneeze. I realised he was thinking of Disney's  Pinocchio , the scene where they light a fire in the wale's belly. We had a proper party for Lady on Saturday. Lots of friends came over, as well as my dad and step-mum, Gordon cooked and I baked and we all had a lovely day. Lady got lots of great gifts. The house and garden were full of children running around having fun. Lady really liked her friend J and the 2 girls spent the day together, usually with Lady's guinea pigs in their arms. Daisy and Crookshanks had no shortage of attention! It's so nice to gather friends and entertain. My extended family are great at that sort of thing. We really must do it more often. On Sunday, it was my mother-in-law's birthday, so Gordon took her out for lunch in a posh restaurant. Lady went too. She wore a pretty pink dress she'd received the day before as a birthday present, and I fixed her hair in 8 plaits. Lady enjoyed the experience, even if she only ate the desert!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/birthday-weekend_14.html", "title": "\nBirthday weekend\n"},
{"date": "18 Aug 2006", "body": "\nWe bought Lady a game called  Harry Potter scene it?  for her birthday. It's a board game with a DVD and tests the players' knowledge on the books and films. We have played it several times, and she keeps winning. I was shocked at the kind of stuff she knew, far more than me! She'd do well on Mastermind with Harry Potter as her specialist subject. She gets a real kick out of her success too. Thomas loves to play snakes and ladders. We played a couple of games this morning, winning one each. He gets so excited by it all; it's so cute! He explained the rules to me before we started. I thought it was interesting how he was able to recognise the value of each facet of the dice instantly by just looking at the dot patterns. They decided to do some art work next. Thomas requested 'the materials' and got to work with a sponge and some green paint (green is still his favourite). He showed me his finished product, '8 green fish having a race'. OK then! Duncan produced a bit of what could be considered an artistic enhancement of our bathroom last night. He had taken loads of toilet roll, wet it, and then flung the piles of mushed up paper at the ceiling. When I saw it, the bathroom ceiling was hung with lots of little papier mache stalactites. Well, it was a more pleasant experiment than his  earlier dissection . He and Lady are painting downstairs right now, so I'd better go check what artistic delights await...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0009V5RLW/026-3003978-8950059?v=glance&n=468292"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/mastermind.html", "title": "\nMastermind\n"},
{"date": "10 Aug 2006", "body": "\n Happy Birthday!!! How did that happen, one minute she's just been born, eyes wide, looking round, assessing the situation; next minute (or so it seems) she's a tall, strong girl growing and learning and making me proud. She lies on the floor with her little brothers and tells them long, convoluted stories using their toy trains. She plays chase with Duncan as she knows it's his favourite game. She sits up in her room watching  The Sound of Music  with Thomas, the 2 of them belting out the songs together. She still likes to dress up and play with dolls. She makes dens with the boys and reads to them (they love  Cat in the Hat ). Having spent so much time together, they are all good friends. She can make friends with children much younger and much older than herself. She has not been exposed to the idea that only people born in 1998 can be her friends. She draws pictures most days, of herself with her brothers or of Gordon and me, and writes little love notes and puts them under our bedroom door to find when we're going to bed. She loves her JuJitsu and is determined to keep at it and get a black belt. She has loved going to summer scheme and has made friends with a gang of children there. They've been swimming every day and going down to the beach where she makes collections of shells and stones. She is kind and considerate of others. She understands and loves Duncan and always stands up for him. She doesn't wish he wasn't autistic, she knows that he just is as he is. She can tell me when I'm doing the wrong thing or am not being fair on one of the boys, and when I mess up and tell her I'm sorry, she immediately forgives and rushes to hug me. She holds no grudges. She is clever and learning well. She is a Harry Potter super-fan and knows the books inside-out. She loves history and science, especially learning about the body. I love seeing the progress and learning with her. It is wonderful to have her around to share this. When she was a baby, Gordon and I would keep staring at her while she slept, and we'd whisper 'we made her!' in awe. We're still in awe when we look at her. Our lovely Lady (who's real name is  much  nicer!).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/IMG_0919.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/lady-is-8-today.html", "title": "\nLady is 8 today!\n"},
{"date": "8 Aug 2006", "body": "\nI had the most fantastic weekend away at my cousin's wedding while Gordon stayed at home with the children. I drove first to my brother's house, got changed into my dress, had some bacon and eggs, then went with my sister to the church. On the way, a policeman flagged down my car for no reason, and growled at me 'What's the name?'. Now, I'm a good girl and have never been stopped by a policeman before so I was a bit flustered. I had to think for a few seconds, 'the name of what? The car?  The street? Oh no, he must mean what's  my  name' by which time my sister had poked me and I told him. He then asked 'Where from?' Well, lets not waste words here! Again I had to think; do I give my current address or would it be more correct to say where I'm from; my home-town, so I gave that answer and he waved me on. How odd. We speculated that there may have been a crime reported in the area, carried out by 2 women in pretty dresses, who clattered away on high heels before making their getaway in a people carrier. We arrived at the church minutes later. Crowds of relatives and friends were there, everyone looking gorgeous, especially (of course) the bride. Another cousin is due to have her 2nd baby in 3 weeks, and as I told her, she was the best dressed guest. The service was lovely, a string quartet provided the beautiful music, and my cousin and her  husband were so happy together. Everyone went to my aunt's house for drinks and snacks while some photos were taken, then we went to Donegal town for the reception. I tried to book into my room at the Central Hotel, but, like 3 other guests, the room had been double booked and we had to make other arrangements. The woman who was supposed to be sorting this out was a grumpy shrew. (If she had just said these 3 little words   I am sorry ! then we wouldn't have been so bothered cause mistakes can be made, but she was nasty and rude.) So don't stay there! Now this wedding had the best speeches I've ever heard. The whole lot were done in about 10 minutes! Unusually, they were given before the meal. The groom had written a romantic poem which left all us soft hearted folk with a wee tear in the eye. It took some nerve for him to do that; I'd have thought he'd be worried about the slagging he'd get from his mates. But he is clearly crazy about his wife and their lovely baby son. The meal was good and the band were excellent and much dancing was done. I had the chance to catch up with various cousins I hadn't seen for ages as they're living abroad. I was delighted to see my youngest cousin for the first time in years. She had come with her girlfriend and we had the best of crack together. I had a fair bit to drink (well, for me) and though I had no trace of a hangover the next day (I've never had one) I was totally hoarse and stiff from too much loud talking and dancing like a teenager. My dancing was described as 'provocative'...ha! It was great to not have to be the sensible mummy for a day! I had to abandon my car (obviously), and we managed to get a lift back to our brother's house. with yet another cousin. We got in at 4.15 am, wahey! I woke up at my normal time the next day and went for a walk to the corner shop for more bacon and eggs, as I needed some fresh air and exercise. We went back to Donegal later on Sunday where we met some of those who had stayed over, and where my other brother came to meet us with his family. That was another nice afternoon. I had a long drive alone to get home. When I got back I was bowled over by hugs. Thomas said 'Oh Mummy, I was so worried about you. I really missed you!' Duncan was a bit overwrought and told me to go away and said he was 'not happy'. (Gordon had been asking him if he would be happy to see me.) After he was done being a bit angry with me, he came up to sit on my lap and he cuddled in and cried for a while, after which he was OK. Gordon told me they had all had a lovely time together. It's nice that they are all old enough to enjoy being with him, and don't suffer any from my short absence. I did miss them, but boy, did I enjoy my short time away.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/08/marvellous-wedding.html", "title": "\nMarvellous wedding\n"},
{"date": "15 Apr 2008", "body": "\n Duncan usually makes his pictures on the computer these days, but sometimes he produces a drawing on paper. Last week he created this Noddy puppet, entirely by himself. He also enjoys little books, that he draws and writes on, and that he sometimes asks me to illustrate too. These books have such a combination of his favorite things. He has one with the title, \"Enid Blyton's Noddy's Toyland Adventure, by Dr Suess\" and another called \"Atari Tarzan\" showing a picture of Disneyland's Space Mountain coaster. This one has an interesting story too; It wose a chilet day in toyland was a roket Jafr and Tarzan and Lady Noddll The range wose Noddy (And the writing on the page shown) Now Alice trap Tarzan posh Clayton angry It wose Tarzan poshe Clayton. Well, it's clear to see poor Alice is indeed trapped, and that's Clayton looking angry at the bottom on the right, where Tarzan must have pushed him. You will also notice the many deadly looking arrows shooting all over the place, as well as the sword. It's all very exciting! Lady draws too. For a long time she produced mainly pictures of the 5 of us, embellished with hearts and flowers and her name in Chinese characters. This picture of the 3 children in a paddling pool (drawn a few years ago) is typical, and the duck-billed platypus is a more recent creation. She has been drawing lots of animals lately. One of her - stranger - pictures is this one, created 3 years ago, and apparently showing the birth of Thomas! That's the newborn Thomas at the bottom of the bed, and some hospital equipment to the right. Gordon, Duncan and Lady are all looking very pleased with the new arrival, while I'm saying ouch, as it hurts a bit when you have a baby. I've no idea what the purpose of the number line is, and by the way, the children were not around while I gave birth! Thomas is not very interested in drawing, so it's something I'm trying to encourage him to try to enjoy more. He sometimes copies Lady's work, coming up with pictures like this monkey. Yesterday I photographed many of their pictures drawn throughout the years. It'll help ensure I can enjoy these images for a long time to come.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAR1JP4PNFI/AAAAAAAAAK8/ivjZ_9Ob_wE/s1600-h/IMG_2802.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAR4Cf4PNLI/AAAAAAAAALs/40N1eUEjksU/s1600-h/IMG_2804.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAR1Kf4PNJI/AAAAAAAAALc/cV6xD5qyN5k/s1600-h/IMG_2844.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAR1J_4PNHI/AAAAAAAAALM/W9gcyT5n_dY/s1600-h/IMG_2820.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAR1cv4PNKI/AAAAAAAAALk/SEJbJL0RHQU/s1600-h/IMG_2855.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAR1KP4PNII/AAAAAAAAALU/iXKph79iSfc/s1600-h/IMG_2806.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/04/our-gallery.html", "title": "\nOur gallery\n"},

{"date": "14 Apr 2008", "body": "\nMy sister spent a few days with us, so we had a few outings together. One was to W5, which was busier than it usually is on a school day. There was one school group there and many of the children were acting up, while their teachers ignored them. I had to keep Duncan away from them as they buck-lepped (that's west Tyrone speak for jumped wildly) around at his favourite exhibit; the weather camera. Lady and Thomas enjoyed showing their aunt around all the cool stuff. They ended the day with Duncan and Lady arranging furniture in the doll's house. My personal favourite time didn't involve my beloved children. I'd arranged baby sitting, and myself, Gordon and my lil' sis took public transport into Belfast where we meet my dad and step-mum for a fantastic Thai meal washed down with much wine. The children didn't want C. to leave, but eventually she'd had enough of us (or had to go back to work or something).  On Saturday, the children spent an hour at their Grandma's house while Gordon and I went for a run. We were totally out-done by my brother though, he ran about 21.2 miles further than us on  Sunday in London , along with about 34 thousand others. You go bro! Yesterday we piled into the car intending to drive to local park, but decided instead to drive up to the north Antrim coast. It was perfect driving weather and the road from Larne to Carnlough (where we stopped) is spectacularly beautiful. Thanks to my  Blueprint  inspired new interest in local geology, I noted the chalk cliffs topped with basalt. The locale provided the backdrop for some of the scenes from that programme too. It was my first time along that part of the coast; I'd always been coming from west to east before and never made it past Bushmills or thereabouts. We had chips (good) and ice-cream (poor) in Carnlough and the children burned off some of their vast quantities of energy in a playground before we headed for home. And just so you know, Duncan was  not  wearing a Santa hat, despite how it appeared to the several people who smilingly remarked on how out of season he was. He was, in fact, dressed as Noddy, which should be obvious when you note the blue shorts, red top and yellow scarf! Also, it's perfectly acceptable to carry the case of a Thomas the Tank CD Rom around with you in a playground! Instead of driving back along the coast, we headed south towards Belfast, taking us into some lovely countryside. We passed a mountain and I looked at the map for its name. It was Slemish, which I obviously know (as a good wee girl I'd absorbed all this information) as the place where the captured Briton later known as St Patrick, was sent to watch sheep and where he did a whole heap of praying. It was nice to see it for the first time. Again, thanks to Blueprint, Lady reckoned it was once a volcano. We looked it up later, and yes indeed it is the plug of erosion-resistant hardened lava from the inside of a dead volcano. Oh and that reminds me, another family tradition for all but Duncan (who finds it too scary and watches familiar videos instead) we enjoyed the Pompeii episode of Doctor Who, in which the volcano was far from dead. Right, I do believe I'm all caught up again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.london-marathon.co.uk/site/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAOqGf4PNDI/AAAAAAAAAKs/If9bh8f9OEU/s1600-h/IMG_2795.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SAOqG_4PNEI/AAAAAAAAAK0/07sWm_yNOEA/s1600-h/IMG_2798.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/04/week-that-was.html", "title": "\nThe week that was\n"},
{"date": "28 Jul 2006", "body": "\nWell after all the nerves, Lady has been loving her summer scheme. She has made friends with some other girls and really enjoys all the activities. The 2012 London Olympics road-show 'Be Part of 2012' called at the leisure centre and they watched a swimming display and listened to a talk by genius runner,  Steve Cram . It last from 9 to 5 though, much too long I think. Lady is exhausted and famished when she gets home, and really grumpy too. I'm glad it's only on for 3 days a week. There's no way she (or we) could deal with this intensity daily. On Wednesday, while Lady was gone, we took the boys to  Pickie Park  in Bangor. Duncan and Gordon went on the little Pickie Puffer train while Thomas played on a bouncy castle. Duncan had quite a wait before the train got moving and he was great. He was so excited; his eyes were shining and he kept waving to me 'Bye bye Mummy!' He waved at people as they went by. This is another new thing. Then we all went on the swan boats, Duncan with Gordon and Thomas with me. We took the boys' swimming stuff  and they played in the big paddling pool. Duncan was running around, splashing and jumping and laughing and squealing with joy. Thomas was more cautious and delicately picked his way around the edges. Every so often, Duncan would dart up the steps and run to the sweet shop, right by the pool. He would be looking in our direction as he ran; he knew he wasn't supposed to do it but he thought it was worth a try. Gordon and I took turns to observe Duncan. He can move so fast that we couldn't take our eyes off him for a second, especially in that crowded environment, and with all the little half clad children looking quite alike. It was usually easier to hear him than the other children though, he was certainly louder! At one stage, he tried to engage a little girl in a splashing game and I had to intervene, and another time, he blew water out of his mouth at a group of teenage girls. Thankfully, they just laughed. (I saw a woman walk through the pool, fully dressed with her trousers rolled up. Two little boys were playing as she passed and they splashed her front a bit. The old biddy then poked one of them on his shoulder and scolded him for wetting her! I tell ya', if that had been my child, she'd have been wet all over.) I couldn't believe how great Duncan was at dealing with all those tempting bags of candy-floss and ice-lollies right out on display. I kept telling him '1st paddling pool, then lollipop', and he managed to wait. They got their ice-lollies to eat as we walked back to the car. Later in the evening, I was helping Duncan on their computer when a wasp stung me in between my toes.  It bloody hurt!! Duncan was most interested and after volunteering to 'kiss it better', he asked me to draw a wasp! Some of the other things I have had to draw recently; Ice Age nut Bug's Life false teeth (from the Geri's Game short film after the film on our video) Bug's Life nasty grasshopper (hands go down) 4 Magic Roundabout characters Lots and lots of Snow White Grumpy pictures Thomas the Tank Engine lighthouse and many more! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cram", "http://www.pickiepark.co.uk/index.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/07/summer-fun.html", "title": "\nSummer Fun\n"},
{"date": "20 Jul 2006", "body": "\nA few days ago, I listened to the BBC Radio 4 programme,  My Brilliant Baby ; a discussion about hothouse parenting versus benign neglect. One of the contributor's said she and her husband had started out as laid-back parents, but when they realised their son had autism and his special-needs nursery was inadequate, he started 4 years of intense behavioral therapy. She says about her son; His play was terribly repetitive and obsessive and he wouldn't really communicate with others. If he was going to learn and grow up as a whole person and happy person, Sam was going to have to be actively taught all the things that other children just absorb naturally (snip) Sam underwent 40 hours of lessons a week with a team of behavioural therapists (snip) Everything in Sam's environment became super-controlled. His favourite toys-his beloved dinosaurs-which he would arrange in circles again, and again, and again, and again-they were all put away and he was only allowed to play with them for half an hour every day. He had to learn everything. He had to be taught to look at people and recognise emotions. He had to be taught not to grimace weirdly and not to walk away while someone was talking to him.  She then refers to some books they made including one which began; 'I must not talk all the time about dinosaurs, bugs and death.' (said in a monotone, to the merriment of the other guests.) She mentions that when they were out for a walk she thought; 'Oh good, he's generalising social skills', for as Sam was gradually becoming human, I was becoming a creep. We kept on Sam's therapy for 4 years. I think it was pretty successful, though of course as he doesn't have a twin, I can't really tell how he might have shaped-up without it. Sam is 10 now, and although he is still a difficult boy and needs support at school, he has genuine friendships with other children and he also doesn't seem strange the minute you meet him. They gave up the therapy after 4 years because 'Sam needed to have a life.' He now says rather poignantly, 'When I was young, you ever let me play with my elephants, and there were always these ladies everywhere. I never had any space.' I thought this was a interesting interview. The mother obviously wanted to help her son, but the piece included many autism cliches that I believed for a while when Duncan was diagnosed. It's sad that she felt she had to fill his days with so much therapy and restrict his access to his favourite things. I heard this programme on the same day as I wrote my post  A novel treatment for autism . It  describes the opposite approach to that we are taking with our son. Duncan plays with trains a lot, or with his little Zeebad figure and paper tube characters. His play looks repetitive, but I wouldn't think to restrict his access to those toys. I also know him to be fully human already, even without such training as she describes. Although I have no way of knowing whether this is the right approach, I would imagine than when he is 10, he will be happy in his own skin, perhaps he'll have one or two good friends but he will seem strange to people who meet him. About that last part, so what! As my children are learning, different is good!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/offthepage/pip/diiir/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/07/not-novel-treatment-for-autism.html", "title": "\nNot a novel treatment for autism\n"},
{"date": "4 Aug 2006", "body": "\nLast Friday, we went to a playground and met up with another (relatively) local home-educating friend. Lady played with her 4yo daughter, after some initial shyness. Thomas went off and scaled the  really high  climbing frame,  with all these much bigger children. He then joined a queue of 10-15 year olds from group outing, to ride the slide-along-the-rope-thing; the same one he was terrified of last year. This time he was marshaling all these big kids into helping him reach the seat, and getting them to push him along at top speed. Duncan climbed and slid and spun, but most of all he played with the sand. An ice-cream van drove in while we were there; I braced myself for the tantrum, but it didn't happen. 20 mins passed before Duncan noticed the van was there, then he ran straight towards it. I (as usual) dashed after him. I passed a man who called out something like 'bet he keeps you fit!'; I get that sort of comment a lot when I'm out with Duncan. So he asked for an ice-cream, I told him I had no money, so no ice-cream. He said, 'Get the money.' I said, 'The money is at home. Sorry, no money, no ice-cream.' He looked hard at me for a few minutes, thinking about this, then ran off to play. Whew, that was easy! On Saturday, we had another family outing to the cinema, this time to see  Cars . The film was great, but didn't hold Duncan's attention so well and he was quite fidgety towards the end. Talking of cars, ours failed the MOT; faulty rear number plate light and fog lights. I'd taken it to a local garage for a pre-test check too, you think he'd have picked up on those faults. Bah! But some good news, we had a meeting with the local NAS befriender scheme coordinator and the woman who had volunteered to befriend Duncan. She seems really nice. She will probably come here every week or so to spend time with Duncan, just playing and having fun together. There's no other agenda than that. Right. I'd really better get sorted. I'm heading off to my cousin's wedding tomorrow in my home town. The children will be left in their father's capable hands while I'm kicking up a storm on the dance floor (and I'm staying the night in the reception hotel too- lie in! Undisturbed breakfast!)

He can use the toilet independently during the day, but almost every night, I have to change the sheet, often the duvet cover and pillow case also, and sometimes more than once. I lift him out of bed 2 times a night and take him to the toilet. He wears nappies, though they don't do all that much good as he, well he's a boy, and he fiddles, causing his urethra to point up and out of the nappy! It's a bit of a pain, but I reckon it's just one of those things that he will eventually grow out of. There are some other things going on right now. He is loud. He cries a lot; sort of shouting out at me, to get various things or do what it is he wants RIGHT NOW! I'm not talking about really big storm  outbursts. This low-level complaining happens if I don't immediately jump to do his bidding. This shouting can last for 5-20 mins at a time, and happens several times a day. He sometimes pulls at me and bites my sleeve. He knows not to bite my skin (though he has done on a very few occasions when he was completely overwhelmed and unable to exert any self-control. This has not happened for over 5 months). I can mostly screen it out, and try to help him communicate what he wants in a more reasonable way. If I ask him to use a quiet voice, he will say 'Not happy, Duncan sad!' It  grates on me sometimes, and I will get a bit grumpy and whiny and do the 'Can I not even have a bite of breakfast in peace' or some similar spiel. But you know what, it always blows over. No-one is ever hurt. I'm getting better at dealing with it and at helping him deal with his big feelings. It reminds me that I have a choice in how I view these things. I could rage against the world and ask 'why do I have to listen to this, it's so unfair, other kids don't do this, if he didn't have autism we could do so much that we can't do now, blah, blah, blah.' But what the hell good would that do. It would only trap me in a bitter cycle of pity, that would close my eyes to much of the joy we share, like hugs and smiles and watching all of them grow, learn and progress. And there is a lot of progress.

He is even more excited than usual to see him return form work. He calls out for him often when he's frustrated or needs help. Yesterday, he came to me and announced, \"Daddy is a doctor - helps sick people - makes them feel better.\" Yes darling, he does! Gordon was delighted when I told him later. He said he'd talked to Duncan about what he does when he's away almost every day, trying to explain to him why he has to leave home. Duncan obviously got it. Yesterday I took the children to the animal rescue centre. One of the staff thought that a Collie dog might be good for us. I'd explained that Duncan, who was at the time making a lot of noise, is autistic, and though he's loud, he's gentle. She asked me, \"what kind of autism does he have?\" leaving me sort of stumped and stammering something like, \" he's just um, very autistic!\" What are you supposed to say to that?! The children were able to play with this beautiful dog for a while. Duncan kept telling me to take it home; \"put it in the boot.\" On reading about the breed further, I know we'd not be able to meet the demands of such am energetic, intelligent dog. We need something lazier and dumber! But Duncan enjoyed telling Gordon about our day. I prompted him to explain what we'd done and he readily told where we'd been and what we'd done; Played with a dog. Throw the ball. What was the dog's name? Dog - Chep! Yes! It's called Shep!

{"date": "18 Jul 2006", "body": "\nWe had a great weekend with my brother, sister-in-law and their 2 daughters.  It really was as perfect as we could have hoped for. The children enjoyed playing outside together in the sunshine. My niece C. adores her big cousin Lady and wanted to emulate her hairstyle, so I had to put C's hair into 4 plaits too. Thomas played with cousin E. who is almost 3. They had fun on a toy tractor and Duncan showed them how to drag each other in the trailer. I went for a run -4 miles!- with sil. I. She's  been running for a while now and is much fitter than me, but I manged to run most of the way though I walked up the hills. Our route was along narrow, isolated country Leitrim lanes, past bogs and low mountains. I thought of the  John McGahern's   Memoir  in which I've just been reading his recollection of walking the Leitrim lanes in his childhood.  I. told me that he died a few months ago. I hadn't even heard and feel  a bit shocked and bereaved. Last night I read the heartbreaking passage about his beloved mother's death when he was a boy: Those who are dying are marked not only by themselves but by the world they are losing.  He would have known he was dying when that was written. He was a wonderful, author who wrote truthful accounts of lives and family, place and the seasons.  May he face the rising sun . We went to a 'Game and Country Fair' at Makree Castle in the afternoon.  Last year at the same event, Duncan had wandered off and it took us 15 fraught minutes to find him (standing by an ice-cream van). Amazingly, he recognised the place although it's just crowds of people and stalls in fields. He pointed to a group of stalls and asked for 'brown sugar cubes', meaning fudge. That section contained the shopping stalls, though how he could tell them apart from a distance, I don't know. He was on great form, stayed by me (with lots of reminders) and with Thomas, really enjoyed patting loads of well groomed dogs, there for the pet show. Gordon joined a queue to buy ice-creams for everyone. Duncan was getting a bit anxious at having to wait, and it wasn't helping him that I kept reassuring him that he would get ice-cream soon. So I walked close to the van, and pointed to each of the people in front of Gordon in turn, saying '1st that man gets ice-cream, then that woman, then that man, then that man...then Daddy gets ice-cream for Duncan' and I repeated this information as the queue reduced. He must have understood better what was happening as he was content to wait then. All the children enjoyed the day. Lady liked the falconry display. Duncan was enthralled by some dancing horses and afterwards, he was singing the  Gipsy Kings  song played . Even when lyrics are in English, it's usually just a collection of sounds to him and although he has no problem repeating the phrase, it's good when someone says it slowly enough for him to hear the individual words. We bought a selection of good cheese, olives and bread and feasted after dinner when the children were finally asleep. The next day we had a relaxed walk, played and ate some more before heading back to the north east and home.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGahern", "http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,6121,631225,00.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/07/leitrim-lanes-and-sligo-castles.html", "title": "\nLeitrim lanes and Sligo castles\n"},

At one stage they went off with a selection of saucepans, glasses and some smoothie I'd made earlier, and pretended it was  Felix Felicis  (a luck potion). Well, it was the right colour! Duncan was a bit stressed out and stuck right by me for a while before he decided to head off and play again. Thomas played with the little 1 1/2 year old girl.  Their Mum was commenting on how gentle and lovely he was with her. I told her that I reckon he hasn't had to toughen up like many boys do when they go to nursery.  She then told me a few stories about  situations her son has had to deal with at school. The following day, we met up again at a brand new, and very busy playground beside their house. Thomas and Lady darted off and climbed and slid and swung while I stayed by Duncan. He liked the roundabout best. It's flush with ground level to benefit wheelchair users, but it's also easier for toddlers to get on and off. They seem to judge the speed so well and know when it's slow enough to climb on or off. Duncan, clutching a picture of Fizz I had made that morning, was loving this roundabout. He lay down and closed one eye so he could look more closely at the small gap between it and the ground. A dog was wandering around outside the playground fence making Duncan very excited. No-one was with this dog, and Duncan kept opening the gates and letting it in so I had to herd it back out a few times. Who designed a small playground with 3 gates anyway! There were frequent shouts of, 'Duncan, gate CLOSED! No dog!' as I ran up to him. He had  bit of a shout and cry when it was time to leave and a few old ladies were having a good tut about us. I was admirably upbeat and we had a snuggle and moved on happily again. Yesterday, I bought a 3 person tent on impulse at Tescos. Well, I had looked at them online a few days ago. We put it up in the back garden and all 3 children brought out their duvets to sleep there. When they were still shouting and laughing and running around at 10, (it was still bright daylight) I took Duncan (the noisiest one, who'd have thought it!) inside and he feel asleep beside me on the sofa. Thomas and Lady both went to sleep quickly too, then I carried Thomas back inside and I slept there myself. It's been years since I slept in a tent!

{"date": "23 Apr 2008", "body": "\nIt was only to be expected, but we had a fantastic time visiting C. in London. When we arrived, we took the tube out of Liverpool Street, and sort of on a whim, got out at Holborn. We still had our bags with us so we headed off to the British Museum to use the cloakroom there. Having discarded the bags we were able to dander around the museum for a while. I used to live in university residences not far from there (it's where Gordon and I first met) so had been in the museum before, but not since the refurbishment. It looks wonderful. Lady was particularly keen to see the Chinese items so we looked around that section first, marvelling at what these people were achieving while the people where I'm from were busy bashing each other with clubs...or something. Thomas wasn't very interested, though he did call my attention to some of the stuff. We looked at the Egyptian area next. Lady explained to C. the process of mummification. There were plenty of examples, including mummified cats and crocodiles. We didn't want to overdo the whole culture thing, and we all needed to eat to we went to the  Pizza Express across the road. It's somewhere we used to go as students to treat ourselves. My friend D. and me were there once when a couple sitting next to us walked out leaving their deserts almost untouched. D. noticed my look of horror at such waste (we would have been sharing one pizza and drinking tap water) and assured me that one day, I too would be able to afford to order desert and leave it, but I'm still too tight to waste food just to make a statement! The next day we went to the London Aquarium. I'd bought our tickets online in advance thus saving about 25% on the cost of entry. This also meant we were able to bypass the enormous queue and go straight inside, whew! This is a great place. Thomas however was less than impressed. Thomas is happier when jumping, running, climbing or when watching TV or playing computer games. Looking at lots of pretty fish didn't do much for him. He told me he was bored after only 20 minutes or so, \"they're just fish, just animals, what's so interesting about that?\" Delightful eh? Did I complain to him about being ungrateful, did I mention how much I would have given to be flown off to London as a child, and taken to restaurants and activities? Well obviously! Anyway, Lady loved it. One of her occasional ideas for her future career, is a marine biologist. When we left we walked across Waterloo Bridge, keeping an eye out for a bus to take us up towards Leicester Square. For some reason we didn't pass a bus stop for ages, and it was so very cold and windy. When we did get a bus, it was a single decker, causing Thomas to huff again for a while. But not to mind because we were soon at China town and in the Harbour City for dim sum. C. doesn't eat fish so I didn't order my favourites. Thomas only ate the spare ribs, but Lady had everything. It was very good. As promised, we then went to Hamleys. This was one of the highlights for the children. In the computer games section, there are a few Wii games set up for customers to try. There were around 20 people gathered around this sofa in front of a huge TV and console, where a couple of teenage boys were playing Mario Kart. When they finished another boy took up one of the controls, and Thomas decided to take the other. (No-one else was volunteering.) He sat and played the game, totally unfazed by the watching crowd. At the end I congratulated him for playing what was to him a new game, and doing quite well at it. He replied, \"I didn't do that well, I didn't win!\" Lady choose a toy dog that can jump and bark. She has called it Master Harry, the jujitsu-shihtzu. Thomas picked a Simpson's torch and lucky bag. I had bought a gift for Duncan before I left home, to be sure of getting exactly what he wanted. We took a trip on a double-decker bus to kill some time, and because it was what Thomas really wanted. Later we went to Planet Hollywood  for dinner, since I had some Tesco vouchers. I'm glad I didn't have to pay, it was awful. On Saturday, I had arranged to take the children out to stay for a night with Lady's best friends in the whole world. They both loved their time there. They went to a really cool playground and the maze in Hampton Court palace. For them both, it was the best part of the trip. I enjoyed catching up with my friends too, and in the evening, my sister and I met another of my oldest and best-est friends. We went to a lovely Thai place across from Centre Court in Wimbledon (I can't remember its name). Then since my sister was so incredulous that in all my time living in London, I had never been inside an O'Neill's pub (it's a chain of Irish themed pubs) we went to one for a while. It was a dive, but at least we had somewhere to sit, and to be honest, we were only interested in our conversation. I lay in the next day, enjoying being child free for a while. My sister and I had lunch then went to a crepe place for desert. The crepes were OK, but Thomas can make pancakes just as good. I wondered if I should buy one of those crepe burners, and put the children out to work in the summer! They'd make a fortune! We collected Lady and Thomas again then for once, had a quiet night at home. The next day we were leaving, so we packed up and headed to Waterloo station, and walked along the embankment to the Tate Modern, stopping for lunch at Wagamama on the way. We choose the smaller, lunch meals but these aren't as good as the food from the standard menu. We hung out at the Tate Modern (leaving our bags in the cloakroom again for a while) and watched Thomas sprint and roll all over the polished floor in the Turbine Hall. Well, the main floor was closed; they're repairing that artful crack and installing a new item, but he was able to run over a smaller, raised floor. We didn't look at any of the art, but we enjoyed the big, open, ugly splendour of the building. We crossed the Millennium Bridge (after passing the Globe Theatre, famous in our family for its inclusion in a Doctor Who episode) and caught a bus to Liverpool Street station. Our train was delayed for half an hour and I worried we'd miss the flight, but although we had to run to the security check, we were just on time to get to our gate and line up to board right away. Once back, Gordon and Duncan came to meet us. It was so good to see them. Duncan was grinning and hugging us all. He was happy with his promised gift; the remote control Brum. They had both got along just great. Duncan was happy to be with his dad, and knew we were only away for a short time. All in, it turned out to be a great trip for everyone. Now I have to finalise my plans for Disneyland Paris.

{"date": "16 Jul 2006", "body": "\nIt's called maturation; that is, the natural process of growing and learning. My child doesn't need treatment, he needs a little teaching, and not even too much of that since he learns in a fairly autonomous way. When I first learned that Duncan was autistic, I was determined to find the most effective therapy (well cure actually, but I was a lot less enlightened then), and was willing to throw myself selflessly into ensuring that every waking moment was optimised. (That reminds me of a scary  article  I read recently. It describes  all  time a child spends outside of some 40 hours a week behavioural therapy sessions as  dead time . The reader is instructed to ensure the poor child is never given a moments peace to just play or ponder, as the parent must constantly yap and sing and force new toys and flash cards and leaning opportunities on the child.) But a few years ago; I thought that  I had to be doing something , or else I was letting my son down and therefore was a bad mother. Thankfully what I decided to do first was to read widely and I came across the view that autism wasn't a terrible thing and this resonated a lot more with how I viewed my son as a quirky, sometimes exhasperating, often demanding, always loving and wonderful boy. As I've mentioned before, this growth of acceptance lead to advocacy and is part of the reason for my blog title. What I know now, is that it is actually very easy (most of the time) to raise Duncan. We have optimised our living environment to suit his and our needs. We lock some internal doors to avoid unnecessary battles and have a safely enclosed back garden. Difficulties arise often enough, but I'm getting better at dealing with them. This weekend we were away at my brother's house and visited a crowded fair, and he was  excellent . I enjoyed his company and was proud to be his Mum. Duncan has a TV with an integrated DVD player and video which he uses a lot. He needs to watch and re-watch films to catch what is said. I hear him saying the phrases over and over trying to make the right sounds. I see it as an important educational tool for him, although I previously thought only neglectful parents allowed their children to have a TV in their bedrooms. He plays most of the day. He asks me to draw pictures and has to find words to describe what he wants. We manage to squeeze in lots of maths too, as I ask him what shape the desired drawing should be, should it be bigger, longer, are there stripes or dots, do they go above or below. He can turn on the computer and use a variety of software and websites to play and learn.  He dresses-up most days and re-enacts scenes from the films. He runs and climbs, rides his bike and scooter, chases and bounces. He loves to sit on my lap for cuddles or a story. Over the past few months, with no great effort on my part, he has continued to increase his vocabulary, his knowledge of the world, the words he can sight read and he has extended his diet. I just smile and play and keep loving him. That's all I have to do. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tacanow.com/outsidetherapy.htm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/07/novel-treatment-for-autism.html", "title": "\nA novel treatment for autism\n"},

Lady and Duncan ate 4 each before I hid the rest! Lady described them as 'Over delicious' which I think is good. I sat down to have my cookie with a cup of tea and a browse. Several BBC headlines struck me immediately. Most horrible is,        Patients 'suffer extensive abuse' . This describes the unsurprising yet disgusting exposure of systematic abuse, physical, emotional and financial, in care facilities for people with learning disabilities. I will do everything in my power to ensure that no child of mine ever spends time in one of these places. If Duncan needs more help as an adult than people usually do to get by, I will help empower him to choose where he is based and how that help is provided. I then had a look at the Education headlines, which always help convince me of the case for home-education, especially things like;  Classes 'may get knife searches' . \"Teachers could be allowed to carry out knife searches of entire classes - rather than just individual pupils - under government proposals.\" There was also  Campaign to tackle gay bullying . I'm glad efforts are being made to help prevent this abuse of children, but it's disgusting that more hasn't been done to stop it already. Lastly I read about        School uniform trade investigated . I used to think school uniforms were a good idea but now I think it's ridiculous, especially the daft concept of dressing little kids like bankers in grey suits complete with ties and (for posh schools anyway) blazers. I found that when I had children in school, I was forced to buy overpriced tops from a selected source, just because of a school logo. Then it was such a hassle trying to make sure they were clean every morning. These days it's perfectly acceptable for Duncan to run around in whatever odd combination of dressing up clothes he wants. Yesterday he was wearing his red top-red pants combo, with artfully placed strips of white paper crossing on his chest and the whole look finished off with his Dad's black woolly hat pulled up high on his head. He was doing his impression of ' Soldier Sam ' (aka the 'Henchman') from  The Magic Roundabout . Just to give me an excuse to post this, Duncan loves wearing his Captain Hook costume too.

When I was pregnant for the 1st time, I was asked during a routine ultrasound scan, if I wanted a nuchal fold measurement carried out. I was told it was a screening test which could be used together with maternal age to give a prediction of the likelihood of Down's Syndrome. I said yes, as it wasn't invasive and I thought it would be interesting to know the outcome. I was told that it was highly unlikely that my baby would have Down's Syndrome. I had already decided that I really wanted that baby no matter what, but I wonder how I would have felt if I'd been told the opposite? When I was pregnant with Duncan and then Thomas, I had changed my views on a few things about the whole medical management of pregnancy, and though I still opted to have 2 ultrasound scans each time, I refused all other diagnostic or screening tests. Once again, I wanted the child I was carrying and I didn't need the pressure of these tests. Prenatal testing puts pressure on parents, mothers in particular, to reject a  specific  child. This is a whole different issue from that facing women who are pregnant and do not want  any  child at that time.  Woman are getting the message that they would be irresponsible to chose to give birth to a child they know to be disabled. These children are seen as 'drains on society' leading 'empty and pain-filled lives'. They are said to 'cost the state too much to care for them'. This is eugenics. It is anti-feminist. Parents who have learned through prenatal testing that their child is disabled, often don't know enough about the rich and rewarding lives of people with the same disability as their fetus. They don't know the joy that child can bring. No-one knows what will become of any child, how they will turn out. I will admit that for now, raising my autistic son is more difficult at times than raising my non-autistic children. People may see me running around after him or dealing with him when he is frustrated and shouting or lashing out, and they might think, I would prefer not to have to deal with that. I want everyone to know that the joy hugely outweighs the  sorrow. I would not want my boy to be anything other than who he is. The idea that he could be among the last generation of people who think in his own quirky way, just like the dwindling numbers of people with Down's Syndrome who make it, is scary and very saddening. It is not fair for a fetus to have to pass a test just to be born. Our society gains from diversity in all its forms. Disabled people cannot feel accepted and supported while it's possible to stop children from being born just because they're like them. Society can change and offer more help to families living with disability. A change of attitude would be a good first step.

{"date": "6 May 2008", "body": "\nOn Tuesday, we woke, wished Thomas a happy 6th birthday, and headed for breakfast together. There were no tables for 6 people available and we had to sit in a row of tables for 2. This was tricky, and we were relieved when a better table in an alcove became available soon after. That way, someone was able to supervise Duncan while the other raided the buffet. The children all loved the breakfast selection of cereals (including chocolate covered varieties) croissants (again with chocolate options) and plentiful mini-packets of Nutella. Duncan drank hot chocolate with frothy milk and ate croissants. It was all a bit messy and disorganised at our table, but eventually we'd filled our bellies and were ready for the next stage. At last, we were heading to the park. We bundled into our raincoats, since in accordance with the forecast, it was very wet and cold. Although we would have been allowed to enter certain portions of the park 2 hours early as Disney hotel guests, our particular group make-up prevented the rushing and early rising that would have involved. So we joined the throng and headed in. The first thing I did was to get an Access Card for guests with disabilities, after showing a letter from our GP (which I had written and he had merely signed and stamped!). Then we had to go see Space Mountain. This is one of Duncan's current favourites. He loves watching footage of the ride and films about its construction on YouTube, as well as films created by Roller Coaster Tycoon users, some of which are fabulous. He was in awe of it, and so pleased to be there beside the real thing. Before we'd left, Duncan had insisted that he'd  only  go on the Casey Junior ride. I wanted to see if he'd be willing to try any of the others and suggested the Buzz Lightyear one. I stressed that it was not a roller coaster (which are great to watch but much too scary for small boys!) and he agreed to try it. We used our Access card for the first time, and were allowed to join the much shorter FastPass line for the ride. Before long all 6 of us were blasting away with our laser guns at Zurg and his minions. Duncan loved it! Having got a taste of the action, we kept the momentum going by heading back to Fantasy Land and the Peter Pan ride. Again we had only a short wait before boarding our flying ship and heading off over London to Neverland. Duncan is so familiar with many, if not most of the Disney films. Many times I was reassured that he understood and recognised what he was seeing. The characters and stories are so well known and beloved by him, and it really helped him enjoy the narrative of the rides as well as the various shows we watched. Duncan was keen to see the ride he was most looking forward to, Casey Junior. We headed over there, both Gordon and I relieved to know our way around fairly well from our previous trip. On the way we headed into the Small World ride, knowing that E. would enjoy it particularly, and she did! Then finally, Casey Junior. Only 3 others were allowed to accompany the Access card holder on this ride, and we had a longer wait to board too. This really tested Duncan's abilities to wait and stay calm, when the train came past him over and over and he wasn't allowed on. It was much easier to be waiting away from the main queue though, since Duncan would have been trying to push past other people. At last we were on, Duncan next to me, and Lady beside Thomas. Gordon and his mum had joined the standard queue, and waved us off. This was it! This was why we'd gone to all that effort and expense to bring them to Disneyland. Duncan was perfectly happy and I just couldn't help getting a little misty eyed to witness such joy. The photo shows Thomas and Duncan on a later trip on Casey Junior. We were all hungry and cold so went to the Videopolis to eat some burgers and chips etc. These were OK, much helped by the trays of salad available to green up the burgers. We wanted to see the Tarzan show, but arrived 45 minutes before the start. Thinking that was far too long to expect Duncan to wait, we walked over to Phantom Manor, and using the disabled users entrance, were able to bypass the most freaky part of that ride (crowding into a room which goes dark before descending to where you board the carriages of the ride). Thomas thought it was boring, and Duncan wasn't too enamoured of it either. Moreover, by the time we got back to the Tarzan theatre, we were too late to be admitted which was a shame. But never mind, there was more to see and do. Next up was the character tea party I'd booked for Thomas' birthday. Well, I thought I'd booked a birthday party but it appeared I hadn't. This didn't go well, partly I must admit, due to my own grumpiness. We entered the restaurant via the wrong set of doors, well who knew! We had some trouble convincing the staff that we wanted to attend the tea party which we had booked and paid for. We were shown to our table, far away from the buffet, and with 6 chairs squashed around a table for 4. Then we were ignored. Eventually, I figured out that we could just go and help ourselves to the food, but I was a bit riled up by then having tried unsuccessfully to get some help and information from a member of the staff. Next they brought out the birthday cakes, singing happy birthday and didn't bring one to Thomas. WTF! Gordon eventually found someone to find out what was going wrong, and it transpired that I had not booked the birthday meal, merely a character meal. Hmm, not what I thought when I made the booking but if so, the error was mine. After all that it was hard to settle in and enjoy proceedings, but we managed with the help of Goofy, Pluto and Captain Hook among others who made a great fuss of the children, even Thomas who was a bit miffed at not having the promised birthday cake, but who being such a trooper, kept smiling anyway. We went on a few more rides, Pinocchio and the very freaky, even dystopian Snow White ride (more cuteness, less oppressive forests please!) before deciding we'd had enough. For much of the day, Duncan had been riding on my back. I'd considered hiring a pushchair, but decided to try to do without. It was clear however, that he'd benefit form having the refuge of a pushchair just as he often does at home. So Lady and E. went ahead of us while Gordon and I arranged the presumably simple task of hiring a pushchair. Not so. It took ages, and even when it was all arranged, when we were trying to leave, an employee at the exits wouldn't let us out with the pushchair without seeing our hire contract, which unfortunately Gordon hadn't been given. He had to go back and sort that out, which took yet more time. By then I was exhausted, cold, wet and wanted nothing more than a hot shower and a sit down. Eventually Gordon returned with the form, but Miss Prissy on the gate still didn't think it was right. So I unleashed just a small portion of pissed-off mammyness, and let her know that she  had  proof that we'd hired the chair, that my child is disabled and stressed out by the waiting around, that we wanted to leave and were within our rights to do so, so could you just let us the hell out! She complied, but was just a bit too stupid to move back far enough to let me push Duncan out, and I inadvertently rolled a wheel over her booted foot. I apologised profusely, while she rolled her eyes. And silly me, I was just so stressed out that I burst into tears. How embarrassing. Ah well, I got over myself soon enough and we got back to the hotel and met up with Lady and E. again. E. just wanted to stay in her room for the rest of the day, understandably, and she wasn't hungry having eaten at the tea party. Duncan and Thomas decided to have a bath, and a while later when we were all recharged a bit, we headed to McDonald's where they ate. When they were all in bed and asleep, E. looked after them all again, and Gordon and I went out for an hour to ourselves, a few drinks and surprisingly decent fajitas at the Planet Hollywood restaurant. So ended the second day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCAeeqF5YZI/AAAAAAAAAL0/aMd2sworDl4/s1600-h/IMG_3009.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCApvaF5YaI/AAAAAAAAAL8/nTWAd4U_bGQ/s1600-h/IMG_3013.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/disneyland-day-2.html", "title": "\nDisneyland Day 2\n"},
{"date": "3 Jul 2006", "body": "\nI went to Dublin with Gordon on Friday while my Dad looked after the 3 children. We took the train from Belfast and stayed in a really nice hotel on St Stephen's Green right in the heart of the city. It was a wonderful trip. The sun was shining both days, we walked round the park and ate ice-creams, we enjoyed several wonderful meals, we dandered up Grafton Street and Gordon bought a stack of Cd's while I found a 'grey spring' for Duncan (a metal slinky- so he can hold it on his bottom and bounce around pretending to be 'Zeebad') another slinky for Thomas and a tacky leprechaun-topped, shamrock-plastered pencil for Lady. She also got the newest Harry Potter DVD so she's happy. We jogged round the park on Saturday morning, though we had stayed out late the night before enjoying a few drinks and the buzz in Temple Bar. It had been a brilliant break. Even the train journey back was nice; watching the gorgeous scenery or reading the papers in comfort and quiet. And it was great to see the children again and to hear how much fun they'd had with their Granda. It all went wrong on Sunday though, another downturn on the roller coaster as a broken promise meant I was forced to let a friend and the children down. I went to my home town with Thomas and Lady and my Dad. My aunt had organised a memorial mass and meal at her house as it would have been my Mum's 60th birthday on July 2nd. It was a good chance to see aunts, uncles, siblings and cousins and all their offspring. Today, the children, guinea pigs and I are enjoying another warm day and ploughing through a big box of books from  The Book People . Thomas was reading some Oxford Reading Tree books and Duncan loves the  Little Red Train Adventure Playset , with maps, postcards and tickets and a clock all stuffed into paper satchels in the book. I'm living in interesting times.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.thebookpeople.co.uk/", "https://www.thebookpeople.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/productSearch_10001_10051_22019_100___10_SimpleSearch_2_1_2__basicSearch_"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/07/ups-and-downs.html", "title": "\nUps and downs\n"},
{"date": "6 May 2008", "body": "\nOn our last day, Gordon and Lady went off alone after breakfast to ride on Crush's Coaster. I'd expected them to be back before 11am to help me check out and leave our bags with the hotel. Also, shortly after they left E. told me that she didn't want to go into the park that day. She just wanted to stay around the hotel and take it easy. It was a bit inconvenient that she had no room to rest in, but she was content to remain in and around the hotel. Since Gordon wasn't back in time, I lugged the cases and the boys by myself and checked out. I had to leave a mobile phone with E. just so she wasn't entirely cut off, and I headed off to meet Gordon and Lady, waiting with the boys in the Videopolis for a further 40 minutes for them to arrive (they loved the coaster!) I was very grateful for the big screens showing cartoons while we waited! We ate lunch then decided to watch the live Lion King show. It was a shame that E. didn't feel up to coming out again because she would have loved it, but it's better by far that she knew her own limits and didn't try to push past them.  While waiting for the show Gordon and Duncan enjoyed watching Space Mountain again. \n \n \n \n \n On presenting Duncan's access card, we were shown to some great seats to watch the show. Thomas was not much interested claiming that it was too boring. Lady loved it; the Lion King is her favourite Disney film. Duncan really enjoyed it too, more than I'd have anticipated. He figured out who all of the characters were, and was excited when Simba ran up the aisle at the end and shook his hand! We decided to go on a few more rides, and ended up going on the Carousel, Pirates of the Caribbean (very long wait, the children did brilliantly) Casey Junior (yippee) Peter Pan, and Buzz Lightyear. I was astonished at how happy Duncan was at dealing with all this. Obviously, without the green card, it would have been impossible for him to deal with all but the shortest of queues. But the park was jammed with people, far busier than when we'd gone last year, and much worse weather too. We ended with the Tarzan show. Now I have a special place in my heart for the Tarzan film. Lady received the video when Duncan was born, and I always think of baby Tarzan as representing baby Duncan and some of the songs just get me all emotional. Duncan loves the film too, especially Jane in her yellow dress. I told him he'd see a real Jane and Tarzan and he was really exited. The show didn't disappoint. It started with gymnasts dressed as apes and monkeys, tumbling, swinging and bouncing. Thomas was again in a bit of a huff since he thought it wasn't interesting, so I tried to engage him in the gymnastics aspect of the show. Duncan recognised Kala, the mother gorilla and was delighted to see Jane and Tarzan, showing noisy appreciation of their swinging antics. There was a nice bit of audience participation when the children got to bash some metal plates. Lady was first to be asked to go up, and Duncan just ran after her and got stuck in. By then we had to return to the hotel and drive to the airport. Thankfully the taxi service was punctual this time, and we actually arrived more than 2 hours before the flight departed. Duncan was happy to be flying back and told me he likes Easyjet the best! The flight back was perfect. Having already experienced flying, Duncan was much less nervous. Back in Belfast we were at the end of the queue for passport control, since E. walked more slowly from the bus than other people. I stood for a while with my exhausted, squirming boy, before walking past the line, calling for help, and getting us all fast tracked out of there. Home at last. I was delighted at how well it had gone. We'd taken an 80 year old, and an autistic 7 year old and it had worked! Yes sure, as I'd known would happen, there were times when it wasn't going so well and one or more of us was tired and grouchy. But overall, a resounding success that we'll all remember for ever.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["rtsp://v5.cache1.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQkgID3NBfDhVRMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCB0L6F5YfI/AAAAAAAAAMk/AfuOYdyXKAU/s1600-h/IMG_3034.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SCB0OqF5YgI/AAAAAAAAAMs/SxYAafSFQhI/s1600-h/IMG_3036.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/disneyland-day-4.html", "title": "\nDisneyland Day 4\n"},
{"date": "12 May 2008", "body": "\nWarning; contains spoilers on Doctor Who episode 6! I do love Sunday mornings. It's the day when Gordon usually brings me breakfast in bed. I was trying to read the newspaper on-line (begone, days of piles of paper and newsprint rubbing off on the covers) but Duncan was snuggled beside me and kept taking over my laptop to look at films of roller coasters. I was chatting to him as he tried to poke my ears (that's a recently developed habit of his; he'll tell you he's trying to get the wax, yuck). I asked him about the episode of Doctor Who we'd all watched the previous night. That was a lovely time; all 5 of us on the sofa, both boys cuddling in to me. He said, \" The soldiers were shooting .\" And then what happened. \" Then the girl died. Doctor Who loves the girl. Doctor Who was sad...and happy .\" And then what... \"The girl went to Doctor Who.\" The show had been sad and happy, and that was a pretty good summary of the episode. So what better thing could a family proceed to on a Sunday morning than a trip to the rescue centre once more, where we picked out a puppy. Hopefully, subject to a home-check, we'll be adopting a Cocker Spaniel cross pup. We just thought we didn't have anything like enough going on in our lives already! For the rest of the day, the children played outside. Duncan's great joy right now is to ride a bike or scooter up and down along the path in front of our house. I need to be out to supervise him so I took a little film of his fun. Lady and Thomas spent the afternoon with their new friends from our street, in either their house or ours. Thomas in particular is delighted to have another boy to play Wii and Doctor Who games with. These are good days. Perhaps it's the good weather, perhaps the glow of a good holiday is still lingering, but for whatever reason we are happy together and Duncan is being just marvellous.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/sunday-morning.html", "title": "\nSunday Morning\n"},

Lady had drawn a beautiful card with a picture of her and me inside, and a mole wearing a miner's hat in a cave under us! Gordon baked a cake, his first ever, and very nice it was too. Duncan was anxious to try it. We gathered and sang happy birthday to me! Duncan covered his ears and with a very serious expression on his face, sang it as fast as he could. It was obvious that he considered the song a silly impediment to cake eating that had to be dealt with as quickly as possible! Gordon had bought me a DVD of  Curb your Enthusiasm ; yeah! It's the funniest, most painful thing I've watched for years, and I've only seen a few episodes, so I'm looking forward to watching the whole first series. In the evening, Gordon brought his Mum over and she stayed with the children (who were still all awake when we left) while we went out and enjoyed a great meal at a Malaysian restaurant. I'd been pensive and low for a few days previously, and I went out for a run on Saturday evening to get some peace and think. I realised that I'm a bit lonely. I  need more women friends. I want to travel more. I need to go out and dance more. So, I'm going to sort out a trip to New York to see my best friend from school days, while Gordon stays with the children. My Dad has also agreed to mind the children for 24 hours so I can go with Gordon to Dublin this Friday night. And I'm going to look for a dance class I can join, preferably Salsa!

Duncan was holding a new pig shaped eraser I had bought; it was his object of choice yesterday. He started telling me different words starting with the sound 'p', pig, pirate, puppy, Pippen, Percy and pants! He was very pleased with himself. Then his little voice was echoing every sentence as I read. Thomas was working out a few words for himself and labeled himself a great reader altogether! It's really nice that we can all enjoy books together now. Something amazing has been happening here recently; Duncan has started to expand the range of food he will eat. He has always been a  very  fussy eater. When he was less than a year old, I took him to the paediatrician who diagnosed 'failure to thrive' as he was so low on the weight charts they use to monitor babies. (Those charts have since been scrapped for use with breast-fed children). But he was well skinny and I was always trying to maximise his intake of calories, especially fat and protein. For years he has eaten stuff like spaghetti with butter, cheese and tomato ketchup (and don't you dare try to blend something more nutritious into the ketchup!) and cereals with milk. Oh, and as much chocolate, cake and sweets as he could get hold of. Now a few weeks ago he decided he wanted to try some fish fingers, having seen them on Charlie and Lola and he liked them. Then he saw Lady and me eating corn on the cob and reached out to try mine. I told him, 'It's corn, like on Pocahontas!' He said ' Home on the Range  corn!' then he started to eat, loved it and now eats it every day. Wow, he's actually eating some vegetables! He has also started to eat peas and onions, having first tried them from my plate as he sat on my lap as I ate dinner. It's a bit like the way the other children tried food from my plate when they were weaning! Now I need to go and help find 'Lego man,' that is, a 2cm high bit of red and yellow plastic. I reckon I spend about 2 hours each week looking all around the house for various very small plastic objects that Duncan has lost and desperately wants. I have regularly thought that if I could really perform just one spell from the Harry Potter books, it would be ' Accio ', the 'summoning charm'!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://usborne.com/farmyard_tales/farmyard_tales.asp", "http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/homeontherange/main.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/pigs-pants-and-nowpeas.html", "title": "\nPigs, pants and now...peas!\n"},

I bought a magnifying glass and they've all been going round the garden examining mini-beasts. As can be clearly seen here, Thomas is the only one of our 3 who inherited brown eyes from his dad. Don't know why the photo is on it's side though! He has been coming out with loads of snippets of 'Thomas-wisdom' lately. He asked me if elephants turn into mammoths in winter, wanted to know the ingredients for making brioche this morning, told my sister that she had better start looking for a nice husband soon so she'd have someone to bounce on the trampoline with (what?!), started calling some sweets Gordon bought 'god-stoppers', told me I needed to go back to bed this morning as we hadn't had our morning cuddle (the one which makes him 'so happy') and said it was a 'very serious situation'.

{"date": "23 May 2008", "body": "\n What follows, is a (poorly done) parody. I have something I need to share with all you parents of children with autism. I have stumbled on a brand new treatment for autism!!! It's AMAZING!!!!! Before I started this intervention, my son was having difficulties in all areas of development. He used to be unable to speak at all, couldn't use the toilet, was frequently having tantrums...you know the sort of terrible pressure us martyr parents have to cope with. If you have not walked in my shoes, then you can't comment. And high functioning, computer using people with autism are not like my son, so there!! But since starting the new nutritional therapy , it's like we have a different,  better  child!!! Duncan is so much calmer and more articulate. He is learning better every day and is really interacting with the rest of the family. Going to the supermarket has become much easier. He just learnt to ride a bike for the first time. He can understand more complex instructions. He has started to make lovely clay art. He is better able to express himself. His grandparents have all noticed the changes for themselves. They have remarked on how improved he is recently and  none of them knew about the new treatment !!!! It's like a miracle! I have been crying tears of joy to think that I have found a way to save my son from the grip of autism. You will be very keen to know what this wonderful food supplement is, and I will tell you  for free!!!   Astonishingly, all these things happened just because we switched the brand of tomato ketchup he uses, yes REALLY...it's all down to KETCHUP! Duncan loves his ketchup and smothers whatever he eats in the stuff so I started to buy a reduced salt and sugar version of our usual brand and that has made all the difference!!! Or...perhaps it was the bath water in the hotel at Disneyland. He had a bath every night we were there and all the improvements seem to stem from that time too. Perhaps there were healing properties in that water, sorta like Lourdes but with better rides... Or perhaps it's the modelling clay; manipulating it helps draw out the toxins that (as we all know) cause autism... Or is it to do with the change in the weather? We've been outdoors much more over the past few weeks and enjoying plenty of fresh air, sunshine and exercise. That might have had an effect... OK enough. It's  none  of those things, though the better weather certainly helps us  all  feel better. Duncan is just one of five people living here and is sensitive to the mood and affect of all the rest of us. He's growing up and developing all the time. He honestly has been doing great these past few weeks and other people have remarked on how calm, happy and chatty he is. It made me think about correlation and causation. I have read parent testimonials similar to what I wrote above and they always made me wonder how the author could be so sure that the effect they were describing was due to the intervention (homeopathy, nutritional supplements or diet changes, HBOT, etc.) applied. People are complicated. There are good reasons why testimonials, even multiple testimonials, do not make evidence. My children, all three of them, autistic and not, learn and develop every day, no miracles required.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/its-bit-like-miracle.html", "title": "\nIt's (a bit like) a Miracle!!\n"},

He has a good understanding of arithmetic, although until a few weeks ago, he'd never answered a written maths question. He has, however, spend ages counting the coins (and a few notes) in his Tardis money bank, he has played loads of board games, some card games, many hours worth of computer games. He has played with Lego and wooden bricks, Geomag and measuring cups. We have baked and weighed and measured as part of real life.

So when I wrote out a page of addition and subtraction sums, I just had to tell him what the plus and minus symbols represent, and he easily completed the questions correctly. Right away I was able to present him with more difficult sums. We often have discussions about numbers. For a long time he asked about the biggest number and asked how long it would take you to count to it, then was fascinated by the idea of infinity.  He asks about astronomical distances so I have to look them up and explain concepts like light years to him. He asked his Dad how long it would take to walk around the sun, so we looked up the numbers and showed him how to divide the distance by the speed to get the time taken, (approx. 1 million hours or approx 114 years, assuming you survive). Gordon has talked to them about  Graham's number  and the  Planck length  as examples of the largest and smallest numbers used in science. More usefully, we've mentioned how amazing it is that any number can be expressed using just 10 digits, (and why we use 10) but how they can also be written in other ways, like the Roman numeral system. Thomas has also been introduced to negative numbers and fractions. He asks how old I was when he was born, or what age he'll be when Lady is 18, and although I used to just tell him and explain how I worked it, now I get  him  to figure it out. He understands money, so it's a great tool in explaining concepts like place value. (He says he wants to be rich when he grows up, perhaps he will!) Looking at a catalogue recently, he remarked on how expensive the hot-tubs are (he and Lady covet these items; dream on, my children!). He said, \"it's ten thousand, four hundred and ninety nine pounds, that's nearly fifteen thousand pounds!\" He asked me on Wednesday how long before we went to his gymnastics class, and I said 1 hour and 15 minutes. He responded, \"OK, 75 minutes.\" He asked what time that would be so I told him, 3.15. He said, \"when both hands are at the 3.\" Yup, you've got it! He was helping me put the shopping away yesterday and he saw the box of eggs, and said, \"You bought 10 eggs.\" I asked him to count them, so he did, and acknowledged that there were actually 12 eggs. He started looking at them, grouping them with his hands, and told me that there were 2 groups of 6, then 4 groups of 3. I showed him the other multiples. It took about a minute, and he learned because he was noticing the patterns in the quantities for himself, and I was just there to help explain and confirm what he discovered. It's good to reflect sometimes, on how they're doing and to see the methods of learning we've adopted, working so well.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/05/maths-for-6-year-old.html", "title": "\nMaths for a 6 year old\n"},

We spent much time in the garden today and there was a lot of trampoline bouncing and bike riding. Duncan and I sat on a rug playing with a toy  Fizz  for a while. Duncan had her eating grass, which we laughed at. Then he decided to engage me in a game of 'chase-kiss'. The rules are simple, I run after him, then I kiss him! He just loves to be chased, especially if I climb into their playhouse and follow him down the slide (which was just  not  designed for grown lady hip widths!). He has much more energy than me though and I was glad when we just lay on the rug together for a while and cuddled.

We all had fun, though I was slightly freaked out when Duncan ran ahead of me when we were getting ready to leave, and I couldn't find him for a few minutes. Lady found him in the shop, helping himself to the pic-and-mix sweets. Oops. I told him that it is naughty to eat those sweets, he said 'sorry Mummy'. I'm sure he  really  meant it.  ;-) Lady went to her Granda's place and stayed over with her cousin for 2 nights She enjoyed some spoiling, courtesy of G. and had a lovely time. I heard that they were caught in the act of a midnight feast, albeit, a very healthy feast; they were eating a big bowl of shredded wheat cereal! I was so sad to learn on Saturday morning that my uncle had died suddenly. I feel so bad for my 4 cousins. Their mother (my Dad's sister) died 27 years ago when she was 28 and they were all small boys so they have no parents now. They were a very close family and they are devastated. My sister flew over from London and stayed with us on Saturday night.  Then we all drove to our home town on Sunday. There was a service at the parish cemetery where my Mum and grandparents are buried, and lots of the family gathered. Occasions like this bring out my latent Catholicism. It was nice to see the hundreds of people around their family graves, and the priest, who's a very nice man, spoke movingly about remembering our dead relatives and friends with love and pride. I had all the children with me, I was able to abandon Thomas and Lady to whoever was around while I stayed with Duncan. (my sister told me later that when the priest said 'the lord is risen...', Lady asked her 'is he talking about Voldemort?' :-o You see how latent my religion is?) Duncan was a bit overawed by the crowd, even though it was well dispersed. He disliked the loudspeaker too and covered his ears when there was singing. Since he was trying to eat a bag of crisps, I held my hands over his ears for him. When he was really restless, we left and walked down the road a bit where he played on a grassy slope. I was aware that people were looking at us because he was noisy and running around a lot. They may have been wondering why, perhaps thinking he was naughty or I was a bad parent. Or perhaps they were enchanted by Duncan's beauty! I did feel a bit weird, but I had wanted to go and I'm glad I did, even if I had a good run around at the same time. After tea at my lovely aunt G's house, Duncan went with my Dad while I took the other children and my sister out to see our Granny. She's just come out of hospital and she is very weak and tired and upset by her son-in-law's death. She kept saying 'I just want to die'. Bless that wonderful woman. It is so hard on her to watch so many people she loves leave her forever. We went to my uncle's house to see our cousins. I'm really fond of these cousins, though I don't see them often now. There were tears and laughter in the short time I was able to stay. The wake will be starting properly today, and the house will be full of people, night and day until the funeral on Wednesday. My sister stayed in town and I drove the children home, feeling tired and emotional. These are the things that happen though.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/things-that-happen.html", "title": "\nThings that happen\n"},
{"date": "1 Jun 2006", "body": "\nGordon has gone to a conference and will be away until Wednesday, yikes! The past few days he stayed off work to get organised and to spend some time with us before leaving. It's been frenzied as I managed to finish the DLA form, (with big thanks to D. for her input) and we bought loads of food to ensure I don't run out over the next few days; Duncan and supermarkets is  not  a good combination! I managed to visit the library by myself last night and now have loads of great books to keep me entertained in the long, bright evenings. I got a big book on Greek and Roman mythology; having read lots of references on Kristina's blog ' Autismland ', I wanted to know more. You see, blogging is educational! Duncan continues to care deeply about his image. I came home the other night to see him dressed as Zeebad. He was wearing a brown shirt, clinched at the waist with a brown belt. The outfit was accessorised with a brown toy arrow bag slung over one shoulder and a small brown handbag over the other shoulder. The best thing though was the 'hair'. He had stuck a long, thin bit of black plastic, encased at the top by a small gold ring, onto his hair with sticky tape! The character he was emulating is bald, apart from a black plait on the top of his head, bound by a gold ring. Thankfully, he changed to more standard attire when we all went to visit the open farm. Duncan was very,  very  excited. He was much more interested in the big, old farm dog than any of the other animals. He wasn't sure how to react to all this excitement and emotion spilling out of him so he ran and ran in a circuit. He would approach the dog, saying (as it was lying in the sun) 'Dog! Wake up dog!' Then he was a bit freaked out if the dog moved towards him. He was shouting,'I'm frightened! Dead!' followed by 'I want, pat the dog'. I lead him to the very good-natured animal, who was completely unperturbed by this shrieking boy, and showed Duncan how to stroke him. We spent most of the time at the farm making approaches, then retreating swiftly, from this dog. I was happy to hear Duncan run off to find Lady at one stage and tell her, 'Lady, dog! Come see dog. Pat dog!' She obliged, of course, and he was so happy to share this great experience with her. Thomas and Lady loved all the animals. Lady is so fond of animals and even when Thomas was playing on the slide and climbing frame, she was always sitting stroking a kid (the goat kind) or lamb or some rabbits or chatting to the donkeys. They both had a chance to bottle feed a lamb and hold a baby rabbit too. Duncan kicked up a fuss when it was time to leave which almost always happens when we go out. I'm not sure how to best help him to make the transition at these times. Today he woke up and came to my room, jumped into my bed and asked 'I want a dog, buy a dog'. Oh dear! Perhaps, he'd like a guinea pig instead!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/6c_1_b.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/trip-to-farm.html", "title": "\nA trip to the farm\n"},

The (not very good) photo was taken on her arrival in our house. She is possibly the cutest puppy on earth. We're making good progress with house training and she happily uses her crate both as bed and training aid. Duncan has a new special interest, the red Renault Clio car parked in the drive 4 houses up from ours. He wants me to buy it, or steal it, or just acquire it by any means necessary(!) and get rid of our blue Vauxhall. He keeps  going up to stand just outside their drive  looking at it. He's drawn it, and even downloaded a photo of a red Clio and changed its number plate on Paint to that of our neighbour's car.

He went up to his room and returned a few minutes later having removed all his clothes and replaced them with a nifty pair of red underpants and a navy blue t-shirt. I was not even aware at first that he was in costume, but he explained matters to me soon enough and he sought my assistance with the finishing touches; a strip was cut from a black bin liner and stuck to his pants, voila, a tail! Then I had to stick 2 white buttons to the front of his pants in just the right place. He then added a pair of white gloves and he was looking good, or so he thought as he preened in front of the mirror.

The next day, the hub will be closed in her memory. My son will be 6 in 17 days. He is beautiful, sweet, inquisitive, interesting, messy, gentle, troublesome, funny, very active and loving. He loves trains, playing chase, watching videos and rewinding them to see the best bits over and over, bouncing on his trampoline, baking and making a mess. He is a whiz on the computer and can always tell us what he wants and how he feels. When Duncan was 3 he was much the same, except he couldn\u2019t communicate his wishes so well and was frequently frustrated. But much more than that he was happy and learning and developing every day, like all other 3 year olds. This is Duncan aged 3. He was enjoying a tickle game with his Dad when this was taken. We went to Legoland on the day of his 3rd birthday when this photo was taken. Duncan was taking a break from the splash pool to chill in the buggy, eat some candyfloss and look at the Peter Pan book he carried round all day. Here's another Peter Pan themed photo taken last Christmas. He has since started to really enjoy dressing up and always customises the outfits to suit his own vision. This picture was taken on a  family day out on a steam train . All the children, but Duncan especially, really enjoyed the train. They are such good friends and Duncan plays with his siblings more than anyone else. I am so lucky to have them all. I am lucky to have a son like Duncan who has opened my eyes to so much. It has been a voyage of discovery for me. I am lucky that I realised myself that he is autistic when he was 2. I am lucky that the UK autism charity, the  NAS , promotes reasonable, realistic information about autism and not scaremongering. I am lucky that I was able to take part in an NAS  EarlyBird  course for parents of autistic children and gain a better understanding of how to connect with Duncan. I am lucky that my husband is intelligent, level headed and promptly put me right when I was briefly seduced by the dark side- the autism biomedical quackery. I am lucky that I didn't spend too long investiagating ABA before realising it was a totally unsuitable way for my son to learn. I am lucky that I didn't spend too long reading 'autism is hell' sites like CAN before coming across heart lifting, joyous places like  Oops...wrong planet . I'm lucky because I read  Jim Sinclair's  essay ' Don't mourn for us ' and found web sites by people like  Amanda Baggs  and  Michelle Dawson . I'm lucky that Duncan went to a wonderful nursery 4 mornings a week which he loved and whose staff were kind and helpful and I'm lucky that he is now learning at home with his family, living, loving and growing every day.

The Brownie promise still has the bit about \u2018serving my god and the queen and my country\u2019; blah. I can\u2019t help the hackles rising slightly at that queen bit.

Lady has been listening to the audio books and has almost finished the lot. She just came to the really emotional bit in \u2018The Half Blood Prince\u2019, so we had a big talk about that. Thomas was having his morning cuddle when he said \u2018dieing is bad isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I replied that it usually is, then he said that it wasn\u2019t so bad if you die at home and not outside because carpets are softer and you wouldn\u2019t hurt yourself. He\u2019s not quite got it yet. I\u2019ve been reading all these wonderful and moving posts on the Autism Hub marking the death of a 3 year old child.

{"date": "15 May 2006", "body": "\nLong time, no post. I\u2019m trying to remember the significant events of the past week. The best thing is that we have Gordon\u2019s Jamaican cousin staying with us for a long weekend. It\u2019s great having more family around. Lady and Thomas love her and she\u2019s so good and sits chatting with them for ages and playing snakes and ladders with Thomas. Duncan merely tolerates other people staying here. We\u2019ve split up to take her out to various tourist attractions. Duncan has stayed at home with either Gordon or me except when they all went for a long walk to the local beach. Yesterday everyone had a nice time; I went with the boys to a friend\u2019s birthday party while the others went to Carrickfergus Castle. They were well impressed with the castle and joined us at the party later for some good food and company, our kind of party! Today, I\u2019m staying at home with the boys while Gordon drives with the girls to the Giant\u2019s Causeway. It\u2019s a wet, miserable kind of day so they\u2019ll be seeing it in its natural state! I took Thomas to see the GP on Friday. We had a long wait around due to a mix-up by the receptionist, but Thomas was busy playing with a little boy then a little girl. He chatted away to her and to her mother and found out all he could about them. They were so cute together, especially when she took him by the hands and started dancing around and singing with him. He was happy to play along; after all, she  was  only 3! I managed to let her Mum know about home-ed too, she was interested especially as her daughter has Down Syndrome and it\u2019s good to know there\u2019s an alternative to fighting the system to get an appropriate education for your special child. So we saw the GP and Thomas had 2 vaccinations; 2nd MMR and a Meningitis one. Just before this the GP checked his testes and Thomas giggled and said (oh so clearly) \u2018Oh, I like that part\u2019. He was most unhappy about the jabs though and called the GP a stupid doctor and said he was completely fed-up. Poor wee man. We had a quick visit with the health visitor next. They do a 4 year check here so we played along. Thomas started building the blocks into a tower and counting them before the HV finished saying hello to me. She asked him if he knew any letters and he proceeded to spell his name phonetically. She asked about school and nursery and wondered how I would cope with more than one at home. She was even more surprised when I told her Duncan wasn\u2019t at school anymore. She asked if he was seeing any professionals and what they thought of this. I told her how the clinical psychologist though it was great! HA! The other BIG news is that we had an important delivery on Monday- Zeebad has arrived, praise all that\u2019s good! Duncan immediately latched onto a new requirement \u2013 Henrietta the coach. It is never ending. Ah well, he\u2019s been very happy with Zeebad and has carried him everywhere. I had a nice present too, I asked him for a kiss one day, so he kissed me then turned away murmuring, as if it was an afterthought, \u2018love you Mummy\u2019. I think it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s said that without hearing me say it to him first. It\u2019s nice anyway and made me smile :-).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/05/catching-up.html", "title": "\nCatching up\n"},

It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s had any kid of outside formal assessment. It\u2019s been a lovely day and we\u2019ve just played about in the garden. The trampoline was a great purchase.

I went food shopping last night with Lady and spent too much money, but at least we have loads of nice fresh food to keep us going. (I made our 1st Greek salad of 2006 for lunch; sunny days make me crave salad.) It was hard last week when Gordon was away for 4 days at a conference. Duncan was going on and on (and on\u2026) about that toy he wants and I knew it would be a disaster to take him to the shop when he had it on his mind so much. I considered asking my Dad to come over to look after them for a while so I could dash out and get what we needed, but Duncan would have been so cross if I\u2019d not come home with what he wanted. He asked me to draw a series of pictures, identical to those I drew when we went to Italy to explain what would be happening. He is using this method now to describe what he wants to happen! Anyway. I managed to buy a Zeebad on ebay so I hope it comes soon. I\u2019ve really heard enough about that now! As I was writing, Duncan opened the big window in our dining area which is at the front of our house. He then stood half-way out on the window sill and when I turned to call him inside, I saw that he was peeing out the window. I wonder if any of the neighbours noticed that one?! (He broke a TV once by climbing on its back; he liked to watch the screen by hanging over it and looking at it upside-down, and while in this position, he peed and it broke with a fizzle and a pop.

{"date": "9 Jul 2008", "body": "\nAutism is discussed in today's Time;  Fringe Autism Treatment Stirs Debate.  In the opening sentence, chelation therapy for autism is described as voodoo medicine: Pressured by desperate parents, government researchers are pushing to test an unproven treatment on autistic children, a move some scientists see as an unethical experiment in voodoo medicine. Several times the writer highlights the lack of evidence for chelation as beneficial to autistic people. There is a quote from a believer mum, who reckons chelation helped her five year old son settle at school, followed up with;  There is no way to prove whether chelation made a difference or whether Charlie simply adjusted to the school routine. Get that, a journalist pointing out the difference between causation and correlation! National Institute of Mental Health director, Dr. Thomas Insel, is said to support investigation of this potentially dangerous (one fatality) absurdly irrelevant (to autism) form of intervention; But many parents of autistic children are believers, and the head of the National Institute of Mental Health supports testing it on children provided the tests are safe. \"So many moms have said, `It's saved my kids,'\" institute director  said.   The moms may have said it, but that doesn't make it so. Apart from causing the death of a five year old boy, here's a bit more about what chelation can do, followed by a quote from someone who actually seems to have ethical qualms about subjecting children to such unnecessary and potentially painful and risky drugs. One of the drugs used for chelation, DMSA, can cause side effects including rashes and low white blood cell count. And there is evidence chelation may redistribute metals in the body, perhaps even into the central nervous system.    \"I don't really know why we have to do this in helpless children,\" said Ellen Silbergeld of Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was invited to comment on the study to a review board of the national institute.   Well said, Ellen Silbergeld. The glut of quackery associated with autism is described: Frustrated parents use more than 300 alternative treatments, most with little or no scientific evidence backing them up, according to the Interactive Autism Network at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Md.   \"With a lot of mothers, if they hear about a treatment, they feel like they need to try it,\" said project director Dr. Paul Law. \"Anything that has a chance of benefiting their child, they're willing to give it a shot.\"     What about the fathers? I'm shocked at that attitude of \"sure let's give it a go anyway\" that is described here. Many of these quack therapies have known risks: HBOT, chelation, massive doses of vitamins, not to mention the distress caused to the poor children forced to put up with them and the expense of consultations with the in-for-profit quacks, the useless and biased tests they order and the equally useless treatments they advise. More than 2% of the children tracked by the project use chelation. If that figure holds for the general population, it would mean more than 3,000 autistic children are on the treatment at any time in the United States.     Many of the parents who approve of chelation (and are there really as many as 3000 autistic children in the US suffering this treatment?) are at best distrustful of vaccines or an worst raving anti-vaccine loons. How do they reconcile the cognitive dissonance of administering drugs with known and common side effects with their fear of vaccines which have an extremely low risk of side effects? The potential danger of a chelation trial is further explained: But the study was put on hold for safety concerns after an animal study, published last year, linked DMSA to lasting brain problems in rats. It remains under review, Insel told the AP.   Insel said he has come to believe after listening to parents that traditional scientific research, building incrementally on animal studies and published papers, wasn't answering questions fast enough.    \"This is an urgent set of questions,\" Insel said. \"Let's make innovation the centerpiece of this effort as we study autism, its causes and treatments, and think of what we may be missing.\" The drug they want to study caused brain damage in animal models, but Dr Insel wants to push on regardless?! He says he's worried that they're going at this too slowly. Don't ethics matter with autistic people? My husband has told me of the difficulty he has getting ethical approval for trials of therapies for people with a fatal form of cancer. Even in people who have no hope of survival, the ethics committees block trials and take their role of protecting patients with cancer seriously. Autistic children deserve nothing less. Interestingly, indigo/autism healer/model/actress/Google Uni PhD/vaccine campaigner Jenny McCarthy, who has many times claimed that her son has been \"recovered\" from autism, has now said she will have him chelated.  \"A lot of people are scared to chelate ... but it has triggered many recoveries,\" she said.     And she's been on Google for ages so she knows. Addendum Here are a few other posts about this topic: Respectful Insolence Autism Vox Left Brain/Right Brain Science-Based Medicine And a comment from  HCN  on Kristina's post that highlights something important;       Wouldn\u2019t it be useful to do a matched pair experiment design, which would involve also chelating a bunch of \u201cnormal\u201d kids? Would the (very real) risk of chelating be too much to endanger these \u201cnormal\u201d kids?   In that case, why would it be acceptable to to endanger the health of the autistic kids?            Why not indeed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1821191,00.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/medical_ethics_children_and_chelation.php", "http://www.autismvox.com/chelation-study-put-on-hold/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=922", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=164", "http://www.autismvox.com/chelation-study-put-on-hold/#comment-428499"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/chelation-and-autism-in-time.html", "title": "\nChelation and autism in Time\n"},

When I\u2019m looking back on this on 5 years time, will I be glad I\u2019ve written a bit about my children and what they\u2019re getting up to, or will I regret the time I didn\u2019t tidy up my room after Duncan trashed it looking for a toy  Zeebad  that he has convinced himself I\u2019m hiding there? You see, I can justify this! So, we went to Sligo on Saturday. The journey was fine. Lady listened to Harry Potter on an MP3 player while Thomas watched a Barney DVD on a player we had in the car. My brother and L have a beautiful house in a nice little town. I\u2019m so pleased for them. Their daughter was 4 two days before Thomas so they had a joint party. The bouncy castle they\u2019d hired wasn\u2019t used much since it was raining heavily, but the children all had a great time. 3 out of 4 of my brothers were there with their families and my sister had flown over from London for the weekend (hiya Mavis ;-)), so it was a great gathering of the clan too! We stayed the night at my older brother\u2019s house. Lady and Thomas enjoyed playing with his daughters (aged 4 and 2 and oh so cute). It was just a nice, happy way to spend the weekend. When I got home, Duncan was so pleased to see us. Gordon had been busy sorting out the house; putting pictures up and cooking and he\u2019d even washed the carpet on the stairs. It had been horribly dirty. They\u2019d gone to Belfast on the train and Duncan even had a new wooden Percy. You can never have too many Percys you know! While I\u2019ve been doing what I do best (procrastinating) the children have been busy learning in their own way. Lady has been listening to her Harry Potter and has read some of the book too. She was also reading a book we had about English kings and queens. But mostly she\u2019s been drawing pictures and practicing her handwriting. We keep getting little love notes as she\u2019s so happy about her new, fancy, joined-up writing.  Duncan is absolutely obsessed with having a Zeebad toy. I\u2019m going to get one on ebay; where else could you find a toy that was given away in Rice Crispies boxes a year ago. He was Googling for it and wrote it from memory himself! He also wrote \u2018trnpercy\u2019 yesterday on Google, meaning \u2018train Percy\u2019. He knew that he\u2019d get too many false hits if he wrote \u2018Percy\u2019 only. I\u2019ve been trying to encourage him to type more on the computer. I think he will learn to write and read together. Thomas has been learning more letter sounds. The phonics approach works well for him. We read the 1st story on Starfall yesterday together;  Zac the Rat . Right, Duncan is just making me a cup of tea (pouring cold water from the kettle into the teapot) and admiring his reflection in the curved surface of the steel teapot.

I took some tea out to the couple doing the work and we had a chat. I explained about Duncan (when he tried to lift the massive chainsaw) that he doesn\u2019t understand much language as he\u2019s autistic. I was surprised at the woman's reaction; she asked if I was able to cope and did I have family to help me out enough. I told her we managed fine and the children all get to see their grandparents quite often. A while later the man mentioned the shocking incident in England where a woman is said to have killed her son and then herself on the Humber Bridge. I was really pissed off at the way that story was reported at the time in a way that made it seem as though it was the boy\u2019s autism (Fragile X really) that caused these 2 deaths and not the woman\u2019s mental illness. I was glad they were able to see Duncan running around having loads of fun with their beautiful Husky dog, which they brought round in the afternoon. It might help change the false perception of autism that the media usually portrays. We went to W5 on Wednesday and met up with another family. We all had a great time as usual. Duncan loved his lunch of unlimited ice-cream at Pizza Hut, while the rest of us had the more standard piles of pizza and salad.

{"date": "16 Jul 2008", "body": "\nOn Saturday, having given sufficient time for her vaccinations to take effect, we took Pippi out for the first time. We went to a playground, and the children played while I walked about letting her sniff and explore her suddenly expanded universe. Then, since the sun always seems to shine on the twelfth of July, we went to the beach. Pippi loved it. She tried to make friends with/harass a couple of tiny but ancient dogs we encountered, who had no interest in the feisty pup. I took Lady and Thomas to meet up with all the rest of my clan on Sunday as my newest niece underwent the traditional ritual of baptism. This time, Duncan stayed at home with Gordon to look after Pippi. They enjoyed a peaceful day together and went on another massive bike ride. I enjoyed a peaceful day too. Unlike when I'm at an event with Duncan, I was able to relax and chat without having to be constantly aware of where the children are and what they're doing. Lady did her usual Pied Piper thing and Thomas had a blast with his buddies. My niece A. came to spend a few days with us. She's over a year older than Lady and they get on well. Knowing A's propensity to seek and rescue injured wild animals, bringing them home to recover, the only rule I stipulated was that she brought no animals to our house. Monday was a holiday here. We went to the Transport Museum, which was a whole lot busier than when we usually go during school term time. As ever, Duncan enjoyed playing on the steam trains. In the picture, he's putting \"coal\" (handfuls of dust and stones) that he scraped from the bottom of the bunker into the \"fire\". He pulled the levers and adjusted the boiler, he checked the pressure and applied the brakes, his detailed commentary going all the while. We all headed to the air travel section and all bar Duncan and I went in the flight simulator ride. Duncan jumped into the open door of the cockpit on the chopped-in-half bit of aeroplane. I took a quick sneaky photo before asking him to leave, because usually that door is closed and there's a \"do not enter\" sign on it. But he loved his minute behind the controls, saying he was the pilot of \"Thunderbird number 2.\" We headed over to the Folk part of the museum, and wandered around the countryside area, the girls being most interested in seeing some animals. They were more excited than I'd have thought appropriate when they spotted some sheep, then they spend 10minutes stroking a scrangly cat, and feeding a couple of horses and gooking at a few chickens. The olden day houses couldn't compete. They did like the jail room in the police station. So what delights did Tuesday bring? Well, we all headed off to the funfair. I left everyone with Gordon for a few minutes while I found a cash machine, and by the time I came back, the girls had \"won\" 3 teddies and a goldfish. See how well my \"no animals\" rule was adhered to! I didn't think they gave fish out at fairs any more. It seems cruel to me, all those children clutching plastic bags of fish. I wonder how many are alive at the end of the day, the fish, I mean. I asked A. if she's swap the fish for a toy, but no, she had already bonded with it. When they wondered what to call it, I suggested Awkward, but they changed that to Aqua. I put it in the car, cause we couldn't exactly carry it around all day, or take it onto the rides. Anyway, post-fish incident, we all went on  few rides. Gordon and Duncan went on the dodgems and he loved it! I took him on the Twister (the swizzy double turning one) and we both screamed with delight as he was squashed against me. Thankfully, my knowledge of physics (!) meant I had chosen the squashee position; could you imaging my bulk pushing poor, wee, skinny Duncan?! The girls were very brave and went on the MadMouse (Duncan's favourite to watch), the Shock Wave and the fast turning Big Wheel. Thomas enjoyed the bouncy slide, helter skelter (he was to scared last year) and the Caterpillar Coaster. All in, we enjoyed the day. We stopped off for hot dogs, a few groceries and fish food. Contrary to my expectations, Aqua, who was transferred into my largest glass mixing bowl when we got home, is still alive today and seems to be well.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SH3TjtaQpbI/AAAAAAAAASE/XXTMFY19l74/s1600-h/IMG_3323.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SH3TkKJ9xhI/AAAAAAAAASM/ur9Raqjwqps/s1600-h/IMG_3334.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SH3TkVmaGTI/AAAAAAAAASU/8w5-pPamkqs/s1600-h/IMG_3351.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/some-awfully-big-adventures.html", "title": "\nSome awfully big adventures\n"},
{"date": "20 Jul 2008", "body": "\n Channel 4 news  on Monday 14th July, reported on an autistic child called Ben Haslam and his parents, who say their Local Authority (LA) of Bedfordshire is forcing them to decide whether Ben should be taken into care to provide him with the services and education he needs. Ben has been thriving at an independent, residential school. He has made fantastic progress and is much happier and his parents, who have already spent more than \u00a360,000 in legal costs to have Ben's needs met, were delighted. His mum's face really shone when she said, It's a pleasure to have him around, it really is. However, even though the Haslams won their case to have Ben educated at that school, the Local Authority stopped funding his place at the end of last week, having overturned the earlier court decision forcing them to pay for his placement, at the High Court. The Haslams were forced to defend their position, but having lost, now must cover the LA's costs as well as their own. John Friel, barrister to the Haslam family, says the case raises \"important issues about parental rights and the use of voluntary powers\" and that autism and parental rights charities \"will be extremely concerned by this\" The LA say that the \u00a3250,000 cost of Ben's residential school entailed \"unreasonable public expenditure.\" They postulate that Ben's needs can be met by attending the local LA run special school and living in a children's home, costing them \u00a3125,000. Effectively, they are giving the parents just one option; put your son into care. They cite a section of the 1989 Children Act, whereby a child can be taken into voluntary care, if the parents agree. The LA claim that this \"does not remove parental rights but promotes partnership in meeting a child's needs.\" John Friel ends by saying the council's attempt to impose a voluntary care order on good parents, \"is objectionable both morally and politically.\" He is right. This whole thing stinks. Ben was being failed by his LA run special school, and in common with a very small number of children, needed the level of care and consistency provided by the residential school. It's absolutely crazy to consider that a child with Ben's difficulties will manage in a children's home. He would be miserable. It would undo all that he has achieved in the past year. His parents must not be forced to  make \"voluntary\" arrangements to put him in care. The LA staff who came up with this plan to save them a bit of money, obviously care nothing for this child or his family. They are squeezing them emotionally and financially. Ben's parents have been forced to give up their life savings, and now to pay the LA legal costs too! Then they are expected to give up their parental rights and in exchange see their beloved son fail in a system that cannot possibly meet his needs. I'll be writing to the NAS about this. I'm not sure what else to do. I could contact my MP too. If anyone has any ideas of how we can support Ben and his family, and stop this attempt to erode our parental rights, please leave a comment. There is more coverage of this at  Left Brain/Right Brain  and (I've just discovered)  Action for Autism . As Mike mentions, there are some very interesting comments on the  BBC Ouch boards  too, including a few from a Bedforshire LA employee.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/education/autistic+boy+forced+out+of+school+and+into+care+as+council+stops+funding/2336477", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=934", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2008/07/20/the-case-of-ben-haslam/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/mbouch/F2322273?thread=5666635"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/ben-haslam-erosion-of-parental-rights.html", "title": "\nBen Haslam; erosion of parental rights in the UK\n"},
{"date": "18 Jul 2008", "body": "\nI've had better mornings. There was a knock at the door, and I spied the postman through the glass. Thinking he had a parcel or something to be signed, I opened the door and saw Duncan standing alongside him. I had seen him only a few minutes earlier. The front door was locked, but he had obviously gone out unnoticed through the garage, left open after Lady fed her guinea pigs. Postie asked, \"Is he your son?\" I was tempted, but honesty won, \" Yes. Is everything all right ?\" \"He was trying to get into my van. He was trying to get a parcel\" Oh shit. Look sorry, I know I don't swear here (often) but sometimes it's apt. He must have been scooting up and down the street until he noticed the van parked at the top of the road. (Duncan muttered, \"Get Ertl break-down train in brown parcel.\") \" Oh no, I am so sorry! Was anything damaged? \"No, but he wouldn't listen to me when I told him not to.\" \" Look, he's autistic, he didn't understand. I'm really sorry. \" \"Now if anyone sees him getting into the van they could call the police. The police would get involved.\" What! I've just told you he's autistic, he's a little kid, he thought there was a toy in there for him, you're a big man, you can keep him out. And surely you lock the bloody van when you're not in it! Get the police involved! Like they have nothing better to do than write up reports on small disabled boys. \" I understand. I'm sorry. \" That's it, just suck it up. I should have known for sure where he was, the little Houdini. \"Just talk to him will you, try to explain that he can't do that.\" \" Yes I will, sorry .\" When he went I glowered at the child and gave him a stern talking to. I know he likes post vans; I've seen him look up Google images for  Royal Mail van . But it was still an unexpected transgression, not something I'd known I'd have to prevent. He was very worried at the mention of the police, which he'd overheard and asked repeatedly that the \"police not take Duncan away.\" I reassured him that he was safe, that the police help children, and they only take away very bad big men and women. I was glad to be getting out that afternoon. I took the children, including cousin A. on the train to see their Granda and G in Belfast. I dumped them on the grandparents (such good people as they are) and snuck out to meet Gordon for a late lunch. Oh the bliss of being away from all the little darlings for a while. We went to Japanese place called Sakura and had fantastic sushi for next to nothing. Lovely! Meanwhile, the children had a BBQ and went to the park, although Duncan refused to leave the car having decided that he  needed  to go to the toy shop. Home later, to a puppy delighted to see her pack return.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/raider-of-brown-package.html", "title": "\nRaider of the Brown Package\n"},
{"date": "23 Apr 2006", "body": "\nIt\u2019s been another bad day. We all went to the zoo and it didn\u2019t work out so well. Perhaps I should have learnt my lesson at the aquarium last week, but when I saw it was a sunny day, I suggested we all go out again. We\u2019ve visited the zoo before, and although it has involved lots of running after Duncan and some crying from him about buying ice-cream from the shop, it was OK. Not so today. Firstly, it was very crowded and then there was a bloody ice-cream van right by the playground. We decided right away to split up, I was to stay with Duncan for half an hour while Gordon went with Lady and Thomas, then we were to swap. But it was all I could do to keep my boy away from the ice-cream van. I didn\u2019t want to buy one right away (I didn\u2019t have any money left either) but so many other people were eating ice-cream that he just couldn\u2019t get it out of his mind. He wasn\u2019t interested in the playground or the animals. When we all met up again, we walked about together for a bit. Duncan was unhappy and I had to carry him on my back most of the time. Then Thomas was in a really whiney mood too and I didn\u2019t have the physical or emotional energy to help him while dealing with Duncan. So we split up again. I was going to just go back to the car with Duncan and let Gordon take the others around to see the animals. Then Duncan started to notice what was around him and was really enjoying the animals. We spent ages looking at the sea-lions and penguins. He kept running from one enclosure to the other; they\u2019re adjacent and there\u2019s quite a steep slope on the path between them. I marvelled at his energy as he raced up and down this path. He was singing a penguin song he\u2019d heard on the computer. He splashed about for a bit in a mucky puddle (before I caught up with him) and was saying \u2018Dr Foster went to Gloucester\u2019! We saw the bears next; there was Daddy bear, Mummy bear and baby bear, so he was looking in the enclosure to find Goldilocks! After a while we went back to the car to wait for the others. I was exhausted as I was always either running after him or carrying him on my back and the zoo is very hilly, and he\u2019s getting heavier. He\u2019s skinny, but not  that  skinny! Lady had a wonderful time and Gordon told me they\u2019d seen so much together and he was really impressed at how much she knew about the different animals. Duncan cried and shouted the whole way home for ice-cream. Gordon was really fed up and wanted to ask about my \u2018plans\u2019 for Duncan, now that I\u2019ve decided to educate him myself. He thinks I give in to Duncan\u2019s crying requests too easily. I probably do. He said that I\u2019ve become too accepting of Duncan\u2019s condition and says I need to train him up somehow to cope better in more situations. He reckons that Duncan is a virtual prisoner and he\u2019s just getting worse and he doesn\u2019t know how to react to anyone but me- and the same for Thomas.  He suggested again that Lady and Thomas would be better off at school getting an \u2018ordinary\u2019 education. We have this same talk all the time. I have to talk about the benefits of what we\u2019re doing for everyone  so  many times. He has  always  concluded by agreeing with me.  But perhaps ordinary will have to do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/04/so-close-to-giving-this-up.html", "title": "\nSo close to giving this up\n"},
{"date": "21 Jul 2008", "body": "\nI hadn't heard of  Wall-E  until seeing the trailer when I took Lady and Thomas to see  Prince Caspian  at the cinema. Wow! How had I missed it? It was clearly a masterpiece, and I was very keen to watch it. So we headed off to an early screening on Saturday, hoping the cinema would be less busy then, which it was. I loved the film; beautiful, touching, hopeful. Duncan sat enthralled for almost all of it, getting a bit jittery towards the end. I did prefer the beginning too, the unspoken action easily understood by everyone, including little autistic boys. But the closing credits brought a few tears to my eyes. On the spur of the moment, we headed to the  Lisburn swimming pool  yesterday morning. We've been once before, years ago, and only went this time as our local pool, where I bring the children during term times, doesn't open until 2 on Sundays. We took a wrong turn and had to drive around the  city  (titter) before finding the place. Gordon and I took turns to tail Duncan. There are slides and whirlpools and a river thing and pirate ships. It's a great place and we all had a blast. Duncan was too scared to go around the river at first, but as usual, when he felt ready he gave it a go, clinging to my back (and neck, ouch) like a limpet, then increasing in bravery, just holding the tips of my fingers, then telling me to move away altogether. We spent the last half of our time there just floating round and round in the current. Back home, Gordon cooked; Johnny cakes (adapted recipe, with turmeric and garlic) with callaloo and salt-fish. There are advantages to being part of a \"mash-up\" family. We took Pippi for a walk, in behind the train tracks, there's a beautiful woodland path leading back home though a small grove of young oak trees. We only discovered the place a few months ago. Duncan recited \"Going on Bear Hunt\" as we walked, and Pippi revelled in the smells and sights, bounding with joy and enthusiasm until we got back on the road when she just gave up and had to be coaxed back. Before bed, and dressed in pyjamas and wellies, sporting yellow goggles from the dressing-up box, and (for reasons known only to himself) an Indian feather head-dress, Duncan declared he was Wall-E and that he needed some rubbish to clear.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lisburncity.gov.uk/lagan-valley-leisureplex/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/wall-e-water-and-wooded-walks.html", "title": "\nWall-E, water and wooded walks.\n"},

He made burgers using some bread dough I\u2019d made earlier and as I told him, it was the tastiest burger I\u2019d ever eaten. I know it was also his way of trying to patch things up and get good feeling back in the family. He went out to PC World next (I wrote that previous post then) and came home feeling much better about things, having had time to think. I\u2019m not sure why he often feels so ambivalent about home-education, for Lady in particular. When this has happened before (many times) we always talk it out and he always ends up staunchly pro-home-education. He doesn\u2019t have the insights I do regarding the children nor sees what amazing steps they take every day. I tell him, but it\u2019s not the same. He doesn\u2019t spend time with other small children so doesn\u2019t know what is age appropriate. But he was telling me that when he was with Lady and Thomas at the zoo, he was so impressed with her reading ability as she read and understood the information signs about the animals to Thomas. We\u2019ve decided that we should take the children out separately sometimes. He loves taking Lady to Ju-Jitsu most Saturdays and they usually visit his Mum afterwards and it\u2019s a really nice outing for them both.

Earlier I was listening to him playing with a few toy men; \u2018you NASTY man, you are so grumpy. I have a happy face. You have a grumpy face. You are HORRIBLE.\u2019 I wonder what that was all about\u2026? I went for another run the other night. It was lovely. I went to the park, followed the burn (stream) to the sea and then walked along the beach alone listening to the wind and waves and birds. Gordon goes to the council gym and thought I might enjoy that too. But I much prefer to go away by myself somewhere quiet, instead of a gym with noisy machines and 5 big TV screens. I need some screen-free time! My \u2018little\u2019 bother C came for a visit yesterday with his girlfriend and her 3 year old son. My Dad came with them. The boys had so much fun playing together. Uncle C is big and strong so is great at picking up small children and swinging them up over his head and generally tossing them about in a way that Duncan just adores! Lady wishes she wasn\u2019t too big for all that. Duncan enjoyed lots of chase games and our little visitor was right at home, since he loved playing in the boys\u2019 toy car outside. We all went to the beach for a while too and as expected my children had socks and shoes off and paddled in the cold sea. Thomas came to inform S, my brother\u2019s girlfriend, that her little boy had fallen and needed help. He said \u2018your son has fallen down\u2019 in his formal little serious voice. Thomas fell himself too and bumped his forehead on our wooden bench. He got a huge bump and a little cut. When he saw it in the mirror, he was very pleased to have a scar on his forehead, just like, well who else, \u2018Hairy Potter\u2019!  Oh I have to describe what my crazy daughter is doing; she came in wearing a yellow bath towel over her head, and yellow rubber gloves on her hands  and  feet, while Thomas was wearing blue rubber gloves.

He cut his knee a little earlier and wanted a plaster on the little wound. A while later he was pulling the wrappers off a few more yellow plasters and sticking them onto his brown belt. I asked him not to rip open the plasters, but then I realised he was making a golden buckle on his belt so he looked even more like Robin Hood!

{"date": "11 Apr 2006", "body": "\nYesterday was dry and sunny and in the morning, Duncan was sitting outside, dressed as the handsome prince and examining a collection of trains and drawings. He looked so content. I thought about how different it would be if he was still going to school. He\u2019d have been forced into a school uniform and onto a bus at 8 am, and then made to engage in activities that held little or no interest or relevance to him. Oh, I\u2019ve just remembered; on Sunday I was having a lie in and he came into my room, kissed my cheek and ran out saying \u2018handsome prince!\u2019 When he came back a while later I asked if I was the sleeping princess and he said yes, then I asked who everyone else was. He told me that Thomas was the fairy, Lady was the king and Gordon was the horse! We had friends over to visit in the afternoon. I had a lovely time sitting around, drinking tea and chatting. Oh and I enjoyed watching a beautiful smiling baby, content in his Mummy\u2019s arms. The children all enjoyed themselves too, even if Thomas was a bit judgemental about D\u2019s hair! Duncan was happy when he saw the boys come to the front door and he wanted to cuddle D when she came in, though that may have been partly because she had a bag of food he wanted to investigate! Later when Gordon came home from work, Thomas told him about his day, \u2018my friends were here and A. (the baby) was here and you missed him,\u2019 which was obviously the most important thing for him. We had yummy roast chicken for dinner and after the children were in bed, we watched \u2018Annie Hall\u2019. I\u2019d forgotten how utterly funny and sweet and wonderful it is! We\u2019re having another quiet day. Thomas has been doing what he calls his work, which is, playing CD ROMs. He spent ages playing a \u2018learn to read with Clifford\u2019 game, and was doing really well at sounding out the letters for 3 letter words. He also played \u2018Jojo in number land\u2019 and is now onto \u2018Adiboo\u2019 a strange but fun music game. Duncan has been focusing on rockets again today. He has asked me to draw pictures of \u2018Barney\u2019s rocket\u2019 (it features in their \u2018Barney in outer space\u2019 video) over and over. I must have drawn 10 of these by now! I was getting a bit fed up drawing the same thing so many times, (though I\u2019ve been instructed to make some alterations on the recent batch) but I figure he must  need  to do this right now. He can\u2019t explain what benefit he derives from it, but there\u2019s obviously something meaningful going on. Perhaps sometime later on, he\u2019ll look back at this and tell me what it was. I also wonder what causes his great desire to acquire new Thomas the Tank Engine trains. He\u2019s gone beyond needing the different characters so he can emulate the stories we read or that he watches. He now wants me to get the various types of each train produced by the different manufacturers. In this case, completing the collection seems to be his motivation. Thankfully he hasn\u2019t discovered the Hornby collection yet. At a cost of \u00a320 or more per engine, he can buy those for himself when he\u2019s grown up, if he\u2019s still interested! Lady has been going through a BBC Spark Island Maths book and longingly reading a Disney World holiday brochure with Thomas. I sent off for the free DVD because I knew Duncan would enjoy the footage of roller coasters and other rides.

{"date": "21 Apr 2006", "body": "\nIt\u2019s been nearly a week since I last blogged. Gordon was off work so we\u2019ve been hanging out together with the children and I\u2019ve not been at the computer so much. It was a nice Easter week. Gordon has done most of the cooking so we\u2019ve eaten well, and we\u2019ve had a few outings, some more successful than others! We had a really good day here on Easter Sunday. We sorted out the garden a bit in the morning and the children liked their presents of new mugs, windmills and a few mini chocolate eggs. My Dad, Step Mum and Gordon\u2019s Mum all came over for lunch. The food was delicious, and it was just a lovely, relaxing day. The children enjoyed the company too. Thomas told me at one stage, \u2018I like visitors. Is this my party? Am I four now?\u2019 My wee sweetie! He also demonstrated his \u2018magic\u2019 by repeatedly hiding things behind his back, them using his powers to make them reappear, to the astonishment (hmm) of his audience. Lady did a fair bit of showing off too and read out a story she\u2019s written, \u2018The Witch Tale\u2019. Duncan loved all the attention and games and best of all, chocolate! On Monday we went to Downpatrick to ride in a real steam train. It was magic. The journey lasted only 15 minutes, then we got out to watch the engine turn and re-couple. This was a most exciting endeavour involving lots of steam and whistle-blowing and men down on the tracks clanging bits of metal. Duncan\u2019s little face was a picture of pure joy. We then chuffed back to the station, crossing a bridge and waving to the people in canoes and the man driving a tractor. Duncan was singing and smiling and calling \u2018hello\u2019 to anyone we saw. There was a little shop at the station selling, oh god no, \u2018Daniel\u2019s\u2019 engines! That is one of the other types of trains that we\u2019ve managed so far to do without buying because he\u2019s never seen them in any shop before, just on the internet. Well, I bought him a \u2018Percy\u2019, I think he has 6 Percys now! Thomas got a \u2018Thomas\u2019 flag and Lady got a bunny necklace. All in, a good trip. We didn\u2019t do much on Tuesday or Wednesday but we did manage to sort out some household management stuff. Dad looked after the children for an hour in his apartment while Gordon and I went to the shops. On Thursday we went to the Aquarium. It\u2019s a great place but it wasn\u2019t such a successful outing. First of all, Duncan was disappointed that we weren\u2019t going on a steam train again, (the train only goes 5 or so times a year). When we went in, he was running around all over the place. That was understandable since we\u2019d been in the car for a long time so he was like a wound spring. They all liked touching the rays and sticking their hands in the touch pools. Lady liked the anemones and Thomas liked the giant crabs. I stuck right by Duncan, and he spent most of his time in a children\u2019s section full of play tubes and dressing up clothes. Duncan dressed as a diver and wanted to jump into the water with the fish! At one stage Gordon was with him and he threw his shoe away and it hit some other poor child. Gordon was really embarrassed and upset and wanted to go home right then. But we stayed another while and before we left, they went to watch the seals for a while. The seal was right up against the glass beside Duncan who was loving it, especially when it started barking and he barked right back! They were rolling around together and just making friends! That made the trip worthwhile. Everyone was grumpy on the drive home though, pah. Today we had some friends over. When they\u2019ve been here before, Thomas has usually stayed near me and my friend and her 1 yo daughter. Today though, he spent the whole time playing with Lady and the other little boy. They were playing Harry Potter; there was a bit of an issue about the casting but Lady set some challenges and her friend K bagged the main role while Thomas had to accept the part of Ron. They said Duncan was Malfoy! Not that he was interested anyway. Lady has suddenly started reading well which she\u2019s happy about. Thomas was playing in the bath last night with some foam letters. He had an \u2018N\u2019 and was thinking of N words. Then he got an \u2018O\u2019, put them together and said NO. Pretty good, I thought. Both boys have enjoyed some maths stories I bought in the charity shop and do well with the little puzzles in them.  I\u2019ve realised why I had to draw the same picture over and over for Duncan. He started producing his own rocket pictures, and they\u2019re really good. He enjoyed watching the process of creating the pictures as well as the finished product. He likes to have these objects and characters to hold and I think that\u2019s why he likes to dress up too. He likes to see himself in character. Lately, he has been wearing a knight costume, a Pocahontas dress (with pretty shoes and a pink hat), an angel dress with wedding veil and Lady\u2019s yellow top under a \u2018Big Chief\u2019 waistcoat.

So now I pass the award on and here are the rules: Pick five blogs that you consider deserve the award for their creativity, design, interesting material, and also for contributing to the blogging community, no matter what language. Each award has to have the name of the author and also a link to his or her blog to be visited by everyone. Each award winner has to show the award and put the name and link to the blog that has given her or him the award itself. The award winner and the one who has given the prize have to show the link of the  Arte y Pico blog , so everyone will know the origin of this award. So here are my picks: Ed from  Ed's autism page  writes with passion and understanding. He speaks for himself, but in doing so, helps keep in mind those who have been marginalised and denied a chance to express themselves. Sometimes I have to read his posts a few times to understand his meaning, and sometimes I have to ask him if I got it right. He is unfailingly polite and helpful. He really cares about others, is keen to learn and share what he knows. The team at  Holford Watch  keep a close eye on purveyors of woo and nutribollocks. They analyse the many proclamations, media articles and email newsletters produced by and about a mister Patrick Holford in particular, and point out the errors and nonsense contained therein. It's important work; who knows how many people are swayed by the sciencey Holford and his quack ideas on important health issues. Obviously, like any quack worth their feathers,  Holford isn't too keen on vaccines . Bev writes the sublime  Asperger Square 8 . I'd like to see her cartoons internationally syndicated! She can say so much that is true and important about human dignity, understanding, acceptance teamed with educational and living assistance, in a few illustrations. Manuel who writes  Well Done Fillet , is best waiter in Belfast, if not the world...probably. His stories of the crabbit, the complainers, the crooks and the cooks, are well written and very funny. He has also written a useful guide to diners, with tips of how to dress, order, eat and err, tip.  One post in particular  was useful to me a wee gurl from the hole of nowhere. Gimpy writes the well titled  Gimpy's Blog , which he says is about \"inane witterings and badscience.\" He lays into the pathetic \"reasoning\" behind homeopathy, and was first to write about  troubles in the Dore company . Dore are an organisation who preyed on the fears of parents with learning disabled children, to sell their totally unproven therapy. The company collapsed recently, leaving parents who have forked out loads for treatment without refunds and staff without wages. It further demonstrates the lack of ethics in that particular company. So there you have it. Obviously there are at least 10 more blogs I could nominate, but these all came to mind first. Feel free all of you to participate, or ignore completely as you desire. But I hope you get a wee frisson of pleasure knowing that someone out there appreciates you!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SIcQ41zA-OI/AAAAAAAAAS0/rkVlfdRW6W8/s1600-h/premioArteypico.jpg", "http://blawgat.blogspot.com/", "http://arteypico.blogspot.com/", "http://blawgat.blogspot.com/2008/07/id-like-to-thank.html", "http://arteypico.blogspot.com/", "http://eds-autism-blog.blogspot.com/", "http://holfordwatch.info/", "http://holfordwatch.info/2008/07/14/patrick-holford-and-his-recommendations-for-vaccines-as-canard-stuffed-as-we-feared/", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/", "http://welldonefillet.blogspot.com/", "http://welldonefillet.blogspot.com/2007/04/open-letter-to-anybody-from-provincial.html", "http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/", "http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/links-about-dore/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/random-and-fantabulous-award.html", "title": "\nA Random and Fantabulous Award\n"},
{"date": "28 Mar 2006", "body": "\nWe\u2019re off to Rome tomorrow morning. We fly at 6.20am so we\u2019ll stay in the airport hotel tonight. My Dad will be staying here and looking after the children. We really, really need to get away for a few days together.  I had been strained and tired and emotional over the weekend. Duncan is very sensitive to my mood. He gets so upset to see me sad and cuddles me and says, \u2018No Mummy sad, Mummy happy.\u2019 One time, he fetched a tissue and wiped my sad eyes. But the confusion also made him extra demanding.  Sunday was Mothers Day and Lady had made a beautiful card. After breakfast, we all worked together to clean the house for a while. I didn\u2019t want to leave it looking too messy as my Dad would be staying over for a few days. Gordon cooked and his Mum came over for lunch. Duncan has been asking us to buy a particular train for a few days and he had convinced himself that Gordon would have it when he drove his Mum to our house. When he didn\u2019t, Duncan expressed his BIG anger and made a lot of noise. I took him upstairs to help him deal with it and to get him away from my MIL who I knew would be shocked at his behaviour. While there, Gordon came to tell me that his Mum was very upset about Duncan and was worried it might be her fault. I can tell you this was not the thing to say just then. I asked him to explain to her the nature of Duncan\u2019s disability and could people not have a bit more understanding and it isn\u2019t about THEM. Well, we all calmed down after a while and had the delicious lunch Gordon had prepared. On Monday we all went to the transport museum and had a good work out running after Duncan. Afterwards, we all got chips at the chippie and ate by the sea. Today (Tuesday) I\u2019ve been clothes shopping and had my hair cut and I\u2019m running round like crazy trying to get clothes washed and everything ready to unleash my children on my father for a few days. I explained to them all that we\u2019d be going away for a few days and the Granda would be looking after them. I told them I\u2019d get them all a present. I\u2019d already bought the correct train for Duncan! I drew a little cartoon for him to describe what would be happening over the next few days. I\u2019ll get round to packing for myself eventually I\u2019m sure! I can\u2019t flicking wait to go!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/counting-hours.html", "title": "\nCounting the hours\n"},
{"date": "10 Apr 2006", "body": "\nI woke up when Thomas jumped into our bed this morning for his start-the-day cuddle. A few minutes later, Duncan joined the throng. I heard him before I saw him; as usual, he woke up singing! I though to myself what a special child he is, that he just wants to sing for his own pleasure as soon as he\u2019s awake. It\u2019s been a nice easy day. The children were out in the garden this morning while I did a few outside jobs. It was warm and sunny, then a big black cloud rolled overhead and suddenly, the hailstones were falling. For the rest of the day, the weather varied from sunshine to heavy rain to hail, with a bit of snow thrown in. Gordon and I sat around this afternoon, listening to The Smiths and using our computers. We were two happy nerds! I had to break off many times to get one or more children a drink/ wipe someone\u2019s bottom/ make some cakes/ draw some pictures/ play \u2018chase me!\u2019 Thomas wanted to sit beside me at lunchtime, as always. He looked deep into my eyes with his own big brown eyes and told me it was because \u2018I really love you.\u2019 Ah, what a wee Romeo! I spend lots of time with Lady yesterday. We went shopping together for the groceries and her new shoes. Then in the evening we walked through the forest to the beach. It was lovely. We had a good old delve around in some rock pools and raced each other to the shore. She ran twice as far (at least) as I walked; she was constantly flitting over to examine something. We came home with our pockets full of pretty stones and shells. I picked a limpet shell from a rock pool for her collection, but it was still alive. We had a quick look at its big foot, mouth and tentacles before putting it back in the pool to finish its dinner. I\u2019ve found a page on Enchanted Learning about them so we\u2019ll read it together later. We had a big discussion about the Harry Potter characters and their motivations on the last leg of our walk. She\u2019s such a great person to spend time with. I told her she was my favourite girl in the world (she asked if Auntie C. is my 2nd favourite; I was happy to say yes!).\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/04/my-favourite-things.html", "title": "\nMy favourite things\n"},
{"date": "24 Mar 2006", "body": "\nI had a big panic on Monday about Lady\u2019s maths abilities and convinced myself that I\u2019ve been failing her because she wasn\u2019t able to do something she had previously been able to do. It appeared that what she could do in one setting, like a computer game or worksheet, she couldn\u2019t do in other settings. She wasn\u2019t generalising. Well I spouted on for a while in a ridiculous and destructive way about how I\u2019d have to send her back to school as I clearly wasn\u2019t capable of helping her to learn myself, blah blah\u2026 Well I calmed down after a while (and apologised for my stupid behaviour) we thought about what we needed to do. We\u2019ve decided to go back to using the  Maths Enhancement Programme . I think we would both benefit from following a prescribed course of study right now, for maths anyway. So each day she has worked through 4 or 5 pages of that, and she\u2019s enjoying it and gaining confidence in her abilities to think logically about the problems. I also asked her to start writing a story. She has added an instalment every day and it\u2019s getting very exciting. It\u2019s about a little boy, named after Duncan, who meets an evil, child-gobbling witch, whom she\u2019s named after me. Ummm, nice. With this, playing the piano a bit, playing with her brothers a lot and reading and learning/playing on the computer, the days have been full and fun. The boys spend most of their days playing together. There were a few sunny but cold days and they were outside a lot. We went to a local playground on Wednesday. Duncan was on the roundabout for ages. It wasn\u2019t enough for him that it was turning, he was spinning while on the contraption too! How can he balance like that? I felt dizzy after a few minutes on it! He also copied his big sister in her game of rolling down the grass bank. Thomas is much more stoic. He calmly walks around and has a go on everything. He jumped onto the big swing and I asked if he would like a push. He said \u2018no thank you, I will do it myself\u2019 and he did. He loves it when other children are in the park and always makes friends with them.  He\u2019s such a cute boy. He and Gordon have a special game they play; he holds Gordon's face and asks \u2018if I kiss you, will I be in TWOUBLE!!!\u2019, Gordon says yes, Thomas kisses him, then much tickling and laughter ensues! Duncan is still big into dressing up. He\u2019s been Pinocchio, Grumpy from Snow White and Fizz from the Tweenies in the past few days. He\u2019s very resourceful, and has decided that if the correct costume can\u2019t be found in his dressing up box or someone\u2019s wardrobe, then Mummy can draw it and stick it on him. Yesterday he came downstairs with my pink t-shirt, asked me to out it on and had me draw white flowers to stick on it. We then used Lady\u2019s dressing gown belt as Fizz\u2019s white belt. He was upset that we couldn\u2019t make his legs yellow and wore a pair of pink tights instead. Yip, I\u2019m raising a transvestite autistic!  I asked him to fetch the sticky tape for our project and he went running off to the table saying \u2018I get the sticky tape, hooray, I found it\u2019 then handed it to me saying \u2018thank you\u2019. It was the 1st time I\u2019ve heard him refer to himself as \u2018I\u2019. He also did some colouring in himself yesterday. He usually gets frustrated at his efforts as he wants the finished project to look exactly like what ever he\u2019s copying. He coloured Lucy from \u201964 Zoo Lane\u2019 and gave her bright pink skin. I asked what colour his face is and he said \u2018pink face\u2019.  He then divided all the family into pink versus brown faces. Mummy, Duncan and Thomas are pink, Daddy and Lady are brown. I must end this, as he has just told me he wants a beanstalk. He means the big ones that grow from magic beans and have giants at the top. Right, do you think ebay does them?

{"date": "3 Apr 2006", "body": "\nI went to Rome a few days ago. It was absolutely marvellous, the best holiday I\u2019ve ever had and totally lived up to my expectations. I\u2019d always thought that if I had just one place I could visit before I die, I\u2019d choose Rome. We took a taxi to Belfast International airport and stayed at the hotel there on Tuesday, Neither of us slept well. I suppose we were too excited and I was worried about sleeping in. But we didn\u2019t and at 5.30 we were checked in and enjoying good coffee and croissants in the airport. It was funny to see how European we are in Belfast now. No-one was having the traditional fried breakfast; we were all sipping our lattes and cappuccinos instead! The flight was fine and we reached our  hotel  just after midday. It was wonderful; clean, modern, comfortable and just a few minutes walk from the Colosseum.  We had our 1st Italian meal at a caf\u00e9 near the hotel and it was lovely. Then we went exploring. We took the metro then walked and walked and walked. We wanted to go to St Peter\u2019s Square but started off in the wrong direction and went a long way off course. I was wearing flat boots; I wear them all the time and never had any problems. But after a while, my feet were really hurting. We reached the Vatican eventually and it was amazing to find myself standing somewhere that was so familiar. It was beautiful. We were too late to go into the basilica or the Vatican museums though. It\u2019s impossible to describe Rome adequately. There are beautiful churches, monuments, statues, fountains and 2000 year old buildings scattered in a big, chaotic, messy city. I kept seeing things and saying \u2018Oh, Lady would love this!\u2019 I\u2019d been told about driving in Rome but was still unprepared for the reality. It is crazy! There doesn\u2019t seem to be any system in place. And cars are parked anywhere it seems. We saw a car parked perpendicular to the pavement on top of a pedestrian crossing! We returned to the hotel and I soaked my poor feet and washed off the city dirt before collapsing, exhausted on the bed. Gordon said he was far too tired to go out and wanted room service. No way! We were in Rome and we were not staying in a hotel room all evening. We rested a while then dressed up and went out to a fantastic fish restaurant on the same street as our hotel. It was a really fancy place with well-healed customers and friendly, helpful waitresses. Our food was wonderful, the wine was excellent and it cost a lot less than we expected! I was totally tipsy as I tottered back to the hotel. We\u2019d planned to get up early on Wednesday but neither of us woke until 10.30. It was the day of our 10th anniversary! Thankfully, they were serving breakfast until 11.30. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to miss that! Then we went straight to the Vatican Museum. This time, I wore trainers! We\u2019d decided that the 2 things we most wanted to see that day were the Sistine Chapel and inside the Colosseum. I think we were so lucky in many ways. We had perfect spring weather, sunny and warm. We didn\u2019t have to queue for the museum and were just in time to join a guided tour. Our guide was a lovely Italian woman who\u2019d been giving tours for 30 years and who was keen to share her enthusiasm and knowledge with us. I had assumed that the museum would have only Christian paintings and artefacts. That is not the case. It is a wonderful collection containing many ancient Roman sculptures and artefacts. It was humbling to think we were looking at the work of people from nearly 2000 years ago. Before we entered the Sistine Chapel, our guide used posters to describe what we were about to see, since talking is forbidden in the Chapel. She explained that it took Michelangelo 4 years to paint the ceiling fresco and he virtually lived on the scaffolding he\u2019d had erected for all that time. He stood up to paint and wouldn\u2019t let anyone else see it, locking the chapel door whenever he did leave. He also painted \u2018The Last Judgment\u2019; a mighty fresco covering a complete wall in the chapel. She told us how one of the cardinals used to criticise him every day about the number of nudes in the painting. Unlike most people from Tuscany, Michelangelo never said a word back. But when the painting was complete, he had painted the charcter of Minos, the Judge of Souls, complete with ass\u2019s ears and with the cardinal\u2019s face. What a riposte! He was a tortured genius, living on a different plane from other ordinary people. The Raphael Rooms were another highlight. Another interesting thing the guide pointed out; in Raphael\u2019s fresco \u2018The School of Athens\u2019 he depicts Michelangelo (as Heraclitus) sitting wearing a pair of boots that he apparently insisted on always wearing. The tour ended at the door of the Sistine Chapel. It was magical. We wandered around for half an hour drinking it in then sat on the cardinals' bench in awe. We went out again and back to St Peter\u2019s Square where we hoped to go into the basilica. There was a huge queue by then though so we left it and went back to the Colosseum instead. I was disappointed that I didn\u2019t get to see the \u2018Pieta\u2019 but I probably would have cried if I had. We joined the last guided tour of the evening in the Colosseum and again it was amazing, wonderful, and awesome. After, we returned to our hotel close by since I was feeling cold by then. We went out for a meal that evening in the piazza by the Pantheon. There were loads of people sitting outside the cafes enjoying themselves and there was a really lovely happy atmosphere. We ate in a nice place, with gorgeous well-dressed waiters and again, wonderful food and wine. We walked back to the hotel; we had plenty of time. It was a great way to see the city illuminated at night. The next day we only had time for a great breakfast before going to the airport. The drive out was totally crazy. Our driver, a dapper middle-aged man, drove like an egotistical maniac, cutting people up constantly and overtaking, even at junctions. Ah well, we got there safely (by magic or something) and flew home. My Dad had driven our car with all the children to meet us at the airport. It was so nice to see them again. Duncan immediately asked for \u2018shiny Jack\u2019, the train I\u2019d bought (without his knowledge) before I left so I wouldn\u2019t be searching in Rome for Thomas trains. Daddy told me that they had all been great and there hadn\u2019t been a single problem. He had been so impressed with Duncan. The children were happy to see us too. It was the perfect way to end the perfect holiday.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://rome-hotels.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d252244-r4742867-Capo_d_Africa_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/04/rome.html", "title": "\nRome\n"},
{"date": "4 Apr 2006", "body": "\nIt\u2019s funny how having a few days away knocked me off schedule. I had many days worth of washing and cleaning to catch up on. I think we\u2019re sorted now! Lady really liked looking through our Rome photos, and drew a great picture of Gordon and me beside the Colosseum. On Saturday last I took Lady to see \u2018A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u2019 performed by the village drama group in a local church hall. I was surprised at how good it was and we both really enjoyed it. I explained to Lady what was happening a few times as we watched. She understood well and asked lots of questions in the break and at the end. She wants to join the junior drama group now. I bought the 1st 3 Harry Potter films recently; they were on special offer. Lady has watched them a few times. Currently, Daniel Radcliffe is her favorite actor. She has been playing Harry Potter games with the boys nearly all the time. She is Hermione, Thomas is Harry and Duncan is Ronald Weasley. They\u2019re all walking round wearing cloaks and using chop-sticks as wands. Thomas has been wearing Lady\u2019s pink, sparkly sun-glasses (the only ones they could find) with a zigzag scar drawn on his forehead with marker. Lady has been teaching Thomas various magic spells. This morning, the computer didn\u2019t start properly for him and before I could come to help, he was waving his chop-stick wand at it saying \u2018allo halora\u2019, \u2018cause that\u2019s going to sort it out! He calls himself \u2018Hairy Potter\u2019 and the 4th film is \u2018the Goblic of Fire\u2019. He asked me if he could have a \u2018bomb stick\u2019 for his birthday when he\u2019s 4. I asked what that is and he explained that\u2019s it\u2019s \u2018a bomb stick, like on Hairy Potter, you can fly in the sky on it\u2019. Ah, he means broom-stick! He was a bit upset when I told him that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get one that could fly as they\u2019re imaginary. I took Lady to her drama class and discovered they were having a show for the parents. Oh heck, I was going to have to sit through that with the 2 boys. Thankfully it was for the 2nd half of the class only as they had to rehearse 1st. I took the boys out to buy a train and a packet of sweets to keep them quiet. The show consisted of all the children showing how they could project their voices and act with their bodies before putting it together to do a short play about a hospital. I missed the play as Duncan decided just then that he needed the toilet. At one stage, the children were sort of chanting in a monotone \u2018run, run as fast as you can, you can run faster than Mary and Dan\u2019. Duncan, who had been sitting on the floor playing with his new train until then, pricked up his ears and as soon as the children had finished, he repeated the whole thing in the same monotone voice, really loudly! He also liked it when people clapped. He screws up his whole face, but in a happy way, and clapped and stamped his feet, with little fast steps. Thomas wanted to join the children and right at the end he slipped out of his seat and went to stand beside Lady. The bothersome thing is, the head-lice beasties are back and this time they\u2019ve taken up residence in Lady\u2019s beautiful thick curls. Oh dear! I definitely underestimated their persistence! I had loads of great advice from the early years home-ed list yesterday and I\u2019m on to them now.

{"date": "20 Mar 2006", "body": "\nThis is what I have sent to our education board to demonstrate how I intend to educate Duncan at home. I've had to make it suitable for the purpose, so have written about 'literacy' and 'facilitating communication' and that sort of thing these people like to hear. We will provide our son with an efficient full-time education suitable to his age, ability, aptitude and to his special educational needs as identified on his Statement, in accordance with Regulation 6 of the NI Education Regulations 1974, No. 78. Case law in England and Wales has established that an \u2018efficient\u2019 education is one that achieves what it sets out to achieve and prepares the child for life in modern civilised society, enabling them to fulfil their potential. Duncan\u2019s education will be full-time as we consider every part of the day to provide learning opportunities. Duncan\u2019s special needs are identified in his Statement. He has a diagnosis of ASD. He has difficulties with speech and language and with social communication. He also displays some obsessive behaviour. In his education, we aim to improve his;  1. Communication skills 2. Play and social interaction skills 3. Behaviour  4. Numeracy, literacy and all other areas of learning 5. Self-help skills It is explicit in law that the education of our child is an aspect of our parental responsibilities. We aim to engender in Duncan, the desire to learn and the ambition to realise his potential. We want him to have empathy and respect for others. We will help him gain confidence and self-esteem. We hope to extent his ability to focus on goals. We want him to develop a health conscious life style, the skills to solve problems and the flexibility to deal with modern life as well as he is capable.  We have taken part in the Early Bird autism course run by the National Autistic Society and have read extensively about autism from a variety of sources, with a particular interest in autistic learning. We have adopted many ideas to facilitate Duncan\u2019s communication as much as possible. We have studied and work with Duncan\u2019s personality type and sensory preferences. We can use this information to optimise the conditions to help him to learn, communicate and interact. Optimisation of his environment also helps to avoid problem behaviour. For example, Duncan enjoys physical activity. We try to make the most of his exuberance with rough and tumble games or by playing chase or hide and seek. These provide many opportunities for communication and social interaction. This also provides the balance he needs to be able to concentrate and engage on more focused learning tasks. Physical activity is also important for his health so we ensure he has many opportunities to exercise. He enjoys playing in the garden, on the climbing frame or with his bike and scooter. He likes to go to the playground, or soft play centre, which provide opportunities to play with other children. We also often go to the nearby beach or to the countryside park for family walks.  The home environment provides the right level of stability for Duncan. He functions best with consistency. At home we have the chance to model empathy and to help him gain understanding of his emotions by labelling. There is no need for extrinsic modifications or rewards or punishments. These are counter-productive. We will help him to learn to do what is right and internalise these skills; not to do things out of fear or to gain gold stars. Every routine of the day provides opportunities to extend his communication. We  are fostering routines and order. At home we have more time to help him develop skills in, for example, toileting, dressing, choosing clothes, tidying his room. Duncan is a clever boy and has demonstrated a great capacity for learning. It is clear that he is a visual and hands-on learner. Our role is to facilitate his development; to enable his talents and natural curiosity. He can learn at his own pace and will be encouraged to discover, explore and create. Duncan learns best in the security of his home with his family. He learns implicitly from his various special interests. Duncan\u2019s communication abilities will improve as he develops reading and writing skills, so encouraging literacy is important. He now enjoys listening to stories, either alone or with his family. We often act out the scenarios or use toys as props. He has access to a large number of children\u2019s books and we often visit the library. Duncan has a particular interest in everything to do with Thomas the Tank Engine, so I have bought a new set of \u2018learn to read with Thomas\u2019 books to capitalise on this. (Duncan learnt his colours and numbers through \u2018Thomas\u2019. The characters also helped him to recognise the facial expressions for different emotions. His first spoken word was \u2018train\u2019 and the first words he learned to read, after his own name, were Thomas, Percy James, Edward and Fat Controller!) As he is now starting to read some words, we will help to extend this ability. He has come to love many other stories too, and among his current favourites are \u2018Duck in the Truck\u2019, \u2018We're Going on a Bear Hunt\u2019 and the \u2018Apple Tree Farm\u2019 stories. A good deal of Duncan\u2019s speech is phrases copied from videos and computer games. We play with him and act out the phrases to help him understand their meaning. The computer is a crucial tool in Duncan\u2019s learning. He is adept at using the mouse and can write his name using the keyboard. We have a broadband internet connection, and Duncan can use bookmarks, move back and forward through pages and find the home page. I have bookmarked lots of excellent sites. He enjoys cbeebies which has lots of great games, stories and activities. He also enjoys the Starfall learn to read site and Literactive.com. We also have lots of educational CD ROMs. Using all these, he can listen to stories and songs, play games and follow instructions. They help to improve his literacy and numeracy in a fun way that holds his interest. Using the computer together provides a point of joint attention. Other tools that are available to facilitate Duncan\u2019s education include DVD\u2019s, Cuisenaire rods, magnetic numbers, letter cards, Lego, puzzles, card and board games, workbooks and craft resources. A lot of learning happens through real life situations. Duncan often helps to cook which gives him a chance to discover many principles of science like mixing and melting, and of maths, like measuring and counting. Learning about food will also hopefully increase the range of food he will eat.  Duncan enjoys playing and having fun with all his family including his extended family and close friends. We have annual family membership at Belfast Zoo, W5 and the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum and visit all these regularly. Duncan\u2019s home-based education will progress in a manner which optimises his continuing development while meeting all his needs.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/educational-philosophy-for-duncan.html", "title": "\nEducational philosophy for Duncan\n"},
{"date": "2 Aug 2008", "body": "\n Lady and I spent the day together in Belfast. We travelled in by train, and after a bit of a wander around the gathering point for today's Gay Pride parade, with Lady picking up a rainbow pencil, wrist-band (message: respect differences) and some Rainbow Drops sweets, we headed to the Victoria Square shopping centre. Here's Lady by the pretty yellow Jaffe Fountain which we think would look at home in the palace of a Disney princess. We browsed the shops, and I discovered that I'm a size larger than I thought (grrr). Feeling hungry, we set off to find grub. I'd fancied going to Nandos, but herself isn't too fond of chicken so that was out. But while wandering along hoping to be inspired, we caught sight of the Pride Parade on Donegal Place, so we stood to watch it pass. Eventually I remembered that I'd brought a camera and took a few snaps. I like the juxtaposition of Belfast's City Hall, a potent symbol of the city's allegiance to the British crown, dour industrial past and fervent religiosity, with the parade and rainbow flags. Lady had asked what it was all about, so I explained how people have been and still are, discriminated against because of who they happen to love. She knows about diversity in race, culture, gender and disability and it was easy to explain how differences in who people love are just as natural. She thought the men dressed as women were funny but asked why they weren't embarrassed. I told her that they're making a point, that they are letting people know that they can dress how they want, but that they're just trying to look good or funny too. There were loads of posters and stickers about  Iris . One women held a banner saying \"I (or was it we?) love you Iris.\" Others had stickers saying something like, \"Iris is the sick one\" a sentiment I'd tend to agree with more. Perhaps in part due to the abominable statement made by that woman (she's an MP, and wife of the leader of our regional parliament) in the media recently, the parade was far bigger than I expected. Most of those I saw were young. I'd expected more family members, mums and dads walking alongside their children. But perhaps that's not needed, what do I know! Anyway, it was good to see their energy, hope, defiance and pride. So anyway, the girl and I carried on with the important business of shopping and Lady asked to have her ears pierced. I consented; for years I've told her to wait until she was 10, and that's only 8 days away. She choose little sapphire-like studs, and without even flinching, got them installed. And very pretty they look too. Cups of coffee and hot chocolate gave us a mid-shop boost, and eventually we headed for home. It had been a lovely day together. My beautiful daughter is such great company.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJTO8zqv6MI/AAAAAAAAAS8/BkTbRKJSKEI/s1600-h/IMG_3466.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJTsC1sC7rI/AAAAAAAAATs/UfdLU9ui-OY/s1600-h/IMG_3468.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJTO9ziOr4I/AAAAAAAAATU/aF5Ls5A9QDo/s1600-h/IMG_3467.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJTajleKthI/AAAAAAAAATk/k7A5TsSFuHI/s1600-h/IMG_3472.JPG", "http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=29343385488", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJTPZDC1LxI/AAAAAAAAATc/AEqqVt5PldA/s1600-h/IMG_3473.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/08/me-and-my-girl.html", "title": "\nMe and My Girl\n"},
{"date": "4 Aug 2008", "body": "\n Sunshine and showers, that's what we've had for most of this summer. I've noticed that even on the wettest, greyest and potentially most miserable day, the sun breaks through for a time. The children run out when the rain eases or stops. I've heard complaints about the terrible summer we're having, but being with the children has allowed me to notice how much sunshine there's been too. We've caught loads of rainbows. When we all took Pippy for a walk in the evening, a spectrum of colour reached across the sky. We headed for the path beside the station. Duncan took a turn holding the lead. Pippi loved it. The boys played at being steam trains for a while. The ran along the path, then when it forked, Duncan said they were going down the 'branch line' and they dashed down 'Gordon's hill' shouting \"Stop wheels, stop! I'm going too fast!\" and other lines from Thomas the Tank engine stories. Then they both ran straight back up the hill, and repeated the game multiple times. They sure are fit. On reaching our street, Duncan had to stop to admire the red Renault Clio car and try to sneak a look at the front door of the house where it's parked. There's a thick, high hedge surrounding the house which has heightened the mystery of the house and its inhabitants. It's all very exciting. I stood in the drizzle, adopting my usual stance of Duncan observation, ready to call out or, if necessary run to intervene. I have become slightly more hands off as time progresses.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJa8EpMme0I/AAAAAAAAAT0/YqsnADj0s3s/s1600-h/IMG_3479.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJa8E7CdbgI/AAAAAAAAAT8/F8Pemm39Y04/s1600-h/IMG_3489.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SJa8FAethpI/AAAAAAAAAUE/hUUMJdUAMD0/s1600-h/IMG_3494.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/08/weekend-walkies.html", "title": "\nWeekend Walkies\n"},

I can\u2019t believe how tricky these freakin\u2019 head lice have been. I\u2019ve spent ages every day combing them out. Poor Thomas had a mega-city settled in his sweet head. On to more joyful things, the children have been busy playing and eating and reading and arguing and drawing and all the rest of that sort of thing. Lady has started to learn to play piano. Gordon has taught her a few scales and she\u2019s just started to play a few very basic 3 note pieces of music. She has taken to it really well and likes it so far. She bops her head up and down as she plays to keep time, it\u2019s very cute. Yesterday she went to Brownies for the 1st time. The same woman runs Brownies and Rainbows and she had told me that Lady was old enough to move up. She really enjoyed it and says it is much more interesting and fun for 7 year olds. She needs a new uniform now so we\u2019ll go to the guide shop later to get one. Hopefully she will be able to get to know a few girls in the village now. Well, we\u2019re 1/3 of the way to being proper home-educators yesterday. We made flubber! It was great, though there was only 1 small bottle of white PVA glue in the shop when I went, so we could only make a tiny bit of flubber. We used red food colouring so it was a beautiful pink colour. We all had lots of fun with it! Duncan loved feeling it against his face, I tried it and it did feel nice! I had a few emotional outbursts from Duncan to deal with yesterday too. He was getting cross about some more trains he wants me to buy. But he got over it with a bit of help. I did have to draw many, many paper trains though!  Today he has decided he would dress up as Zeebad from the Magic Roundabout film so he was running around in a grey vest with a belt over the top and his pants. He asked me to make his hands blue too \u2018not pink\u2019, for that extra authenticity! Thankfully I was able to dissuade him from that plan. He boinged about the house for a while, clutching his \u2018paper Zeebad\u2019 which I drew earlier.  I\u2019m a bit stressed myself for a few reasons but I hope it\u2019ll get better soon. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/zeebad-in-da-house.html", "title": "\nZeebad in da house\n"},
{"date": "20 Mar 2006", "body": "\nI took Lady to her Ju-Jitsu class on Saturday then spent the time pootling about the town alone- bliss! I trawled the charity shops (not having enough junk of our own at home\u2026) and bought a few more children\u2019s books, including a few \u2018Famous Five\u2019 books which I think Lady would enjoy. I loved them as a child, though they are quite trashy and politically incorrect (sexist mainly, as far as I remember). When she's read them, we can talk about the changes in society since then. Got to keep the liberal ideological training going! I took all the children to a friend\u2019s 4th birthday party in the afternoon. The children all had a fantastic time. Lady hung out with 2 older girls and I think she thought they were really cool. Thomas loved it, he and his little buddy are so similar and cute together. Later he was telling Gordon all about it, \u2018I like-ed the pizza and the crisps and I like-ed making big burps and everybody was laughing\u2019. Duncan was, well, tricky. He discovered a packet of biscuits on arrival and wouldn\u2019t stop climbing to get them. He had a fair few tantrums and I was trying to calm him down often. I had to decide before we went whether I should take him or leave him behind with Gordon, but he knew we were going to a party and he really wanted to go. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to leave him just because he\u2019s harder work. Part of the problem was bad planning by me and I felt bad that the other adults there who don\u2019t really know us might be thinking how awful it must be dealing with children like him. (None of the other children posed any problem as far as I could see.) I should have brought some food and drink with me because he\u2019s so limited in what he eats that even child friendly home-made pizza, crisps and cola aren\u2019t acceptable to him. As soon as the cake was cut we all left, but he still had time to grab at the bit of icing the birthday boy was eating and break it up. I felt bad about that, but I just wasn\u2019t fast enough to stop him. It might sound strange, like I\u2019m over analysing all this, but I need to learn what I can improve to help him deal with situations better. There were 2 notable occurrences on Sunday. 1st, I went out for a run. I haven\u2019t run for ages and I did OK. It was great actually; I went easy and ran into the park which was utterly beautiful. There were tiny pink flower buds appearing on the hawthorn and I saw the 1st crop of wild primroses. I used to pick bunches from the hedges round our house for my Mum when I was little. I hope I can run more often as the evenings get lighter, that is if I\u2019m not totally knackered by the time Gordon comes home from work! The 2nd and more amazing thing was that Duncan ate a chicken leg!!! He was hungry and asked for some chicken. Obviously I obliged, then we all stood in wonder as he ate it, dipped in tomato ketchup of course!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/running-around.html", "title": "\nRunning around\n"},
{"date": "17 Mar 2006", "body": "\nToday started off a whole lot better than yesterday. I even had my breakfast brought up to me in bed. Today was a holiday so Gordon was at home; and he used his laptop for only about 30 minutes!! There were loads of extra events at the local folk museum today to celebrate St Patrick\u2019s Day. It\u2019s a bit different to how I did things as a child. Then, Paddy\u2019s day was a great excuse to break my lentern denial of sweets. We all pinned a bunch of shamrocks to our coat with a big golden harp thing, headed to Mass and sang the Hail Glorious St Patrick hymn, then we stuffed our faces with sweets before heading to Letterkenny in Donegal for a fairly rubbish parade. I don\u2019t do the mass thing any more so the religious aspect of the day is lost to me. I can\u2019t be doing with all that corny green beer either, not that I get much opportunity for sitting about in pubs anyway. But it\u2019s a bit annoying how it\u2019s almost seen as St bloody Guinness\u2019s day now! The folk museum thing was nice though, and no matter what foot you kick with, you could enjoy it ;-) But of course we\u2019re not your average family. It was cold and windy (it wid\u2019a foundered ye). The children went rushing off and started going into some of the little houses, looking at the open fires, running up the narrow staircases. Duncan really liked the room housing an old town library, especially the grandfather clock and the glass case full of stuffed birds. I suppose that kind of thing was cool 100 years ago. Some bright spark had decided to stick an ice-cream van in the middle of the town square. Did they not know we were coming? Do they not know how tricky it is to keep Duncan away from that kind of thing? And did they not think that it was a bit of wishful thinking to expect to sell much ice-cream on a cold March day in the top bit of Ireland? True to form he made straight for the van, and I lead him away telling him I would buy some \u2018floss\u2019 (candyfloss, which they also sold) just before we went home. After that he was in and out of buildings, running to the van in between with me panting along behind him. Once I was a few seconds too slow and he was trying to climb up into the van. Lady was closer so she pulled him down and I heard her tell the woman there, \u2018he\u2019s got autism\u2019 in her straightforward manner. Just before we left, we all had a ride on a trap pulled by 2 beautiful shire horses. They all loved this. Thomas and Gordon sat up front beside the driver, and Duncan squealed with pleasure and sang \u2018horsy, horsy, don\u2019t you stop\u2019 twice! One thing that went through my mind as I was watching him run around shouting  and squealing with happiness, enjoying the feeling of the wind pushing him, I thought about how he would appear to others. The sound he was making sounded like \u2018arghhh!\u2019 but happy. I thought that though he sounds cute doing it now, if he\u2019s making that kind of noise when he\u2019s 10 it will look weird. Though why I thought about this I don\u2019t know because I couldn\u2019t actually give a flying duck what outsiders think. He was fed up when we were leaving as he wanted more \u2018floss\u2019 and made a terrible racket in the car. It upset Gordon more than me. I think I\u2019ve finally realised that it\u2019s not worth getting upset because he always gets over it soon enough. One thing I will have to sort out though is a new seat belt system as he kept undoing his. Our new desktop computer arrived from Dell; I ordered it at almost midnight on Tuesday and it was delivered yesterday. We bought the cheapest one they sell, \u00a3289, and Gordon and Lady went to PC World to buy a speaker system and internet connection. He loves it there (and hifi shops and stationary shops and electronic music shops). When they came home, he told me they\u2019d had a great talk about progress.  Hmm. She told us that she\u2019s going to test Santa\u2019s existence by asking him for the  ASIMO  robot Gordon showed her; she reckons if he\u2019s real he\u2019ll be able to get it, but if it\u2019s just her parents, we\u2019ll never be able to afford it. I might ask him for a 5 day a week maid, just in case he\u2019s real.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://world.honda.com/HDTV/ASIMO/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/happy-st-patricks-day.html", "title": "\nHappy St Patrick\u2019s Day!\n"},

I also got a letter from the education board today about home-educating Duncan. It contained this sentence, \u201cYou will be aware that because Ryan is of compulsory school age, both the Board and yourself must have regard to the law which places a duty of parents to secure the regular attendance at school of their child.\u201d How about that for great writing! Then she goes on to ask me to provide written details of how I intend to educate him according to age, aptitude, ability and taking his special needs into account. So it\u2019s a bit mixed up. First, she falsely says I have to send him to school then she\u2019s asking for evidence of how I will educate him.

{"date": "9 Mar 2006", "body": "\nAt 11.30 yesterday I suddenly remembered that Duncan had an appointment with the clinical psychologist at 1.30. The paediatrician we saw last year suggested it and we agreed thinking we should get \u2018on the books\u2019 of a few people here in Northern Ireland. So I took Lady and Thomas to their Grandma and went to the hospital with Duncan. It\u2019s been at least 6 months since we went there but of course he recognised the place immediately and wanted to go up the stairs to play with the \u2018red train\u2019. So he was a bit put out when we were asked to wait in another room.  We went in to see the psychologist soon after. It was a strange session. To be honest the only reason I went is because I\u2019m filling Duncan\u2019s disability living allowance (DLA) form and it always helps your case to have some professional or other backing up your claim, particularly since I\u2019m now home-educating him. So I decided I would just make sure I got all the \u2018difficulties\u2019 we have with Duncan down on paper, I mean, all the extra effort we have to put in to keeping things ticking along. None of this is bad or hard to deal with, it\u2019s just how it is, but I know the DLA money could come in useful for him later.  Anyway, I just talked to her about what we do and the things we have to deal with and how. I told her about Duncan\u2019s complete lack of road sense and how if I have the 2 boys out, it\u2019s Duncan\u2019s hand I make sure I hold onto at all times and not his 3 yo brother. I talked about his bed wetting and how he gets really upset when he wants something and doesn\u2019t get it. I also talked about the solutions I\u2019ve come up with to deal with these things. She obviously had to recommend something so she advised me to use cards symbolising \u2018quiet\u2019 or \u2018stop this tantrum\u2019 or something when he gets into a bit of a strop in a shop. And she had some idea about making a game to try to get him to eat more varied food. It was a bit of a drag. It actually went on for nearly 2 hours. Who on earth is paying for this woman\u2019s time? She just sat there and let me witter on and on. She arranged for us to meet up again in a months time (blimey!) to see how things have progressed. I\u2019ll have to get on with finishing this DLA form because I really don\u2019t want to darken her door again. (She also used the expression \u2018these children\u2019 twice or so; I really hate that one). The other interesting thing is that while he was in her office, Duncan was an absolute angel. He got bit fed up toward the end, understandably, and wanted my attention. I couldn\u2019t see either of my other 2 children managing to amuse themselves with a box of manky toys and a paper rocket I\u2019d made earlier for such a long time! When we were finally leaving, he asked to take a \u2018James\u2019 train home with him. She said it had to stay in the box for all the other boys and girls to play with. I told him I could draw a picture of James with the driver at home and he was perfectly happy with that. Today we had a nice chilled sort of day. The children did what they enjoy; played on the computer, drew pictures, read, told stories, watched cbeebies and helped to make pancakes. Lady has continued her arithmetic practise, focusing manly on multiplication and division. She went to Rainbows too having missed a few from being away or someone being sick. She\u2019s been told she can join Brownies if she wants so next week she\u2019ll start that.

{"date": "6 Mar 2006", "body": "\nYesterday it was ten years since the day my mother died of cancer. My aunt invited everyone to her house to gather, have a meal and remember her. So I drove with Gordon and the 3 children 100 miles to my home town. Everyone was going to the church first so Lady joined my Dad and sister while I went to take the boys in. Duncan hasn\u2019t been to church since he was about 2 since I\u2019ve stopped going and he was intimidated by the large towering building. He said \u2018no go in scary castle\u2019, so I turned round and took him back to the car and Gordon looked after him while Thomas and I returned to the church. It was nice to sit among all the family members and admire all the babies, though the service did little for me. We all went to the graveyard next before heading over to my aunt\u2019s house. My Mum\u2019s 4 sisters and their husbands were there as well as lots of cousins and their children. The house was filled with people and noise. Duncan wanted to go to another aunt\u2019s house at first, the one who has a working cuckoo clock. But he went in, found a few toys and a supply of sweets in one of the cupboards and he was happy. I am very close to my aunt, the one who organised the whole thing. She had prepared a huge amount of food and we all ate and drank and had a great time. Having these big parties with lots of people and food is a great tradition on my mother\u2019s side. I\u2019d brought some of the letters Mammy (as we always called her) wrote me when I was at university and passed them out among a few people. They were always very short and are among the only ones she wrote, mainly because my siblings were mostly at home before she died. She wrote exactly as she would have spoken and when I read them I can hear her voice. The children loved playing with their cousins and spent most of the time outside. Gordon had really worried about Duncan before we went and we planned to leave if it was clear he was having a hard time. However he was perfectly happy all the time we were there. He found a little yellow lorry which he carried around and my aunt had thoughtfully bought him a new Thomas the tank engine book with noisy buttons. Both boys loved playing chase with their big cousin. Thomas was busy making everyone fall in love with him by flashing his big brown eyes and sweet talking them. Lady was talking to few elderly relatives about home-education (after they asked if she liked school) and left them looking baffled at the very idea! I hugged my aunt when we were going and thanked her for having us all and told her that it was my favourite way to spend the day. Memories of Kathleen \u2022 Hugging her every time I was leaving home to return to university; both of us in tears in case it was the last time we\u2019d be together, \u2022 Filling with joy when she would walk up the country road to meet me off the school bus, \u2022 Baking together, \u2022 Feeling so proud when she\u2019d made a dress for herself, me and my doll using the same material, \u2022 Choosing my wedding dress together, both of us picking the same dress instantly, her crying when I tried it on, \u2022 Getting married 25 days after she died because we hadn\u2019t brought our wedding date forward by quite enough time, \u2022 Her crying on the phone as her sister had just told her about my cousin who was unexpectedly pregnant, whereas Mammy knew she would never know her grandchildren, \u2022 Lying beside me when I was little and had the flu and telling me how she hated to see me so sick, \u2022 Wrapping Christmas presents for my youngest brother and sister; when I exclaimed at how much they were getting, she pointed out that she wanted it to be a special Christmas as they wouldn\u2019t have another with her, \u2022 Never ending hugs and kisses and the feeling of utter safety in her arms, \u2022 Too many days of pain and sickness and suffering, \u2022 Spending the last day with her and Daddy in the hospice.

Gordon was asking me a few days ago if I could pin-point what we\u2019re doing different right now, i.e. had Duncan expanded his diet? It\u2019s obvious that what's changed is that he hasn\u2019t been to school since 15 Feb. He isn\u2019t struggling to conform to an imposed routine. He can go run round, or bounce on a bed, or have a big hug when he feels the need. He can play on the computer for as long as he wants, and is giving way to Lady and Thomas when I tell him that they want a turn. He can bring me a book to read or ask me to draw a picture any time and there\u2019s usually a good chance that I will be able to oblige fairly soon after. His use of spoken language is increasing daily. He is playing with his siblings more than ever, frequently seeking them out to play some game or other. He has more fun with them than alone most of the time, and if he ever wants to lie on his bedroom floor and play with trains, then he can do so.  We went to their Grandma\u2019s house today while Lady was at Ju-Jitsu and Duncan was much happier than last week. He asked for a new train but readily accepted that I just wasn\u2019t going to get one. The boys chased each other and played with an ABC puzzle. They were loud though! I don\u2019t notice it so much in our house which is bigger, but I\u2019m also always a bit worried about how their poor Grandma is coping. She lives alone and loves her peace and quiet. She says it\u2019s OK though in small doses! Lady informed me that she beat a green belt child in the wrestling (or whatever it\u2019s called) at the end of Ju-Jitsu and one of the other girls came to tell me how great she\u2019d been!

{"date": "3 Mar 2006", "body": "\nToday started with the familiar sound of Duncan running from his room to ours. He jumped in beside me and snuggled up, to be joined a few moments later by Thomas. After that it was just another normal day here at the engine shed. Lady started to write a story about \u2018Pixen the Pixie\u2019, which sounds like it\u2019s totally plagiarising several by Enid Blyton. I read her some of Ms Blyton\u2019s \u2018Faraway Tree\u2019 and \u2018Magical Wishing Chair\u2019 books last year, but I had to give up before finishing as I was getting so sick of them. I told her she\u2019d just have to get better at reading for herself if she wants to hear the rest of those. Actually, when I was little we didn\u2019t have 10% of the books that my lot have, and though my parents must have read aloud to me at some stage, I can\u2019t remember it. Maybe that\u2019s why I had the motivation to read early. But Lady is really getting there now.  And one more first from Duncan, da ta da!! They were all playing \u2018running up and down\u2019 in the kitchen today when I walked by and bumped into him. I said \u2018oh, sorry\u2019 and straight off he said, \u2018that\u2019s alright\u2019. What!!? I wouldn\u2019t have expected that and it just made me smile so much. Later I called his (old) school and spoke at length to his teacher. She said she was so upset to hear that he\u2019s not going back and that they\u2019ve really been missing him. She also said that she isn\u2019t surprised that we are going to home-educate him. He always hugely enjoyed one-to-one activities in school but he had problems with the strict structure, changing activities and all group tasks. He was, she said, the child they were having the most problems getting through to. She wished us well, invited me to visit some time to pick up all his little bits of art and to talk about what they were planning to do next with him. She said that she knew he would thrive at home. I also called the principle, who I\u2019ve spoken to just once briefly before. He was quite surprised about this development. But then unlike Duncan\u2019s class teacher, he doesn\u2019t know we\u2019ve been doing this for almost 2 years with Lady. I told the principle that I\u2019d always intended to have him learn at home at some stage, but that he\u2019d told me he didn\u2019t want to go back. He recommended that I talk to the Educational Psychologist. I might do at some stage, but only because I\u2019ve met her a few times and I like her. It sounded like he thought I\u2019m a total push-over for taking Duncan\u2019s wishes seriously! Anyway, that\u2019s dealt with now, and we're just getting on with it and having a grand old time!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/thats-alright.html", "title": "\nThat's alright!\n"},
{"date": "8 Mar 2006", "body": "\nMy sister stayed over with us on Monday night. I was telling her about how great Duncan has been since he finished school for good, and right on cue he was loud, crying and complaining. He wanted me to find a picture on-line of the dancing bear from the Teletubbies. No such picture exists. I had to take him upstairs twice so we could spend some time away from everyone else and get some of the anger out of his system. Eventually he was able to accept a Mummy-drawn picture based on his description, and after that he was back to being a delight. All 3 children were still loud, but in the joyful way when my Dad arrived. The boys made him play chase and Duncan loved it when he pretended Duncan\u2019s Peter Pan hat was his. Duncan kept saying \u2018it\u2019s mine, give it back, give it to me\u2019. I love to hear him playing along but at the same time clearly saying what he wants. It should make it harder for nasty people to push him about. Lady worked on sums, she\u2019s finally getting lots of the number facts memorised. Thomas played a bit of \u2018Jojo in Numberland\u2019 and managed to sort the counters into disordered drawers marked up to 20. I didn\u2019t know he could do that. Duncan played lots of Tweenies games and spent a few minutes looking at a Thomas the Tank workbook. He was able to match words to pictures for 5 words, some of which were  not  engine names! They all enjoyed the  literactive.com  site. Thomas played the \u2018Hairy Mary\u2019 story about 30 times. He was fascinated at the idea of a girl getting teased and then getting mad and hurting others. Gordon had to leave this evening for another series of cancer research meetings. He\u2019s been away a lot in the past few weeks.

So the children all went out to the garden to play. Lady squashed up a few handfuls into ice balls and stuck one into the freezer to show Daddy later. I\u2019m sure he was thrilled. ;-) I was a bit stressed today. The never ending mess and cleaning was getting to me. Lady and Thomas were bickering with each other a bit more than usual too, though they were really only picking up on my negativity. Duncan, bless him, was easier than the other two. He is blossoming. When Gordon was going off to work this morning he said bye to Duncan who chirruped back, \u2018bye Daddy, goodbye!\u2019 followed a minute later by \u2018where are you going?\u2019. Gordon said that he\u2019s going to work and Duncan pondered that, \u2018Daddy go to work. Daddy go on train.\u2019 Now this is another first for him. He\u2019s never asked a question like that before. Lady did lots of learning today, writing and maths and reading. She\u2019s reading \u2018Fantastic Mr Fox\u2019 aloud and is really proud of herself; a proper chapter book! She\u2019s enjoying the BBC Jam site still and also spent a bit of time on her favourite, the Chronicles of Narnia site. The boys were chuckling away at the Tweenies on cbeebies. They keep making mistakes on purpose because they love it when the characters say \u2018whoops a daisy!\u2019. Duncan was watching \u2018Chicken Run\u2019 earlier. He was watching the same bit over and over, and then he ran off and got a toy sword and was copying the nasty woman trying to chop the chicken. He kept putting two fingers into his mouth and stretching his mouth out, then I realised he was trying to look like a wide-mouthed Nick Parks character. :-)   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/Wallace%20and%20Gromit.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/03/ice-and-snow.html", "title": "\nIce and snow\n"},

{"date": "28 Feb 2006", "body": "\nI was reading all sorts of stuff over the weekend trying to get ideas on how to help him grow and learn. I\u2019ve read some fantastic  blog entries  over the past few days by people giving their take on  autistic learning . I\u2019ve also read a great, in depth post about autistic learning by Michelle Dawson on the  Autism Science Forum . All this reassures me that Duncan will grow and learn best at home when he is free to follow his interests, when he isn\u2019t stifled to conform to society\u2019s version of normal. Having them all at home is really nice. I do have to find a better system of storage for al the toys and stuff we have lying around otherwise we will descend into chaos. Or are we there already? So, I\u2019m working out some routine for us. I\u2019ve had a bit of a problem with Lady recently; I keep asking her to do something, like put her clothes away, and she regularly doesn\u2019t do it. I think she always intends to do whatever it is, she just gets distracted. We have to work a solution out because I keep getting angry with her and being a horrible Mummy. Today it happened again and I shouted at her which obviously is not going to achieve anything except make us both feel bad. A little while after she said to me \u2018can we make up now?\u2019 and of course I rushed to hug her and told her she is a much better person than me because she always is willing to kiss and make up. She is a very considerate girl. She had her drama class today so I had the boys to entertain for an hour in town. Every time we\u2019ve done this previously, I have bought a train for Duncan at his favourite shop. Today I told him I would not get him another train, which made him very grumpy. We went into a charity shop which I\u2019d told him had videos. He wanted a Thomas video and when he didn\u2019t find one he was upset and when he\u2019s upset he tends to be noisy. I don\u2019t know if the other people in the shop were wondering why this little boy was \u2018behaving so badly\u2019. I considered telling them, he\u2019s autistic, he can\u2019t help it. But I decided not to bother and to just calmly deal with him as I would anywhere else. I did apologise for the noise to the man at the till when I paid for yet another Rosie and Jim video. (Oh good link,  Rosie and Jim , there\u2019s a bit where they can type in their names and Jim says \u2018hello Thomas\u2019 or whatever. My lot think it\u2019s hilarious!). They all want a bath now. I suppose Duncan will want to wear his orange jacket. It\u2019s a child\u2019s float suit and he\u2019s been wearing it non-stop for the past few days, usually with a pair of big yellow goggles.

He then told me about his dream- he was in W5 and he was on the moving stairs and there were nasty trains and purple spiders and there were lots of girls and boys and the boys were saving the girls (eh?) and he was flying but he had no cloak. Whew!! Duncan was wearing his favourite top today. It\u2019s black with red sleeves, and a red and yellow logo on the front. He got me to draw a picture of himself wearing the top and his red wellies. He checked that I got all the details right. Then I had to roll it into a tube and tape it and he carried it around the rest of the day. When Gordon phoned home, Duncan was keen to tell him about the picture. Duncan has usually been carrying some small object around with him ever since he could grip. When he was only about 9 months old, he wanted to take a bottle of Olbas Oil to bed with him. It comes in a small glass bottle with a pointed white plastic lid. I tried to get him to accept all sorts of substitutes but he was adamant that he wanted that bottle. I think I let him hold it; I just stayed near by and took it off him when he finally went to sleep. They all had a \u2018superbath\u2019 this evening. They were in there for ages with a pile of toys. Duncan was playing with a pair of small baby dolls and I heard him have one say to the other \u2018oh, you mus be ba-on-ess Sheider\u2019. I had no idea what this was but Lady kindly translated, \u2018he\u2019s saying, \u2018oh you must be Baroness Schneider\u2019, it\u2019s from the Sound of Music\u2019.

I really love my children (oops, she\u2019s getting sentimental and all maudlin\u2019). They bring colour and joy to my life. They bring snot and grime and dirty clothes too, but never mind! Every day I spend with them, they each make me laugh at something they do or say. I love that they enjoy playing with each other so much and they know each other so well. My beautiful boys and my strong, kind girl; what have I done to deserve such gifts? Duncan spent most of today wearing a knight costume he\u2019s recently received as a present. I couldn\u2019t find the camera unfortunately. He looked the business in the tabard and cloth helmet, swishing his toy sword around. He pointed to himself (a recent trait) saying \u2018Prince Charming, Shrek 2\u2019 to let me know exactly who he was pretending to be. Then he badgered me into joining him in the garden to play chase. At one stage they went into the garage so I chased them out and locked the door.

(Listen to Radio 4\u2019s  Leading Edge  article about Theory of Mind and autism, 15 minutes into the show). You know what other myth is fast being demolished; that most autistic people have learning disabilities. Some Canadian scientists, among them an autistic woman who has over the years come in for a huge amount of disgraceful personal attack, presented data at a conference last week showing that the test usually used to measure IQ, is inappropriate for use with people with autism. A more appropriate scale, the Raven test, which measure abstract reasoning, consistently gives autistic people a higher score. There are more details in a  Canadian newspaper  and in a great  blog post  translating another article.

We all had fun, but for Duncan, the highlight of the day was the safari train that had been set up in the outer building. I just had to let him have a go. Oh I thought he was going to burst with happiness. Thomas was too frightened and Lady felt too grown-up so I went on with him myself. We sat in the engine and he rang the bell non-stop. It looked like this; I know because I had to Google for it when we got home. This picture was on page 6 of the Google results, but he found it. Duncan wanted me to draw it. I made a really rotten attempt but he liked it well enough. He had me stick my picture onto one of his toy carriages, one with a monkey and an elephant painted on. Lady had watched a demonstration at W5 about slime. So today we made some using corn flour, water and food colouring. It was all going well and all 3 children were having a great time getting their hands in and squelching it. I was sitting at the table with a cup of tea and my laptop just listening out. Lady took out the enormous saucepan and started teaching the boys Hogwarts spells. When I next looked, they had made rather a lot of mess. Duncan had the mixture all over his face hair and clothes. They had decided to make some more by themselves and had used up 2 full bottles of food colouring. I had a bit of a rage about that before I caught myself on. We cleaned up a bit, though Duncan still has a bright blue nose and green hands! Oh yes, I\u2019ve just remembered. Duncan\u2019s contribution to the clean-up was to fetch the mop from the upstairs bathroom where I\u2019d just used it. I said, \u2018Duncan, get the mop.  I want the mop\u2019. Hr went up the stairs and returned a few minutes later empty handed. I said again, \u2018Duncan, get the mop for Mummy. Mop to clean the floor\u2019, then I mimed mopping the floor. Duncan went off again, saying \u2018mop, clean floor!\u2019 I heard a bit of a squelching wet sound, then he came down the stairs proudly bearing the wet mop. He\u2019d stuck it into the (thankfully clean) toilet, because, he\u2019d obviously reasoned, you can\u2019t clean the floor with a dry mop! Later Duncan was having a bit of a whine about something or other. I tickled him and asked him if was grumpy like Captain Hook. He laughed and pointed to himself saying, Peter Pan, then pointed to me saying Captain Hook. Then he ran away saying \u2018Mummy chase me, Captain Hook, crocodile, SNAP!\u2019 I just heard Thomas talking to Duncan in the special simplified way; \u2018Duncan watch Bambi with Thomas? Yes watch Bambi?\u2019 Then he turns to me and says \u2018We would like to watch the Bambi video. Will you get it for us please?\u2019 I love that they know exactly how to communicate best with Duncan. They play together every day and really enjoy each other\u2019s company.

{"date": "23 Feb 2006", "body": "\nDuncan didn\u2019t go to school today or yesterday. The half-term break has ended and yesterday morning I brought him his school uniform to help him get dressed. When he saw it, he became distressed and said \u2018NO school, I don\u2019t want school. I don\u2019t like it\u2019. I asked him what he wanted and he told me he wanted \u2018home\u2019. He was very clear about this. Gordon was with me and I told him there was no way I was going to be able OR willing to force Duncan out to school that morning. So I called the school and said he had a cold, well he does have a bit of a cough. So now what. I have always intend to home educate Duncan some time, I was just waiting for the imaginary \u2018right time\u2019. This might well be it. I have heard of very few autistic children who are thriving in school; any school. However I\u2019ve heard countless reports from parents about the terrible difficulties their children are having, the lack of understanding for their differences and the constant battles with the education authorities to provide the appropriate support. The reports I\u2019ve read by autistic adults of their school days, are dire; a litany of bullying and intolerance. Duncan was spending almost an hour every morning on a school bus. He was arriving at school full of energy and recently, he\u2019s been allowed to run around for a bit before being expected to settle down. According to his home-school diary, he has enjoyed many activities at school. But he has also been expected to participate in assemblies. To him this is a meaningless activity. The teacher told me last month that he won\u2019t settle in assembly though he used to \u2018sit nicely\u2019 before \u2018when he wasn\u2019t used to it and was a bit overawed by the big room\u2019. Is that supposed to be good?  One of his IEP (individual education plan) targets was to be better at standing in line! In this month\u2019s IEP, a target is \u2018to participate in PE with less support\u2019. The strategies they have used include \u2018praise for appropriate responses\u2019 and \u2018use of time out when he refuses to co-operate\u2019.  They have also been using a reward system of gold stars and Cheerios, you know, the dog-training approach. I want to get him out before they squash him. In terms of learning; Duncan is a very clever boy in spite of his developmental delays. His language and processing difficulties mean that it\u2019s difficult to explain concepts to him in the usual way. But he is linking concepts in his own way, like setting up his tracks to emulate what he\u2019s watching on a Thomas video. He gets other props, when he\u2019s watching other videos and acts out the scenarios. He\u2019s also starting to recognise lots of words when I read to him. (It\u2019s no surprise that he can read Fat Controller and the names of all the engines!) The computer is a very important tool and his use of it was very limited at school. The teachers were shocked at his mouse control and ability to use bookmarks and flick through pages. We take that for granted here, where he uses the computer as much as he wants. I have read the legal requirements for de-registering a child from a special school and although the Education Board might try to be a bit awkward, I\u2019m not phased by them. Gordon isn\u2019t sure about doing this right now. He thinks we should keep him at the school until the summer and then see how I get on with them all over the holidays. He\u2019s worried if it would be wrong for Duncan to spend so much time with me and thinks that having him used to other adults is important. He\u2019s also worried about how I would cope. That\u2019s my concern. I want to do what\u2019s best for all the children. One thing is certain, I\u2019m going to have to become more organised. It is easy enough to drag Thomas and Lady round the supermarket to do the shopping, but taking Duncan is a whole different story.

When I got back, Duncan was asking for a train that he had convinced himself I would buy. He was upset that I didn\u2019t have it and was making a lot of noise so I took him into the kitchen to calm down. His Grandma told me he was very unhappy while I was gone and kept saying, \u2018he has a bad cold\u2019 to excuse his behaviour. I knew that wasn\u2019t it; he was just really unhappy that I didn\u2019t get what he wanted. I empathised with him, and after a while he calmed down, though every time he remembered he became a little upset again. But it was OK, I really wasn\u2019t worried at all but his Grandma obviously was. I started to tell her about how great he\u2019s been at playing with the others and how he\u2019s talking more and even starting to read. It\u2019s hard on her to see him at his worst. She loves them all deeply but finds it much easier to engage with Lady and Thomas.  She was talking to Thomas about his beautiful eyes (he\u2019s well used to hearing  that !) and he nodded in his wise and sombre manner and said \u2018yes, the white bits are made out of paper and the black bits are made from coal\u2019, referring to his eyes! A while later, I said something to him about how I was trying to make a point (daft thing to say to a 3yo I know) and he screwed up his forehead and said \u2018points? Change the points?\u2019 because so many conversations in our family centre on trains. Lady has been drawing lots. She drew a picture the other day which she told me was of her ancestor, in a field in Jamaica and she was sweating because it was hot. Now when I write out some sums for her, she does the sums then decorates the page and writes \u2018Oh no\u2019 but crosses that out, then writes \u2018oh yes\u2019 which she circles. She also writes \u2018by Lady\u2019 on all her work, except she writes her name in Chinese characters. (A friend of Gordon\u2019s wrote it out for her last year and she copied it hundred\u2019s of times!) Duncan has been talking more and more. When he\u2019s asked something, he will now give a most emphatic \u2018no\u2019 when appropriate; when he\u2019s done something wrong (naughty) and I tell him so, 50% of the time he spontaneously says sorry and 50% of the time he says thank you when he\u2019s given something. Whatever everyone else is up to, he wants to be part of it. He was playing hide and seek with Thomas in my bed this evening. When Thomas was under the covers, Duncan was saying \u2018where is he, I can\u2019t see him\u2019 and laughing because he knew where he was, then he pulled back the duvet with a flourish saying \u2018there he is!\u2019 That was another first! Gordon really thinks he should go to school until the end of term at least. I see no point but I\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/02/when-you-want-to-hear-no.html", "title": "\nWhen you want to hear 'NO!'\n"},
{"date": "14 Aug 2008", "body": "\nSo there's this film that's just been released in the US. Ben Stiller has co-written, directed and stars in the film. It makes frequent use of the words retard and retarded. It features the stories of a white actor who is made up to play a black man and a non-disabled actor doing the whole bowl haircut, bad teeth and crap dialogue in the film-in-a-film, with the tag-line, \"Once upon a time there was a retard.\" The white actor who dons black-face is admonished by black characters in the film, but no such denouncement occurs for the other character. Instead he is told that the reason he failed to gain Oscar success, unlike previous actors who portrayed disabled characters, is that he went too far with the character. The line used at this point has already gained notoriety and T-shirt slogan status. In flicking about I found this interview on  Entertainment Weekly with the actors : The challenge with that character was to find the right line. You want to make fun of this pompous actor, but if you play it wrong, it verges on being minstrel-like. Your costar Brandon T. Jackson told me there was a scene in the script where Osiris uses the N-word and that he said it went over the line. ROBERT DOWNEY JR.:  Brandon might have saved the movie that day. BEN STILLER:  For sure. We were rehearsing in Hawaii and we got to that scene and I said to him, ''What do you think of this?'' Brandon said, ''This feels wrong.'' It was definitely a constant process of feeling it out. So the black actor advised them on what was going \"over the line\" on what \"feels wrong\" but they never thought to consult with disabled people about what might cross lines or feel wrong in their use of \"retard\" or the many examples of  insensitive dialogue and portrayals detailed  here . I'm glad disability activists are speaking out about this. I'm not going to join them in asking people to boycott the film. I won't go see it myself. Until I knew about all this stuff, I  had  intended to go as the trailer I saw looked bloody funny and I really like some of the films Stiller has been involved in. Other people can decide for themselves. I know there is an important distinction between trying to ban something and deciding not to go yourself. But there is a bit of me that feels it's all a bit \" down with this sort of thing .\" The film has already been made unfortunately, and we can't decide what other people choose to watch, read or say. But we can inform them on what we think about the controversy and why. A blog I read had a  post up arguing against the \"PC vampires\" and their weak euphemisms  and making a case for people to use language as and how they see fit. I commented there, and I'll copy from that here 'cause I'm too lazy to write the same stuff down twice. I don't think the word retard should be banned; how do you ban a word anyway? But like some people who have learning disabilities or have family members who are learning disabled, I don\u2019t like the word and want to educate people as to the reasons why. Retard is an ugly, hard and hurtful word. People can keep on saying it if they want, knowing that choosing a word that refers to people like  Brent Martin  (beaten to death because a few lads thought it was fun to pick on the \u2018tard) or my son or the thousands of people like them, and using that word as a short-hand for stupid, moronic, pathetic, just devalues these people and hurts them. Some wise people have explained the history of ugly words and how they cause harm. Others can clamour for their freedom to label stupidity after a term used to describe my son\u2019s developmental delay. They can fight to call gay people faggots. It\u2019s different when you know someone well enough and can make an in-joke. But not in a million years will I use a term associated with hate speech. Do you think when bigots attack, they accompany each kick with the PC words, or might they choose the strongest, most hateful language possible? I don\u2019t know why people are so desperate to be able to keep saying retard as an insult. I think everyone can say and write what they want. I can choose who I talk to and what I read. Just be aware of the reasons why some of us wish that word could just be quietly dropped out of circulation.    Please, just read  this one post , then decide if moderating language can be the right thing to do. And how do you make the distinction between hate speech and offensive speech? Yes sure retarded is a valid word. If I put sand in my car\u2019s tank it would retard its performance. My son\u2019s development is retarded compared to his typically developing peers. (I\u2019m not going to refer to them as \u201cnormal\u201d as that just makes him by default, abnormal.) Those are perfectly fine uses of the word.  But using that same word to mean disabled people like Duncan, and then using it as synonymous with stupid, pathetic, crap is not nice. If you drop your glass, or bash into a wall and your mates call you a retard or say \u201cjeez you\u2019re so retarded\u201d then a judgement is made on learning disabled people as the epitome of thick. Oh and just to round off, here\u2019s a much funnier and less wanky way of making the point Stiller claims he wanted to make with his movie. It's the  episode of Extras with Kate Winslet . Watch out at 4.40 in particular and notice the reaction of Gervais' character. Excellent stuff. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20217667_4,00.html", "http://www.patriciaebauer.com/2008/08/08/just-the-facts-tropic-thunder/#more-2929", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mmge8nfsyg", "http://bocktherobber.com/2008/08/cripples-retards-and-politically-correct-euphemism", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2008/08/words-hit-like-fist.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR2mBxumNe4"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/08/that-film-and-that-word.html", "title": "\nThat film and that word\n"},
{"date": "15 Aug 2008", "body": "\n Lady was 5 days old. One of Gordon's best friends and his mother visited our home to meet the new baby. The sun was shining and the world seemed to be a kind, good place. Then there was a call from home, a small town in county Tyrone not far from Omagh. For the first time, I heard about the bomb. I couldn't understand; why would there be a bomb going off in the middle of Omagh on an ordinary, sunny Saturday? The Irish people in the north and south had recently voted in huge numbers to accept a peace deal and in Northern Ireland, voters had elected First and Deputy Ministers for the devolved assembly. We had made it clear to the thugs with guns and bombs that we wanted an end to their rule of terror and that we were willing to accept compromises and make deals with our neighbours for the sake of living in peace. (The above photo shows the town minutes before the bomb, hidden in the red car, exploded. Several of the children on the left were killed.) But the dissident republican murderers didn't care about what the people clearly wanted. They decided to plant a bomb in a town full of shoppers, children out getting school uniforms, day trippers and workers. They deliberately gave false information in the phone warning, so people were moved towards danger not away from it. In the end  29 people  including 9 children  died.  In addition 2 unborn children died when their mother was killed. A few of my family members were caught up in the carnage. One of them, only nine years old, was very badly injured and though he has thankfully recovered, he had to endure multiple major operations. So that horrible day passed and the extent of the death and suffering was made known. Today, I want to pause to remember those who lost their lives, those who were injured and disabled, and the families left to grieve. I remember that no-one has ever been held accountable for the crime, and hope that those involved suffer for it, in some way, some day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Omagh_imminent.jpg", "http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/09_03/omaghbombingPA_468x507.jpg", "http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/omagh/dead.htm", "http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/omagh/dead.htm", "http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/omagh/dead.htm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/08/ten-years-ago-today.html", "title": "\nTen years ago today.\n"},

{"date": "17 Feb 2006", "body": "\nThere\u2019s an autism charity in NI. I haven\u2019t had many dealings with it; I did talk to a member on the phone when we moved here and I was going to attend a group meeting one evening, but I couldn\u2019t get away and I\u2019ve not pursued it again. But a few days ago I got a leaflet back from Duncan\u2019s school about a course the charity is organising for the parents of autistic children (or children with autism; mustn\u2019t forget to use person first language ;-) ). The course is designed to help parents understand autism and their children better and give more information on the practical support available. I considered applying to take part, especially to find out more about services I could make use of in this area. But I think I would probably sit through most of it squirming in my seat as I was forced to listen to obvious, boring or irrelevant information. I also have a low tolerance for those people who like to whine and ask loads of stupid questions, you know the kind of people who always talk the most at antenatal classes. Then I was thinking, what services could I possibly use anyway? How could outside agencies benefit my family? The answer is, I don\u2019t think they could. I don\u2019t think the risk would be worth any potential benefits. I don\u2019t want to have our names written on any more files. Since we moved here I have had just 1 paediatrician visit with Duncan, initiated by us, and he has seen the educational psychologist a few times at school. One of the things I used to hate was all the visits to paediatricians and dieticians that we used to make when we lived in London. I watched an episode of \u2018Without a Trace\u2019 late last year in which a young boy with autism went missing for a while. In the program, the parent characters tells the story of how they went to some autism support meeting at which all the couples were informed that 80% of them would divorce \u2018cause autism is so bad and it rips families apart\u2019 and all that. I remember reading that sot of stuff when Duncan was 1st diagnosed too and feeling a bit freaked out. I mean, we\u2019d need to be superhuman to hold out against that kind of statistic! (It\u2019s probably not true anyway.) But I think that these statistics could actually influence you in a negative manner. If you\u2019re having problems you might feel more likely to \u2018blame it on the autism\u2019 and admit defeat, because after all, \u2018nearly every couple with an autistic child, split up\u2019. My child\u2019s autism does limit our family in some ways but there are so many things that are much more awful than having an extraordinary child. Everyone faces difficulties in their lives, whether with money, illness, gambling or drug use or even awkward in-laws. It has helped me to accept things the way they are, to enjoy my child and laugh at some of his funny ways. If I was constantly saying poor me look at all the things our family can\u2019t do, then I\u2019d be feeling totally depressed. I am so very far from being a saint and sometimes I do just need to get away from them  all , but that\u2019s what Gordon\u2019s here for!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/02/how-to-be-superhuman.html", "title": "\nHow to be superhuman\n"},
{"date": "20 Feb 2006", "body": "\nThursday may have started with me sitting on a wall feeling as useful as flipping Humpty Dumpty, but it got much better. My dad called later that morning telling me that my baby brother (he\u2019s 24!) had come up to visit with his girlfriend and their daughter Lilly. She was born 2 days before Thomas and about 12 weeks before her due date. But she is thriving now and is a great little girl. Her mother is wonderful with her. (I was so worried about her when she became pregnant as I wrongly thought she was too young). I arranged to meet them at W5, the hands-on science place in Belfast. We all had a great time. Lilly really enjoyed it, as did her parents and Granda! Duncan played with the wooden trains for a while before seeing how many ways he could push a plastic ball into a big sucky tube (that\u2019s the scientific name for it). He sat for about 10 minutes concentrating on aligning rods on a platform before going to the castle, grabbing a flag, hoisting it onto his shoulder and marching around saying \u2018I\u2019m the king\u2019! Lilly\u2019s mum and me went off for a nice cup of tea and left the men in charge for a while too!  When we were going back to the car, Thomas was copying his big sister by walking along a low wall. He has only recently started to do this as, unlike the other 2, he\u2019s nervous about heights and uneven ground. (He insists that I carry him on and off trains and in lifts). My dad was with him and when they got near the car, Dad lifted him off and carried him over. Thomas started crying really hard and kicking and squirming. I was putting Duncan\u2019s seat belt on and he became distressed to see Thomas so unhappy so he started screaming and he bit my arm- hard. Thankfully I was wearing a leather jacket because he marked me badly. :-(  He kissed me on the arm straight after he\u2019d done it.  He always does if he realises he\u2019s hurt someone. As we drove off, Thomas was still crying and explained that he had wanted to walk on the wall to the end, just like Lady. He said he was very, very, very angry with Granda and wasn\u2019t his friend any more. \u2018You\u2019re just my Granda and my uncle and not my friend\u2019 (The uncle thing must be generalisation for male relatives). My dad apologised to him for not listening and after a while Thomas decided that he did love Granda again. It was interesting when he was telling Gordon about it later he said that he was \u2018so, so, so, so angry with Granda but it was alright because Granda was still smiling\u2019.  Everyone came back to our house for pizza and play.  On Saturday we wanted to meet again so we took the train to St Georges Market (farmer\u2019s market) in the city. Duncan\u2019s little face was a picture of joy on the train! We had some good food and Lady enjoyed the freedom of wandering around the market without us, talking to the stall holders. A Spanish group was playing. Lady told me she went up to tell the singer that she enjoyed her singing, and then they had a discussion about music!  We called in at Gordon\u2019s mum\u2019s where I stayed while Lady went to Ju Jitsu and Gordon went to the gym. Afterwards, MIL looked after all the children while Gordon and me went out for a quick coffee.  Sunday started out as a nice lazy day. I was having a bath and talking on the phone to a friend. Before the call had ended, somehow my little cuckoo children were all in the bath and I\u2019d been pushed out! We went to see some friends and had lots of good chat and yet more nice food. Thomas and his little friend (aka Jack) were off exploring in the garden and spend a good deal of time making funny faces and laughing. Duncan was a bit over active, and when we were going home it was obvious that he was exhausted as he was alternating between really grumpy and tearful. They all had a quick bite to eat then went straight to bed and conked out right away.  We watched a bit of Donnie Darko (free with Sunday times) on the laptop in bed before giving up and conking out too. (That\u2019s not some euphemism, there\u2019s other blogs for that sort of thing\u2026)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/02/busy-days.html", "title": "\nBusy days\n"},
{"date": "15 Feb 2006", "body": "\nWe had a marvellous time. We arrived late on Thursday. Lady and I were ravenous, she was \u2018so hungry I could eat my hand\u2019, but a big bowl of my sister\u2019s stew sorted us out. On Friday we went to the Natural History Museum. It was my dad\u2019s 1st time there and he was suitably impressed. I love that place. Could you imagine anyone designing a public building of such splendour today? It\u2019s a cathedral of science. Obviously, we visited the dinosaurs first! I was blown away by the evolution display and we all liked looking at the section of giant sequoia tree dating from AD 600 or so, with the dates of various historical events marked on the rings. In the afternoon I went with Lady on the train to Hampton to meet up with our friends. We meet S and I as they were walking back from school. The children were expecting to see us on the following day, so the look of surprise and delight when they caught sight of Lady was priceless. The girls ran to each other and hugged and we mums had a little tear in our eyes to see them together again. They have always acted more like sisters than friends and it meant so much to me seeing them all. The girls disappeared upstairs when we got to their house while I caught up with their mum and dad. I learned that one of S\u2019s school friends called her \u2018gay\u2019 when she was talking about how excited she was that Lady was coming over and how much she loves Lady. How is it that 7 year olds are using \u2018gay\u2019 as an insult?! Lady stayed there overnight and all the next day. She said they played all the same games they used to!  Meanwhile, I found myself childless for the evening! I joined my dad, sister and her friend for a Chinese meal after which my dad was packed off home and we bright young things ;-) hit the bar, and it was all very jolly! I also met my sister\u2019s new boyfriend (2 thumbs up). My dad said that when anyone asks him what we did in London, he\u2019ll have to say \u2018I ate\u2019! On Saturday we went to Wagamama (why doesn\u2019t someone bring this franchise to Belfast?! Please!) then to the National Gallery. I haven\u2019t been there for years and it\u2019s such a thrilling place. I never realised quite how many pictures depict the baby Jesus nursing. They moved me greatly as beautiful images of a mother and child.  I had a look at the Alison Lapper sculpture in Trafalgar Square afterwards. I like the way it sits there, among all the fighting men, an image of a strong woman, seemingly saying, I\u2019m naked, pregnant and disabled and I am  not  hiding! On Sunday my UCL-days best buddy came up to London with her family and we all went to Nandos (another one I\u2019d like to see in NI!). Her children are 1 and 3 and they are  gorgeous ! We had such a lovely time! I was delighted to get back home though. I\u2019d really missed all my boys. They\u2019d been fine, great in fact! Gordon took them out on the train to St George\u2019s Market where Duncan had a lovely time looking at the big clock (with visible mechanism!) and eating ice-cream. I\u2019d promised them a present but couldn\u2019t find what they wanted in London, so I had to get off the train on the way home to go to our local toy shop! Even then I couldn\u2019t find exactly what Duncan wanted. He was disappointed when I didn\u2019t have the right train and was crying and saying \u2018bye bye Mummy\u2019 to me. I let him be angry until he was ready to be sad and then he came over, climbed up on my knee and cried while I held and rocked him. I know he was upset with me for leaving him for those few days as well. Actually when he came back from school on Monday, he got off the bus, looked at me with a little smile and ran inside happily.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/02/london-report.html", "title": "\nThe London report\n"},

The children were looked after by their amazing grandparents and Gordon and I spent a night at a Donegal hotel called  Harvey's Point . What a place. If you are ever in the area, stay there, or at least dine there. It was perfect in every way. Once back home, we realised that it's just nice for everyone if we can leave home even for a short time and have a proper break from the routine chores and demands. But what about Pippi? I didn't want to leave her (I mean, look at that wee face, how could you leave that?) so she had to come too. I looked online and found a  house to rent  where dogs are welcome. We packed up and went the next day. The house was beautiful, if rather hard to find up in the hills of Inishowen and overlooking Lough Foyle. Thankfully the owner met us at a convenient point and showed the way. We settled in and made ourselves at home. The children and pup explored the new place. Duncan, dressed as usual these days in his self-designed Clayton-the-hunter gear, enjoyed the Border Collie who came to play in the garden, tossing a ball and his toy gun for the dog to fetch, as well as on occasion, pretending it was a gorilla and shooting it. (Clayton is the bad man in Disney's Tarzan and indulges in such vices.) We headed to a beautiful beach for a few hours. Thomas did not want to be there, as evidenced by that face. But the rest of us enjoyed it. Duncan filled his welly boots (part of the Clayton look) with a sand and water mixture and claimed to be making toffee. Pippi, who is still kept on-lead when out, got very excited at all the other dogs and barked lustfully. One of these well behaved dogs and his owner appeared to be rather taken aback by our ruffian pup whom we've started to call Asbo pup.

Lady was so pleased when we found it in the shop; she said that Duncan would be in heaven when he saw it. He was asleep when I came home. I went to his room to check on him and he woke up briefly, looked at me and mumbled \u2018bow\u2019n\u2019arrow\u2019 so I got it and put it under his pillow and he was most gratified! We all walked to the country park on Sunday. It was magical. Lady and Thomas took their scooters. Duncan found a strong stick which he slung over his shoulder. He had a great time stomping about looking and touching. He kept humming the song from the Teletubbies Animal Parade! Yesterday Thomas, Lady and me went to the Folk and Transport Museum. We had the place to ourselves! It was cold so we were glad to warm up by the fire in the \u2018rectory\u2019. The woman working there was baking soda bread on a griddle over the fire, or as Thomas calls it \u2018Sodor bread\u2019. If you know anything about Thomas the Tank engine, you\u2019ll know why!

Lady calls it \u2018the Land of Spare \u2018Oom\u2019, her first literary reference (The Lion, the witch and the wardrobe)). Lady really likes that museum and asks me non-stop questions about things she sees. We also visited the railway section of the Transport Museum, which is so impressive. With no effort, we learnt loads about how transport and power developed. In the afternoon, I took Lady to drama as usual. We always have to wait about for an hour while she is at the class and Duncan always gets a new train from the toy shop. We seem to have added a visit to one of the charity shops onto our Tuesday routine. Duncan knows they always have kid\u2019s videos so we have added a few new titles to our collection over the past few weeks. It was raining when we were going back to the car, so we had to run. I was calling \u20181, 2, 3 jump\u2019 and the boys were laughing and running and jumping. We got there extra quickly and everyone was happy!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/02/running-and-jumping.html", "title": "\nRunning and jumping!\n"},
{"date": "4 Feb 2006", "body": "\nIt\u2019s Saturday and Gordon has taken Lady to Ju Jitsu while he hits the gym. The boys are watching a DVD and I\u2019m having 5 minutes peace. Yesterday we spent the day together. Duncan stayed off school, ostensibly because he had a cold (and he does, but it\u2019s not that bad) but really because I didn\u2019t have anything in the house on Friday morning that I could pack for his lunch. So we played and read stories and I drew lots of pictures and rolled them up into small cylinders, as instructed. He has decided that he wants a bow and arrow. I think Lady told him that he could get one for his birthday, but he doesn\u2019t do anticipating future pleasure; he wants it NOW! So when Gordon came home from work, Duncan had convinced himself that Daddy had a \u2018bow\u2019n\u2019arrow\u2019 in his bag. Big tantrum ensued, and when he was finished being angry he was so sad and was crying like his heart was broken. It\u2019s hard to know what is the best thing to do in these situations. I just stay near him, usually carry him to another room and let him be angry and empathise with him. Then when he\u2019s ready he climbs onto my lap for \u2018Mummy hug\u2019. I\u2019ve asked Gordon to have a look in the toy shop for the requested object before he comes home. I know he can\u2019t have everything he wants. This demanding various things, usually trains, is one of the hardest things to deal with. On Thursday (to go back in time), I took Lady to meet up with a gang of local home-ed people for a tour of the Tayto crisp factory. I stayed with Thomas at a local leisure centre with 2 other Mums and their little ones. We all spent some time in the soft play area and the children had a great time; they even enjoyed the big ball cleaning machine that was wheeled out and set into action after someone peed in the ball pool! Thomas was quite smitten with his new friends and I enjoyed making a new friend too! Lady loved the Tayto tour. She was raving about it all the way home. They got to sample some of the crisps and she said they had big machines \u2018like in the tooth paste factory in Charlie and the Chocolate factory movie, only these ones worked\u2019. Duncan was looked after by his Grandma when he returned from school. I was a bit worried about how they\u2019d get on but he greeted her with a big smile when he got off the bus and they were absolutely fine together, thank goodness.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/02/lady-and-crisp-factory.html", "title": "\nLady and the crisp factory\n"},

When he's riding his bike he's really Percy the cheeky steam engine and he crashes into buffers or goes too fast and comes off the tracks. As well as the Thomas Tank stories, an assortment of other characters and scenarios are played out. Recently he's taken this a step further. In the past few days when he answers me or tells me something, or just is scripting one of his myriad adventures, he puts his own words in quotes. As we walk into the shop together he says, \"'Let's go!' said Duncan.\" When I don't get him a book he wants, it's, \"'You're a nasty woman,' grumbled Duncan.\" When he can't get a new Trainz engine downloaded he says, \"'Oh dear, it's all wrong' cried Duncan.\" At bedtime, when I ask him to turn the computer off and come to brush his teeth, \"'I don't want to go to bed,' moaned Duncan.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/lets-go-said-duncan.html", "title": "\n\"Let's go!\" said Duncan\n"},

{"date": "26 Jan 2006", "body": "\nLots of \u2018socialisation\u2019 today! First, a friend called over with her 5 boys. The children had a good time playing together and we mums managed to find  some  things to talk about ;-). My Thomas and her 3 yo are so cute together; they look very alike, same size, hair, eyes and skin tone. We also visited one of our old neighbours and Lady enjoyed running around on the street with her (young) old friends while Thomas played with the little 1yo girl and Duncan played with their train set and combed the kitchen for chocolate. My friend thought she\u2019d put it all away, but the eagle-eyed one found a tiny chocolate Santa in amongst her spice jars. Oh and Lady went to her Rainbow group. Don't you feel sorry for my poor isolated home-educated children! Also today, I was asked what I imagined Duncan\u2019s future would be like, bearing in mind that we cannot predict the future for any child whether special issue or not. I said I thought he would be fine, he will continue to develop skills and knowledge, his communication skills will keep improving with help from us and I hope he will be happy with himself and find work that he is good at and enjoys. I thought that he could do anything, for example, something in computing or engineering or a designer. Well I\u2019m sure I waffled a bit more than that but you get the idea! I think he will be able to live independently but need help with some mundane aspects of life. I know that this is nonsense because he could end up as a concert pianist or a monk or an astronaut (I did used to call him my little space-boy when he was 1; \u2018Duncan go home\u2019!!). What the heck do I know?! But I\u2019m not too worried. Well, I am a bit and we save what money we can and it is in the back of our minds (Gordon and I) well, Duncan might need it when he\u2019s older. (Compound interest will do more for him than chelation or ABA!) All I know is that too many people end up feeling depressed as they get older and I want him to be happy in his skin and feel loved, supported and competent at what matters to him. What\u2019s funny is another remark my friend made later; if the person she was 10 years ago could meet the person she is now, she\u2019d be shocked (earth-mother wise-woman that she is! ;-) ). I think the same; I have changed and grown so much in the past 10 years. If we can\u2019t know what we ourselves will be like, how can we hope to know what our children will be like? And finally... Today\u2019s little note from Duncan\u2019s teacher included the following; \u201cHe enjoyed PE this morning although finds the hall a huge temptation to run about in !!\u201d. :-0 Look, she\u2019s a really nice woman and is short on time when she writes these little notes, and it\u2019s nice to get them since Duncan goes to school via bus and I don\u2019t see the teachers often, but; PE, a big hall and a very active little boy; well DUH!!!

{"date": "25 Jan 2006", "body": "\nToday was one of those days when you just feel blessed. Thomas and I went to our playgroup. When I told him we would be going he asked if I was going to stay all the time, I said I would and did he want me to stay. He said yes because, \u2018then I am safe and I love you\u2019, which is a nice reason to want your Mum around. Lady visited her Grandma as usual while we were at playgroup, since it only caters for pre-school age children. It\u2019s a nice group with great coffee and cakes and since Thomas goes off and does his own thing the whole time, I get to chat with the mums and admire the babies. A woman asked me what I miss about London since moving here and it\u2019s just my sister, a few good friends and the wonderful toy library sessions run from the Project for Children with Special Needs. It was run by volunteers who gave me much needed support when Duncan was even younger and I had spent all my time at other playgroups running around after him feeling stressed, apologising constantly, picking things up that Duncan had scattered in his usual way after investigating them. My first time there, when I said sorry because he\u2019d knocked something over or was climbing on something or poking about in someone\u2019s handbag, I was told not to bother apologising, he was fine and so was everyone else. I learned to relax and let the 3 children enjoy themselves (another benefit; they allowed school-aged children to attend too). I meet some lovely families with just the best children. We got to know each other and celebrate the children\u2019s successes. I remember one day a woman came to sing with us bringing some beautiful hand puppets and she sang a little song called \u20183 little birds sitting in a tree\u2019. Duncan went right up to her, and sang right through all 3 verses in his sweet high voice, trying SO hard to pronounce the words and every adult in the room had tears in their eyes when he finished. Another man used to bring a didgeridoo and one child, who was deaf and delayed in all his development, smiled when the didgeridoo was played beside him and reached out to touch it. We\u2019d never seen him reach before then. Well I didn\u2019t bore the poor woman silly telling her all that! She also asked me about autism so I tried to give a short summary of the autistic condition! (You tend to have about 2 minutes when talking to most mums at playgroups before one of you has to see to the kids!) After Duncan came home, he wanted me to read his little Pinocchio book over and over. He was saying all the names until he got them right, and Jiminy and Gepetto aren\u2019t that easy to say! He sat behind me and looked over my shoulder as I read, hiding behind the curtain every so often when the tension was just too much to bear! I told him Gepetto is Pinocchio\u2019s father or Daddy and then talked about how his Daddy went on the aeroplane and will be back in 1 day. He said \u2018Daddy get noisy Lady\u2019 (a train he wants) and I said, \u2018no, Daddy will get sweets\u2019, to which he said, \u2018Daddy get sweets, Daddy get noisy Lady\u2019! Before they all went to bed we were watching the Madagascar DVD, the bit with a dance video for the song \u2018I want to move it, move it\u2019 (sung by that Baron Cohen bloke, you know, the funny one ;-) ). We all danced round the room as they played it 4 or 5 times!

{"date": "23 Sep 2008", "body": "\nThere have been many books written by the parents of autistic children. I admit that I have read few of these parental accounts, knowing from the reviews and book descriptions that they would bore or irritate me, perhaps even anger me. I have enough to be angry about already. So I know less than many about how  Clara Claiborne Park  would would \"use every stratagem we could invent to assail her [autistic daughter's] fortress, to beguile, entice, seduce her into the human condition\" as described in her book,  The Siege . I never got to read how Catherine Maurice's \"two children were rescued from the tragedy of autism\" (as described by the  Amazon UK  blurb) or grasp the irony of a woman writing of her anger with \"professionals who ... prey on desperate parents by offering false hopes and anecdotal accounts of miracles\" in her own version of just that,  Let Me Hear Your Voice . And I certainly wasn't going to waste my time with Jenny McCartney's woeful  Louder Than Words . \n \nI have endured a novelised version of the parental autism story as described in gory detail  here  and I think I know enough about the genre to see that they all follow a particular template: \n \n \n \n \n Baby is born \n Everyone rejoices \n Baby grows \n Mum realises baby is somehow different, something is not quite right,  or , \n Baby develops entirely typically but is vaccinated after which Mum realises baby is somehow different, something is not quite right. \n Mum struggles to get anyone to take her concerns seriously. Her husband might think she's worrying about nothing and that no child of his could possibly be anything less than perfect. All the doctors she encounters are callous and all the other professionals are harsh and unhelpful. Eventually one special therapist or teacher (but not a medic) comes along who understands and for the first time, really listens. \n After much effort and heartache, Mum and Dad are  devastated  to learn that the explanation for all the child's problems is this terrible curse known as  Autism . \n Just so we know how hard their lives are, how terrible this Autism thing is, several examples of the child's terrible behaviour are described, the tantrums and self-harm, the strange humming and abnormal interest in trains. This makes the book \"gritty\" and \"unflinching\" in the newspaper book reviews and is generally thought of as a good thing. \n The best way to garner sympathy and to dehumanise the afflicted child entirely is to describe in vivid detail, some time when the child hurt a member of the family. Mum must never write about any time when  she  (or any other adult with power over the child)  lost her temper or lashed out at the child. \n The warrior phase commences.  Mum finds out stuff the doctors don't know, or didn't want her to know. She arms herself with superior knowledge, garnered from a motley crew of\u00a0brave mavericks\u00a0or comes up with some self directed plan, and goes medieval on the autism. \n Mum is a lone crusader, challenging authority and staying strong and calm in the face of what to ordinary mortals would be insurmountable obstacles. But Mum reveals in her book, the real terror she felt, the depression and anxiety, the tears and sleepless nights, all due to the autism which has seized her child and holds him or her hostage. \n The intervention phase commences. The child gets older and matures, hopefully with lots of love and good education as well. But the intervention is credited with effecting a miraculous cure. \n The story ends by recalling just how far they have all come and how it would never have been possible without x, y or z (ABA, the  companionship of a Golden Retriever  or certain biomedical treatments). The child is said to be  normal  or  recovered , as measured by a place in the Valhalla of this type of autism parent - mainstream school. \n \n \n \nTHE END. \n \n \n \nI wrote a short version of this myself in my tale of the  magic ketchup . \nDoes anyone know of any other books that fit the template? \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.co.uk/Siege-Clara-Claiborne-Park/dp/0316690694/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222167809&sr=1-3", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Let-Me-Hear-Your-Voice/dp/070905548X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222167523&sr=8-2", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SNjcpnt81HI/AAAAAAAAAXM/BonpMApqVLY/s1600-h/529999_81765483.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-write-book-about-your-autitic.html", "title": "\nHow to write a book about your autistic child\n"},

Anyway, Lady and Thomas have spent the last hour playing on the new  BBC Jam  site and really enjoying it! So what\u2019s been happening; well, we\u2019ve all got colds. Duncan isn\u2019t so badly affected, though I have had to wash his school jumper every day; snail trails on the sleeves! I\u2019ve had a bit of a headache which has left me whining and grumping even more than usual about the VOLUME of children\u2019s noises in our house. Though to be honest I am far too loud myself, having a propensity to shout. It comes from growing up in a loud house with lots of noisy siblings, well that\u2019s my excuse! Duncan left his new train on the bus yesterday after school and was \u2018SAD and GRUMPY!!\u2019 So I joined him in a good old stomping and crying session and then showed off my superior parenting skills by distracting him from his agony (and to him, it was) by offering him some sweets. I had a big bag of Haribo jellies so I put a few into bowls for each child and hid the rest in a plastic bag so I could show Duncan the empty sweet wrapper as \u2018proof\u2019 that they were finished. If I just tell him the sweets are finished, because I don\u2019t want him to have any more, he looks in the bin and if he doesn\u2019t see the wrapper, he knows I\u2019m lying and demands more. I got the DLA forms a few days ago; it\u2019s time to make a new claim for Duncan. Filling them in 1st time round was a depressing experience \u2018cause you have to focus on all the negatives in your child\u2019s life. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be so bad this time. I\u2019m less stressed out in general now and will be able to state the difficulties and differences between Duncan and a typical 5 yo without feeling bad about it. Some of things we do are different, but that\u2019s it. It\u2019s how you choose to present it. So, on the DLA form I will bemoan the fact that my son has to wear nappies at night, while to myself I will celebrate the fact that he is completely continent during the day. I will complain that he takes ages to fall asleep and needs a lot of time every night, to myself I will celebrate our shared enjoyment of stories, especially since he has only started to enjoy being read to very recently. I will tell how I have to carry him on my back every morning when we go out to meet his school bus, but to be honest, it\u2019s nice to have that little bit of closeness before those hours of separation. There are some things I just can\u2019t put a positive spin on, and there\u2019s no doubting he is entitled to this money.

Man, that boy can handle a computer! He has great mouse control, though he uses his thumb to click. He started playing a puzzle game, dragging blocks to make a variety of shapes in a certain time and he flew though it.

The people writing to me had obviously never read any of my blog (shocking, I know) or they might have known that I'm not going to be too enamoured by that type of depiction of autism. But perhaps the publishers were responsible for giving the book a certain spin, trying to cash in on the growing market for autism recovery tales, in which autism must be presented as nothing less than demonic possession and natural maturation as a miracle. Perhaps the book itself was a  much more open, honest and thoughtful depiction of the development of an autistic child and his family's efforts to support him.

I'm a Tyrone woman, so I'm going to take the opportunity to gloat about our county's masterful defeat of Kerry in  Sunday's All-Ireland Football final . Pubs and houses in my home town were packed with cheering fans, the atmosphere was marvellous and everyone was having a great time celebrating the victory. Across the land, people north and south from 31 counties were cheering on the Red Hands, well, maybe not the Dubs. Even my sister in London enjoyed the match from a pub jammed with other Irish folk, sports fans and people just soaking the atmosphere. While all this was taking place, I was with Gordon at a nice and sedate wedding in Cambridge, England where talk of Gaelic games was not on the agenda. Gordon's best friend from his school days was the groom and Gordon was honoured to be his Best Man. It was a beautiful wedding, and I had a lovely day. My sister was kind enough to text me updates on the match and I was unable to withhold a small cry of joy when the final result came in while we were having dinner. At least it wasn't during the ceremony. Our friend is a super smart mathematician, runner and musician, and it turns out, a great speech giver. He assured me that his talents didn't stretch to dancing; he wasn't wrong. While I was enjoying a sedate and short recital of chamber music, my siblings no doubt were engaged in a baser and bawdier type of entertainment. There was a great band at the wedding too so I did enjoy a chance to dance a bit myself. I'm glad I was able to go to the wedding, it was far more important to be there than bounding about with a gang clad in red and white, but I wish they'd taken place on separate days.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SNkbz66l8-I/AAAAAAAAAXU/OyxGn7NUi2c/s1600-h/news3.jpg", "http://www.irishnews.com/appnews/540/5860/2008/9/4/596766_356129657757GiantTinn.html", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/7628281.stm"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/tyrone-gaa-win.html", "title": "\nTyrone GAA win\n"},

{"date": "26 Sep 2008", "body": "\nIt took me a long time to read  this book  by Nuala Gardner. It's short and simple, but it's the opposite of compelling. I found the writing dull, flat and pedestrian and the only person whose characterisation felt real and alive, was Nuala herself. The book consists in the main, of an account of the autistic child's birth and childhood and closely follows my   how-to-write-a-parental-autism-book template . I had hoped to find some inspiration from this story, especially since we have recently had a canine addition to the family. There is surprisingly little about the dog Henry, named after a Thomas & Friends engine, a strategy I wholly approve of. Yes, it's nice that Dale (the autistic boy) and the dog had a good human-animal relationship, but it wasn't anything all that astonishing. It just seemed to me that when the Gardners brought Henry into Dale's life, they happened upon something that interested and engaged him. They had the great idea of giving Henry a voice, as Dale was more inclined to heed them when they spoke through Henry. They used Henry as a teaching aid, maximising all those little teaching moments as they arose, and so helping Dale to develop and learn. There were no miracles. It's likely that even without Henry, they could have found another way to reach out to Dale and find a way to engage him and support his education. The story proceeds to describe all the struggles Nuala faced, first to understand just why her son was so different, and then to have her worries for him taken seriously. There's a lovely account of how her mother helped Dale learn to say his first word-tree-by patting a tree and labelling it with a single word. She then encouraged him to finish the sentence \"it's a ...\" giving him time and space to say the word, and he did. This is hailed as a miracle, which I suppose is fair enough when your child's first word comes at 26 months. (Duncan's first word-train, emerged when he was nearly 3 years old. We played lots of ending the sentence games, a favourite was to sing the Winnie the Pooh song, letting him sing the very last word -bear, which he loved to do.) I felt for Nuala when she described an incident at a playgroup when Dale didn't want to give up a plastic spoon when they were tidying up the toys, leading to a tantrum and condemnation from the other mums. I remember such things myself. The moment a professional gave voice to the word \"that petrified\" her,  autism,  she says that \"something inside me died,\" but her mum, an eminently sensible person from the sound of things, reminds her that \"he's still our Dale, and we'll do whatever it takes to help him.\" Unfortunately, Nuala struggles with this and describes how she cried and wished she \"could find a way out of this hell...wishing I was dead. I loved Dale so much, but while I respected his disability, I hated his autism,\" a sentiment that makes no sense to me. Shockingly, to her, he laughed as she cried because, apparently, of his \"lack of empathy and low comprehension of emotions.\" Just as in part 8 of my template, Nuala explains how awful things were, \"despite all our efforts to break into his world, autism was now engulfing him-and I was losing him to it.\" I wonder, do parents of children with other disabilities ever speak about their children in that way? For a book ostensibly starring Henry, we don't hear much of him until quarter of the way through the story and he's barely mentioned in the second half. As a pup, he approaches Dale, Dale strokes him and so the bond begins. Whereas Dale (like Duncan) learned lots via Thomas & Friends, Henry is a living companion, so there's lots of talk and play which both enjoy. But bad things are a-stirring, and we enter the chapter corresponding to point 9 on my template. Dale kicks the dog one day, and everyone is shocked, and it's a turning point because Dale is desperately sorry for what he did, apologises to the dog and is devastated when his mum pretends that she's calling the breeder to return Henry. But most amazingly, the child who was said to lack empathy, tells his dog that he loves him, and, stop the press, tells his parents he loves them too. Wow, they can do that? (Just so people know, Duncan's been telling us that he loves us for years, without any of these miraculous interventions.) Time passes and things happen and we're told about almost all of them in this book. There's a huge cast of characters and schools mentioned and I was losing track of who was who before long. There's a lot less about Henry than I expected, and more about their struggles to have a second child and various family traumas. Much emphasis is given to their efforts to have Dale attend mainstream school as he was \"regressing, in that he was picking up autistic mannerisms and copying inappropriate behaviour from the other children\" who were also autistic. We couldn't have those awful children contaminate him now, could we. The Gardners were not fully immune to the autism-biomed quack theories and Nuala tells of a conference with the Grandaddy of autism-vaccine nonsense himself, Andrew Wakefield. She knows that his notion of a link between MMR and autism is bunk as Dale was clearly affected from birth but she believes in his invented disease of autistic-colitis. Later, she spoke with the star attraction who recommended that they get Dale checked out, which led to an appointment at a private hospital for some unnamed medications which soon resolved his unmentioned problems. Moreover, by now Nuala has a second child, who is not exposed to the MMR, as they \"took the  informed  decision to give her single vaccines at six-month intervals ( my emphasis ).\" The Gardeners did their best to help Dale learn and progress academically and socially, enrolling him in drama classes and extra maths lessons. Dale was eventually able to attend mainstream secondary school, where he \"passed\" (my word) as non-autistic. He didn't even know he was autistic until he was around 12, when he is said to have asked his mum why he was struggling so much with his school work, \"Why did I get born with problems? Do these problems have a name?\" They had hidden the truth about his neurological condition from him for so long, it was a terrible shock to him when he was finally told the truth. It can't have helped that his mum was even then depicting autism as some sort of troublesome add-on. She told him \"if you didn't have such a strong desire to be like everyone else, you'd never be where you are now.\" Way to go at bolstering his self esteem there. Let the boy know that the aim is to pass, to hide the autism. Dale was concerned that his sister \"had it\" and Nuala assured him she was \"all right and doing well.\" But no, it turned out that her \"worse nightmare unfolded as I watched Amy [Dale's sister] slowly slipping away from me.\" What is it with these changeling metaphors and autism-parent authors? But never fear, for Henry is brought back into the story at last to save Amy as well as Dale, and when he's old and ill, Nuala's thoughts were, \"How do you let go and say good-bye to someone who has helped give you back your children?\" It's clear that Henry was a wonderful pet, gentle, loyal and well trained, but it's an exaggeration to say that he gave her back her children, who after all, hadn't gone anywhere, but just had some growing up to do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/friend-like-henry-my-thoughts.html", "title": "\nA Friend Like Henry: My thoughts\n"},
{"date": "28 Sep 2008", "body": "\nLady and Thomas had a Jujitsu class, so Duncan and I went for a walk in town together. The sun was shining and we were full of joy and energy. We chatted about our plans, Duncan requested a visit to the toy shop and I consented. But we had some business to attend to first, returning a shirt to a men's clothes shop and buying some fruit and vegetables in the greengrocer's. Duncan had a story going as we went along, all about working at the harbour and quarry masters and cheeky engines who are too big for their boots. He didn't like the greengrocer shop, preferring to stand outside while I paid for my Bramley apples (we'll be having apple crumble tonight). We like to call into the charity shops in town, and he usually spies a video he likes the look of. This time he chose a work of Canadian evil entitled  Polka Dot Shorts . We carried on down the hill to the shopping centre housing his favourite toy shop. After checking out almost every Thomas & Friends item on sale, he asked to have a Take Along Whiff. The canny folk making the Thomas films have created (or resurrected) a load of new characters, just to keep our Thomas obsessed children supplied with more items to collect. Leaving the shop we passed a woman collecting for Save the Children, I gave a few coins to Duncan to place in the box and asked if he wanted a sticker, which he did. The lady gave him the sticker, and he said \"Thank you...I love you!\" which made her smile, and made me laugh. My little smooth operator! One of my favourite charity shops was across the road. I often buy books there, using it like a long lease library. We found a couple of Disney themed back packs, one with Mickey Mouse (Thomas's favourite) and one with Chicken Little, which may have been a daft film, but Duncan likes the character. I also saw a lovely photo album/project file for Lady and a Manchester United wallet for Thomas. All these will be useful for our Florida holiday. Duncan was sitting on the floor near the door looking at some books. A car was parked right outside with its window down. A miniature schnauzer (same breed as our Pippi) in the front seat let out a loud wail of pain or complaint, which disturbed Duncan tremendously. He ran out of the shop, crying about the dog saying \"Dog is safe, miniature schnauzer will not die, it will be fine!\" He shouted and wailed and stomped about a bit. I assured him that the dog would be fine and safe, that it was not hurt any more. He said he wanted to go away, I had a fair idea that he didn't mean that he wanted to leave that place right away, but that he wanted the bad feeling to go, but I confirmed this by asking if he wanted me to take him back to the car straight away, but he didn't. As this was happening, a woman around my age walked past us into the shop. She looked at Duncan then at me and made some comment which I didn't make out, but her reprobation was written clearly in her twisted face and in the the harrumph and tutting that I did hear. Well bugger that. My boy and I were doing the best we could and I wasn't going to let some ignorant woman's mistaken superiority get the better of us. I said directly, \"pardon, I didn't quite catch that.\" She walked on, so I followed her (my ire was up) and said again, \"excuse me, did you want to tell me something?\" But she ignored me and left the shop. I probably shouldn't have said anything, but I do get fed up with the looks and whispers sometimes, even though I have a merry attitude that whingers can all take a flying leap as far as we're concerned. Anyway, I still felt good and Duncan was fine, even though he decided that the naughty man in the car had upset the dog. We met a friend of Lady's in town, to whom Duncan proffered the top of his head for a kiss, we picked up the remaining children, went home and had bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches for lunch.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/09/in-town.html", "title": "\nIn Town\n"},

On Friday we all slept in and Duncan missed the school bus. So he stayed at home and we had a great day together. We went to the library and it was actually OK. I mean the boys were quite loud and Duncan kept going behind the lady's desk to look for a (what else) Thomas video and I appeared (or was) scatty and disorganised but hey! we achieved what we set out to do! My Book People delivery arrived too. The Learn-to-read-with-Thomas books came as well as my bargain collection of 5 books for a tenner. I love a bargain! The Thomas books are a big hit with the boys and I prefer them to the usual Thomas books, nice clear illustartions with simple text. Much better for Duncan, who will know the stories by heart soon I bet. I think that is how he will learn to read, not via phonics, which they are following at school, but by looking at favourite well-known books alone, and figuring out the text himself. The weekend was nice and easy. We did a bit of shopping, cooking, cleaning and lots of playing and reading. I'm reading Phillip Pulamn's ' The scarecrow and his servant ' to Lady.  No book has ever made her laugh so much. It really is very funny. The boys likes the Usborne books Farmyard Tales and the new Thomas books.

One such example is the promotion of a supposed link between the proteins casein and gluten and autism. I wrote about this theory  here , giving links to some of the published data on the subject, showing just one review claiming that a diet avoiding both these proteins was linked to parental reporting of a decrease in their children's \"autistic traits,\" a nebulous set of criteria to measure, I think. \n \nAnyway, the idiots at PETA have heard about these theories and decided to  spin the autism hate and fear to suit themselves . They haven't even got their own stupid story straight, as the studies they mention are discussing possible correlation between autism and casein (in milk)  combined with  gluten. Do they want all children to go vegan and stop eating gluten too? Well, those fools probably do expect that. They say: \n \n\"Autism is a brain disorder that causes sufferers to have extreme difficulty communicating and relating to others. It is often marked by anti-social behavior like screaming and obsessive repetition of actions, which takes an enormous emotional toll on sufferers and their families. PETA has created a billboard to alert the public to the connection between this devastating disease and dairy-product consumption.\" \n \nSee how they have adopted the language of the previous soldiers against autism (ABA=cure adherents, anti-vaccine loons, biomedical quackery child abusers). See the soggy cereal making a big sad face, 'cos autism is so  awful and dreadful . \n \nI am angry about this. I am angry with all the lies and abuses, with these groups pushing their agenda by offending autistic people. I am angry that little children with autism are held down in the offices of unscrupulous medical practitioners while chelation agents are injected into them, I am angry that some children have to touch blue 5 times to get a sweetie in place of getting a decent education, I am angry many are forced to swallow bucket-loads of supplements and sit in HBOT tents, that others must spend hours listening to AIT tapes or drink the magic water of homeopathy instead of seeing proper doctors and having their medical issues sorted out properly. I am angry that these children are the guinea pigs for any quack out to make a buck or any dodgy researcher looking for a hook for funding of whatever crazy notion they can come up with. I'm angry that real needs like accommodation, inclusion and acceptance of autistic people are set aside while we have to battle these other evils. There's more, but I have to stop writing this at some stage. \n \nAs for diet and health links, this is not difficult. If you or your child appear to be among the many people allergic or intolerant to various food stuffs,  it makes sense to have your concerns checked out by seeing your doctor or dietitian and if necessary, altering your diet to improve your health and quality of life. \n \nPlease  sign this petition  and read the following letter from The Autistic Self Advocacy Network: \n \n \nHello all, \n \nRecently, the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) launched a new ad campaign entitled, \"Got Autism?\", misleadingly implying that the consumption of milk is associated with the cause of the autism spectrum. PETA is misinforming the public about autism and thus joining a long line of unscrupulous groups that have sought to try and spread fear about autism as a means of pushing their particular agendas. \n \nAttempts such as these treat individuals with disabilities as pawns in the efforts of other constituencies. By refusing to acknowledge the right of the autistic community to be referred to with respect instead of as the focus of public hysteria, PETA contributes to a state of affairs which marginalizes the disability community. People with disabilities, our families and our supporters deserve better than the exploitation and fear-mongering that comes about when disability is used as a means of scaring the general populace. For millions across the globe, the answer to PETA's \"Got Autism?\" question is an unequivocal yes. That should not spell the end of our lives or prevent us from being fully included throughout society. By exploiting us, PETA becomes a culprit in the social forces that marginalize people with disabilities and lead to the discrimination and prejudice that truly disable us. \n \nLet PETA know how you feel about its choice to exploit autistic people by writing to them at info@peta.org or call them at 757-622-7382 and dial 0. In addition, we encourage you to express your support for these ads' swift withdrawal by signing this online petition. \n \nRegards, \nAri Ne'eman \nPresident \nThe Autistic Self Advocacy Network \n1660 L Street, NW, Suite 700 \nWashington, DC  20036 \nhttp://www.autisticadvocacy.org \n732.763.5530 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZryPCn48cBc/U4YGAX2ohxI/AAAAAAAABfI/AgsIxHygYqw/s1600/got-autism-peta-bullshit.jpg", "http://www.peta.org/features/got-autism-learn-link-dairy-products-disease/", "http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/autismPETA/index.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/hey-peta-got-morals.html", "title": "\nHey PETA, Got Morals?\n"},
{"date": "9 Oct 2008", "body": "\nI've just had a request from someone I have recently (cyber) met and come to like and respect, to promote a fund raising campaign for  Irish Autism Action  (IAA) and backed by  mobile phone company, O2. I hate to be so negative, but I have many differences of opinion to the IAA and this campaign. When I last looked at the IAA website, there wasn't much content and it focused strongly on ABA, though I had another look today and have more appreciation for the work they are involved in. As for the O2 campaign; I  really  dislike the poster. I have long been irritated by the \"puzzle\" image of autism. I don't think autism is all that more puzzling than other varieties of the human condition, disabilities and not, nor do I think autistic people have to be \"put together\" (as can be implied by a puzzle piece). I particularly dislike the picture of the young boy with his mouth missing. I don't like the message, \"let us be the voice for children who don't have one.\" I'd be far more keen on something about enabling children's voices to be heard, or something based on the  Scope \"no voice no choice\"  campaign. As far as I can find with my Google skills (not as good as Jenny's no doubt) this is the main charity representing autism issues in Ireland. To analyse this group and their particular ideology, I read their \" message to the Irish government \" which had 8 requests:  Commit to Autism Specific Provision in health, education and family affairs  Fund Ireland's first Autism diagnostic centre, known as Solas  Provide each child with the educational intervention appropriate to their needs  Fund ABA schools  Make Autism-specific provision in secondary schools a priority  Fund ten hours of home-based support per child per week  Fund Ireland's first supported living project for adults with autism  Provide automatic welfare entitlements based on diagnosis        I commend their efforts for all of these aims except points 4 and 6. Looking further into the IAA site, their \" What is Autism \" page starts with a Donna Williams quote, \" Autism is not me. Autism is just an information processing problem that controls who I am\" After giving a standard definition of autism, they write of: \"the increasing scientific research which has investigated chronic bowel problems in some children with autism and many believe that this continuing research will eventually provide some of the answers to this previously unexplained condition and the current rise in incidence.\" and later: \"Although it is widely maintained that the increase in incidence can, in part, be attributed to better diagnostic procedures, it is apparent that the condition itself is reaching epidemic proportions worldwide.\" There is no evidence of an increase in incidence, nor of an  epidemic . It is possible to focus on the increased needs of children with autism, without twisting the truth to make a case. Among the many ways the IAA is helping autistic children, is their recently opened diagnostic centre. I saw also that they make lots of helpful information available for the parents of children awaiting or post diagnosis, about the provision of services in every county as well as advice on how to ensure your child gets the help they need and are entitled to. Heading the \" diagnosis and assessment page \" is a more admirable quote from another autistic woman, Jasmine Lee O'Neill; \"It does not have to be about tragedy or pain or loss. Bearing an autistic child is not losing that child. It's gaining a very special new son or daughter\" Like the NAS, they  provide links to the dubious biomedical therapies  groups, but include the disclaimer that \"the presence of a link in this list does not indicate that IAA supports or recommends the content of that website\". There is also mention of their work in  Supported Living Services , something I'm particularly pleased to see. However the IAA I think are best know for their lobbying for  increased provision of ABA as the educational setting of choice for autistic children. Earlier this year, they produced a really unpleasant radio advertisement which was banned by the regulator. The parents of autistic children behind the IAA  set up 13 ABA schools  now funded by the government as part of a pilot scheme. These centres of education, which have on average been in existence for 5 years or more, deliver intensive one-to-one (where necessary) scientific intervention to the children. The majority of the tutors in these centres of education have Primary Degrees in Psychology with many also holding Masters Degrees and Doctorates in Psychology. These centres of education deliver both a longer school day and a longer school year to ensure retention of the skills acquired by the children and to prevent regression during the long school holidays.  Places at these schools are highly sought and have been credited in media reports of near miraculous changes in the children attending them. I contend, that any school with intensive one-to-one teaching, and with many more hours taught each year, and an individualised education delivered to suit the learning style and sensory preferences of the child, will have good results, whether ABA is used or not. Early this year, autism was much discussed in the Irish media, particularly the ABA lobbyist's attempts to have their preferred method of therapy fully supported by the government. I wrote  here ,  here ,  here  and  here  about the hugely overinflated claims for the effectiveness of ABA and railed against the denigration of autistic people, especially children, in these articles and discussions, some of which included interviews with IAA's celebrity spokesperson, Keith Duffy. Just as I said then, I support anyone campaigning for better educational provision, better training of special education teachers, more resources for classrooms and smaller class sizes, more speech and occupational therapists, more leisure and sports facilities, measures that would help everyone. I support campaigns to reduce the wait time for diagnosis and the provision of support. I'd like to see more action on the needs of adult autistic people. I feel that the emphasis on ABA and the tactic of occasionally misrepresenting autism, will delay these aims.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismireland.ie/", "http://www.o2online.ie/wps/wcm/connect/O2/Home/IAA+Affinity", "http://www.timetogetequal.org.uk/page.asp?section=36&sectionTitle=Scope%27s+view+on+the+right+to+communicate", "http://www.o2online.ie/wps/wcm/resources/image/46865c24b2d221ca/IAAAffinity_artwork.jpg", "http://208.112.17.64/detail.asp?ID=57", "http://www.autismireland.ie/detail.asp?ID=7", "http://208.112.17.64/listing.asp?id=6", "http://208.112.17.64/listing.asp?id=51", "http://208.112.17.64/listing.asp?id=63", "http://www.autismireland.ie/detail.asp?ID=144"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/irish-autism-action-campaign.html", "title": "\nIrish Autism Action Campaign\n"},
{"date": "4 Dec 2008", "body": "\nThere have been several articles in the UK media recently about prenatal testing and the number of children with Down Syndrome born each year. Some stories have suggested that an increase in the number of children born with Down syndrome, suggests that we're living in a more  caring and accepting world , while others have  criticised the interpretation of the data , suggesting that the percentage of fetuses with Down syndrome to be aborted has not changed. Via Michelle Dawson's  TMoB board , I discovered a couple of articles in the Times,  one which disgusted me  and  one which I cheered . The first, by Minette Marrin, contains many outstandingly ignorant and prejudiced statements, like this: I am convinced that it is a grave misfortune for babies to be born with Down\u2019s or any comparably serious syndrome. It\u2019s a misfortune for their parents and their siblings as well. Sad observations over decades have convinced me: a damaged baby is a damaged family, even now. She goes on to preempt any disagreement with her views:  I resent the moral condescension of those who claim that people who think like me are not only wrong but hateful; there have been vicious attacks on me in the blogosphere by disability-lobby extremists. My point of view does not make me a heartless eugenicist. I think that this article is hateful. I'm not sure that my saying so counts as a \"vicious attack\" nor that I'm a member of the terrifying \"disability-lobby extremists\". Watch out, they're coming to a town near you with their torches, pitchforks and calls for ramps, assistive communication devices and individualised education plans! I don't think her views make her a heartless eugenicist, but they do display a belittlement of the value of disabled lives, and a inordinate emphasis on the difficulties faced by disabled people, as if non-disabled people enjoy a charmed, perfect, blissful existence.  See this example of Ms Marrin's reasoning:  In a hyper-sexualised culture that worships bodily perfection, beauty and sexual success, adult life is also bound to be painful for people with Down\u2019s.  Isn't she aware that many adults, even the non-disabled ones, have relationship problems and broken hearts and personal insecurities? India Knight, also writing in the Times,  issues a slap down . It's lovely. In response to Marrin's line: ...what more powerful \u201csocial reason\u201d could there be for an abortion than the virtual certainty that the foetus would be condemned to a life of frustration, disappointment, dependence, serious illness and poverty, to the great sorrow and hardship of its family? Ms Knight writes:    I like 'virtual certainty'. I mean, f*** science. Bugger medicine. Take your research and shove it. 'Virtual certainty', innit? No jaw-dropping medical advances taking place every year, dear me, no. Sure, your hole-in-the-heart baby - to pick one example at random - would have died  not very long ago, and is now likely to lead a full and active life, heart fully repaired, as though nothing had happened. Life expectancy for people with Down's has doubled since the 1980s - but hey. Let's not nitpick. Or, you know, believe in the fundamental decency of human beings, or in the possibility of finding joy - and pride, and strength - in unexpected places. Applause from me! And to another one fighting the ignorance, Nick, dad to Jacob and his siblings, who  tackled some blogger's assertion  that people proceeding with a pregnancy when they know the baby will be disabled, view their children as pets. Nick responded: If you are going to approach a subject of such emotive power as the right for people who have a chromosomal difference to exist, it is a noble idea to invest your strongly held opinion with first-hand experience. Go meet some downsies. Get to know them. And possibly when you\u2019re at it meet a few blind people. They\u2019ve been holding us back for ages too. The autistic ones are no better. And cancer sufferers are an insane drain on society as a whole. Idea: burn the hospitals altogether, and the clinics, and shut down any factories that make wheelchairs or crutches or other such resource-squandering gimmicks. Let the bastards with heart issues die off. The car-crash victims probably did it to themselves, so just pull the plug now and cut down on the greenhouse gas. Double win!! And when they\u2019re all conveniently out of the way we\u2019ll sit down, you, me and Dr Mengele, and we\u2019ll really have it all to ourselves. Because there won\u2019t be anyone else left. I came across another wonderful article from the  F word blog . The author, Victoria Al-Sharqi, is a disabled woman who declines naming her conditions because, as she says, \"if you can\u2019t label me, you can\u2019t define me and you can\u2019t write me off.\" She writes: Disabled people who do oppose selective abortion are usually dismissed as unqualified to speak about the topic. I lose count of the number of times that I have been told that the \u2018seriously handicapped\u2019 clause does not apply to People Like Me. It applies to those poor people who can\u2019t speak or even wipe their own bottoms, let alone appreciate life for what it is. I just don\u2019t understand what it means to be severely disabled; I\u2019m blinded by the relative mildness of my particular handicaps. But fear not, enlightenment is at hand. While I may not understand severe disability, there are plenty of able-bodied people who do, so why don\u2019t I just sit back and leave these difficult questions to the real experts? I think that every autistic person I know who has written publicly about autism and/or disability issues, has been told the same. I wrote about the development of a prenatal test for autism and selective abortion a few years ago  here  which can be summarised by this excerpt: Prenatal testing puts pressure on parents, mothers in particular, to reject a  specific  child. This is a whole different issue from that facing women who are pregnant and do not want  any  child at that time. Woman are getting the message that they would be irresponsible to chose to give birth to a child they know to be disabled. These children are seen as 'drains on society' leading 'empty and pain-filled lives'. They are said to 'cost the state too much to care for them'. This is eugenics. It is anti-feminist. Yesterday, I read another opinion on all this. A  GP blogs about a pregnant patient  of his who has discovered that her fetus has Down syndrome, who wants an abortion and who \"feels particularly bad about it because she too has read and listened to the recent ill-informed media barrage which alleges that more and more parents of Down\u2019s babies are deciding not to have abortions.\" He's critical too of the Down's Syndrome Society's chief executive  for suggesting that  the higher birth rate of Downs babies  \"seems to show that parents are thinking more carefully before opting for termination.\" Dr Crippen writes: The Down\u2019s Syndrome Association live in the same cosy world of politically correct half-truths as the para-olympics. Oh! Dear me, how dare you suggest that watching people play tennis in wheelchairs is not just as exciting as watching Wimbledon? How dare you suggest that Down\u2019s Syndrome sufferers cannot lead a completely normal life? Oh the sarcasm kills! The post contains other points I take issue with and I wrote about some of them in  my comment on the blog . Michelle Dawson also criticised the post but her concerns were written off and she  was labelled  as \"getting emotional, silly and abusive\". The majority of the comments there just make me sad, but not as much as seeing Ben Goldacre, writer of the fantastic  Bad Science blog , for whom I have great respect, linking to Dr Crippen's blog post on his own MiniBlog with the description, \"Some Crippen realities on Downs. It really is a bit scumbaggy to make parents contemplating a termination feel guilty\" Does Dr Goldacre really believe that we shouldn't discuss these issues for fear of making prospective parents feel guilty? Aren't the lives and views of a whole group of people, deemed by society to have lives that are better not lived, not important at all? Is this post \"scumbaggy\"? Isn't it worth pointing out the way the NHS screening program works, as explained  here : The NHS' so-called 'best practice' information leaflet devotes less than 3 pages to informing parents about Down syndrome. Most of this limited information is about maternal age and chromosomes rather than people. People who have Down syndrome are not featured talking about how they view their lives. Nor are their families. There are no photographs of people who have Down syndrome. This 'best practice' guidance then devotes 12 pages to describing the screening and diagnostic process in detail. The message? On balance, parents should be far more interested in learning about the screening process than the condition actually being screened for. Is that post also \"scumbaggy\"? Is it wrong to suggest that changing attitudes, better education and medical care, and more interaction with actual disabled people may be leading some people to either decline prenatal screening for disabilities or to elect to continue with a pregnancy despite knowing the child is affected? I find many of the comments on these articles and blogs disturbing in their libertarian fuck you attitude. There are many who resent the welfare state, and  laws to make society more accommodating  of disabled people.  Dave Hingsburger  had a poll on his blog recently. Like the majority of those who voted, I answered the question \"the most frustrating thing about disabilities is...\" with \"the attitude of others.\" Is it any wonder?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5219174.ece", "http://www.badscience.net/2008/11/scientific-proof-that-we-live-in-a-warmer-and-more-caring-universe/", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/minette_marrin/article5258348.ece", "http://timesonline.typepad.com/india_knight/2008/11/blimey.html", "http://timesonline.typepad.com/india_knight/2008/11/blimey.html", "http://downsdad.wordpress.com/2008/11/28/the-battlefield-of-love/", "http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2008/12/recently_i_stum", "http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2008/12/crippen-diaries-2008-december-1.html", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1088774/More-mothers-choosing-babies-diagnosed-Downs-Syndrome.html", "http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2008/12/crippen-diaries-2008-december-1.html?showComment=1228314240000#c5487454432852989374", "http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2008/12/crippen-diaries-2008-december-1.html?showComment=1228303140000#c1861401421848362365", "http://www.badscience.net/", "http://blogs.downsed.org/frank/2008/11/informed-choice.html", "http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2008/12/crippen-diaries-2008-december-1.html?showComment=1228384020000#c3603073693712809188", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/12/prenatal-testing-and-disability.html", "title": "\nPrenatal testing and disability\n"},
{"date": "20 Oct 2008", "body": "\nOmigod did you hear about how funny Denis Leary is? I know he's been like, really boring and all for the past few years, playing serious drama roles and providing  a voice  for one of my own  little moron's  favourite kiddie films. So it's just marvellous to see him try to recapture his rebellious youth when he did brave and edgy shows like  No cure for cancer  in which he went on stage and drank beer, smoked and bawled out a litany of respectable targets in a most amusing and radical manner. I suppose it's a mid life crisis thing, and he wants people to remember him at his Bill Hicks impersonating best, so he's written a book and it sounds like the most amazing, riotous, revolutionary tome. It's called \"Why we suck\" and again he gives 'em hell, lancing the inflated egos of those who put themselves in the spotlight, people like Hilary Clinton, Dr Phil and, er, those pesky disabled children. This great comedic talent wrote: There is a huge boom in autism right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can't compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks . . . to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons. I don't give a fuck what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you - yer kid is NOT autistic. He's just stupid. Or lazy. Or both. Diego the sabre tooth tiger from Ice Age with a self-portrait of Duncan. Try not to die laughing just now. When this short exert was publicised (by whom?) many people complained, among them parents with autistic children. Sadly many of the complaints tended to be like this: \"How can you laugh at autism, it's devastating and a tragedy?! Just come live in my house for a day and see how it's nothing to joke at!!\" Bleuch. The problem isn't laughing at autism, it's just how pathetic and unfunny Leary has been. Then Leary himself went and got all offended at people using their right to express their distaste at his words, by saying that the protesters  hadn't even read the book and the quote was taken out of context : ...I not only support the current rational approaches to the diagnoses and treatment of real autism but have witnessed it firsthand while watching very dear old friends raise a functioning autistic child.  The point of the chapter is not that autism doesn't exist - it obviously does - and I have nothing but admiration and respect for parents dealing with the issue, including the ones I know.   The bulk of the chapter deals with grown men who are either self-diagnosing themselves with low-level offshoots of the disease or wishing they could as a way to explain their failed careers and troublesome progeny.   Of course, this entire misunderstanding can be easily avoided simply by doing one thing-reading the book. Aw get over yourself Leary. I don't care if you acknowledge now that autism exists, even if you do qualify the statement with talk of \"real\" autism, as opposed to what; leprechaun autism? It's great to know you're onto the huge numbers of autism malingerers out there too. We parents of REAL autism kids are so relieved. I wonder how the context of the nasty quote could make it any less offensive. Perhaps the preceding excerpt was, \"Some people use autism as a platform to spout about all sorts of nonsense. They push their spectacularly idiotic ideas about \"greening vaccines\" or claim massive conspiracies exist to cover up the poisoning of children. Many claim they know what causes the condition, be it wifi, dog shampoo or milk. Others jump on the bandwagon to sell dubious and even dangerous therapies to deluded parents, or run schools that administer electric shocks to children for minor transgressions. Then there are those, who clearly haven't a decent thought in their shrivelled up brains, and who make low jibes about autistic children and their parents, saying horrible, hurtful, inaccurate and plain unfunny things like...\" I don't know how else it could be taken  in  context and not be all wrong. Leary's book has lead to a few amusing moments though, not least when Jenny McCarthy rushed out to capitalise on a bit of self-publicity and with no insight into the destruction she was effecting on irony metres the world over,  called Leary  \"obviously stupid.\" It won't be a surprise to anyone to hear that I won't be reading his silly book.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268380/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248752/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SPxrV7sPd-I/AAAAAAAAAYE/CwbqWaZGfuE/s1600-h/doc45634ff1b0517883060873.jpg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context", "http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272623265.shtml"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/denis-leary-too-funny.html", "title": "\nDenis Leary- too funny!!!\n"},

{"date": "17 Oct 2008", "body": "\nThe National Autistic Society launched their \"I exist\" campaign for recognition of the needs and views of adult autistic people at Stormont yesterday. For my first time at the parliament building, the sky was startlingly blue as I made my way through the security posts to the revolving doors, location for some of the  most cutting edge performance art  the world has seen. The launch was held in the prosaically named Long Gallery, and was so well attended that there was standing room only during the presentations. I was hovering around looking a bit lost, according to the two kind souls who offered me a seat beside them near the front. I ended up sitting two rows behind the four MLAs and right next to Mark Lever, the NAS chief executive with whom I had a brief chat. First to speak were the politicians. I took notes as they spoke so can share my perceptions, though none of what follows is necessarily totally accurate. This is no Hansard report. I'll put my own thoughts in italics. John McCallister (UUP) wishes for politicians from all the parties to work together on these issues. He acknowledges there is too little known about autism and that the state needs to work on the delivery of services to support adults. He called for the release of funds to support human dignity. Iris Robinson (DUP) spoke as the Chair of the Health Committee. She said she's been interested in supporting people with autism for many years and visited the USA in 2007 as part of a cross party group with  PAPA  to find ways to meet their needs. She said there's a need to get  Statements  earlier for children and mentioned that autism is diagnosed in the USA in a different way using a \u00a31 million set of equipment called a MEG scanner. ( I looked up  MEG scanners  today since I'd never heard of them and they sound like a cool bit of kit, with SQID detectors and stuff that excites the usually dormant, medical-physicist parts of me .) So back to Iris; she reckoned the high cost of a MEG scanner is justified by the high number of children with autism in NI. It would soon pay for itself as it could be used for people with epilepsy or who have had strokes or brain injuries as well as people with autism. She finished by saying that we need to have a strong and inclusive voice and that education and social needs are especially important. ( I don't know how MEG scanners are being used to diagnose autism. They may play an important part in understanding he condition but I don't know if the limited funds available should be used to pay for one here when the need for basic support services in education, health, accommodation and employment is so great and underfunded. Also, is there really a centre of excellence in neuroscience where such a device could be put to best use, in NI? Also, there was nothing in this speech about the needs of adults .) Carmel Hanna (SDLP) spoke of the need to educate all of us to end confusion on autism issues, and said that we're all learning to listen to carers and parents about what it is like to live with autism. She said that the majority of adults with autism live at home with their parents which can cause stress and isolation for the parents, who can benefit from exchanging views with others in the same situation. She also told of the autism families who worry and dread the future and called for further training for health professionals. She said that the SDLP meets many parents and that they have a bigger lobby, and worried that older autistic people fall through the cracks in the services available and their physical and mental health can suffer, as can that of carers affected. She finished by calling for consolidation of services and said that her door is open to those needing support and help. ( The views, needs and worries of autistic people themselves were given much less prominence than the concerns of parents .) Michelle O'Neil (Sinn Fein) was unable to attend due to a family funeral, and wanted to convey her support for the campaign. Keiran McCarthy (Alliance Party) spoke last and said that he had little to add to what the previous speakers had expressed. But he added that autistic people need support, especially from the departments of health, education, employment and transport but from every other department as well so they can receive the same facilities as everyone else. He complained that various departments shy away from a joined-up approach meaning people lose out. He believes that early diagnosis of the condition would highlight the degree of spectrum ( not sure he used the word spectrum here ) to work out what provision is needed. He wished we could do more to ensure all people enjoy a fulfilling and exciting life like you and me. He finished by quoting from the report ( showing he at least read some of it ) that all are extremely valued and wanted people. \"I commit to ensure this.\" Mark Lever showed a short campaign film then spoke briefly about the aims of the campaign. He told how \"low level\" ( and presumably cheap ) support services have made a huge difference in the lives of some people. He said that gaining services is often a battle when it should be a right. He believes that if we can make people aware of autism and its impact, then more people would be keen to act to improve things. He was followed by Regina Cox who highlighted the findings of the NI report showing that many people haven't got a clue about autism. ( This is no surprise .) Regina then introduced Jenny McCleave, a young, autistic woman who read a few extracts from a short book she wrote for her family. ( I have no notes for the next two speakers as I was so engaged by them that I forgot to write anything down .) Her contribution was incredibly moving. She spoke clearly and simply about her struggles to be heard and taken seriously. She wasn't diagnosed as autistic until she was ( I think ) 18 despite telling those around her for years that she knew she was autistic from the descriptions she read of the condition. She was always told, no Jenny, there's something wrong with you but it's not that. She was so frustrated and isolated that she considered suicide, and her diagnosis was a relief and vindication of what she'd known for years. She spoke too about love and how people like her are capable of love even if they don't show it in normal ways. I, like the women sitting next to me, had tears in my eyes by the end of her short presentation. I felt so for the unnecessary suffering she's undergone, and wondered again how it is that people are so blas\u00e9 in claiming that autistic people lack empathy when the truth is often the opposite. Another autistic speaker called Rob Devlin spoke for a time. Again he described the difficulties he's faced as a child, the bullying and awful time he'd had a various special schools. His diagnosis didn't come until he was 14. He now lives at home and aged 29, is trying to get work as a voice-over artist. ( He does have a wonderful voice. ) The event ended with a talk from Geraldine Banner, described on the programme as, mother of Noel, an adult with autism. As she spoke, a huge photo of her son was displayed on the screen. I don't know if it was a particularly unflattering photo of the young man, but it felt a bit exploitative to me. She started her talk with the words, \"autism is a life sentence with no parole\" ( which jolted me, I thought it was a disrespectful choice of words ) and said it affected the family and extended family. She said that her son is severely autistic and non-verbal. He was at a special school but the placement failed when he was about 13. She contacted the Camphill school near Belfast but they didn't ahve a place for him so they got him a place in a Camphill school in Scotland. He was there for about 8 months but that too failed, \"due to his autism\". She found out about another residential school in Scotland and visited it, was impressed and determnied to have him go there. She drove back to NI from Scotland with her very distressed son in the back seat, went to see a psychiatrist in Derry and though she said the doctor advised against it, had her son admitted to hospital ( I presume she meant the psychiatric hospital ) while she got her MP to secure funding for him to go to the residential school in Scotland. He had a difficult start and displayed self-injurious behaviour and aggression towards the staff and his peers. But he battled through adolescence and recently celebrated his 21st birthday with family and friends and it was a fantastic experience. She wondered why there are no services available in Northern Ireland. So ended the event. I spoke for a few minutes to the chief executive, continuing the conversation we'd started before the presentation when I'd asked if he knew if any adult autistics would be there and I asked if they thought about showing videos by other self-advocates. He told me about various videos he'd seen and other pieces of art that represented the voice of people who wouldn't be comfortable enough to speak to a crowd or engage directly in events like this one. I asked him if he'd seen Mike Stanton's  presentation at the NAS conference about the Autism Hub , he had and he commended Mike's work. I didn't get a chance to speak with anyone else in any detail. Before I left to pick the children up from their grandmother's, I joined a tour of the building led by the UUP MLA. We headed into the debating chamber where DUP MP Sammy Wilson was talking to a group of school children (who looked utterly bored). He talked about the role of the speaker and how debates work and asked if anyone had a question. I wanted to ask, Mr Wilson, as Minister for the Environment, have you any evidence for saying, \"I am not convinced and I don\u2019t think that there is any firm evidence to show that all of that climate change is due to CO2 emissions.\" Further, is there any chance you lot will be getting back to work any time soon? But I held my tongue. So that's what happened. I have lots of thoughts about it all, some good, some bad. I think the aims of the campaign are sound and support them fully, but I worry that the ends don't always justify the means and there's still a lot to do to get people, even those presenting at an autism conference, to think differently about autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/stone-claims-stormont-raid-was-art-938948.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SPhV4IKMi7I/AAAAAAAAAX8/fKci8Zl72xE/s1600-h/800px-Stormont_Parliamentary_Building_01.JPG", "http://www.autismni.org/", "http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/SpecialEducationalNeeds/DG_4000870", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography", "http://actionforautism.co.uk/2008/09/17/hub-bloggers-at-the-international-autism-conference-in-london/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/i-exist-in-northern-ireland.html", "title": "\n\"I exist\" in Northern Ireland\n"},
{"date": "24 Nov 2008", "body": "\nWe're back home form our trip to Florida. Everyone had a great time and we made many wonderful memories. I wrote a  short post  from Gatwick airport before boarding the transatlantic Virgin flight. I may not have been so chipper then had I known what faced me for the next 11 hours or so. Lady, Thomas and Duncan make themselves at home in the V-room. The Virgin Atlantic staff were all wonderful and as helpful to us as possible. We were able to check in at the Premium Economy desk and were offered a couple of seats at a bulkhead with 3 more in a row across the aisle. I thought this would work out well for Duncan; a bit more space and no-one in front to be bothered by him pushing against their seat back. Wrong! The boys playing with Lady's Gameboy just before we boarded. Duncan sits in his  indispensable  Major stroller. (The Gameboy was lost somehow in getting onto the flight, and hasn't been seen since.) Duncan expected that after a fun time on the V-room, we'd simply jump in a taxi and in a matter of minutes, find ourselves at Disney World. After all, that's what had happened when we went to Paris. He was adamant that he wasn't getting on another aeroplane and was saying, \"no Virgin!\" I explained many times, just as I'd done at home, that we had to fly a long way to reach Disney World. He consented to board the plane and we tried to get settled in before most of the other passengers joined us. He was still a bit fussy when they were walking past and one charming man strided past, saying to me, \"I'm glad I don't have to sit beside  him .\" WTF? Jeez man I can understand that you and every other passenger would prefer on a 9 hour flight, to sit away from the loud, struggling boy, but do you really have to say it aloud to his already harassed mother? I thought of many fruity curses to throw back at him, but at least I had the decency to merely  think  them. The badge I made for Duncan, and which he quite happily wore around his neck throughout the holiday. Sitting beside us in the bulkhead seats, were a man with his 2 daughters aged about 4 years and 4 months. He was nice and understanding and his girls were a couple of sweethearts. Across from us were Gordon with Lady and Thomas, both of whom were perfectly wonderful throughout. They can see when I've got my hands full with Duncan's needs and curb their own devilment in response. In front of them was a row of three people in their fifties. The woman nearest basically stared at Duncan and me constantly for the first 4 hours or so of the flight. The couple beside her didn't stare for so much time, but made up for it with intense evil eye, head shakes, scowls and tuts. Duncan was hard work. He wanted to use the toilet almost as soon as we'd taken off even though I'd taken him just before, his teeth were hurting as I think he'd bitten one of the hard lollipops I'd brought for them to suck during take-off and landing. The noise and crowds were obviously bothering him, a matter helped little by rubber neck woman and the other staring eyes. He cried a bit and shouted out a few choice angry phrases. At one stage the baby next to us cried for a while (as babies quite reasonably do) but Duncan matched her for pitch and bested her in volume. Oh dear. I tried to distract and comfort. I got him to watch Wall-E for a while, and we looked at some books. I drew a few pictures and coloured a rocket picture book. I offered the ear defenders I'd taken, and a blanket, cap and eye mask to reduce the stimulation, but all were refused. I worked really hard the whole time, and bless him, so did he. Once when the grumpy two-some next to us gave a particularly nasty look at his distressed sounds, I called to them, \"Please, he's doing his best.\" They lent back to avoid me, and I spoke to rubber neck woman, asked her to tell them what I'd said and added, \"this is hard for him as he's autistic.\" She said that they didn't speak English. They were obviously fluent in the body language of disgust though. Gits. Rubber neck woman took the time to exclaim that I must be exhausted every night after looking after Duncan, after all, as she said, \"I'm exhausted just watching him!\" \"SO LADY, LOOK THE HELL AWAY, TURN YOUR DAMNED TV ON AND WATCH BATMAN OR SOMETHING,\" I felt like replying. Instead I explained briefly, as I really didn't feel like chit chat, that he was under undue stress and normal days are nothing like what she was seeing. Eventually after about 6 hours of this struggle, he consented to wear Gordon's super duper noise-reducing headphones. By then it was about 10pm UK time and we'd been awake since 5am, so he finally settled and slept for a few hours. Phew. Asleep, at last. Do I look worn out or what! At Orlando International, we flew through customs and immigration, encountered staff who were all pleasant and helpful and I got a kick from being called ma'am. A few hours later than expected, we arrived at our hotel apartment, finding it large, comfortable and clean. It's a pity the few hours sleep Duncan had on the flight sustained him for a night of fidgeting and bed hoping! And just in case any one's wondering, on the flight home, we arranged to sit in the rows of 3 seats alongside the galley area, thus reducing the number of passengers around us. Duncan sat between Gordon and myself while Thomas and Lady sat behind us. It was an evening flight and we'd been on the go all day. Duncan wore his cap pulled low over his eyes, ear defenders and had a blanket around his shoulders. I'd changed him into his pull-up nappy and removed his shoes. He cuddled me and Gordon gently stroked his feet and he fell asleep before the plane had even left the runway, remaining asleep for the entire journey, Yeah!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSqTxJg_tKI/AAAAAAAAAfE/mdRCPhQKUT8/s1600-h/IMG_3678.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSqTwzbeKvI/AAAAAAAAAe8/sr9yXbhQveM/s1600-h/IMG_3673.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSqTwx5HLpI/AAAAAAAAAes/zD53fogSdGQ/s1600-h/IMG_3670.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSqTxSC141I/AAAAAAAAAfM/ymt_JNipdO0/s1600-h/IMG_3700.JPG"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/11/flying-virgin.html", "title": "\nFlying Virgin\n"},

Duncan had me pull him around, going from side to side (good arm work out) and Lady obliged to play the role of the crocodile leading to squeals of delight when she closed in.

The boys wouldn't get back in. I told Lady I'd take her swimming one evening without them. So we get dressed again and as I leave, I tell the man at reception that the water in the learner pool felt colder than usual, he said he'd look into it. It's probably just because the air temperature is so low. Well, it was a heck of a lot of effort for 5 minutes of swim time.

{"date": "26 Nov 2008", "body": "\nWhy did we put ourselves though what I had a fair idea would be a  difficult flight ? Here's why... That makes sense, doesn't it! If anyone's still not convinced, have a look at a few more: See how excited Goofy is to meet my children! I bet that made his day. He's such a handsome fella! Look at that sky! After a two week long summer at home, we relished the perfect Florida weather. This little guy was so happy. He absolutely loved the parks. Lady loved the Pirate Pool at our hotel. She was a bit disappointed that we only went swimming once. Duncan got so much enjoyment out of meeting the Disney characters. I won't write a long, detailed report of our time in Florida. Well, I might do so later, but I'll give fair warning so people can skip those posts. There are a few memories I want to share now though. Before we left Ireland, I'd drawn up a detailed plan for the week, having researched the parks and working out what attractions were unmissable and what we could live without, as well as what would be suitable for the different tastes of various family members. We all agreed that the holiday had to begin with a trip to the most famous park of all, the  Magic Kingdom , which looked beautiful in the sunshine. Right away I went to the guest services desk to get a GAC (guest assistance card) for Duncan. He wanted to go straight to  Toontown  to watch the  Barnstormer . After all, he'd been poring over the park maps for weeks and looking up all the rides on YouTube, so already knew what he wanted to do and see. So going with me to get the GAC didn't sit well with his agenda and he was rather fussy as I approached the desk and told the nice lady what I wanted, reaching in to pull out some relevant documentation from my bag as I finished speaking. She immediately told me there was no need (to show her anything) and within a couple of minutes, she'd provided me with the card and a bit of red tape for the stroller, to show it should be treated at the attractions as a wheelchair. Result! Over the week, the card was so useful, as was the ability to let Duncan sit in his stroller in the films and shows, and until he was just ready to board the rides. He was much more settled than he would have been. The card allowed us to use Fast Pass entrances, or to queue away from the crowd, and always for a very short time. The longest we waited for any ride was about 15 minutes, for the excellent  Toy Story Mania  (amazing blend of high tech 3d and old skool pull-ball shoot-em-up with theming based on all the classic toys and games- one of the best) and that was only because there were 3 or so other groups with disabled people in front of us. We went on every decent ride in each of the parks. Duncan's favourite was  It's a Small World , and it's a testament to how much I love him, that I rode it 4 times with him. He also loved the  Carousel of Progress , a strange attraction for a boy his age to enjoy, being as it is, about the technological advances available to an American family at different points in the 20th and early 21st centuries. On one scene, there's a cuckoo clock on the wall, and it goes off, making the whole 30 minute, dialogue heavy show desirable to Duncan. Gordon proved his love of our son by taking him there 3 times. Lady has developed a bit of a taste for the bigger thrill rides, and went on 2 of the bigger roller coasters,  Big Thunder Mountain  and  Space Mountain . Thomas does not like coasters. He went on the kiddie coaster  Barnstormer  with me, and was utterly terrified. He asked me to give his opinion on my blog; The scariest ride that I went on was Barnstormer. The least scary ride I went on was the Carousel. My favourite ride in the Pixar studios was Toy Story Mania. That was from Thomas. Duncan opted to just watch these things and loved it. After months of looking at the videos and recreating them as best he can on Roller Coaster Tycoon, as well as drawing them and setting his train tracks up to resemble them, he was once again in front of the real thing. The staff were unfailingly delightful, smiling and helpful. We were always nice to them too of course, and very grateful for all their assistance. Once I was with the boys while Gordon spent some time with Lady. They were hungry so I took them to a cafe, ordered a couple of children's meals and tried to figure out how to bring them to a table while pushing Duncan. One of the staff offered to carry my tray, which helped so much. We never encountered that kind of positive, generous attitude in Disneyland Paris. We loved all of the parks for different reasons. We loved the lush  Animal Kingdom , the gentler pace and staff who took the time to talk to the children and point out little trails and tasks they could do, the utterly gorgeous and beguiling effigy of Everest at one end of the park, and the musicians giving children a chance to bang their drums and have a go. Duncan told me his 2nd favourite ride was the safari bus. Gordon and I took turns to ride  Expedition Everest . Just wow. The  Hollywood Studios  park was bunged with folk there to see their favourite soap stars, an event which despite all my planning, I'd failed to notice clashed with our appointed day there. But it didn't matter, they were there for the (to us) unfamiliar celebrities, while we wanted rides and shows and our needs didn't clash. We watched the studio's spectacular  Fantasmic  evening show one evening. Duncan slept through the whole thing. I'd love to go around  Epcot  without any children some time. There's so much to see and try there, if you can take your time and savour it all. But as it was, we all enjoyed the  Test Track  ride (fast, thrilling, just a bit too much for Thomas 2nd time around) and each of us but Duncan went on  Mission Space  (the easier option) which might be my favourite ride of all. It was especially good having watched the shuttle Endeavour launch just before. Duncan was keen to go to Germany in the  World Showcase  section of Epcot, and kept talking about the cuckoo clocks he'd get to see there. I was worried that there wouldn't be any and he'd be disappointed, but he knew better than me. The shop had a wall full of clocks and Duncan was in his element. He stood watching, enthralled for, oh, about five minutes and then the trouble started. He wanted me to buy one of the clocks. These things started at about $200 and even if I was willing to spend that sort of money (I wasn't) they're not exactly the kind of thing you can throw in your backpack and carry around while touring a theme park. He started to kick off, so I had to take him out. I made up a story that Daddy bought the clock, and the lady in the shop put it in a box, took it to the post office, and sent it to Santa who will bring it to him for Christmas. Yes, I lied directly to my child. (I have to get a deal on a cuckoo clock for Christmas now!) He was not happy for a while after. I wrote out what I'd said and read it to him, letting him hold the paper. He just couldn't stop thinking about the clocks and wanting to go back to see them and to get one, but I couldn't let him do that. At least when we'd been in, the shop had only just opened so we were the only (potential) customers in it. Again, we split up and I took Duncan ahead while Gordon took the others to watch a film about France (amazing and beautiful-Gordon, boring-Thomas). We ended up in the England bit, and guess what Duncan found in the toy shop- a load of Thomas the Tank stuff. He played for a while with the display train set and when he asked for a $14 wooden train, I complied and bought it, just to help take his mind off the clock. The man in the shop took the train to a back room to cut the packaging off for us, and Duncan tried to follow him. I found a toy policeman's hat, popped it on and said, \"Stop in the name of Plod!\" (It's a Noddy reference.) Duncan, either annoyed or mortified, gave me a look of disgust and said loudly, \"I hate it when you do that!\" prompting all the nice mums in the shop to look at me. As usual. Just once I sort of forced Duncan to go on a ride when he didn't want to. In  Soarin ', you sit in a row, raised and suspended over a huge screen showing footage of California scenes from the air, and fans blow and you swoosh around giving the sensation that you're flying. He panicked when he saw the ride, thinking it was a coaster but I got him on it, knowing that he'd be fine when it started, and he really did love it, grinning and pulling his feet up when it seemed we were skimming the tops of a forest. As it ended, he said to himself (a quote from a film) \"It was the best birthday ever!\" We went to out hotel pool one afternoon, and intended to go to the  Blizzard Beach  water park for a few hours one day, but it was just a wee bit too cool and windy for a few days, and then we were too caught up doing other stuff. Lady was disappointed by the omission, but didn't feel too bad since we were still having fun in other ways. We bought lots of take-aways in the evenings and ate in the apartment as we don't do restaurants with our family, not yet anyway. We ate at a few of the park counter service places, but usually in 2 sittings so someone was able to keep Duncan busy while the other ate. A few places sold these huge smoked turkey kegs, very Friar Tuck. We liked those, even Duncan managed to gnaw on one for a bit, and since he mostly ate chips (fries) ice-cream and candy floss, his ingestion of a bit of protein pleased me greatly. On our last evening, we went again to the Magic Kingdom to watch the fireworks. We were just in time to see the night time parade, with the cast and floats all lit up and looking so pretty. I pushed Duncan in his stroller to a small gap along the route, but he pushed the woman standing slightly in front of him, right on her bum. Oops! I apologised instantly, and catching sight of his badge, she laughed and said, \"oh my son's autistic too!\" The fireworks were wonderful, but the boys had both had enough after about 10 minutes, so we walked back towards the park exit, looking around every so often to see the show. We made it to the exit just as it all ended and were able to get on the monorail (we loved this) to the car park right away before the crowds. So, this seems to be a good type of holiday for us. Duncan enjoyed keeping a map in his hand at each park and knew what he wanted to see and do. Coming home, I was already thinking about what we could do for our next holiday, whenever that will be. Top contenders now are  Legoland Windsor  (and seeing our friends in London, brace yourselves) and  Drayton Manor Park  in the Midlands; it's even got a Thomas Land!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxSveaNXjI/AAAAAAAAAfU/WqT23URA4hA/s1600-h/disney6.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxSvjIktMI/AAAAAAAAAfk/gqq8erCO1nY/s1600-h/disney28.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxVNLPm7QI/AAAAAAAAAf8/cIyFhDwuz4Y/s1600-h/IMG_3710.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxVNXjiWJI/AAAAAAAAAgU/vAO7RaSYXb0/s1600-h/IMG_3859.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxVNSQ-S7I/AAAAAAAAAgM/vN1wYSzSssg/s1600-h/IMG_3840.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxVNG2SqaI/AAAAAAAAAgE/eghXqXGTIx4/s1600-h/IMG_3754.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PQ4k-AriypM/SSxSvTaR4fI/AAAAAAAAAfc/FatrsPJ5ELI/s1600-h/disney7.jpg", "http://www.legoland.co.uk/", "http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.draytonmanor.co.uk%2F&ei=ECotScmdI6beQsDiwasL&usg=AFQjCNG3JyRQ7_Cf1ArQAbVTQykWgfyjaA&sig2=l8ejuxX2aDjTDeoSAOcQVQ"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/11/so-why-do-disney-world.html", "title": "\nSo why do Disney World?\n"},

Adapted, (and far better) PETA poster by  Bev . The advertising company have taken the offensive and stupid billboards down, but  PETA are still insisting  that they're in the right. Ari Ne'eman, President of the  Autistic Self Advocacy Network  shared the good news: I am happy to announce that PETA's recent, \"Got Autism?\" billboard has been removed by the advertising company hosting it. The billboard misinformed the public about the autism spectrum by falsely implying that milk consumption was the cause of autism. Such advertising contributes to a state of public hysteria about the autism spectrum, fueling the fear and resulting prejudice that marginalizes us from society at large. It is unacceptable for autistic people, our families and supporters to be used as instruments in PETA's political agenda or that of any other unscrupulous interest group. Our community  came together  to communicate the need for a swift withdrawal of this ill-informed piece of advertising, and I'm pleased to say that were able to achieve a swift result. That we were able to accomplish this so quickly and effectively speaks well for the autistic community and the cross-disability rights movement. Thank you all for your support.

{"date": "19 Dec 2008", "body": "\nLady has cared about how she looks for a long time. Since she was a toddler she has chosen most of her outfits though often when she was younger, she'd mix it up in clashing colours that had me rolling my eyes and envying her nice, neat, pristine and coordinated friends. But I usually let her make that decision, knowing there were plenty of other battles that I had to win. As she's grown, she has developed a cool and easy style and always looks good. She's so different from myself at her age, when I had no confidence about clothes and hated shopping, worrying about what my friends might think about what I wore, and just having no idea what looked good on me. Thomas too likes to dress to impress, and gave me shopping instructions for the Big Family Christmas Party we're going to on Sunday; black trousers and a button down shirt. He's not gone too far into junior meterosexual territory yet, hasn't asked for hair gel or anything, but he makes an effort now and then. So far, Duncan has only worried about clothes when he's been dressing up. Then he'd pull together a look using stuff from his dressing up box, but also the drawers and wardrobes of all the family, if he thought it fit the part. But when we were in Florida, I was buying tops for the children, and he picked a couple that  he  wanted. One was a Spiderman shirt printed  with a picture of a rippling chest, which looks so funny on his skinny frame. But hey, he wanted that one. He also chose a bright Disney shirt and has worn it often since we got home. I've usually laid an outfit out for him each morning, but more often than not he wears what he wants. Recently there was another new development. We were in the supermarket, home to dough-nuts, sweets, crisps, DVDs and toys and so full of temptations for a boy like Duncan. He looked at these in turn, chose a packet of gum, examined as usual the case of the much wanted but at the same time feared Dinosaur DVD, then said, \"go see boy's things\" and walked off to the clothes section! I wasn't expecting that. He liked the look of shirt/waistcoat combo, saying it was a \"Lord of the Rings top.\" (Lady's just explained why; he's seen clips of the Hobbits on YouTube.) But he opted instead for a stripped and very handsome looking shirt, and a Superman T-shirt. Now he has a special outfit for the party too. I just need to think about what I'll be wearing now.

In an earlier comment  I wrote : \u201cGonzo Girl mentioned that she thought more DS births was good, not because it's more evidence of a caring society (as interpreted by The Mail) but because people will know more about how life can really be for people with DS when they have more chances to meet such people.\u201d (I should have made it clear that this is just how  I interpreted  what The Gonzo Girl had written, but I could be wrong. I hope I have not misrepresented her position.) In response,  Tom wrote :  This is an interesting statement, and one that didn\u2019t really get addressed on BadScience through all the shouting. It seems to me that, if only for social reasons it admits that there is a personal cost to being disabled. It then goes on to argue that it would be better if more people paid this cost because there would be a benefit to the whole group. This seems like a good deal for the current members of the group and a bad deal for the new ones. I am rubbish at dealing with disabled people (well, not if your just missing an arm, or something, but I\u2019m sure you know what I mean) for precisely the reason Gonzo Girl mentions. I have very little practice. So I guess I agree that increasing the numbers might bring benefits. Equally one never knows, you might end up with \u2018Downs Plague\u2019 headlines in the Mail. Predicting the reactions of society as a whole is a tough business. I think that in many ways, being in a misunderstood minority is a reason for some of the difficulties disabled people face. Like Tom said, many people never encounter (at least not knowingly) disabled people, especially those with learning disabilities or atypical neurologies like autism or Tourette's. I'm not sure what he means about this seeming \"like a good deal for the current members of the group and a bad deal for the new ones.\" I think we\u2019ve hit one of the things I think people misunderstood. The point, as I read it, was that parents were in a difficult position and the last thing they needed was to be told emotionally loaded stuff about the \u2018kind\u2019 decisions other parents were making that was simply untrue. It seems to me that it IS a bit scumbaggy to tell parents contemplating an abortion stuff that isn\u2019t true (whether for, or against) to further an agenda, moral or otherwise. The woman from the DS society said that it seemed that parents are \"thinking more carefully\" and that there now is \"greater inclusion and acceptance, with mainstream education having a huge role. We think this plays a part in the decisions parents make.\" There's nothing wrong with her saying that, but the release of and focus on badly interpreted data is wrong. People on BadScience can be kind of rough. On the whole, I find, they mean well. Even, or perhaps particularly, Dr Crippen seemed to me to acknowledge and be quite annoyed about the problems faced by the disabled (I would probably not have put the comments about the paralympics in quite the way he did.). One of the difficulties is that experience doesn\u2019t necessarily make you right and people on the forum will challenge you regardless. The dangers of quackery come up on BadScience all the time. It is a plague for disabled and {whatever everyone else is called} alike. Taking autism as a case apart, it is pretty much only the alternative medicine/anti-science movement pushing a cure. You DEFINETLY have everyone (minus a few trolls) at BadScience on your side on this point. If you say ANY cure is a bad thing, then that\u2019s something else. I really like the Bad Science blog/column, forum and the related blogs and appreciate the work they do in tackling quackery and bad science in all its forms. Heck, Ben linked here a while back and generated more hits in a few weeks than I'd had in the couple of months before. I've written about the importance of accurate science, as has Michelle Dawson many times (she's an autism researcher) as well as many of the people on the  Autism Hub  blog aggregator. I'll just say wrt a cure for autism, I think it's as likely as a \"cure\" for homosexuality, and the idea of something that would cause such a huge change in neurology is worrying to me. But should it be available and safe, I would let my son decide for himself when he's an adult. If by cure you mean, helping him to communicate more effectively, regulate his impulses and learn how to maximise his talents, then fine, bring it on. As for your question on terminology, in the context of these discussions I say non-disabled. Some say,  temporarily able-bodied . One of the feelings that I came away with from BadScience was that people are sensitised to the word \u2018pity\u2019 and almost start the conversation with \u201cI don\u2019t need your pity\u2019 (not you I hasten to add). The thread in BadScience ended with myself and a guy called The Nameless talking about what we actually felt that had been interpreted as pity. Disabled people have been made objects of pity for so long. Some charities have misguidedly presented a face of disability, usually a poor, innocent child, that is as pathetic and needy as possible to evoke pity and funds. Pity usually precludes respect and dignity. Empathising with another's pain or difficulties is fine, especially when it's understood that many of those problems come from other people's attitudes and systematic failures. The page you linked to gave me some stuff to think about. At the very least I think people are definitely less careful around disablist (new word on me) language than they are with sexist language. It can be all too easy to talk about a group of people you don't expect can hear you in a short hand way and say things that, if held up to the light, you have no choice but to back peddle away from like crazy. I appreciate Tom for taking the time to read that. There's a good (short) post  here  about disablism and language. In response to Michelle's comment, Tom wrote: This is the main point for me that never got resolved on Bad Science. The information in the DS story may *technically* have been accurate, but it was being used to make a claim, 'society getting kinder', that created a totally false impression. Telling people that, in this sense, society is getting kinder IS giving people false information. I would be shocked if Ben Goldachre was against people having access to correct information presented in a proportionate way. I think  Ben Goldacre was speaking out  against inaccurate numbers. I don't doubt that there  is  data suggesting that conditions now are better than before for people with DS; higher life expectancy, fewer people in institutions, more people employed. There probably is evidence somewhere of a more accepting attitude to the condition in society at large too. The DS births data however, wasn't evidence of such a thing and I agree that it's wrong to interpret it as such like many media sources did. Michelle wrote: But I also disagree with Dr Goldacre's (and Dr Crippen's) stated position that, because some people might feel bad, it's \"scumbaggy\" to raise concerns that are important to disabled people. Or to provide accurate information about differences in ability. What Drs Crippen and Goldacre are demanding is unquestioning adherence to the \"realities\" of disability, according to their views. They want discussion of major issues concerning disabled people to be shamed and silenced. They don't want their ideas tested (might make some people feel bad) and they don't want disabled people to get in the way of their certainties. At least, this is what they have so far expressed. As a great fan of Ben Goldacre, I was surprised to see him take the position that some ideas should not be tested or discussed, on the grounds that some people might feel bad. I agree with this. Tom responding to Michelle again wrote: I couldn't disagree with your interpretation of the Bad Science and Dr Crippen pieces. Dr Crippen rather complicated things with his digression into the Olympics, I can understand why his post upset you. In so far as Bad Science goes, are you just referring to the text of the link to Dr Crippen, or the article as a whole. As mentioned I interpreted the 'scumbaggy' comment to refer to giving factually untrue information to parents. If you have a wider criticism of Ben's article I would be very interested to hear. Dr Crippen just went weird and ranty. I felt Dr Goldacre's post was fine except for this quote, \"For many parents the decision to terminate will be a difficult and upsetting one, especially later in life, and stories like this make a pretty challenging backdrop for making it.\" I've explained why already. And yes, I was upset by the text of Ben's link to Dr Crippen's article, never mind his linking at all to what I considered a badly written post full of speculation and negative stereotyping. By the way, in coming here I realized that you folks had some what more reason to be offended than I had at first supposed. I'm still chewing that over. I just don't want it to come across like I'm busting in telling you you're wrong. It just bugs the hell out of me that we can read the same article and take away something totally different. If Tom is referring to Dr Goldacre's article, then I think he and I have interpreted it the same, though I disagree with the small section I've already mentioned. I'm not  offended , I just don't agree with all the ideas presented.  Dr Crippen's style makes defending him harder than it might have been. I can see a point in what he says about the Olympics that I have some sympathy with, but the way he put it isn't at all helpful. I won't defend that issue unless you're really keen. I thought Crippen's paralympics rant was ridiculous and his trying to defend it by saying he thinks the olympics is a waste too, didn't work. He was purporting to read the future for his fictional patient, and foresaw all sorts of dire consequences should she proceed with her pregnancy with a DS child. It was plain silly and  I commented there once . I didn't bother to try again as he was clearly uninterested in a reasonable conversation, and many of the other commenters were extreme in their views. As for assigning mental states onto others, it's best just to discuss the content of what they wrote. It's not possible to tell if they are offended or upset unless they directly say they are, like when I wrote in my post that I was saddened by the comments on Crippen's blog and more so by Dr Goldacre's link text.  \"None of what I wrote or quoted was challenged in any rational way. \" I agree there was a bunch of stuff that didn't get dealt with. That's why I followed you guys here. Personally I think it goes both ways. There seemed to be a lot of unwillingness to accept, what was for me, the central point of Ben's article, that the reasoning behind the \"society is getting kinder claim\" is simply wrong and giving wrong information to parents making these difficult decisions is bad. Well yes, the discussion in the comments got derailed from discussing the original post. But there were many issues raised that are important some of which were dismissed with a jibe about the author's emotional state. Some of the posts (I've just had another look) are obviously from people who are against the provision of all legal abortions and there's a strange comment trying to compare selective abortion to walking away from or killing off a child who acquires a disability; not at helpful or relevant. I think you Tom, were one of the few people who tried to actually engage with what Michelle and The Gonzo Girl wrote, instead of scoffing at them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/index.php", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability#Impairment.2C_culture.2C_language_and_labeling", "http://www.unreliablewitness.com/2007/05/01/political-incorrectness-gone-mad/", "http://www.badscience.net/2008/11/scientific-proof-that-we-live-in-a-warmer-and-more-caring-universe/", "http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2008/12/crippen-diaries-2008-december-1.html?showComment=1228314240000#c5487454432852989374"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-dicussion-on-prenatal-testing_11.html", "title": "\nMore dicussion on prenatal testing, disability and accuracy\n"},

He pours the milk into a bowl, adds a sprinkle of cinnamon, a dash of vanilla extract, a smidgen of sugar and a dollop of double cream, then he blasts it in the microwave. On a few occasions he placed the bowl on the floor and lapped it with his tongue, but realising it's an inefficient way for a human to consume their vittles, he went back to the more traditional method. Once, perhaps inspired by the relish with which the cartoon cats dinned on the concoction, he made a large portion up for our dog Pippi. She tried it, but didn't like it and I poured it away explaining that dogs don't like milk, just people and cats. \"And cows,\" said he. Lady's friend from next door has been to stay with us for a few nights. The girls enjoyed spending lots of time together, with late night chats and lots of time spend enjoying such pre-teen delights as the Jonas Brothers and HSM (if you don't know the acronymn, you'll not care) on YouTube. Best of all, Lady went with her friend to a school disco on Friday evening. The pair got all dolled up, Lady wearing a bit too much silvery eye shadow, so it fell under her eyes, panda fashion. A quick wipe sorted her out and off they went to face the music. I was told afterwards, that 3 boys had asked my 10 year old child to dance. Oh my. Is this the beginning of a new phase? Will I know how to strike a balance between allowing her freedom to have fun, make new friends and enjoy her journey towards adulthood with protecting and sheltering her and teaching her to make safe choices. Ah well, she's still very young. I'll just take it as it comes. Thomas was a bit put out that he wasn't able to go dancing too. He rocks the joint when he's dancing in his room, not that he knows I've seen him. He asked \"why do the girls get to go to the ball, and I don't?\" So endearing! My sister pointed out the Harry Potter connection; school balls instead of discos. To make it up to him, I took him to the soft play area this afternoon and he ran himself ragged while I supped tea and read, so different from when Duncan's there too. Duncan whiled the afternoon away by lounging in the bath (the boy has at least one a day) and checking out cuckoo clocks on ebay. He's got his eye on one that costs over \u00a3200. I bid on a couple but didn't go quite high enough so I still have to get one from somewhere before Christmas. And he's very particular about what it must look like and how it must perform. Bum.

I love writing it and knowing I've got a record of some of the family's exploits, as well as my rants about this and that. I've been at it for almost 3 years now and wonder when I'll have had enough. Lady has got some of the neighbourhood kids in for a Christmas party right now. She's made popcorn and rice crispy buns, and is playing a selection of top tunes on YouTube as they dance about. Simple pleasures eh? Gordon is off for a run with Pippi. He's been preparing for tomorrow's dinner while I wrap the children's gifts and sort out rooms, trying to prepare a bit of space for the new clutter due to join us tomorrow morning. He'll be cooking turkey with pork belly. The pork skin's got a nipple. I feel slightly freaked out by this evidence of it's mammalian beginnings. Duncan has been playing Zoombinis and re-reading the little book we made together called \"Christmas Days\" depicting the expected events of tomorrow. Thankfully I managed to source a cuckoo clock, and it's rather fine, even if it's not quite authentic and requires batteries. At least it's got a white bird and the pendulum (so I've been assured) does move so it should tick all Duncan's boxes. I might cheat and make a little label saying it was made in the Black Forest. Ah, stooping to forgery to please my son! I'll bring all the gifts down tonight last thing. We don't leave presents under the tree here, one little boy would find it too difficult to resist ripping them open to seek the clock and other items he so desires. One more thing, I have to get in a bit of a boast about Lady and Thomas and how well they did at their gymnastics competition. Thomas won all the gold medals for his age group surprising me with how hard he concentrated and how much effort he put in. Lady didn't win any medals, the standard was so much higher for the 10 year old competitors, but Gordon and I both got to see her performance and she did really well. She's strong and has great poise and grace. She desperately wants to go to more lessons and improve, so she can do that after Christmas. It was a pleasure to watch them both. I never realised that either of them are really any good! I usually drop them off outside the hall as I always have Duncan with me in the car and I don't like to take him in there. Lady was sad at first, especially since Thomas had done so well, but she's OK now and feels a bit more hopeful about the next competition. Thomas was just a picture of pride and joy as he stood in the middle of the podium 3 times. On the last time, he tuned to us, his face beaming and gave us 2 thumbs up. It was a nice thing to see.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/12/christmas-preparations.html", "title": "\nChristmas Preparations\n"},

I stayed up really late on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning to watch the results of the US presidential elections, enjoying the company of some  fellow bloggers . I was delighted with the result. From what I've seen and read about the candidates, Obama is by far the better in his policies, aims and intentions. People have chosen the candidate who is clever, accomplished and well organised. His campaign was fantastic especially when compared to the nastiness of McCain's. I'm glad there will be no more McCain \"my friend\" speeches nor any of his nonsense about autism, and I am glad the majority of Americans showed their opposition to the global screw ups his party have made, and that awful Palin woman. It's obviously wonderful to have an African American family taking up residence in the White House. I think that people all over the world who are of a minority race in their home country, will be happy with this. I know Gordon has been deeply affected. I listened to Obama's victory speech live and warmed to his inclusive address to people of all racial backgrounds, to gay and straight people, disabled and non-disabled. How about that?! But, closer to home, the Irish government has just announced their disgusting decision to scrap HPV vaccines for teenage girls due to budget shortfalls. Even if times are hard, this is a terrible decision and is a real let down. The HPV vaccine is the only medicine yet developed that acts as an effective preventative measure against a form of cancer. I live in Northern Ireland so my own daughter will still be vaccinated when she's old enough, but what about all her cousins? I have 5 wonderful nieces living in the Republic, they all deserve this protection too. \"An angry person\" by Duncan. It's how this decision makes me feel. Via  Red Mum  I read that people are being encouraged to write to Mary Harney, Minister for Health, telling her how they feel and attaching a photo of their daughter (if they have one). We've seen that when enough people are motivated to make a change, it can happen. Lets see if the Irish people can effect this small but important change.

{"date": "5 Jul 2008", "body": "\nDuncan is growing up. He has changed again since his eighth birthday. I still  have to be very careful in many circumstances, and he still can, um, surprise me by, for example, finding a pot of poster paint and decorating his trains, getting more than a little splashed around the bathroom in the process. But, I tell myself, it is so much better than when he would never have considered, as he now does, trying to avoid messing up the carpet. And there was a time when it was a substance more unpleasant than poster paint that I sometimes had to clean from various surfaces and objects. But he is desperate to be allowed to ride his bike like the other children, up and down our street. I used to walk alongside him as he rode, fearing an impulsive foray into someone's house or worse, onto the road, but that was when he was on a smaller, slower wagon. More recently I have been able to stand outside our gate and watch him as he goes, shouting for him to turn and come back when he goes far enough. I wonder what the neighbours think sometimes. This used to be a quiet street until my children started to ride around and seemingly unearthed a host of other kids to bomb up and down the street with, pretending to be a police-dog-rescue-squad, or whatever. And then there's me  guldering  (as we'd have said out west where I grew up) orders at my son. One day a few weeks back, I was talking with a neighbour as Duncan rode, and he went out of sight for a minute. Our road sweeps around in a crescent, making it fairly safe as only people with dealings in these houses have cause to drive here. I went to fetch him but couldn't see him or his bike. I called out and shortly a teenager came out from one of the houses asking if I was looking for a little boy, and one matching the description I gave turned out to have popped into their house to use the toilet. Oops! I apologised and for once gave the  autism  explanation, which she understood since she said, her best friend has autistic brother. Yesterday some of our neighbours came round for a very informal dinner. The children were in and out and all about. Duncan got out with Lady and came riding up the street proudly bearing a creme egg. Where on earth had he got  that ? Thankfully he was able to explain it was from one of their friends' houses. The dad told me later, when I was once again apologising, that Duncan had quietly come in, opened the fridge, helped himself, politely said \"thank you\" then left. He did this twice too. Ah well, at the time I was feeding their kids some hot-dogs! Earlier this week Thomas convinced me to take them to an indoor soft-play place as these same friends were going. It's a nice place, with a decent cafe and comfy chairs to entice the parents. I lost sight of Duncan almost straight away and climbed to an upper level to look for him. I spotted him streaking out of the cafe place, with a pink doughnut in his hand. I ran down and caught up with him. \"Sorry Mummy! Mummy go pay for it,\" he said, showing me he knew that what he'd done was wrong. I paid for the already eaten pastry, and I don't think the busy staff had even noticed the little Artful Dodger's pilfering. Anyway, my three children enjoyed their play, especially so as they had a few other friends there too. Just when I'd decided to give them ten more minutes, they all came to me supporting a distraught Duncan, bearing a red, sore looking eye and a face full of tears and snot. A boy had punched him right in the eye! Thankfully Duncan was with his siblings at the time so I was assured that he was blameless, and also that the transgressor had been noted and sternly spoken to. I cleaned him up and followed Lady to meet the thug, who was no more than five years old. I told him that he must not punch people, that it hurts and is very rude. The boy said that Duncan was being rude to him, which Lady denied, and I reiterated that it doesn't matter, he could go to an adult if he thought someone was doing wrong, but he must not hit them and hurt them. I told one of the staff about it all then we went home. Poor Duncan's eye was red for a while. It's shocking to think that such a small boy would decide to just punch another child like that. I wondered Duncan ignored him, or appeared odd in the way he wandered around talking to himself, making this boy feel it was OK to punch the weirdo. Gordon was worried when I told him, saying that such ill treatment is just beginning for Duncan. I refuse to accept that. I will work on Duncan as best I can to help him learn strategies to stand up for himself and stay safe, but I will also do what I can to change the prevailing attitude that difference should be feared and punished. When I was talking to Duncan about it all later, he reminisced about the doughnuts and the \"turntable\" (roundabout thing) and then about the \"naughty boy punch Duncan.\" He wasn't too upset, because we all helped him know that the other child did wrong, that hitting and hurting is bad, and we don't want anyone to hurt our boy.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/07/bully-strikes.html", "title": "\nA bully strikes\n"},
{"date": "6 Oct 2008", "body": "\nOn a cold, dark February morning, I gathered my long-legged but skinny son in my arms and carried him to the end of our street to wait for a bus. He was six years old and lacked mobility problems. Yet on that morning, like all the other mornings when I brought him out early to meet his bus, he was overwhelmed by the sleep that still hadn't quite relinquished it's hold, the inclement weather and his tension about what lay ahead and needed my arms to hold and comfort him and my neck to hide his face in. He spoke his longest sentence to date that day as he said quietly yet emphatically, \"I not go to school today.\" So we turned and went back home. He has not been to school since. When he was six months old, my maternity leave ended and I returned to the lab where I worked. While his older sister had thrived in the workplace creche, he was always distressed and it tore me up to leave him. So I ended up serving just the minimum time required to retain my maternity pay and have not returned to paid employment. He was a demanding baby and I was often shattered. I didn't know then that this child whom I'd nicknamed my \"wee marsupial\" for his desire to be attached at all times to his favourite bit of my anatomy, would gain a diagnosis of autism two months after his second birthday and four months after the birth of his baby brother. I have focused on raising these children and eschewed the heady delights of a glittering career, especially since my husband's job demands long hours and frequent trips away from home. Years ago, while reading online about autism, I encountered families who opted to home-educate their autistic children. They described the difficulties their children had faced in schools; the inflexible education system, the lack of appropriate support, the bullying and the children's feelings of inadequacy and isolation. Many had battled with the education authorities to have their children's needs recognised  or to have those needs addressed. I didn't want to spend too much time tussling with the authorities, I just wanted to raise my children. Intrigued and inspired by their stories, I researched it further, meeting with home-educating families, reading books and articles and discussing it all with my husband and our daughter. She promptly decided that she wanted to be home-educated after having attended primary school for almost two years. And so it began. My youngest son has never been to school. My autistic son had gone to a fantastic nursery and on to a special school. I knew that eventually he would join his siblings in learning without school but I worried about how I would cope with teaching all three of them, especially considering how demanding he could be. Then he moved to a new school which he never enjoyed, and clearly expressed his desire to leave, I listened and complied. I removed his name from the school register and embarked on a path of home-educating all three children. It has been wonderful and he has thrived and developed in ways which, in my ignorance, I'd have thought were impossible. I can be forgiven for having such low expectations; the overwhelming depiction of autism I was faced with at his diagnosis, was very negative and heavy on the devastation rhetoric which has evolved over time as part of the mythology of autism. But for each of my children, home-based education has allowed them to learn in a highly individualised and personally optimised setting. They are motivated to learn via their particular interests, like Doctor Who and Harry Potter, pets and wild animals, Thomas the Tank trains and roller coasters. My son is autistic. It's an integral part of him, like his gender or eye colour and affects how he learns, how he experiences the world and how he interacts with others. It is no less valid a way of being than a non-autistic life. He is wonderful,  just as he is . I am helping him and his siblings, to develop and grow to adults with the ability to think, the desire to learn and the ambition to realise their potential. I want them to have empathy and respect for others, to have confidence and self-esteem. I want them to develop the skills to solve problems and the flexibility to deal with modern life as well as they are capable. They learn that discrimination on the grounds on disability is no more acceptable than discrimination due to race, gender, social status or sexuality. Although I have the same wishes for all three children, they will not end up doing or achieving the same things and they will have different levels of independence. That's fine too. All I can do, is raise them as best I can, in an atmosphere of love and acceptance of their differences, difficulties and strengths. My house is never as tidy as I'd like; there are usually piles of books, CD Rom boxes, swimming bags, toy trains and track, marker pens, dressing-up clothes and modelling clay lying about. Perhaps since we're all at home more than other families, it's more difficult to keep the chaos in check. It's rarely quiet. The youngest might be in the kitchen perfecting his dance moves to a Justin Timberlake song, his sister in her room with the headphones plugged into my laptop and following an online maths course, while their brother designs another action packed funfair on Roller Coaster Tycoon or drawing a beautiful picture on the computer. I stay more or less sane with frequent cups of tea, the odd break to blog or to read my favourites as well as lots of hugs and chats with the three greatest (in my biased opinion) children in the world.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/10/learning-at-home-with-autism.html", "title": "\nLearning at home with autism\n"},

Didn't he make any vocalisations at all? His mum then explains that in fact, \"He has tried saying Spongebob before, but nothing clear. He has been trying for a long time, but he has properly said a word now.\"      So, it's not really accurate to claim that he finally \"broke his silence\" is it? I was wondering why they were reporting on this family, what was so newsworthy? It's nice to read about children making progress, but not exactly surprising. Autism is, after all, a condition associated with developmental delay, not stasis. The true purpose of the piece, it transpires, is to promote the  National Light and Sound Therapy Centre in London,  provider of Auditory Integration Therapy. This is an unproven, unregulated and expensive nostrum, one of the the many claimed, with merely loads of positive testimonials in place of evidence, to help autistic people. Notice however, the header of their web site, and the words, \"A registered NHS provider.\" Oh it makes me cross when taxes are spent on rubbish like that instead of evidence based therapies. The (presumably) free advertisement run in this major national newspaper continued, telling how the boy's parents; ...recently took him to the National Light and Sound Therapy Centre in London, where he underwent twice daily light and sound therapy sessions. The therapy involved listening to music through headphones while the light therapy exposed him to different colours from a light box. His mother said: \"Every day I was saying to Jamie, look it is blue today or look it is purple. Then he pointed at a door and said purple. I was really shocked and I kind of froze. I just wanted to scream and shout and tell everyone, it was so emotional.\" Mrs Jenkins said her son could not now stop saying 'purple' and 'mumma'. \"He does say purple a lot now. It is definitely his favourite word,\" she said. Zelda Landau, director of the centre, said: \"He was a delightful little boy and his family was very loving. He got on very well from the first minute.\" That ends the article. I'm sure he is a lovely boy with wonderful parents, but it wouldn't do their AIT business any favours to say anything else. I don't know much about AIT, but a quick Pubmed search showed up a  few   reviews  that didn't credit the technique with evidence of effectiveness. An Autism Hub blogger wrote a series of posts on AIT a while back, including  this one . I wasn't surprised to see the technique criticised in a Quackwatch  article on autism therapies   and autism researcher Professor Patricia Howlin wrote an  interesting article about the very sam e London centre  which is available on the NAS website . On a positive note, she wrote that the centre's staff, make it clear that there can be no guarantee of success, for any child, and parents are positively encouraged to find out all they can about the Centre before they actually pay the money for their treatment. There seems to be a genuine concern for children and their families and a wish to provide as much support as possible. But she also noted that none of the staff (at the time of her visit) had any training in autism, and her article continued; None are trained in audiometry, psychology, or language therapy although the Centre has access to advice from an audiometrist and a qualified nurse who works locally. A speech therapist may also be called in for a consultation. The most damning part of her account follows; The Centre's literature indicates a somewhat dismissive attitude to evaluation, noting that  \"parents don't really want to know how many double-blind trials have been done, how many years the children  have been monitored following treatment or what other factors might influence the results\".  As noted above, the assessments that are carried out are  not standardised in any  way  and are, on the Centres own admission, highly subjective. There are  no before and after measures , even of an impressionistic kind, and no standard audiometric assessments although discussions with audiologists outside the Centre indicate that in their view it is necessary to have an audiogram to validate the claims that AIT actually reduces the sound sensitivity. There are  no data to indicate which children seem to respond best to therapy and which children do not; nor which conditions are most amenable to therapy . (Emphasis mine.) Also, Prof. Howlin said that the standard cost of two weeks of this therapy, in 1996, was \u00a31250. For most people, the high cost of travelling to and spending two weeks in London would bump that up yet higher. The Telegraph article was what I'd expect for a small regional newspaper, desperate to fill it's pages with stories of the local person doing something out of the ordinary. Why on earth did they feel it was appropriate to present a wholly uncritical view of AIT? I wonder how many vulnerable parents, swayed more by a lack of hope and an uncritical acceptance of testimonial over evidence, will part with cash to try the silly sounds and light show with their child. They'd be better off (in my opinion) going on a proper holiday and if they really want to do something amazing for their child, make part of the holiday about something the child is really interested in, be it trains, John Deere tractors, roller coasters, Monet's paintings or windmills. I bet they'd get plenty of words from their children too. Like I've said before, there is  no need to believe in miracles .

{"date": "22 Dec 2008", "body": "\nIt happened yesterday. I'll get my complaining out of the way first. We gathered in a hotel back home, and though my Dad had requested and been promised a function room for our horde of 13 adults, 9 children and 2 babies, someone in management decided the room wasn't big enough for us and set our tables up in the main function room instead. And though we'd expected to have a room for 3 hours or so, we had to clear out after only 90 minutes to make way for a kid's disco. Then the whole meal/drinks delivery was utterly chaotic. Instead of having service at the table, we had to join the queues for their lunchtime carvery in the adjoining room. When you've got loads of hyped up kiddies, going back and forth to fetch food isn't as easy as just sitting there and having it brought to you. The food was bleuch too, apart from the soup. It seems all these sorts of places can make a decent vegetable soup, the old fashioned kind with bits of lentils and barley. Duncan ate 3 bowls of the stuff. But we were all in good form and the crack was mighty. The children were dressed in their finest Christmas specials ( some in shirts Hobbits would be proud of ) and the grown ups had scrubbed up nicely too. The children loved having the big room with a dance floor to charge around, and enjoyed catching up on all their important news; playground coups and the forging of new alliances on their streets, who's teeth had fallen out, what's happening in the world of culture (limited to HSM3, Hannah Montana and Doctor Who) and most importantly, who was getting what for Christmas. Duncan had expected a particular train and DVD for his gift. I knew which sibling was buying to him and told him the items he preferred, thinking either of them would suffice But when he got the DVD but not the train, Duncan was upset and ranted and whinged for a while about the shocking injustice of it all. Most of the time he was fine, and he liked sitting in the seats a little apart from everyone else looking at his DVD and the Thomas & Friends book he's received. But one little cousin just loves getting him all riled up, and the 2 of them had a few \"wrestling\" sessions. Often he just headed off whenever he felt like it, so my head was turned watching out for him and checking to see where he was and what he was up to. It would have been a heck of a lot easier if we were  all in a smaller room . After gulping down the meal we moved to some seats in the lounge, thankfully free of other customers so we were less likely to disturb people. The disco got going and our gang joined in. Even Duncan indulged in a bit of dancing now and then. They loved it. Up to now, only Duncan had opened a gift, special privilege and all that. We knew that letting the littlies open presents in the lounge of a hotel could be just a demonstration of the effects of entropy so we all trooped off to my brother's house. Entropy still prevailed, but we had a better chance of gathering up all the pieces in the more familiar, enclosed space and knew that, if someone got home and realised that bits of their new Hot Wheels set (or whatever) were missing, they'd be able to get them back later. The children, bless their acquisitive little hearts, liked the gift allocation bit the best. Lady gained a CD player, clothes and a beautiful necklace, Thomas got DVDs, ( Doctor Who  and  Speed Racer ) as well as Narnia dressing up clothes, Duncan has another Thomas set and Star Wars dress-up stuff. The adults all got new stuff too, and very nice it was. Perhaps next year we'll try something different, but we'll certainly have another family get together. It's so lovely to see them, and for some freaky reason or other, all the children in our extended family are delightful, sweet, cute and brilliant and we adults still really get on well and actually, genuinely enjoy each other's company!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/12/big-family-christmas-party.html", "title": "\nThe Big Family Christmas Party\n"},
{"date": "23 Jun 2006", "body": "\nWe're surprisingly organised here today. Lady is writing a letter to her very best friend in the world. Thomas is in his room playing with the wooden trains. Well no, as always, he's telling a story. Earlier he said, 'Get me the wooden trains because I want to tell a story called  The giant boy and the  other way of the tracks !' That title sounds a bit Harry Potter-like to me. He always refers to himself as the giant boy when he's playing with the trains. Duncan is sitting on my lap, wriggling and singing and closely examining a Lego 'Magic Roundabout' sword he made. Some people don't even realise that there was a sword in the Magic Roundabout! I'm a bit scratched. We had an  incident  with the guinea pigs last night. I took them out and laid them on the grass in our fully enclosed and Duncan-proof garden. Then I cleaned out the hutch. Thomas came to have a closer look at them and Crookshanks ran away towards our garden fence. I know now that Duncan-proof does not equate to guinea pig-proof! Crookshanks (she's the brown, black and ginger one, i.e. camouflaged) scooted under a gap into the garden next door; the unoccupied and overgrown garden next door. I climbed over the fence and spent about 20 minutes trying to find her and then trying to catch her. My forearms were scourged on all the branches and brambles and my left palm was jabbed by something so it looks like I've got a stigmata ;-) The poor wee cavy though was frightened and I feel so guilty for putting her in that position. I placed her in the hutch with lots of apple and dandelions to make up for her poor treatment.  My Dad said he'd build a proper run for them so I must get that sorted as soon as possible.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/lost-and-found.html", "title": "\nLost and found\n"},
{"date": "14 Jun 2006", "body": "\nI wanted to write this post, even though other people ( Abfh ,  Ballastexintenz ,  Rettdevil ,  Kevin  and  Kristina ) have already said more eloquently anything I might say, because I wanted to reach people who might read this through the Early Years home-education ring. I wrote earlier about the murder of an autistic child in the US. Many people wished we could know more about little Katie or see her photo, since the newspapers discussing the tragedy, focused on the crime and its perpetrator. All we learned about the little girl, was that she was living with her Dad and paternal grandmother so she could attend a specialist school while her mother and younger sister lived in another state where the mother worked as a doctor. Only 10 days after the family reunited, the mother killed her child by suffocating her with a plastic bag. She admitted this to the police when she was arrested. Many people then started to publicly try to excuse this murder, reasoning that 'a lack of services' may have lead to it. Katie's paternal grandfather has since  publicly refuted these ideas ; \"I too am fed up with the comments from \"advocacy\" spokespersons. How can people pretending to represent the good of children with autism ignore the murder of a beautiful and dear little child.?When I see the lead in line \"I don't approve of murder; but\u2026\" I just have to buckle my seat belt because I know, here it comes. The advocate goes on to virtually admit it is OK, or understandable because Katie had autism. If these people are \"advocates\" for people with autism I can't imagine what the \"opponents\" must be like.\" and \"When they start using a disability as an excuse for murder and say it is understandable, I go well beyond anger. When these \u201cadvocates\u201d speak of the pressure that a care giver is under 24\u00d77, I don\u2019t disagree with that. But my son and my wife were Katie\u2019s care givers for the past 20 months while Katie attend a special school in North Carolina. They not only held up to that pressure but they treasure every moment they had with Katie and are devastated by her loss. Since they lived it and loved it how can anyone use that pressure as an excuse.\" Mr McCarron was generous enough to let us know a bit about his beautiful granddaughter, \"I would like to say something about Katie. Some newspapers have reported that this was done to end Katie\u2019s pain; let me assure you that \u201cKatie was not in pain\u201d. She was a beautiful, precious and happy little girl. Each day she was showered with love and returned that love with hugs, kisses and laughter. Katie loved music; she would fill in some of the words in children\u2019s songs as my wife would sing along with the CD that would be playing, their own version of \u201ckaraoke\u201d . She liked to dance, she loved to do the \u201chooky poky\u201d. She loved being in among flowers and tall grass. She would say \u201cI like grass\u201d. She enjoyed the zoo and because of all of the drills and flashcards she could identify the animals. Which I thought was pretty amazing for such a young child. She was also the only little child in her non-autistic play group that could identify an octagon. My wife and son had a party for her the day they heard that from the teacher.\" Mr McCarron made some  photographs  of Katie available to people who wished to view and use them in a respectful way. Many of us on the Early Years ring have or know children who are not 'standard issue'. We make every effort to help and care for our children. Raising children is hard work and we're often exhausted but we need to keep being real advocates for them. We can tell people that it isn't any less wrong to kill a person, just because that person has a disability.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/06/speaking-truth-to-power.html", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=125", "http://www.rettdevil.com/katiemccarron.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=380", "http://www.autismvox.com/beautiful-precious-and-happy-katherine-mccarron/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/kt.1.jpg", "http://www.autismvox.com/i-dont-have-a-title-for-this-post-about-katherine-mccarrons-mother/#comments", "http://www.notdeadyet.org/docs/mccarron/mccarronphotos.html"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/katie-mccarron.html", "title": "\nKatie McCarron\n"},
{"date": "5 Oct 2006", "body": "\nThis boy is so cute. He has been interested in writing letters to people lately; his cousins, aunts and uncles and our friends who came to stay from England a few weeks ago. Right now he's writing one to our friend  Debs ! These missives consist of his name written in capital letters (always capitals!) on one side of a folded piece of paper, then the proposed recipient's name spelt phonetically by himself and written with reference to an alphabet book. He asks for my help for those difficult 'letters' he can't find in the book, like GR and SH! Running out of space isn't a problem either, one merely continues writing the remaining letters  above  the earlier ones. He's still a big fan of snakes and ladders and engages all our visitors in a quick game. He also enjoys 'pludo' (more commonly known as Ludo). He does his 'computer work' every day, which involves playing a Thomas the Tank CD-ROM or his favourite,  Jojo in Numberland . This is aimed at children older than him but he can do the whole thing. He loves counting and sorting. He'll spend ages looking at a number square or tape measure. It's amazing seeing how much he just learns in that 'soaking it up from the atmosphere' way! Gordon was watching TV the other night and after an ad for Tesco came on, with voice-over provided by Ronnie Corbett, he remarked on how Thomas is a bit like Mr Corbett. And he is! He tells funny stories with a totally straight face, earlier he told me about a dream he had in which he, Lady and their little cousin were in their Granda's car when they fell into some lava. Another day, he told me about his dream that he was at the South Pole and a penguin kissed him. On Sunday, my youngest brother, his girlfriend and their delightful daughter (also 4) were round with Daddy and my step mum.

{"date": "22 Jun 2006", "body": "\n Earlier in the week, I read on  Action for Autism  about an appalling article describing  antenatal screening for autism .   A UCL geneticist is applying to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, to use pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to screen out male embryos, as there are thought to be 4 times more autistic males than autistic females. She wants to offer this highly invasive and very novel screening to families where autism had 'inflicted severe suffering'. This is horrible is so many ways; autism isn't an illness, there is no way of knowing how any child will develop and anyway, you do get autistic women you know. I looked at the comments on the Daily (hate) Mail site on this topic and was distressed at the horrible things people had written. I should know better than to read that stuff. Thankfully, there is Ballastexistenz, where  every post  is amazing, but  this  really hit home. All this was getting me down and I was also full of woe, as I periodically am, at all the unremitting, thankless drag of cleaning and tidying and keeping a house in which everyone is dispensing toys and books and stuff into every corner, every day. I really need to get out more. I feel jealous sometimes of Gordon, stepping out into the world and making his mark in a very obvious and  respected way. I think sometimes, this blog is the only way I exist outside my immediate family. Then I feel a bit guilty for thinking like this. But it's not all doom and gloom round here. The children are on fine form. And we have 2 new family members; we picked up our 2 guinea pigs from the animal shelter on Tuesday. Lady has named them Daisy and Crookshanks, can anyone guess what inspired the later?! They are the cutest wee things. They're still very nervous so we've left them to settle into their hutch and just stroke them when they are willing. Lady is very sensitive to their needs. Duncan however wishes they could chase him, somehow I think they'd run in the opposite direction. Just to record a new addition to Duncan's diet; oxtail soup. He loves it! He has also nibbled at bits of raw carrot, when we were pretending to be guinea pigs! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/06/18/autism-acceptance-or-genetic-testing/", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2230764,00.html", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=132#comments"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/woes-and-cavies.html", "title": "\nWoes and cavies\n"},

Like many others, I've been thinking about our learning plans for the next few months for each of the children. There's room here for a lot more organisation and optimisation. I was a bit low for a few days there, which can be difficult as Duncan is so sensitive to my moods and he was consequently more demanding and clingy. But, spending time with these little people lifts me so I can't stay down for long. They can be hard work, but they are so funny too. Today, Duncan and me have been composing comic-strip type stories. I wrote out a few sentences and illustrated them with stick figures. Duncan helped to improve the story with a few well placed details, and he came up with the last sentence himself, so we ended up with; Duncan has a train. Duncan has a noisy small Thomas train. Duncan is playing. Duncan is happy. Mummy can draw a small Brio Thomas. He can now read all that. So for now, home-made reading books are the way for him to improve his reading ability. Earlier though, I was sitting on the floor in my bedroom reading some blogs (so time well spent then ;-) ) while Duncan played on my bed with, well I thought it was, a toy train. He came over to me saying 'fix it' and dropped something into my hand. I expected it to be a train with a loose wheel or something, not a snail with half its shell pulled off. Oh yuk! I chucked it out the window and lead Duncan to the bathroom to wash our hands, while trying to calmly tell him that he must not hurt snails. I had to wash my duvet cover too, there was some horrid looking yellow goo on it. I blame  Abfh  though, if her last post wasn't so funny and sharp, I might have been paying more attention to what my child was doing! Also today I cleaned lots and baked raisin and oatmeal cookies with Thomas. He always wears a little stripped blue and white apron when we cook so he really looks the part. I hope Lady enjoys her last day. She has loved hanging out with other children and may well miss that interaction.

Their home is big and beautiful, and they don't have a garden; they have  grounds!  Lady paired up with E, and they spent the day exploring, walking in the rain, riding bikes, practising high jumps, learning magic tricks, inventing spells, catching a frog (they released the creature again right away) and talking, talking, talking! Thomas spent his time with J, and they walked round with their heads bent, and their brows furrowed and  discussed stuff . Thomas had taken his  Harry Potter robe /Doctor Who coat and his sonic screwdriver (well, what kind of Time Lord travels without one). Duncan found a selection of Thomas the Tank Ladybird books. They were tightly packed in a large book case with only the spines on view so it was  obvious  they were there, right! He also managed to find a few chocolate sweets in a high corner cupboard in the kitchen, that S didn't even remember they had. But you know how some shark species can taste one molecule of blood in a million molecules of water, it appears that Duncan has instead, some enhanced sugar detection system. He liked their rocking horse, and J's toy monkeys and Warhammer figures. He spent most of his time siting in the middle of J's toy castle, looking at Thomas books and eating crisps. We had a really nice time. Unfortunately Duncan did manage to break a model of a barge E had made and a guitar string and...well something else no doubt :-( The only way to ensure he doesn't cause any damage, however inadvertently, is for me to stay right with him all the time.

It's being held at the local leisure centre and should be loads of fun for her. The only problem is, it lasts from 9 to 5; such a long day! We're missing her too. Thomas and I went shopping this morning. I wanted something to wear to my cousin's wedding in August. I told Thomas what would be happening, and that it probably wouldn't be much fun for him, but he wanted to come anyway. He said he wanted to see my new clothes. He gives me sartorial advice some mornings, so perhaps there's a future in fashion for the boy! (Oh, just to record a lovely Thomas moment; yesterday morning, he came into our room for his daily hug, and when I told him I had to get up, he said I just needed 'one more bit of hug-ness' before he'd let me go. He's such a darling!) So off we went, with him charming all the old ladies as usual. On Sunday we went for a long walk together, through the country park and down to the beach. On the way, the children started playing in the stream while we rested on a bench. An old woman was out walking her dogs, 2 friendly and imperturbable creatures. We said hello to each other and she was just about to turn round to the sight of Duncan standing by a tree, and who had chosen that very moment to empty his bladder. So I quickly called out 'Isn't it a lovely day' and we had a nice chat and she admired the children and thought we were a lovely family altogether ;-) When we reached the beach, Duncan started to ask for his small wand. I suddenly remembered that the last time we were at that particular beach, he had brought and lost a little toy wand. Obviously he thought it would have turned up again. I was able to distract him with a bag of pistachio nuts. I ended up carrying him on my back for a while. Our journey then took us through some meadows so they all ran through shouting 'swishy swashy' ( Bear Hunt  reference there). It was a lovely time together. In the afternoon we decided to have our first ever family trip to the cinema. We watched  Over the Hedge , and everyone enjoyed it. Gordon bought some popcorn for the boys and they sat, enthralled for the whole show. Duncan was funny; he cried a few times, when he saw the characters on-screen cry, and he was particularly taken with the phrase 'Stella, STELLA!!' shouted by the cat who was in love with the skunk; hope I'm not ruining the plot for anyone here! However, Duncan thought he was calling 'stand up' and a few times throughout the show he shouted 'stand up!' I had to tell him that we are quiet in cinemas. Duncan also looked round to the projection room a few times, with a big smile on his face. There was something about that which ticked him. I'm so happy to know there is another thing we can enjoy together as a family.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/07/new-experience.html", "title": "\nA new experience\n"},
{"date": "9 Dec 2008", "body": "\nMy dad came over early so leaving the children in his capable hands, we caught the train to Dublin, buying coffees and bacon rolls to sustain us. Ah the innocent times before we knew that dioxins had also entered the food chain in Northern Ireland pork. Dublin is a place I always enjoy visiting. The day was cold, the sky was blue and the streets around Grafton St near where we stayed, were full of folk wrapped up like Inuit. Having determined that this was to be a time to relax and unwind, I was in no mood to tramp for miles around the streets like we usually do on city breaks. This time we took taxis wherever we wanted to go, and I wore boots with silly heels, not my usual trainers. We dropped our bags at the hotel and dandered about, stopping for lunch at  Wagamamas , as  recommended  by  Mark . After a few hours of strenuous chilling out, we decided to go see a film. I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy or depressing, so we opted for the Coen brothers' \"Burn After Reading.\" I didn't like it much, too wry, too much stupidness and characters doing random stuff that made no sense. But there were a few chortles to be had and it fulfilled the purpose of passing time in an effortless manner. The next task was to have dinner. We decided to heed the  advice  of big brother Trevor and went to  The Cedar Tree  Lebanese restaurant, ordered a set of mezes and a bottle of red wine and went to work, and indeed, it was good. Now either the Lebanese wine was particularly potent or I'm a light-weight, but I was good for nothing after and despite our good intentions to prop up a bar somewhere for a while, we headed back to the room and watched the last 10 minutes of Wallander. A favourite part of spending the night away from my children, is the ritual of a hotel breakfast: the fruit juice, the fresh fruit, then the huge plate of pig meat in various configurations accompanied by some chicken embryos. But the dioxin contamination meant we were denied this pleasure so he had an omelette and I had waffles with maple syrup, not as good as the real thing. Thus fortified we had time for another dander around. Since Gordon was the birthday boy, I was happier than I usually am to spend time in music shops where he ogled bass guitars and in HMV as he browsed CDs and DVDs. We went around the department store Brown Thomas for a bit, wondering just how anyone can bring themselves to buy that sort of stuff at those sort of prices. Another chilled out train journey north, then leaving Gordon in Belfast as he had to go into work for the afternoon, I headed home to relieve Dad from child care duties. He told me that the children had been absolutely no trouble at all. Isn't that just what you want to hear from your baby sitter? After about 32 hours away from home, I felt like we'd had a week off. Just a little bit of adult time goes a long way. Thanks Dad for letting us have it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.irlbrl.com/"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2008/12/one-night-in-dublin.html", "title": "\nOne night in Dublin\n"},
{"date": "12 Jun 2006", "body": "\n Duncan was 6 years old on Saturday. Wow, six years since that magical night when he popped out (you know what I mean!) just ten minutes before midnight, six years of getting to know and understand each other. He is the most amazing and beautiful child. He really keeps me going; I have to move fast to keep up with him! But I have learned so much and am honoured by the better understanding I have of what makes us all human, since having my special boy. We celebrated in an appropriate manner by driving to a nearby countryside park which has a miniature railway which Duncan enjoyed so much, he went on it twice. We gave him a great Captain Hook pirate dressing up outfit earlier and he'd put it on straight away, then ran to his dressing up chest to find the toy hook and pirate hat he got on a previous birthday, but hadn't worn much till now. The second day of celebration was on Sunday when we had a party at home. Our friends came over with their boys and we were joined by all the grandparents. The men got busy building a barbecue (as Gordon had only bought it that day!) and then did a bit of manly cooking over coals, while I stuck some sausages in the oven for the poor, starving children who were getting fed-up waiting! We were all well fed and watered eventually. It was a lovely, sunny day and we all sat outdoors. The children took out the paddling pool, and after the men again did their duty with the pump, Gordon scooted out to the shop to buy a hosepipe so we could actually fill the thing. Meanwhile, Duncan came out with a glass of water which he tipped into the pool. He then jumped into the pool, splashed about for a while,'cause he had to test it, right! Then he went back inside saying to himself 'not enough'. He added a few more glasses, testing it each time! They had such fun when the hosepipe was finally fitted and switched on, well, my Dad did anyway. He was chasing Duncan and Lady around the garden with the water! I took out his birthday cake and everyone gathered to share it. I asked Duncan if he wanted us to sing happy birthday and he said, emphatically, no! Fair enough. So we just said happy birthday, tucked in and that cake disappeared fast. It was a grand day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/ryan1.4.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/ryan3.3.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7571/2963/1600/ryan2.0.jpg"], "link": "http://thefamilyvoyage.blogspot.com/2006/06/happy-birthday-duncan.html", "title": "\nHappy Birthday Duncan!\n"}
