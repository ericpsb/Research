I didn't care if they were trash collectors as long as they at the end of the day they could honestly say they were happy. By no means does this mean I do not or will not encourage them to reach their full potential. I will not, however, force them to do things just because they look good to other people.\u00a0 Forcing kids to do something because you feel it makes you look like a good parent, to me, is kind of the opposite of a good parent. I'm not talking about making them eat vegetables or go to sleep early, the daily nitty gritty of parenting. I am not talking about making a commitment and then walking away when they change their mind. I'm referring to letting a child find out who they really are without undue pressure to be daddy's football player or mommy's ballerina.\u00a0 Sometimes, a child's interest is very different than a parent's dream of what their child would be like when they were born. And sometimes you have a child who is not a child you ever imagined when you decided to become a parent. \n \n \n \n6 years ago today, Boy Wonder was diagnosed with severe autism. It was devastating and life changing. I felt then, and sometimes still do, feel ill equipped and vastly under qualified to parent\u00a0 a child with a disability. But BW has taught me so much. He turned the world right side up. He made me more patient (mostly), far far less judgemental and he showed me that proving people wrong is really really fun.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI may doubt my ability to make the right choices for him when he can't tell me what he wants or why he is upset but I do know for the most part that my boy is a happy kid. So while we may have a bunch of IEP goals unmet and life skills we have been working on for years at home, I do know that my biggest goal for my son is met daily, he is HAPPY and in the end that's all I ever really want for him and his sisters.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19968.John_Lennon", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3lSOqVcPM20/Un5TMuYO0vI/AAAAAAAAAgg/h2c9QsoYB5Q/s1600/photo-68.JPG"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-goal-is-happy.html", "title": "\nThe Goal is Happy\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2014", "body": "\nIn October of 2010, I wrote about autism being the  invisible disability .\u00a0 I wrote about how our children have no physical markers that signal to the world the way their brains are just wired differently. While autism awareness is more widespread today (since I wrote the original post the statistics for autism have shockingly gone from 1 in 110 to 1 in 50), the supports and services our children need are still hard fought for and sometimes denied. Services vary greatly from school district to school district and state to state. Some of us desperately need these supports for our children. It is the only way they can thrive and reach their full potential. Sometimes, it's the only way to keep them and other family members safe. We would like our children to be in the news for positive things. Not because they wandered away like  Avonte Oquendo , where the school personnel failed to keep him safe.\u00a0 Or the parents who murder their children because they see no other way out after being denied help and services time and time again. ( I absolutely do not condone murdering your child which is why there are no links to media stories. )  \n \nSo we as the parents are invisible until something horrific happens to one of our children.\u00a0 Then the media and the public pay attention.\u00a0 Then there is judgment, public outcries for justice and finger pointing. How much suffering and how many tragedies could be avoided if the people and system who are designed to help children like ours actually worked? What if, instead of judging us after the tragedy, you put your hand out and helped to prevent the tragedy. Society is reciprocal. At some point all of us will need help from one another.\u00a0 No one's life is free from difficulties. \n \nIf you are the friend of someone with a special needs child, you offering to watch the child for an hour, bringing a meal, calling with a funny joke or just being a shoulder to cry on could make a big difference. I am fortunate that I have a strong support system in place. Some friends with typical kids and a wonderful network of special needs moms and dads who will come if I call and say for today I can not face this alone. I, in turn, have the same offer on stand by for them as well. \n \nThe tragedies need to stop. They can be stopped with support, love and compassion.\u00a0 The autism rate has soared in the 6 years since Boy Wonder's diagnosis.\u00a0 Autism crosses every race, religion and socioeconomic barrier. It does not and will not discriminate. We could be you some day and we will be here for you. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/nyregion/an-outpouring-of-support-as-avonte-oquendo-is-laid-to-rest.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cRTo4GZlWhY/UvKGNlkS_NI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/N4lexUTLgUg/s1600/1891207_10151913583262555_1878512126_n.jpg"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2014/02/invisible-again.html", "title": "\nInvisible Again\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, August 6, 2013", "body": "\nWhen Boy Wonder was diagnosed with Classic Autism just under 4 years ago, the rate was 1 in 150 kids had autism. Then it was 1 in 110 kids. The current rate is believed to be anywhere between 1 in 88 or 1 in 50 kids have some type of Autism Spectrum Disorder.\u00a0 We are your \"But for the Grace of God\" story.\u00a0  \n \nWe hear what you say about our kids. We hear what you say when we aren't there to listen when you speak about our kids. And it always eventually gets back to us what you say when we aren't there. To your kids, \" Be nice to Johnny. He has special needs\" in your Florence Nightingale voice yet then you complain that your kids were placed in the inclusive classroom with our kids. \n \nYou complain about what it costs to educate our kids out of one side of your mouth while looking at us with eyes full of pity while rubbing our arm and asking in your most sorrowful voice,\"How's Sally doing?\".\u00a0 Then you stand up at a Board of Education meeting and ask if (insert extracurricular activity of your choice here) was cut because of what it costs to educate those special needs kids and furthermore, that our kids are holding your kids back academically. \n \nWe hear you and we see you. More importantly, your kids see you. They see your hypocrisy and your double standards. \n \nI'll let you in on a little secret. I'm no saint. I didn't chose to adopt a special needs child. Most of those who have kids with special needs didn't chose this path. It was thrust upon us by some random act of God, genetics or luck of the draw. I know I checked off the smart and perfect child who will never give me a moment's worry. He or she would grow up, go to college,\u00a0 and have a happy, successful and independent life.  \n \nLet me ask you a question. How would you feel if I said well since my kid can't participate in (insert extracurricular activity of your choice here) I'd like it removed from the school. It's not fair to have (insert extracurricular activity of your choice here) since my kid can't and most likely will never participate. That's not fair now is it? \n \nFederal Law protects Boy Wonder. It mandates that he is given a Free Appropriate Public Education. Your child is also entitled to a Free Appropriate Public Education. \n \nSo what does your child really learn by having children like ours in their classrooms? Hopefully, they are learning empathy, compassion and an appreciation for other people's differences. They are learning tolerance and acceptance. Aren't these all things that will serve your kids well when they are adults? Yet you want to take that away from them. I bet you think you are all these things but you're not. Your words and deeds have proved otherwise, yet it's not too late for you to change and be a positive example for your kids. Autism and other developmental and learning disabilities are NOT contagious but bigotry, ignorance and intolerance are very contagious.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f9y2BjeOxGI/UgF7s3hnSPI/AAAAAAAAAfc/6ygGiIq7kJo/s1600/photo-67.JPG"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2013/08/but-for-grace-of-god.html", "title": "\nBut for the Grace of God\n"},

No thoughts other then pushing on and through the fire as my legs burn. 50 to 55 minutes I begin to slow down as\u00a0  the sky begins to lighten and I hear one or another of my little tribe  of hooligans begin to stir. Why you ask? For my sanity and health so I  can be here for them because who will care for Boy Wonder when I\u2019m gone? I need to be here as long as possible. So I can walk the  walk of a Special Needs Mommy. So I can breathe deeply and calmly when  chaos seems to rule the day. To set an example for my girls that a  strong woman is a beautiful thing and that weak and helpless isn\u2019t cute.  So I push on each and every day for myself but mostly for them.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://runluaurun.com/2010/03/08/band-of-runners/", "http://runluaurun.com/"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2011/10/pushing-on.html", "title": "\nPushing On\n"},

You'll just take my word for it and like it.) I stopped the microwave and helped him push the 30 second button. He stood patiently waiting peering through the window.

Or there's that dirty word, regression. \n \nWe made the decision a year ago to put Boy Wonder on risperdone. Putting a not quite 5 year old on an anti-psychotic was not quite the parenting decision I ever imagined I'd make. Aggressive behavior towards me, self injurious hand biting to the point his hand bore teeth marks constantly like the inside of a mouth guard, lack of focus, and waking up for the day at 3 AM and off the wall vocal stimming forced our hand. We had no choice. Every behavior plan did nothing. \n \nSo we put him on the medicine and the effect was profound. His hand no longer bore teeth marks. He didn't go after me. I was allowed to sit at the kitchen table without him getting made or pulling me off my chair. The vocal stimming was tolerable. \n \nBut then he began to pee his pants which is a side effect. The boy who was on the edge of being fully toilet trained after 5 long years of potty training. His bloodwork came back with cholesterol just below stroke level. The hand biting has returned. I've been bitten and slapped and pulled off the kitchen chair. The vocal stimming is so loud and goes on for hours. He is back to getting up at 3 AM once or twice a week. Risperdone is no longer working. We only are getting the side effects now.  \n \nSo back we go to the pediatric neurologist for help because even though I was so against the medicine at first, it helped him gain so much ground. Big Daddy and I are capable of making the tough decisions for Boy Wonder but it sucks. \n \nThere is a bright beautiful intelligent little boy locked away in his autism. We get glimpses of it every day. In the big smiles. In the silly giggles. In the games we play. In the fact that he is learning to read and do math. Whatever we have to do to help him struggle less and help him reach his potential we will do it. \n \n \n \n\u00a0  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rj1RCBI4Zag/UB_MH8JJjJI/AAAAAAAAATI/LAeaTcSell4/s1600/524007_10150950925767496_1760681050_n.jpg"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2012/08/try-something-else.html", "title": "\nTry Something Else\n"},

Jersey just took her earrings off and put her hair in a\nponytail. I am not thrilled with some of you. \n \nI parent my children in the way\nthat is best for them at this moment in time. For Boy Wonder that means ABA,\nattending public school and home therapies. It means a no tolerance policy of\nhis aggressive behaviors. This is what is working for him. He can not\ncommunicate most of his thoughts and feelings to me. I have to guess all day\neveryday. I am filled with self-doubt on a regular basis. I have tried bio-med\ntherapies and therapies other than ABA. They did not work for MY SON. \n \nI know people for who the special\ndiets, DIR/Floortime and other alternative therapies have worked. I am thrilled for them that THEIR CHOICES\nworked for THEIR CHILD. I am thrilled when any parents choices work for THEIR\nCHILD because it means they are parenting THEIR CHILD in the way that is best\nfor THAT CHILD. \n \nNow I'm going to rant..... \n \nYou do not know me. You do not know\nmy son the way I know him. I parent him to the best of my capabilities. I play\nto his strengths and strive to overcome his deficits. I dislike intensely his\nautism. I have wondered every day for nearly 7 years what he is thinking and feeling. I see my\nchild through a thick glass wall. He is yelling to me but I have to interpret\nand guess and make the best choices on limited information. I am alternately\nloving and stern with Boy Wonder depending on the day and situation. \n \nI work on the assumption that he\nunderstands every word I say. I never say anything negative about him in front\nof him. I do not tolerate anyone else doing it either.\u00a0 I realized that\nthis was not the way to go years ago. After reading  Carly's\nVoice ,  I knew that it was a great freaking parenting choice. \n \nI am preparing for two different futures for my son. One in which he can live independently which is not likely and one in which he will need to live in a group home which is the one that is currently likely. I strive to change that every day. I also on occasion pray for it too.\u00a0  \n \nSo for your review, I do not judge\nyour parenting choices of your special needs kid. You are doing what works for\nyour child. I am doing what works for MY CHILD. I am entitled to my thoughts\nand feelings on Boy Wonder's particular brand of autism just as you are\nentitled to your thoughts and feelings on YOUR CHILD'S autism. \n \nFor the adults on the spectrum who\nfeel their parents didn't parent them in the way they would liked to be\nparented, I am sorry for your pain and experiences. I value your opinions. You\nare the ones leading the way for my son and other children on the spectrum. I\ntry to learn from you. Your insight offers me a wonderful perspective. I\nappreciate and value it. At the end of the day, I am just trying to do the\nright thing for my son and for me that path is not always clear.  \n \n @font-face {\n  font-family: \"Times\";\n}@font-face {\n  font-family: \"\uff2d\uff33 \u660e\u671d\";\n}@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Cambria Math\";\n}@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Cambria\";\n}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria; }p { margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times; }.MsoChpDefault { font-family: Cambria; }div.WordSection1 { page: WordSection1; } \n\n\n\n\n \nWe ask people outside our community\nto treat us and our children with respect.

Bright, clear and cool which is just the way I like it but I hadn't slept well the night before because as usual the mind stays on all the damn time. I was thinking about Boy Wonder who has made some great progress lately but who has some old aggressive behaviors crop up. I was thinking about my friend who wasn't there. And always thinking about how did I get here from 19 months ago without having ever really run.  \n \n \n\u00a0I was really grateful for my friends,  Jess  and  Luau  and their beautiful girls who let me stay with them and are just fabulous friends. Again the whole autism sucks thing but wow I have made some amazing friends because of autism. (click their names and read their race recaps) I could tell you that their Katie gives me a glimpse into what it's like to have a tween cause shopping was hilarious (go to Sephora with her cause it was fun) and she is a smart charming beautiful compassionate young lady and hell if my girls are half of what she is I will consider it a job well done.\u00a0 Or that Brooke has quite the sense of humor and wow she can draw or that when she calls me Jersey in that sweet little voice of hers my heart melts. I could tell you that I finally met  Paula  and what an awesome person she is and that I'm so touched that she ran one of her miles in honor of my son.  \n \nBut the morning of the race, we load up and head in. It was a quick ride. I'm shaking off the lack of sleep, fooling around being me, remind myself that this is my 3rd half marathon this year. (NYC Half and the Asbury Half, thank you very much) and that I am capable of this and want to beat my Asbury time. I think of my boy who they said would never speak and never connect and remind myself that he can talk and oh boy does he connect. I think of my girls who always ask when I get back from a race,\"Did you win Mommy? Can I wear your medal?\" and how they are surprising me already with just how much they get their big brother. \n \nWe find Sassy and Doug and make our way to the start line. Doug and I trash talk cause hey it's what we do. (I'm way better at it though ssshhhh) Sassy is all cute and sassy in her running skirt. We hug Jess and promise to look for her on the course and\u00a0 we are off. We are moving along the four of us. Me cursing, Sassy looking cute, Doug and Luau chatting like tween girls. (Sorry boys lol)\u00a0 At some point Doug tears his calf muscle and pulls over but he makes a comeback.\u00a0 And somewhere around mile 8 or 9 I can't keep up the 9 minute per mile pace. The sight of all the Team UP shirts is starting to get to me. It's an overwhelming sight and yet it's only a very small piece of the enormous pie.\u00a0 Sassy takes off and Luau stays with me cause he's good like that. \u00a0 And Doug comes tearing past us and I know I'm losing my bet to him. \n \nWe get to the last half mile or so and Luau says, \"After this hill, you've got it. We're almost there.\" I may have screamed at this point,\"What the fuck you said the course was flat?????!!!\" really really loudly. \n \nAnd I finish in 2:04:44 beating my Asbury Half time by a whole 3 seconds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Suffolk Downs after the race \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/lo-hicimos/", "http://runluaurun.com/2012/09/19/boston-13-1-the-metaphor/", "http://biggreenpen.com/2012/09/17/listparttwo/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y_e6-7kjr8o/UFxpJxchF4I/AAAAAAAAAYk/cwBns0ThpeE/s1600/photo-52.JPG"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2012/09/boston-good-bad-ugly.html", "title": "\nBoston The Good The Bad The Ugly\n"},

They are focused inward. You fight your way into their world and try to bring them out to your world. You wait for that connection and in our case we waited years.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhile not a daily occurrence, joint attention does happen more and more with Boy Wonder. We took all of them to the Bronx Zoo on Saturday.\u00a0 They had a Dora and Diego 4-D short film exhibit about a robot butterfly. We were hesitant to take Boy Wonder in. Would he keep the glasses on? Would he vocal stim loudly to the point of annoying other people? Would he just flip out and need to be taken out quickly? We looked inside the theater. It wasn't even a quarter of the way filled. We decided to sit in the front row with Boy Wonder and Big Daddy positioned near the exit. Boy Wonder decided he'd sit on his Daddy's lap.\u00a0 As the lights went down we put the 4-D glasses on him and Dora and Diego sprang out at him and he laughed, his big delicious belly laugh. He watched the butterflies come dancing onto the screen and reached out to touch them and then he looked over at me to see if I was watching and laughing too and when he saw I was laughing,\u00a0 he laughed harder. That connection is all that more meaningful because it's been an uphill battle and we are rewarded with the sweetest victory. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--ENLRkV_nJM/UGStV3dFn4I/AAAAAAAAAZA/zv0ZToHmAv4/s1600/548431_10151053058762555_330986036_n.jpg"], "link": "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2012/09/joint-attention.html", "title": "\nJoint Attention\n"},
