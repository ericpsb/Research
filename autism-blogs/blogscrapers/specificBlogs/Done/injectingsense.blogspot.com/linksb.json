{"date": "Wednesday, February 01, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       I may disagree with what you have to say, but I shall defend, to the death, your right to say it. \u2014 attributed to Voltaire Last night, something happened that has me writing about something other than autism.   Two women were ejected  from the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives shortly before President Bush gave his State of the Union address.  Both committed the crime of wearing t-shirts with messages. One of the women was Cindy Sheehan, who has famously (or infamously, depending on your point of view) protested the ongoing war in Iraq by demonstrating outside of just about anywhere the president happens to be.  Ms. Sheehan was sitting in the gallery as the guest of Representative Lynn Woolsey of California.  The t-shirt she wore depicted a number:  the number of United States military personnel that have been killed in Iraq, one of whom was Ms. Sheehan\u2019s son. The second woman was Beverly Young, the wife of Republican Representative Bill Young of Florida, who happens to be chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee.  Ms. Young\u2019s fashion faux pas was wearing a t-shirt reading \u201cSupport the Troops \u2014 Defending Our Freedom.\u201d    According to the  Associated Press , Ms. Young was told that \u201cshe was being treated the same as Sheehan.\u201d  That\u2019s not entirely accurate, in that Ms. Young was merely escorted out into the hallway where she argued with the Capitol Police.  Ms. Sheehan, on the other hand, was handcuffed and booked with something called \u201cunlawful conduct.\u201d  But the disparity in the treatment is unimportant.  A wrong was inflicted upon both women, and through them, upon the nation. Ms. Young is understandably upset at being asked to leave for silently proclaiming what she considers to be a positive message.  And Ms. Sheehan maintains that she had no intention of being disruptive. Predictably, the politicians closest to the incidents are squawking, and missing the point.  Rep. Woolsey issued a statement decrying the action against Ms. Sheehan, and opining that the arrest was simply because of a disagreement with the Administration.  That, of course, ignores the ouster of Ms. Young.  For his part, Rep. Young spoke from the House floor, stating that his wife was taken away because \u201cshe had on a shirt that someone didn\u2019t like that said support our troops.\u201d  That misses the point that two women, espousing different views, were escorted out of the House Chamber \u2014 a place that should not only tolerate, but encourage freedom of speech \u2014 because they engaged in non-disruptive acts of political speech. The one thing said by any of the politicians with which I can agree was spoken by Rep. Young during his diatribe from the floor:  \u201cShame, shame.\u201d The war in Iraq divides this country.  Like most of you, I have strong opinions about the matter, but those opinions aren\u2019t important to this discussion.  Likewise, the substantive opinions of neither Ms. Sheehan nor Ms. Young should make a difference when deciding whether you feel their ousters were appropriate.  All Americans should be angry about this. The State of the Union, as political as it may be no matter which party is in power, should be considered a celebration of our constitutional government and the freedoms we are guaranteed as citizens of this most wonderful country. The First Amendment protects all speech \u2014 political speech in particular \u2014 without regard to how offensive some may find it.  Of course, no freedom is absolute; that is, a distinction must be drawn between \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201clicense.\u201d  If the physical security of an event is actually threatened, there is no question that speech can be curtailed.  And arguably, an event like the State of the Union should be free of disruption.  But sitting quietly in a t-shirt threatens neither safety nor decorum. That no real crimes were committed is evident by the charge entered against Ms. Sheehan:  \u201cunlawful act.\u201d  By definition, committing an unlawful act requires that another law be broken.  Yet there was no other charge entered except of an \u201cunlawful act.\u201d This may sound extraordinarily trite, but it bears saying anyway.  Clamping down on constitutionally protected free speech, regardless of the content, is a slap in the face to the men and women who sacrifice themselves while serving this country.  On that, Ms. Sheehan and Ms. Young should both agree. About a week ago, I took  Camille Clark  to task for what I considered to be a tasteless and cruel post on her blog.  To her credit, Camille left comments on the post trying to explain her intentions.  Although I appreciate and respect her willingness to offer that explanation, I strongly disagree with Camille.  But that being said, I will gladly take on anyone who would deny her the right to speak her mind. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Post Script: The  Capitol Police have apologized  and acknowledged that the ejection of these women should never have taken place. \u201cThe officers made a good faith but mistaken effort to enforce an old unwritten interpretation of the prohibitions about demonstrating in the Capitol,\u201d Capitol Police Chief Terrance Gainer said in a statement late Wednesday. \u201cThe policy and procedures were too vague,\u201d he added.  \u201cThe failure to adequately prepare the officers is mine.\u201d Chief Gainer\u2019s explanation confirms my opinion that the crimes committed by Ms. Sheehan and Ms. Young were non-existent.  Having the chief fall on his sword before the press may forestall any real debate about the incident, and that\u2019s too bad.  I would still like to hear why the police seemingly all believed that wearing t-shirts with messages on them deserved arrest.   The State of the Union address is not something new; it happens every year.  And every year it seems that there is some issue that draws fire upon whatever Administration is in office.  I find it hard to believe that no thought has ever been given to making the \u201cpolicy and procedures\u201d a little less \u201cvague.\u201d\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060201/ap_on_go_co/state_of_union_sheehan_5", "http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060201/ap_on_go_co/state_of_union_sheehan_5", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1571503"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/shame-shame.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SHAME, SHAME!\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, July 16, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n       I see fat people.  Riding scooters among regular people.  They only see what they want to see.  They don\u2019t know they\u2019re fat  How often do you see them?  All the time.  They\u2019re everywhere.  \u23af with apologies to M. Night Shyamalan A couple of weeks ago, we made one of our pilgrimages to bow before the mouse with the white gloves. The Rankin family is Disneyfied.  Every few years (or more often if we\u2019re able), we have to pack the car and head to Lake Buena Vista, Florida, home of the happiest place on Earth.  We not only have a great time (all the wishes you can afford), but we get to look through a window onto America.  On this latest trip, I made two observations about the state of our people, and those observations are not terribly positive.  One is about how people treat each other; the other is about how they have been treated.   First, the decline in courtesy and civility in our society continues to amaze me.  You have to understand; I\u2019m old school.  I was raised to believe that the fabric of our people is held together by the display of good manners.   When I see adult men keeping their seat on monorails and busses when there are women and children standing, I am disgusted.  I saw a few men do the right thing, but often it was out of a sense of shame after seeing someone like me do it.  I was encouraged by one teenager who spontaneously get up and offer his seat to my wife and son.  More often than not, though, I saw men in their twenties and thirties keep their seats and look down to pretend they didn\u2019t see anyone else. Another indication of the decline of cavity is one of my pet peeves:  men wearing hats (usually baseball caps) in restaurants.  Yes, I realize we were in a resort area, and that the old rules are relaxed.  I can handle guys wearing shorts and decent t-shirts to nice restaurants.  I can handle wearing caps inside the lobby of a hotel, inside souvenir shops, or even in elevators.  But I always like to think of restaurants and dining rooms as the last refuge of civility. This is not something restricted to Disney World.  I see this absurd and disrespectful wearing of headgear in nice restaurants outside of resort areas.  These aren\u2019t guys wearing hats outside and not wanting to show their hat hair; most of the guys I saw doing it were bald or had buzz cuts.  And it\u2019s not just kids.  I see middle-aged men doing it.  Shame on their parents for not raising them right! Okay, let me get off of that soapbox.  My second observation is far more serious.   A day or two into our visit, my wife turned to me and asked, \u201chave you noticed how many more scooters we\u2019re seeing than we used to?\u201d  Some were the people we\u2019ve always seen:  the elderly, those with heart problems, those with extreme arthritis (a bad enough sign of the times).  Mostly, though, we saw people who needed their scooters because they were just too heavy to ambulate on their own. Don\u2019t get me wrong.  I\u2019m carrying too many pounds on my frame (a situation I\u2019m addressing).  I\u2019m not talking here about people who are \u201chusky,\u201d \u201cheavy-set,\u201d \u201cbig-boned,\u201d \u201cchubby,\u201d or even just \u201cfat.  The people we saw on their scooters fit the category of morbidly obese.  And they were everywhere. They tooled around here and there, but even in one of the most ADA-compliant locations on the planet there were things they just couldn\u2019t do.  It was just too hard for them to maneuver through the crowds\u2014not that it didn\u2019t stop them from trying as the screams and howls of folks with run-over feet attested. The level of obesity we see these days is not just a problem of too many people lacking discipline at the dinner table or spending too much time at the television.  And even though we saw entire families that were way overweight, this isn\u2019t a simple matter of genetics (there may be some genetic predisposition at work, but it\u2019s too simple an answer).   This is not a matter of personal behavior as much as it is a matter of environment. The obesity epidemic is just one more part of the \u201cnew normal.\u201d  We\u2019re a society packed with autoimmune disorders, developmental disabilities, and so many chronic health problems\u2014like obesity.  Is it all related? The causes for all of these things are complex.  Even the autism epidemic can\u2019t be limited to just over-vaccination and vaccine toxicity. The root of the obesity epidemic are the most basic parts of the underlying causal factors of the \u201cnew normal: as a whole.  It all comes down to what we are putting into our bodies. We live in a country in which the advertising empires have convinced us we must eat \u201clow-fat\u201d foods, and use artificial ingredients to avoid all of that bad natural stuff that will make us fat.  So how come we\u2019re going in the other direction? Could it be that we shouldn\u2019t be so focused on how much fat as we should  the kind of fats ? Could it be that we shouldn\u2019t be so focused on saving calories that we wind up  putting pesticides in our bodies  instead of real, raw sugar, honey, or natural alternatives? Do we need to  focus so much on food production  that we feed things to cattle that God didn\u2019t design their systems for, genetically design seeds to put the pest control inside of the food instead of outside (both bad alternatives), or poison the waters from which we get so much of our sustainable food supply? Our family made a commitment some years ago to clean up our diet.  We eat grass-fed beef, wild caught seafood species that are known to not retain mercury, pastured pork and free-range chicken, and organic produce.  It\u2019s made a difference in our lives.  We feel better.  We\u2019re healthier.  And on those occasions when overconsumption and inactivity bring on the extra pounds, we\u2019re able to make relatively easy corrections that don\u2019t involve riding on electronic devices.

{"date": "Monday, February 06, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      A story from Elmont, New York caught my eye the other day.  The county opened  a new group home  for adults with autism.  For me, this story brought a lot of feelings to the surface about  why  so many parents of autistic children \u23af including me \u23af insist on using various interventions to [choose one:  cure our children; heal our children; alleviate negative dysfunctional aspects of our children\u2019s autism; ameliorate the comorbidities associated with our children\u2019s autism]. In the last six months or so, I have heard from so many adults on the spectrum that live full and meaningful lives.  So I realize that the interventions my wife and I elect to use with our son are not necessary for all autistic children.   I hear time and again how \u201call\u201d children eventually improve and learn to communicate and interact with the world around them.  I want to believe that so much, but there often seems to be a question about how far any particular autistic child can go without interventions designed to counteract a probable trigger of the autism. The story from Elmont focused on one family of a 24-year old man who moved into the home with great excitement.  His mother noted that the residence \u201clooks like a real home.\u201d  She didn\u2019t say it  was  a real home:  only that it looked like one.  The young man\u2019s father made a comment that made me wonder how he views the limitations on his son\u2019s life:  \u201cHe\u2019s got cable, everything he needs.\u201d   This is going to sound harsher than I really want it to, but I want my son to grow up with more to look forward to than something that looks like a real home with cable television.  I want him to build his own life and to have his own home, not just be able to live in a house.   Am I making a value judgment?  Absolutely!  And I would never presume to make such decisions for that young man in New York and his family.  This home will probably serve his needs quite well, and it may even be the best solution for his family.  It will provide a modicum of independence.  For my son, though, I want nothing less than full independence.  I want him to have the freedom to tell the entire world, including me, to shove it. The decisions my wife and I make today on our son\u2019s behalf may well determine whether he achieves that full independence.  In making those decisions, we have to carefully consider both physical risks, and the risk that we may be altering his human uniqueness in some way.  It is an awesome responsibility that is not to be taken lightly.  But making those kinds of decisions is what parents do.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.liherald.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16053658&BRD=1601&PAG=461&dept_id=477736&rfi=6"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/house-may-not-be-home-even-if-it-has.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A HOUSE MAY NOT BE A HOME (Even if it has Cable TV)\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 07, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       In the relatively brief time Sym and I have been a part of this world of autism, certain people have been inspirations to us.  Alan and Lujene Clark are high on the list. Dr. Alan Clark\u2019s  curriculum vitae  appears similar to those of countless other physicians we all grew up admiring.  His distinguished career in emergency and forensic medicine, together with his community involvement, made him a leader before autism came into his life.  With his son\u2019s diagnosis, he found a different outlet for his talents \u23af an outlet he shared with his equally impressive wife, Lujene. Last June, Dr. Clark wrote the following.  It\u2019s excerpted from  a blog post , in which he responded to a certain skeptical blogger, who happens to be a surgeon holding a far more mainstream opinion of the hypothesized link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism: I suspect many physicians, like you and I, might be in denial at the thought of inadvertently poisoning an entire generation of children.  It\u2019s not our fault.  We were misled and we did what we thought was best for our patients. . . . Our son was 7 1/2 years old when he reached his \u201ctoxic tipping point\u201d with mercury after he received two doses of Thimerosal-containing influenza vaccine in November 2002 and December 2002 (approximately 30 days apart per the ACIP/CDC guidelines).  Within a matter of weeks he experienced dramatic changes...he suffered severe neurodevelopmental changes, neurobehavioral symptoms, exacerbated allergies, asthma, eczema, etc. Within 10 months, he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder.  Only when we identified mercury as the culprit and started to remove the heavy metal from his system, did he begin to recover. Until October 2003, I, too, was \u201cblissfully ignorant\u201d of the acute toxicity of Thimerosal much like most other physicians.  We were never told our son\u2019s vaccines contained mercury, a known neurotoxin, in levels that exceeded EPA safety guidelines.  It never occurred to us to ask.  Because of my medical background, I thought physicians could trust the CDC, the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.  I must hope that no one else should reach this epiphany at so high a price. Along with working to heal their son, it became Alan and Lujene Clark\u2019s mission to bring their epiphany to the rest of us.  Together they founded  No Mercury , educating the public about the very real dangers of injecting mercury into our children.   During these last two years, Alan Clark brought intelligence and dignity to the thimerosal debate.  It was far too short a time.  This evening\u2019s Schafer Autism report brought the news that Dr. Clark passed away after fighting cancer for the last several months. I have no doubt that Lujene will ably continue the work to which she and Alan dedicated their lives.  But that will have to wait.  First, we all need to mourn a great loss. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * ADDENDUM: Dr. Clark\u2019s hometown paper published an  obituary  that gives us more insight into this remarkable man.  This is how it ends: Clark\u2019s varied interests and talents \u2014 publishing an online novel, an online medical column, writing music, playing piano and his medical career \u2014 earned him the nickname \u201cRenaissance Man,\u201d said his friend and St. John\u2019s coworker Cora Scott.  Clark only laughed, she said. Among her lasting memories of Clark, she said, is this quote by an unknown author that he used to close his e-mails: \u201cDon't tell God how big your storm is ... tell the storm how big God is.\u201d I like that.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/alan_picture.0.jpg", "http://www.nomercury.org/profileadc.htm", "http://nopointsfortrying.blogspot.com/2005/06/hits-just-keep-on-coming.html", "http://www.nomercury.org/", "http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060209/NEWS01/602090353"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/another-candle.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ANOTHER CANDLE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, February 10, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       [Note:  This post discusses issues that arise in the debate over the safety and efficacy of chelation.  I am not advocating chelation, nor am I even saying that we have chosen chelation as an appropriate intervention for our son.  My point in writing the following  is to illuminate the hypocrisy of one side in this biomedical debate.]   The  Associated Press reports  that an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration recently decided that Ritalin should carry a \u201cblack box\u201d warning because of a risk of death.  At least 25 people \u23af including 17 children \u23af have died after taking Ritalin or similar stimulants that are commonly prescribed for ADHD. What does this have to do with autism?  Well, a lot actually.  Specifically, this story helps to highlight the hypocrisy of one group of people who dare to criticize parents who attempt \u201calternate\u201d biomedical interventions. Let me note that this is a debate among those who acknowledge autism spectrum disorders as being medical conditions that, at least in some cases, require some form of medical intervention.  Those who might argue that all forms of autism are nothing more than a cognitive difference not needing any medical intervention are certainly welcome to keep reading this post, but they might get a tad bored by this debate. In essence, I am writing about the difference in approach between physicians who utilize methodologies such as the  DAN!  protocol on the one side, and physicians who would identify themselves as being \u201cmainstream\u201d doctors who recommend more \u201ctraditional\u201d treatments on the other. Most of us first heard the diagnoses of our children from the lips of mainstream practitioners.  My wife and I had the experience of first hearing the diagnosis when our son was four years old.  A self-described developmental pediatrician told us the situation was dire and we needed to immediately place our son in a special autism school, and that he needed to take Ritalin. We were not too keen on that first doctor\u2019s advice, although we did at least look into the school.  My relentless wife, though, kept searching for better answers, and we wound up dipping our feet into the alternative biomedical waters by starting our son on a gluten-free/casein-free diet and supplements.  But we didn\u2019t completely abandon seeking more conventional solutions.   At great expense, we had a multi-disciplinary evaluation performed, including a pediatrician, a neurologist, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a speech therapist and an occupational therapist.  The pediatrician and neurologist, in particular, were distressed that we would even consider \u201caltie\u201d remedies.  The pediatrician opined, in no uncertain terms, that we were wasting our money at best and, at worst, we were risking our child\u2019s well-being.  His recommendation was that we get our four-year old son on Ritalin immediately. It\u2019s possible that the two \u201cmainstream\u201d physicians we spoke to were unusual in their advocacy for Ritalin, but I don\u2019t think so.  I\u2019ve heard from too many other parents who had the same advice thrown at them to believe these doctors were unusual. The doctors who recommended Ritalin are part of the same group that shout the loudest about chelation being a deadly and unproven intervention because it has never undergone safety trials for autism, and off-label use of medications and procedures is inherently dangerous.  Yet what is it they wanted to prescribe? The Associated Press story I mentioned above quotes one of the FDA committee members as saying \u201cit would be \u2018inappropriate, unethical behavior\u2019 not to disclose that there was uncertainty about the safety of the drugs.\u201d  To me, that raises the question of whether adequate long-term safety testing has ever been conducted on these drugs.   Then, there is the issue of off-label Ritalin use.  I know that many of us see autism and ADHD as being possibly related, but the mainstream medical community tends to consider them as totally distinct issues.  Moreover, the  warnings for Ritalin , even for its use in ADHD cases, include the advice that it \u201cshould not be used in children under six years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.\u201d   So let me get this straight, reputable doctors tell me that I should not use any modalities that have not been proven safe, and yet they want to prescribe dangerous pharmaceuticals that are specifically contraindicated for young children.   I keep thinking about the 17 children who reportedly died while on Ritalin.  I wonder how many other children died in cases where the connection just wasn\u2019t considered.  And I wonder how many of the dead children who were taking Ritalin got their prescriptions for autism.  All that makes me wonder where the voices are of the self-appointed \u201cquackwatchers\u201d who screamed so loudly about the death of a child due to a botched chelation procedure.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifphotos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/Ritalin-SR-20mg-thumb.jpg", "http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060209/ap_on_he_me/attention_deficit", "http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/index.htm", "http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/methphen_wcp.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/stimulating-advice-from-those-who-took.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t STIMULATING ADVICE FROM THOSE WHO TOOK THE \u201cHYPOCRITIC\u201d OATH\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, February 13, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      In the last week, the internet world of autism has gone a little crazy reacting to comments made at a film festival in Berlin.  The comments were made by the people responsible for making a new movie called  Snow Cake .  Apparently the main character is an autistic adult (played by Sigourney Weaver) whose daughter is killed in an accident after hitching a ride with an ex-convict (played by Alan Rickman).  It sounds like an interesting little movie with two of my favorite actors.  Most of the present controversy stems from  comments made in Berlin by Ms. Weaver , who reportedly spent several months researching her role: \u201cI think we have to begin to see it as a gift,\u201d she told a news conference.  \u201cWe may not understand what it's there for, but if you're in the presence of someone with autism you learn so much.  You learn how to play, you learn how to see things, you learn how to experience things and how jarring the world is.\u201d The reference to autism as a \u201cgift\u201d seemed to push a button for a lot of people, but to a limited degree, I can agree with that characterization.  Responding to my little one\u2019s autism has made me learn to exercise patience beyond what is required of other parents.  It has  opened my eyes and made me a better father  to all my children.  Part of the \u201cgift\u201d is being able to celebrate little milestones each day that other parents take for granted:  for example, that first three-word sentence, years after other children of similar age.   But sometimes a gift comes with a catch. The \u201cgift\u201d of autism has a lot of catches.  It not only keeps on giving; it keeps on taking.  There are the countless trips to doctors and therapists, the endless fights with the health insurer to get even some of the \u201cmainstream\u201d treatments covered, the constant fights with the local school board to get services for your child that are needed for a \u201cfree and appropriate public education,\u201d and the sleepless nights spent worrying about what\u2019s to become of a child that might never be able to function independently. Most of all, though, watching one\u2019s child grow progressively frustrated over the years as he grows intellectually but not emotionally, and as he can\u2019t find the words to express what he is feeling, makes it a gift that one wishes could be returned.  I think the part of Ms. Weaver\u2019s quote that caught me most off guard was the reference to learning \u2018how to play.\u201d  One of the challenges that face most autistic children is that they really don\u2019t know how to play; her comment seemed incongruous at best.  Then I came upon other comments Ms. Weaver made in Berlin, and it started to make a little sense.  In  another interview , the actress said, \u201cIt took me a long time to even understand how to prepare for this part because every person with autism is so unique, and to find someone like Linda [her character in the movie] took a long time.\u201d  Even the realization that autism is unique for every person, however, does not seem to have completely kept Ms. Weaver from overgeneralizing our world.  The following is from an interview in the ABC online site called  Articulate : Q.  . . . what\u2019s been your most challenging film part? A.  I have to say maybe this one because I so felt a responsibility to get it right: the physical behaviour, the sense of when you have and don\u2019t have control.  I felt a big responsibility not to do anything general and that\u2019s really what I was thinking about \u23af that and how to interact with the other actors without interacting with them, without any eye contact at all.  Q.  For a lot of people, Rain Man is the classic film about autism.  Was that an obstacle for you in making Snow Cake? A.  Our story is so different. I think they made a wonderful movie but one of the frustrations I heard expressed very often from anyone on the spectrum [of autism] was they\u2019re tired of Rain Man being the definitive expression of what it is to be an autistic person since every autistic person is so unique\u2026 I just think it\u2019s such a big subject.  There can certainly be plenty of different stories that reflect on that and there\u2019s time for there to be more. I don\u2019t think it intimidated us because it\u2019s not about autism and that\u2019s not our focus.  But I did want to be as accurate as I could be and I was lucky to have a lot of people help me and to find a couple of people who were very like the character.  Q.  In the film, your character seems at first to completely lack a sense of grief for her dead daughter. How did you deal with that? A.  I think there\u2019s a real lack of sentimentality about death in the autistic community\u2026 it\u2019s not a lack of feeling but it is a kind of acceptance of it as a fact.  It\u2019s not something get, I can\u2019t really understand it, but I tried to play it as accurately as I could.  I can\u2019t really get it because in my experience, people with autism do make connections.  I have a couple of autistic friends and I talked to one of them yesterday and she said, \u2018It\u2019d be really great to get together for a weekend or something,\u2019 and I said, \u2018yeah it really would,\u2019 and she said, \u2018yeah, and do some serious playing\u2019. And I thought that was so cool because I miss playing \u23af you don\u2019t get a chance to play, you have to really consciously play.  That has to be a priority and that isn\u2019t for most neuro-typical people. Although Ms. Weaver understands how unique and individual each autistic person is, she bases her perceptions of autism on people she met who are most like the role she played in this movie:  high-functioning adults.  Unfortunately, not all autistic children grow up to be like that. I suppose I should be happy that the entertainment industry is beginning to learn that all autistics are not like the little boy who dreamed up several seasons worth of  St. Elsewhere  or Dustin Hoffman\u2019s character in  Rain Man . That those stereotypes are harmfully ingrained in the public\u2019s consciousness is shown in an  early review of  Snow Cake , in which the character\u2019s autism is dismissed as being \u201cthe kind of literary autism that allows her to make sagacious observations and funny remarks.\u201d  Obviously, that critic\u2019s exposure to high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger\u2019s has been limited. So yes, I\u2019m happy that we\u2019re starting to see characters that show another side of autism.  My concern is that we may replace old negative stereotypes with new but equally unrealistic ones if statements like those attributed to Ms. Weaver are taken as showing the whole picture. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that the film\u2019s writer,  Angela Pell, has a particular viewpoint  that seems to exclude any other experience of autism: Pell was inspired by her own autistic son Johnny, who like Weaver\u2019s character in the film loves to eat snow and bounce up and down on a trampoline. \u201cI wanted to write a film that showed that sometimes living with autism can be harrowing but that actually most of the time it\u2019s really good fun,\u201d Pell told reporters. Did she really say \u201cgood fun????\u201d  I\u2019m not sure if Ms. Pell is referring to living as an autistic or living as the parent of an autistic child.  But my experience is that the joy in life I see my son express is too often overshadowed by the frustration of trying to deal with everyday life.  Likewise, my own joy of being around my little boy \u23af and it is great joy indeed \u23af is tempered by the pain of witnessing his frustration.  I would never say that \u201cmost of the time it\u2019s really good fun.\u201d In the end, what might make this film palatable for me is the viewpoint of the film\u2019s director, Marc Evans, as stated in the  Articulate article : You know, I don\u2019t think Rain Man was solely about autism.  It was about the 80s, it was about Tom Cruise\u2019s character and his greed.  Although, in the same way, autism plays an important part in Snow Cake, it\u2019s not about autism.  It does seem to be about grief and dislocation, which seems to be a sort of theme that penetrates a lot of films now.  I think it\u2019s to do with our generation not being so hopeful or not having things to hang on to which get you through life, so when something like grief or depression or divorce or any social problems come up, there seems to be less of a network, either social or familial, to get you through it \u2026 I think in our end of the world, where you\u2019re not dealing with more visceral problems like poverty or war at the moment, these are concerns of the way that we live our life right now. . . . . . . this film is really off the radar for an American studio \u23af it\u2019s about somebody with a mental illness, it\u2019s about somebody who\u2019s grieving, it\u2019s not satisfyingly redemptive at the end . . . Maybe Mr. Evans\u2019 outlook on autism is not as upbeat as Ms. Weaver or Ms. Pell, but he seems to be telling us that autism is not the be all and end all of the movie or of life itself.  That view does not really comport with the reality my family lives with on a daily basis:  a life where autism does dominate our lives.  Still, I still find Mr. Evan\u2019s words more comfortingly positive than the stereotype of a happy and playful autistic that is too far divorced from reality. I want to see  Snow Cake  before I judge its worth.  As for Ms. Weaver, I plan to go on enjoying her work regardless of my opinion of her comments or the film itself.  I just won\u2019t be referring to her as an expert on autism.   I\u2019m reminded of what our  friend, Mary Webster, wrote  in talking about the absurd notion that the autism world, and the biomedical community in particular, needed a celebrity to tout the cause:  \u201cDo we want to live in a society where an issue MUST be addressed on a certain talk show or touted by a celebrity to facilitate social change?  Gads!\u201d   I really don\u2019t believe that many people let celebrities form opinions for them.  The most that might happen is that a celebrity\u2019s words or presence may draw attention to an issue.  As wrong as any of the particular statements are that have been made by the film\u2019s principals, this film may draw attention to our world so that we (meaning parents and autistics of various opinions) can help better inform those that just don\u2019t know.  At least, that\u2019s what I hope.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060209/en_nm/arts_film_berlin_dc", "http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060213/ENT/602130332/1005", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200602/s1567973.htm", "http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=reviewsNews&storyID=2006-02-11T024847Z_01_N10236145_RTRIDST_0_REVIEW-FILM-SNOWCAKE-DC.XML", "http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060209/en_nm/arts_film_berlin_dc", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200602/s1567973.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/just-keep-telling-yourself-its-only.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF:  IT\u2019S ONLY A MOVIE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, January 06, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       The other evening, members of the autism community were encouraged to light candles and observe  a moment of silence  in memory of Liz Birt.  Judging by the buzz on the internet that evening, a lot of candles were lit. Candles carry such a powerful symbolism, even apart from the obvious religious imagery.  They remind us of the light someone has brought to a world sometimes shrouded in darkness (and within the context of Liz Birt and autism, by darkness I mean the lack of attention given by the rest of the world and not the condition of autism).  A lit candle may also symbolize the fire that true leaders may ignite in the rest of us. I did not have the privilege of knowing Liz Birt, so I cannot speak for her as to what she would like her legacy to be.  But I think she would be proud to know that she inspired people like Mary Webster and Lenny Schafer. Mary is one of the people my wife and I have gotten to know since falling into the world of autism.  Mary is articulate, dedicated, and she is determined to heal her son.  The death of Liz Birt, who she never met, has moved Mary to lift her voice.  She sent us a copy of an email she wrote to Dan Olmstead, the journalist who is behind the \u201cAge of Autism\u201d series, along with the photo that appears at the top of this post.  Mary also shared some thoughts on what inspired her to write Mr. Olmstead in the first place. What constitutes a hero or a role model in this country is something I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about lately.  (Also, what attracts our collective -- and the media\u2019s -- attention.)  The year in reviews I saw were focused on Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch and the Runaway Bride from Georgia.  It\u2019s really alarming!  There\u2019s been some discussion on the EOH and CK2 boards lately about Oprah and Bill Maher and attracting the attention of celebrities to our cause.  Maybe I\u2019m a dope, but I don\u2019t think that's the answer, really.  Do we want to live in a society where an issue MUST be addressed on a certain talk show or touted by a celebrity to facilitate social change?  Gads!    So, with that in mind, I sent this message to Dan.  It\u2019s a bit like preaching to the choir, but he\u2019s a good listener and somehow I don\u2019t think Brian Williams is really interested in what I have to say, do you?  Peace,  Mary   P.S. This breaks my heart and I didn\u2019t even know her.     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   Dan,     This is Matthew Lopez.  He\u2019s 11 now, but was nine years old when this photo was taken.  He doesn\u2019t speak and has begun having seizures.  Matthew\u2019s fearless mother, Liz Birt, has been fighting for the truth for Matthew and other children like him for years.  She died in a car accident recently.     If a tree falls in a deserted forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?     Now that Liz is no longer able to speak for Matthew, will anyone hear him?  Liz could hear him, even though he could not speak.     Tom Hanks is an actor.  Michael Jordan is a basketball player.  George Bush is the president of the United States.  Liz Birt was a hero.  Mary  That\u2019s the impression Liz Birt left on people like Mary Webster and me:  people who never had the chance to really know her, but who had a little more hope in their lives because she cared. Considering the impact Liz\u2019s death had on people who never met her, how much harder has the last week been on those who were in the trenches with her?  Lenny Schafer knew Liz as a friend.  In a recent post in the  Schafer Autism Report , Lenny told us about the funeral for Liz, and he gave us a glimpse into the passion with which she advocated for our kids. \u201cHow are you doing, David?\u201d I asked as we both walked up the stairs to the cemetery.  Before he could answer I added, \u201cStupid question, huh?\u201d  David Kirby and I were both there amongst others in Kansas City today for the funeral of our friend Liz Birt.  \"It's still nice that you asked,\u201d he answered.  His face answered the rest of my question, reflecting back my own. I had to cast my eyes away. From Liz Birt: November 3, 2005 Dear Senator Enzi: . . . This past summer I spent over 300 hours preparing a detailed memo for your staff in order to assist them in evaluating the role that our federal health agencies have played in the use and promotion of use of vaccines containing a known neurotoxin, thimerosal. I spent hours with your staff and arranged for many key scientists to present information to your committee. I have been told that the investigation is ongoing but I urge you to make this a priority. Just today, a paper authored by Dr. Thomas Burbacker, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health, was released by Environmental Health Perspectives, a peer reviewed publication of the NIH, demonstrating in primates that ethyl mercury in the form of thimerosal is far more toxic to the brain than methylmercury.  The CDC is now encouraging everyone including babies and pregnant women to get flu vaccines that contain thimerosal, a known neurotoxin. This is at best reckless behavior on the part of our public health officials. To me it is immoral.  Fellow Californian autism activist Rick Rollens and myself arrived the day before on a direct flight from Sacramento.  Rick was a good friend of Liz\u2019s and he had called me just a few days earlier to offer his frequent flyer tickets to me for my fare out there and back.  As a single parent, my attention this time of year is split between taking care of my children, producing a daily autism newsletter and fighting off the dead of winter blues in social isolation.  Only now, there was a dead dear friend, too. We arrived at the Kansas City airport early Wednesday afternoon, only there was almost nobody else there.  The airport was so empty and quiet, it seemed like it was closed.  We picked up the rental and drove our way a half hour into town to the Sheraton.  Almost no traffic and no pedestrians.  \u201cDid some neutron bomb go off around here or something?\u201d asked Rick, \u201cwhere is everyone in this town?\u201d  I answered, \u201cmaybe we\u2019re in the twilight zone.\u201d Liz continues to Senator Enzi: I have spent the majority of my professional time since 2000 working on the issue of whether or not vaccines are related to the epidemic of autism that is plaguing our country. I have been hopeful that our federal government would take the lead in investigating this issue.  I spent many hours reviewing documents provided by our federal health agencies and pharmaceutical companies relating to this issue when I was on staff for the House Committee on Government Reform and as counsel to SAFEMINDS.  What I found was shocking.  After seeing the text of Senate Bill 1873 I no longer have faith in our elected officials in Washington. Rick Rollens is one of those paradoxical guys who is socially and politically popular, yet is never completely comfortable at social gatherings.  Funerals have to be way down on his list of public functions to attend.  Only his love for Liz could get him to be there.  Rick\u2019s political life has made him a lot of friends.  From my newsletter publishing, I know a lot of people.  Out of all of them between us, we agreed that only a handful are special angels.  And now one is gone.  The loss is immeasurable. Liz continues: The cost to society of vaccine-induced illness, especially autism, are enormous. We have a tidal wave of children who are neurologically impaired in this country and no one in Washington is doing anything productive to find out why.  In addition, autism is now being diagnosed in huge numbers in developing countries where American pharmaceutical companies have been shipping thimerosal containing vaccines.  I recently received information that China may have as many as 5 million children with autism and that this is a new disorder to that country.  What will the world say about our nation when the truth comes out? \u201cLet\u2019s skip the Rosary,\u201d I suggest.  The viewing and funeral are enough for me.  Rick agrees.  \u201cWe are here to show support for her family as well as to grieve for ourselves,\u201d explains Rick.  \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t think they'll need our support at the Rosary.\u201d  We both rationalize our decision; I\u2019m Jewish and Rick\u2019s not Catholic.  Neither of us knew exactly what was the Rosary was anyway.  But we knew Liz wouldn\u2019t mind.  Neither of us could remember her ever mentioning the Rosary when she was alive.  Neither of us knew she was Catholic.  But we both knew she was a saint. Liz concludes to Senator Enzi: It is time that federal elected officials get in touch with the people who elected them to office.  There is a huge disconnect between what goes on in Washington and what is happening in our communities.  I truly believe that the solutions to this problem will come from the individual states who are shouldering much of the burden of this epidemic.  It will only worsen as these children age and become dependent on the states for services.  When the public realizes what has happened they will vote those responsible out of office.  I believe in democracy and justice.  In the end historians will write that in the case of the \u201cthimerosal generation\u201d the coverup was far worse than the crime. The day before Lyn Redwood called me to tell me Liz was gone, I had rented the movie \u201cMillion Dollar Baby.\u201d  The Four Academy Awards! rating could not pierce my mid-winter\u2019s night funk.  Big deal.  A clich\u00e9 boxer movie with a gender-bender twist for a gimmick.  Have the leading male role cast as an asexual female who was not too pretty and not too butch. The stupid novelty successfully bedazzled the public and the critics, I harrumphed to myself. Liz was hit broadside by a small truck in a car wreck outside Aspen Colorado.  \u201cLiz never revived before she died at the hospital,\u201d explained Rick.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t know until she got to the hospital that her neck was broken from the impact.\u201d  The timing and parallel to the movie was too spooky:  a hero struck down in the prime of her career. Mary Webster and Lenny Schafer had different levels of connection to Liz Birt, but they both used the same word to describe her:  hero.  It\u2019s a word that we bandy about far too often, using it to describe actors whose performances we admire or athletes who make us cheer.  On occasion, though, we find a real hero who inspires us because she chooses not to take the easy road; because she fights for the common good; because she leaves the world a better place.  Real heroes inspire us to light candles.  And that\u2019s quite a legacy.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/Liz-and-Matthew.0.jpg", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2006/01/moment-of-silence-for-liz-birt.html", "http://www.sarnet.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/01/some-candles-cant-be-extinguished.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SOME CANDLES CAN\u2019T BE EXTINGUISHED:  THE LEGACY OF LIZ BIRT\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Sunday, October 02, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post about  respect , which was prompted in part by the dialog that occurred after I wrote about wanting to find common ground with the neurodiversity movement.  Toward the end of the post, I wrote the following passage: In the biomedical community, we often throw around the word \u201ccure.\u201d  When I use that word, I know what I mean and most other people who practice biomedical know what I mean.  We are seeking to alleviate the dysfunctional aspects of ASD in our children.  We will never alter the genetic makeup of our children, and to the extent genes make them autistic, they will remain autistic.  I can live with that.  But I believe that one or more environmental insults has acted in concert with my son\u2019s genetic makeup to create stumbling blocks that keep him from using all of this gifts.  I cannot believe I am wrong in trying to reduce the effects of those environmental insults. My hope in writing that was to explain that the concept of a cure should not be perceived as a threat to those who view autism in terms other than dysfunction.  I apparently did not do a very good job, as some folks on both sides of the biomedical-neurodiversity line apparently misunderstood my intentions and beliefs.  I apologize for length of the following tome, but I need to make sure I am understood.  Not long after I wrote the above, Kevin Leitch, a blogger with whom I seldom agree but almost always respect (and who I have come to like on a personal level) referred to my words to contrast something attributed to Lenny Schafer on the Evidence of Harm listserve.    Kev wrote  that he considers Lenny to be a \u201cborderline bigot,\u201d and he even suggested that I should lead my own listserve to take the place of Lenny and the EOH board.  Well, in the words of the always quotable  William Tecumseh Sherman , a yankee who knew his limitations:  \u201cIf nominated, I will not run.  If elected, I will not serve.\u201d   There is no need to discard the EOH listserve, and no need to replace Lenny.  Like any other internet group, it serves a purpose of forming a collective wisdom among those who share a common interest or ideal.  That does not mean that everything that is posted therein qualifies as \u201cwisdom.\u201d  I am quite sure the same holds true for any listserve, including the AutAdvo group to which many in the neurodiversity movement belong. I think language is important, but I think tone is equally important because it sheds much light on a speaker\u2019s intent.  And often the best means of determining the tone in a conversation is to examine the context of the words the writer chooses.  For example, Kev, on a few occasions, has excoriated Lujene Clark for a comment she wrote to him on one occasion.  Now, I can\u2019t really say that I know Lujene, but I\u2019ve exchanged emails with her in the past, and I\u2019ve read much of what she and her husband, Alan, have written.  She has always struck me as a very reasonable person.  So I looked at the  context  of the message Kev found so offensive, and found it to be at the end of a heated on-line exchange.  The strange part was the bile seemed to start with Lujene making an innocent mistake about Kev\u2019s name.  Otherwise, her remarks struck me as pretty reasonable, although I\u2019m certain Kev took offense at the suggestion that his daughter might benefit from a biomedical intervention.  In any event, the tone of Kev\u2019s response to Lujene was inflammatory, as was his response to another person who left a comment but unfortunately misspelled one word for which Kev openly ridiculed her. Yes, I believe that words are important, but I believe the tone of a conversation is equally important.  The  second post  I made on the blog criticized the self-appointed defenders of skeptical science for the attitude that it was perfectly acceptable to introduce harshness into a debate so long as the insult was relevant.  I still believe civility matters, but I also understand that it gets difficult to keep turning the other cheek. Yes, Lenny Schafer and I often use different tones in our writing, but I\u2019ve never been vilified like Lenny has.  Now I\u2019m sure that Lenny would be able to give one version of how the feud started, and those who speak ill of him would give a completely different version.  I\u2019m not particularly interested in who started the war of words.  What I am interested in is sharing my observations about Autism, and, in turn, learning about autism from others who have something to say. When Kev quoted me in his blog, he left out much of the context.  Here\u2019s part of what I said before the part Kev found so interesting: When you get right down to it, we have far more in common that we have real divisions.  The divisions are largely the result of semantic differences.  As we continue to discuss things in a rational and respectful manner, we develop a common lexicon and we learn. Anything worth believing in should be able to stand up to scrutiny.  I firmly believe in what my wife and I are doing for my son through biomedical interventions.  The respectful conversations I have had with those who think otherwise have not shaken my belief.  I will continue to encourage others to consider walking the same path we are walking.  But I have learned enough from my new friends that I am starting to recognize the limitations of what we are doing. The word \u201ccure\u201d may not have a place in the common lexicon of the conversation between the biomedical and neurodiversity communities.  But that is only because most members of one of the two groups do not see the need to recognize that word as necessary.  So I try to be careful about using the word in that context.  My semantic caution when writing in a particular context, however, cannot change my belief that  my wife and I are curing our son . How either community chooses to describe autism is irrelevant.  Medical science does not define autism by a particular genetic makeup, but rather by a constellation of dysfunctional characteristics found in autistic individuals.  By definition, if one permanently rids the autistic individual of the dysfunctional characteristics, they cease to be autistic.  Ergo, the individual is \u201ccured.\u201d The biomedical interventions my wife and I use cannot change our son\u2019s genetic makeup.  So to the extent his autism results solely from genetics, he\u2019ll still have that.  And if he remains autistic, I can live with that and be content knowing I did all that I could.  That being said, I don\u2019t think genetics alone explains my son\u2019s ASD, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have the diagnosis after we complete the intervention. I freely admit that I am not a scientist.  But I learned enough about  science and the scientific method , and I have read enough of the emerging science as well as the countervailing studies, to understand that we are still in the early stages of discovering why some children are on the spectrum.  I have also spoken with people of science for whom I have a great respect.  I think I have at least a rudimentary idea about the nature of my son\u2019s condition with which my family lives on a daily basis. I am not sure that all cases of ASD were triggered by environmental factors like exposure to thimerosal.  But the increase in diagnosis over the last few decades cannot be adequately explained by differences in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness.  Something has been happening to our children, and, at least in the case of my son, I think I know what. I believe my son was born with a genetic predisposition that impaired his immune system and left him susceptible to certain environmental insults.  I believe the first insult came within hours of his birth when he was given his first vaccination for Hepatitis B, a disease primarily communicated through activities my son will not even be capable of engaging in for several years to come.  That vaccination contained thimerosal, a purported preservative and purifying agent with a makeup, by weight, which is nearly half mercury.  I believe that dose of thimerosal, and the bolus doses that followed in subsequent vaccines, produced some degree of neurological impairment, manifesting itself primarily by a mild development in speech delay.  I believe, also, that the thimerosal my son received did further damage to his already impaired immune system, leaving him more susceptible to damage from live-virus vaccines.  I believe that my son regressed to a point where he was diagnosed as autistic as a direct result of having received the DPT, Polio, and MMR vaccinations -- that\u2019s seven vaccinations in all -- in a single day!  I am not against vaccinating our children, but the way we go about it is absolutely insane. I believe that the biomedical interventions my wife and I use are curing my son of the characteristics that led medical professionals to label him as autistic.  I do not believe that any gifts he has received through genetics will disappear, and I don\u2019t believe his genetic predisposition to certain environmental insults ( e.g. , heavy metals) will magically vanish.  But I do believe we will permanently rid him of the damage that was done by prior insults.  If we fail to cure him, I can find hope in the courage and dignity I see in my friends from the neurodiversity community. On the question of \u201ccuring\u201d our children, I gladly and proudly stand with  Alan and Lujene Clark , with  Lyn Redwood , with  J.B. Handley , and with  Lenny Schafer .  I may disagree with some of them on certain particulars about autism ( e.g. , the emphasis that has been placed on thimerosal as a causative factor to the exclusion of other factors).  And I may disagree with them as to whether the cure we seek is appropriate for all who share the ASD diagnosis because I am not sure that all ASD is triggered by the same environmental factors.  I consider those disagreements minor.   Certainly my style is a little different from that of some of those other folks, at least when it comes to public pronouncements.  As a good Episcopalian, I have always been better at personal belief than I am at evangelism.  But that does not diminish my belief in the least. So what common ground can we possibly find with the neurodiversity community?  I still believe the common struggle we have to defend the dignity of each individual on the spectrum is just as important as our search for a cure.  (Here\u2019s a  great post by Kristina Chew  on that subject.)  All of us who are parents have had to cry when we see other kids avoid or mistreat our children.  We\u2019ve had to roll our eyes at the ignorance of adults who can\u2019t seem to distinguish autism from mental retardation.  And we\u2019ve had to fight school officials who don\u2019t seem to understand their obligation to help our children.  The battle against ignorance and injustice is worth fighting, and so I will gladly and proudly stand beside Kathleen Seidel and Kevin Leitch in that battle.  The fact that battle is necessary explains why I cannot agree with my friends in the neurodiversity movement that I should concentrate on healing the world and forget healing my son.  I obviously disagree with them on the question of whether healing is appropriate and possible (and I hope I have stated that disagreement with sufficient clarity).  The fact is that the world will not soon change to embrace those with autism.  The differences between autistic individuals and neurotypical members of society is not based on a mere ethnic difference.  Unlike ethnic diversity that will strengthen a society, autism can (not will or shall, but can) cut the individual out of society to an extent that contributing to, and benefiting from, society becomes problematic.   If you read what I have written before, it should be obvious that I am well aware of the contributions many autistic people make on a daily basis.  But how many autistic individuals reach a high-functioning level.  It is simply not an answer to reassure us that all children progress at different levels, but that they all learn to communicate; that attempted answer only raises two questions that are impossible to answer.  Can anyone tell me when that ability kicks in, and can anyone tell me that my son will reach a certain level? The problem we face is that, like it or not (and you can mark me down for the \u201cnot\u201d side), our society has reached a point that children are expected to begin achieving immediately.  We know too many children at school that are exceptionally bright, and yet they are years behind in grade level, or they are unable to pass tests required to advance to the next grade.  I am not trying to have my son live out my dreams; I just want him to be able to utilize his talents and gifts.    Much has been written in various blogs about a site called \u201c Getting the Truth Out .\u201d  As I have stated before, I was very moved by this presentation.  A young woman lets us into her world, and debunks several myths.  I respect her intelligence; I admire her courage; and I will gladly fight for her right to dignity and self-determination.  But if anyone asks me if I want my son to face the same struggles this young woman does, my answer is an unqualified \u201cNO.\u201d We are two communities that need to talk and work together on the issue of human dignity, but that cannot happen if our differences on the question of a cure distract us.  Unfortunately, a productive dialog is impossible if we in the biomedical community do not resist the urge to try and shove our cure down the unwilling throats of people who have made rational decisions to walk a different path.  On the other hand, those who differ with us need to avoid telling us how deluded they think we are, or how we really don\u2019t have our children\u2019s best interest at heart.  And for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t tell us we just don\u2019t get it.  We understand autism all too well. Human nature compels us to question the motives of those who disagree with us.  Sometimes it takes a conscious effort to move past that.  Trying to cure our children, and defending someone else\u2019s right to reject that cure are not mutually exclusive.  Let the civil dialog continue, but understand from the outset:  we will cure our children.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=283", "http://www.vw.cc.va.us/vwhansd/HIS269/Generals/Sherman.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=146", "http://www.nomercury.org/", "http://www.safeminds.org/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://home.doitnow.com/~subs/", "http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/09/human-dignity-86.html", "http://www.gettingthetruthout.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/semantics-and-civility.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SEMANTICS AND CIVILITY\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      Thank you to the friend who emailed to let me know my \"Comments\" section needed to be fixed to allow anonymous contributions. I think I have it fixed now. I\u2019m still new at this, and I ask that you bear with me as I learn how to make this site work. Your comments are most welcome regardless of your views, and I will respect your right to privacy in doing so, although anonymous opinions are not worth much to me. All I really ask is that you show a little respect and civility in your comments. Respect and civility seem to be in as short a supply on the web as they are anywhere else these days. There was a time between the turbulent sixties and the mid-nineties when we weren\u2019t all spoiling for a fight. Now we\u2019re divided into \"red\" and \"blue,\" and we\u2019re all too busy talking to listen. Most of us recall 1992, when the Los Angeles area erupted into riots after some policemen were acquitted of beating an African-American by the name of Rodney King. In the midst of violence born of frustration, Mr. King appeared on live television and pleaded with his fellow citizens: \"Can we all just get along?\" Oddly enough, even that simple but eloquent statement became a source of division between those who thought Mr. King made a comical figure and those who were touched by the humanity of his gesture. I\u2019ve been thinking about Rodney King\u2019s plea a lot lately. It seems that everyone is frustrated and angry about something. Cable television and talk radio fan the flames with harsh rhetoric. And the only reason some people engage in any discussion of a given issue is to hurl insults at someone who may think differently. When I first started getting my feet wet in the bloggosphere by leaving comments on various sites, I found myself drawn into the middle of some terribly harsh and mean-spirited discussions about the causes of autism. I guess that can be expected given the passion that resides within the very being of anyone who lives with the reality of autism on a daily basis. We lost parts of our kids and, dammit, we want to know why and what can we do to make them whole again! It\u2019s a passion that cannot come from greed. I understand that passion all too well, and I too feel the anger and frustration. That being said, I roll my eyes when I see anyone who expresses a different view stand accused of being a \"shill for big Pharma\" regardless of an absence of evidence to that effect. I wince when I hear of someone\u2019s home number being published on the web for the purposes of harassment. Still, I understand where the anger comes from. It comes from being called a greedy plaintiff, an anti-vax wacko, a conspiracy nut, or just plain stupid. I have no doubt that people on both sides of the thimerosal issue will claim that they didn\u2019t start the harsh war of words. It\u2019s all a matter of one\u2019s perspective. I try to keep that in mind when I see comments or blogs by the self-appointed guardians of science. I often wonder about the source of their passion for debating against the thimerosal-autism connection. It\u2019s hard to believe that they all could be shills considering the relatively wide range of topics they cover in their own blogs, but their zeal for debating \"our\" issue makes them easy targets for the label. Of course, the fact that they refuse to reveal their identities makes it even easier to believe there might be a connection to the vaccine industry. If you ask these anonymous defenders of thimerosal, they say that they are only interested in good science. But does a good scientist dismiss a theory just because it is still in the process of being proven or refuted by the scientific method? Maybe I\u2019m just na\u00efve, but I tend to think those folks with the cute cybernames are just a bunch of guys and gals who are terribly impressed with their own intellects, and they think we\u2019re an easy outlet for showing off how clever they can be with words. They bait people like me by articulating the apparent stupidity of our opinions, which of course implies the stupidity of anyone who would hold such an opinion. But if anyone dares to use equally harsh rhetoric or, even worse, question the integrity of one of the epidemiological researchers working for the CDC or vaccine manufacturers, they cry out \" ad hominem \" at the top of their lungs. When one of these fellows gets really wound up, the phrase is repeated several times in a paragraph. I always get a mental image of Ralph Kramden, of  Honeymooners  fame, putting an angry spin on his classic sputtering:  \"ad homina, homina, homina.\" The hypocrisy of the  ad hominem  protests is best illustrated on one of their blogs.   Skeptico , on July 29, 2005, wrote a fairly interesting and well-written commentary on  ad hominem  arguments. I\u2019m not sure, though, if he realized the irony in writing that \"people on both sides of the political spectrum criticize the other side for this method of debate, and yet they don\u2019t realize they do it themselves.\" The \"comments\" section of the  blog  includes a lively and unusually well-mannered debate that reveals a great deal about folks like Skeptico. In Skeptico\u2019s opinion, it is acceptable debate technique to call one\u2019s opponent an idiot if it\u2019s in the context of criticizing the opponent\u2019s position with particular facts and figures. Although Skeptico correctly refers to the definition of  ad hominem  arguments as attacks on an adversary rather than an appeal to logic, he ignores the current usage of the phrase that includes any personal attack regardless of its use in an argument. Moreover, even if we refer to the name calling as just plain rudeness, the harshness of tone serves the same purpose as the traditional  ad hominem  attack: i.e, a tactic to distract from the deficiencies of one\u2019s own argument by baiting the opponent into a personal attack. All a personal attack really accomplishes is a slap on the back from others of like opinion; it will never convince anyone who might otherwise have an open mind. As usual, I\u2019ve gone a little overboard on making what should have been a couple of simple points. You\u2019re welcome to leave a comment, but please keep it clean and civil. I promise not to call you a shill (unless, of course, you\u2019re  Paul Offit ).

{"date": "Monday, January 02, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      One of the nice things about the internet is that you don\u2019t have to actually meet people in order to make their acquaintance.  Sometimes it just takes the exchange of a couple of comments.  In response to my last post, Hal Betzhold left the following comment: Wade, Hope you and your family have a fantastic new year! You and my daughter, Amber, will now be happy.  Our blog is up and running!  I want to thank you for your blog.  My wife and I have found it enlightening and inspiring.  It\u2019s great to hear a voice of reason. Check out our blog; we\u2019d love to hear from you. Well, you just gotta know there\u2019s a story behind that one Like a lot of bloggers, I like to take a look at the referral list I can access through Site Meter to see how people find this site.  It\u2019s fascinating to see the search terms that triggers a good Google hit, although I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve had any of the truly weird searches leading folks here that  other bloggers  have discovered.  I also enjoy finding out what pages that link to mine are providing hits.  Not long ago, I came across a hit that originated from  Art to Cure Autism , and I had to check out what kind of a site had such an intriguing name. What I found was a site that was not yet fully up and running, but it had a great look.  There was one test post, complete with a couple of posts from a young lady named Amber, imploring her father to get with the program and start blogging.  I couldn\u2019t resist seconding that motion.  And several days later, I was delighted to see Hal\u2019s comment.  I immediately went to the site, and I\u2019m happy to report it is well worth a visit. Hal Betzhold is an artist, who lives with his wife, Linda, their 12-year old daughter, the aforementioned Amber, and their 10-year old son, Beau.  Beau is on the spectrum, and he is the reason for the blog.  As Hal writes: Like many children of this epidemic, Beau is a hero.  In his short life of only ten years, he has had more adversity and hardship than many people ever see.  His world has often been a place of confusion, frustration and physical pain.  Like most heroes, Beau faces each day with the courage and determination to be and do the best he can.  Many times people have asked me or my wife, Linda, \u201cHow do you guys do it?  You must be special people to be able to deal with your son\u2019s illness.\u201d  The truth of the matter is we don\u2019t feel special at all.  There are many times that we find ourselves discouraged and exhausted, feverishly praying that Beau\u2019s autism would just disappear so we can get our lives back.  What keeps me answering the bell, no matter what round it may be, is my personal hero, Beau.  How do we do it -- with the inspiration of the bravest ten year old boy I know. How do we not give it everything we\u2019ve got? Those bold words -- and the use of the \u201cC\u201d word in the blog\u2019s name -- will likely draw fire from some quarters.  As for myself, however, I admire this family\u2019s spirit, their determination, and their words.  And make no mistake about it, this blog is a family project.  For the first couple of posts, Hal obviously had a little help from Linda.  Those posts include a wonderful personal remembrance of  Liz Birt .   But don\u2019t get the impression that Hal\u2019s sitting back and letting Linda and Amber do all the heavy lifting.  The site includes several pieces of Hal\u2019s art.  For a modest sum, prints are available, with all of the proceeds going to help defray the costs of Beau\u2019s biomedical treatment (sounds like they\u2019ve gotten the same response from their health insurer we\u2019ve gotten). Art to Cure Autism is clearly a family project:  a family project born in love.  I am happy to have made the acquaintance of this family, and I look forward to getting to know them a little better in 2006.

{"date": "Sunday, August 07, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      This is a new blog. I chose the name \"Injecting Sense\" partly because I believe any discussion can use an injection of common sense. The name also reflects an issue that dominates life in my home: whether thimerosal-containing vaccines and possibly live-virus vaccines have contributed to the increased occurrence of autism spectrum disorders in the United States. (For the benefit of anyone who is not familiar with this issue,  thimerosal  is a preservative sometimes used in vaccines and other pharmaceutical products. Ethylmercury, a known neurotoxin, comprises nearly one-half of thimerosal.) This issue is personal to my family because my youngest son is autistic, a condition we believe is related to vaccines he received. I maintain a keen interest in other issues of the day, and I hope this site does not limit itself to issues of vaccines and autism. But given the passion that people on both sides of the issue have on the subject, I suspect the suspected link between vaccines and autism will be the primary topic of discussion. Although I may address our family's background in the autism debate in a later post, today is devoted to this morning's edition of  Meet the Press , in which Tim Russert hosted -- in Mr. Russert's words -- \"a very civil discussion\" between David Kirby, author of  Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic , and Dr. Harvey Fineberg, President of The Institute of Medicine. What made the presentation so refreshing for some of us was the balance. Unfortunately we too often see coverage by the national media that presents this issue as being between all scientists and physicians in the world unanimously agreeing that there is no connection on the one side, and a bunch of crazy moms who think there is a connection on the other side. There is never any mention of the scientists and physicians who risk their professional reputations to present evidence supporting the theory and who pioneer treatments to help our children. Those one-sided stories are invariably followed by advertisements for pharmaceutical companies. Of course, just about any story on a national news program has a good chance of being followed up by a pharmaceutical ad considering how we can no longer turn on the television without being told to ask our doctors if [insert name] is right for us. The inherent conflict of interest in the national media covering this story is self-evident. To be sure, there have been a few pockets of media that have been more sympathetic; Don Imus and Montel Williams come to mind. But with the exception of some very fair stories by Sharyl Atkinson on the CBS Evening News, the major news operations have pretended that the science only supports one side. Today, Mr. Russert helped NBC News regain some of the credibility it lost as the result of -- to put it politely -- sloppy reporting by its \"science\" correspondent. The discussion on  Meet the Press  included credible and well-spoken representatives from both sides of the issue, who were both given an opportunity to state their positions. (One can quibble with the opportunity being a little unequal, but the inequity had more to do with Dr. Fineberg's drawn-out delivery than with any impartiality on Mr. Russert's part.) Dr. Fineberg made some statements that need to be examined because they raise more questions than were answered. (In fact, the questions are the same ones we keep asking in the hope that someday we may actually get an answer.) First, Dr. Fineberg admitted that no one can know with certainty how much of the marked increase in autistic disorders we have seen in recent years is due to differences in diagnostic standards and how much is due to increased exposure to environmental insults. That is something folks who believe there is a link must also admit -- that we cannot not know with certainty. Certainty can only come when we have learned a lot more about the effects of thimerosal on the neurological development of susceptible children. Even though we cannot know something with certainty does not mean, however, that our suspicions are unreasonable. Common sense tells us that the astronomical difference in the old numbers and new numbers cannot be completely explained by saying we know a lot more about it all now. Personal observations may not be scientific, but they count for something. Even before my son was diagnosed or started showing autistic tendencies, I observed how many more children seemed \"different.\" To be sure, there are autistic adults who grew up before the changes to the vaccine schedule greatly increased the level of exposure to kids. But casual observation does not reveal the same percentages of autistic adults as there are children, especially when one considers the severity of symptoms we are seeing in young children. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any good means of getting an accurate number for autistic adults by which we can compare the different generations. As could be expected, this morning's discussion addressed what many of us believe to be the greatest weakness in the 2004 IOM report: its complete reliance on epidemiological reports, and its rejection of any biological studies. Epidemiology serves a useful purpose in examining the issue, and it can provide clues. Population studies, however, cannot be the sole determinant of the question because they cannot fully account for genetic predisposition, and they are too subject to preordained results. I liken epidemiological studies to forensic accounting because changing the input parameters changes the results. We can't have a real answer without clinical, biological, and animal studies. That's why I nearly fell out of my chair when Dr. Fineberg, at a fairly early point in the discussion, stated: ... When you're dealing with a problem as complex as autism, Tim, you have to look at it from many different points of view and assemble evidence from many different vantage points. Biological evidence in humans and in animals, toxicologic evidence, how does the body deal with toxins, and evidence looking at the actual experience in populations.  Well said, Dr. Fineberg. So why did the IOM rely solely on epidemiological reports? The deficiencies in those reports have been well covered elsewhere. In trying to refute criticisms of the five studies on which the IOM relied, Dr. Fineberg ignored most of the objections and instead focused on the one criticism for which he had a pithy response: When the letter you read states that these five studies were not replicated, I can't help but think that each one of them has been replicated four times. We have now a growing body of evidence, while imperfect, altogether convincing and all reaching the same conclusion, even though they vary in their methods and in their approaches. And that conclusion was no association between the receipt of vaccines containing thimerosal and the development of autism. How can a study replicate another study when it varies in its method and approach? Why is the approach even valid when -- as could be said of the much-debated Danish studies -- the researchers looked at two completely different groups to measure the differences in vaccines with and without thimerosal? And why should we not consider the funding of the studies (i.e., the regulatory agencies who devised the vaccine schedules and the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture vaccines)? Late in the conversation, David Kirby tried to return the debate back to the non-epidemiological evidence that seems to preponderate in favor of a link between thimerosal and the development of autism in susceptible children, and he posed a challenge to the IOM: MR. KIRBY: ... These are the types of things that I think need to be researched further. Yes, we need to look at the epidemiology. There's a whole lot of new biology. This has all been published. None of the biology was published at the time of the IOM hearing. It has since been published, and I actually wonder if the IOM would consider reconvening a new committee or a new hearing to consider the evidence that's come out in the year and a half since the last report. MR. RUSSERT:  Would you? DR. FINEBERG: Tim, Mr. Kirby's description about the certitude of this evidence, I think, exceeds the actual balance of evidence that is produced when you look at the totality. It's true that mercury is handled differently in the body when it's in the form of so-called ethyl mercury, which is in vaccines, and methyl mercury, which was actually the form, which was -- on which the standards of exposure were based. That's the type found in fish, as has been mentioned. But when you look back at the studies of actual poisonings of children with large amounts of methyl mercury and ethyl mercury, most toxicologists believe that the ethyl form of the mercury is less toxic than the methyl form -- less toxic to the nervous system. And that's based on many experiences with poisoning by these different forms of mercury. Had Dr. Fineberg been testifying on a witness stand, the examining lawyer would have immediately turned to the judge and objected to the non-responsiveness of the answer, after which the judge would have turned to Dr. Fineberg and sternly warned the witness to simply answer the question, after which he could add in his own explanatory comments. But this conversation was not being held in a court, and Dr. Fineberg was free to evade the question. In doing so, Dr. Fineberg chose to rely on a mantra intoned repeatedly by the pro-thimerosal crowd that has been shown to be false: i.e., the myth that ethylmercury is not as dangerous as methylmercury. The recent  Burbacher primate studies  demonstrated that a normal primate processes ethylmercury out of the body more rapidly than it does methylmercury. The problem is that the children who have been affected by thimerosal are not \"normal.\" (As the  study by Jill James  shows, some children are deficient in glutathione, an enzyme that enable the body to process toxic metals from the body.) The Burbacher primate study further indicates that ethylmercury, if it is not processed out of the body, actually is capable of greater harm than methylmercury. Unfortunately, inconsistency and inaccuracies are what we have come to expect from the people who are supposed to be protecting our children. The following exchange addressed the IOM's recommendation (and it was only a recommendation) of several years ago to remove thimerosal: MR. RUSSERT:  Why was thimerosal then taken out of the vaccination? DR. FINEBERG: There's no question that mercury is a neurotoxin. And if there were ways, which there are, to protect vaccines without using mercury-containing substances, it was prudent to remove it, not because there was evidence that it caused autism or even definitive evidence that the amounts in those vaccines caused any neuro problems, but because it was an added measure of precaution that was sensible and correct. And I might add that the latest vaccines that contained any thimerosal as a preservative, with the exception of some flu vaccines, were completed in 2001 and outdated in 2003. So anyone watching this program, any parent can be confident that when they take their child to the pediatrician to be immunized this year, they will receive vaccines without thimerosal as a preservative. Dr. Fineberg is, of course, right that mercury is a neurotoxin, and that safe alternatives to thimerosal exist. Unfortunately, Dr. Fineberg inaccurately reassured America that thimerosal is no longer present in vaccines (a bit of misinformation that Mr. Russert unfortunately repeated at the end of the program). First, and most obviously, thimerosal is still used in most flu vaccines -- vaccines that the CDC strongly recommends be administered to the youngest of infants and pregnant women. Second, thimerosal is still used in the manufacturing process of many vaccines. Although efforts are made to filter the thimerosal out before the vaccine is shipped out, the finished product still contains \"trace\" amounts of mercury. Indeed, there have been some indications that some manufacturers are more proficient than others in removing the thimerosal. But even if there are only \"trace\" amounts, the fact remains that thimerosal is still present, and there has never been any real safety study to show that thimerosal is safe at any level for a child that has a genetic inability to excrete mercury. Children are still at risk. To David Kirby, I extend the thanks of a parent for, once again, being the articulate voice of children who are unable to speak for themselves. Thank you especially for saying that the parents -- the ones fighting this war on the front lines -- need to be listened to. Tim Russert, you were not perfect. You could have asked more follow-up questions when Dr. Fineberg evaded the issues, and you repeated the misinformation about the supposed lack of thimerosal in current vaccines. Nevertheless, you were refreshingly fair and, unlike so many in the national press, you treated our opinions with respect. Thank you. Dr. Fineberg, you were obviously prepared, and you have my thanks for showing up and listening to the questions.

{"date": "Friday, October 14, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n      Almost 21 months ago, we addressed an open letter to the  Chicago Tribune , making it clear just why we felt it necessary to cancel our subscription.  Today, I'm more disgusted than ever at what I used to think was a great paper.  So I thought I'd revisit the letter. January 21, 2010 Mr. Tony Hunter President, Publisher Chicago Tribune Company 435 North Michigan Avenue Chicago, IL 60611 Dear Mr. Hunter: A few days ago, we called the circulation department to cancel our subscription to The Chicago Tribune. We thought it appropriate to write and explain why we thought this necessary. Put briefly, the Tribune\u2019s continuing written assault on the autism community and those who serve us has caused us to lose the high degree of respect we once held for your newspaper. Specifically, articles written (or co-written) by Trine Tsouderos have, in our opinion, strayed from the principles of balance, fairness, and the truth. By way of background explanation, our family is one of the hundreds of thousands in this country who have felt the impact of the autism epidemic. We are part of a growing number of people who have chosen not to meekly embrace our son\u2019s disability, but rather to seek biological explanations for the clinical manifestations that led to the diagnosis and to utilize the best medical treatments to treat the underlying physical conditions. We are not alone on this journey, and like most of the parents who embark on this course, we are well-educated. Both of us have professional backgrounds (including a background in mainstream medicine). Each case of autistic spectrum disorder is unique from a standpoint of both cause and treatment. We have utilized some so-called \u201calternative\u201d therapies together with more traditional treatments. The continued improvement of our son\u2019s clinical manifestations has been nothing short of remarkable. Our story is not unique; there are many of us who have seen first-hand the success that can result from treating underlying physical conditions instead of just the symptoms by which autism traditionally has been defined. Many in our community have attempted to speak to Ms. Tsouderos about the healing we have seen in our children, but she has shown little interest in exploring our perspectives. Instead, she chooses to rely on the same talking points we have so often heard from groups and individuals with vested interests, while ignoring scientific studies providing a basis for the treatments.. On those occasions when she does quote someone \u2013 whether a parent, a practitioner or a scientist \u2013 that quote is invariably taken out of context and is either inaccurate or incomplete. For example, an article this past November, mined several quotes from Dr. Martha Herbert, a distinguished neurologist at Harvard. This was Dr. Herbert\u2019s response to the Tribune, which your paper chose to ignore: I did a rather long interview with the Tribune to explain my thoughts on chelation and additional approaches to solving the health issues connected to autism. The only consequence of my interview is that you use a solitary quote to make me sound contentious and defensive. Is there a reason you chose not to use something I said that would actually illuminate the discussion surrounding chelation and other medical treatments for medical compromises that may exist in these children? To be sure, this is a complex and often controversial subject. The Tribune\u2019s editorial stance on autism treatments, however, seems inconsistent with other positions it has taken. Recently, your paper printed an expos\u00e9 on overuse of drugs at nursing homes, a worthwhile subject. Why is the only focus of your autism coverage upon so-called \u201calternative\u201d treatments? Why is no attention paid to the frighteningly large number of physicians who want to treat autistic children under the age of five with dangerous stimulants and psychiatric pharmaceuticals? And why does the Tribune not show outrage at the fact that the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses that off-label usage of pharmaceuticals in their published treatment recommendations for autism? The Tribune has run recent articles on rising numbers of allergies (including one noting the difficulties the Army is having in filling its ranks due to high incidences of allergies and asthma). Is your paper at all interested in exploring the interrelationship in the alarming rise of various auto-immune disorders: childhood cancer, asthma, allergies, ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (although not unanimous, more and more scientists are acknowledging that disorders in the immune system can cause clinical manifestations of autism)?  Our kids are the canaries in the coal mine. Something is going wrong with an entire generation, and it is rooted in environmental causes: adulteration of our food supply, chemical pollution, contamination of our water, overuse of antibiotics, and quite possibly a public vaccination schedule gone haywire. It\u2019s not just scientific research that\u2019s needed to put these puzzle pieces together; we also need the illumination of the questions in order to solving the questions a public priority. The role of the press is to present the issues in such a manner as to fairly raise the questions. In that, the Tribune has fallen well short of its duty. The articles by Ms. Tsouderos were given front-page treatment, including the latest, which came at a time when every other organ of the press was focused squarely on the recent tragedy in Haiti. The lack of proportionality in that is summed up in one question. Why did the Tribune not show equal alarm with a major front-page article last month, when the Centers for Disease Control announced new autism statistics? According to the CDC, autism spectrum disorders effect one-in-110 children (one-in\u201370 boys), which is a dramatic increase from the one-in 150 the CDC announced just two years ago.  This country is facing a public-health crisis of catastrophic proportions, in which too many families are having to make difficult decisions. Instead of amplifying the seriousness of the situation, the Tribune has chosen to blindly criticize some of the scientists and clinicians who are searching for the answers. We have no doubt that the loss of our subscription will have little economic impact on your company. Further, the publication of the articles in question will have little adverse impact on the Tribune\u2019s reputation \u2013 at least not immediately. What the Tribune has lost, however, is far more precious. It has lost the integrity upon which the paper\u2019s reputation was built through generations.

{"date": "Thursday, August 12, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      Lately it seems like every day my Google news alert, set to alert of any items involving \u201cautism,\u201d brings me a new story of an autistic child or adult whose life was snuffed out.  The exact mechanism changes from case to case, but the root cause remains the same.  The victim died, in large part, because he or she was autistic. Often the victim slips unseen into a pond or pool due to an insatiable fascination with water.  Or maybe the victim wanders off during a hike or camping trip.  Sometimes, the victim just slips away. Too often, we are finding out that a parent succumbs to whatever demons are inside of them, and they perpetrate a homicide.  Other times, a homicide is committed by a professional caretaker.  Our kids make easy targets; many lack an innate sense of danger. A new site, maintained by parents of children on the spectrum, has sprung up to remember those victims.  It\u2019s called  Lives Lost to Autism .  It\u2019s simply a posting of news items.  There is no commentary to condemn any individual; that\u2019s the job of the legal system.  Comments by readers are not allowed, so there is no distracting political debate.  The focus is squarely on the victims.  This site is \u201cautism awareness\u201d in its most basic form. Some time ago, in the wake of Katie McCarron\u2019s death at the hands of her mother, some bloggers \u23af including yours truly \u23af were taken to task for something we weren\u2019t saying.  In essence, some thought we should have loudly decried the murder of an innocent, and condemn those who questioned whether the stress of raising an autistic child played into the killing. My response at that time  was that I was unprepared to label something as a \u201cmurder\u201d (a word with a specific legal meaning) when the facts had not yet been adjudicated in court.  I later commented when the jury meted out a  measure of justice , and defined the action as a mnurder. Frankly, my initial reluctance to discuss the case was also due to my complete inability to comprehend the actions of any parent who would take the life of his or her child.  Unfortunately, there have been too many opportunities to try and understand those kinds of things since then.  I still can\u2019t comprehend it, but I can join in trying to honor the lives of the victims.  Hopefully, if enough attention is drawn to the seriousness of this growing problem and enough people start caring, maybe someone in power will feel pressured enough to do something.  A single web site can\u2019t accomplish all that, but it\u2019s a start. Ironically, the first criticism of  Lives Lost to Autism  has come from the same person who led the criticism of our prior silence.  Kevin Leitch argues that the new site goes about the task badly, because to \u201cpoliticize it so graphically and so ham-fistedly is wrong.\u201d    \u201cPoliticize\u201d the issue?!?  Really?!?  The whole point of not inserting the poster\u2019s commentary is to keep the focus on the victims without making them symbols for a political agenda. But Kev says that the use of the phrases, \u201clives lost to autism,\u201d and \u201clives cut short by autism\u201d make it sound like autism itself is being blamed for murder.  The site says that nowhere.  Murder, by definition, is the act of a person or persons.  The fact that a victim is autistic is most assuredly not a justification for homicide.  Not all of the deaths listed at  Lives Lost to Autism , however, are homicides.  Moreover, one cannot ignore, however, that these victims died because they were autistic. Kev\u2019s real problem is not with the site or the way it\u2019s been set up.  His real problem is that his hypocrisy is showing.  When Karen McCarron, who had been identified as being a member of the \u201ccure\u201d community, killed her daughter, Kev and the other members of The Autism Hub devoted an untold number of posts to the incident and its aftermath.  Doing so was not in itself wrong; in fact memorializing a victim is a good thing to do.  In doing so, however, the labeling of the incident as a \u201cmurder\u201d before all the facts were known, and more to the point, taking others to task for not following the same course, was exactly what Kev now accuses the people behind  Lives Lost to Autism  of.  They politicized a tragedy in a ham-fisted manner. There have been far too many other incidents in which autistic children have been killed by their parents since the McCarron tragedy.  To be sure, there have been a few mentions of those incidents by various members of The Hub.  For the most part, however, the silence has been deafening.  The only distinguishing characteristic between the McCarron murder and the other cases is that the accused perpetrators have no connection to the cure community.  That deprives Kev from pointing a finger at those who would have the temerity to want to remove a disability, and say, \u201csee, they are so hung up by what their children are that they don\u2019t see their humanity.\u201d   Not seeing the humanity of a child is not a function of believing that the process of cure or recovery can improve a child\u2019s life.  As I have often said, I accept my son just as he is, but I do not accept the inevitability of his current disability. At the end of the day,  Lives Lost to Autism  is not about curing autistic children.  It\u2019s not against \u201ccelebrating diversity.\u201d  It\u2019s about reminding a nation and the world that there is a cost for allowing this epidemic to get to this point.  There is a cost for our government, our medical establishment, the media, and society itself turning its collective back on the problem and pretending it doesn\u2019t exist.  And the cost for society\u2019s criminal indifference is all-too-human. ADDENDUM: After the above was posted, Ginger, who originated Lives Lost to Autism, posted her own explanation for the need.

{"date": "Saturday, January 08, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n       On Wednesday, after the news outlets all broke the sensational headlines that \u201cthe\u201d study linking vaccines to the autism epidemic had been reported to be a fraud, Mark Blaxill wrote the following: The desperation of the medical industry to defend it profits and programs is never more on display when they launch a new attack on Andrew Wakefield.  Today\u2019s allegations are not new, they are just an attempt to capture another news cycle and ABC and CNN gladly oblige. This is a time that reminds me of Edmund Burke\u2019s quote, \u201call that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\u201d  I stand with Andy. There was a time in my life when I had planned on going into journalism.  As it turned out, my life\u2019s path took me in a different direction.   There have been times when I wondered if I shouldn\u2019t have stayed in that field.   After this last week, though, I\u2019m kind of glad I\u2019m not a journalist; I\u2019d hate to have to explain the complete lack of moral and/or intellectual integrity that was displayed by too many in that field. I\u2019m really not sure what was worse.  Was it Brian Deer\u2019s cynical and dishonest persecution of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, or was it the total buy-in of people like Anderson Cooper \u23af one of the few guys in the mainstream media I thought was worth a damn?  I was certainly wrong about him. The media fell over itself breaking the astounding news that the British Medical Journal was calling the original case series by Dr. Wakefield, et al a \u201cfraud.\u201d  Did none of those enterprising reporters have the time and energy to look past the headline and examine the story itself?  Does the work of a tabloid journalist acquire credibility simply because it\u2019s published in a \u201cprestigious\u201d medical journal with ties to the pharmaceutical industry? The mainstream press has been pounding on its theme:  pity the poor, misguided parents who desperately turned to a charlatan for answers.  Well, to paraphrase J.B. Handley, we don\u2019t need your sympathy; we need the truth, with all its details and nuances. Reporting the truth, though, requires effort.  And reporting the whole truth may conflict with the business philosophy of publishers and networks \u23af an attitude that filters down to editors and reporters:  simplistic sensationalism sells! Why risk losing your audience by presenting all of the facets of a very complex issue.  It\u2019s easier to boil down a position (especially a position attractive to the industry that spends the most advertising dollars) to the personification of a single individual.  In the view of the arrogant media, the public is far more prepared to watch the downfall of a man than they are willing to think about ideas that many men and women have developed and debate. That\u2019s the present Brian Deer gave to the mainstream media, to the absolute satisfaction of the pharmaceutical/public-health establishment.  He created a straw man to knock down and create a loud noise in its fall.   What the media fails to understand, though, is that the only similarity between that straw man and Andrew Wakefield is the name.  The Andrew Wakefield created by Brian Deer is a myth.  He\u2019s fictitious.  And he\u2019s as devoid of substance and truth as is his creator.   The real Dr. Wakefield is not so easily knocked to the ground.  He has proven time and again that he can stand tall against lies.  He stands with us.

There was a nice breeze out on the water, making it the type of comfortable evening we rarely see in South Louisiana during the summer months. A night like this brings people out, and the pier drew strollers as well as fisherfolk. One gentleman and his son caught my eye. The boy was about 10-years old, and was obviously autistic. He displayed the typical stimming behavior I\u2019ve come to recognize, and his speech was relatively undeveloped for a young man of his age. But his father did not seem self-conscious in the least; he was just enjoying some well-spent time with his son on a beautiful evening. Before the birth of my youngest child  (the one on the spectrum)  I would have focused on an autistic child and felt sorrow for the parents without bothering to notice that the parents neither needed nor wanted pity. Now I know better. Having an autistic child is a gift. Every day I get to celebrate progress that I took for granted with my older kids.

{"date": "Saturday, September 17, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n       This has been the season of nail-biting for my wife and me.  After years of steady progress in elementary school, the Little Rankster went into Middle School this year.  He\u2019s now learning to deal with the constant changing of classrooms, dealing with the locker, changing for P.E., etc.  It\u2019s a lot of change to throw at any kid\u2014especially one on the spectrum. The biggest change has been that he now rides the school bus.  It\u2019s not the \u201cspecial\u201d bus; it\u2019s the \u201cregular\u201d bus with all of the neurotypical kids.   And that\u2019s a bit scary for us as parents.   We\u2019ve tried to use it as an opportunity for fostering more independence.  We only walk with him for about a third of the two-block walk to the bus stop.  But it\u2019s so difficult sometimes to let go. This was the conversation the other morning as we left the house: Dad:  You don\u2019t mind if I walk all the way with you, do you? LR:  Actually, I\u2019ll just kiss you good-bye here. Dad:  Okay.  But then I\u2019ll walk you all the way. LR:  Actually, Dad, you\u2019ll just walk me half-way. As I watched him walk, weighed down by his backpack and his trombone, I thought back over the journey thus far.   I remembered the conversation when the developmental pediatrician gave us the Little Rankster\u2019s diagnosis.  He had three pieces of advice.  The first two items were to put him on Ritalin (a recommendation for off-label use, by the way), and to immediately put him in a \u201cspecial\u201d school where they would know how to \u201cbest deal with his problem.\u201d  The third piece of advice was to get on the waiting list for an institution, because the likelihood was that he would never speak or be able to function in a mainstream environment.  I was in shock, but my wife was energized into action.  And her reaction saved my son. So here we are now, with a boy who attends school in a mainstream environment without an aide.  He plays\u2014and even excels\u2014in the school band.  In Elementary School, he sang in the chorus, and served on the student council.   To be sure, there are still struggles and issues, and we\u2019re not finished yet.  But the progress borders on the miraculous.   It didn\u2019t just happen.  There\u2019s been a lot of work.  There has been lots of biomedical intervention and assorted \u201cvoodoo.\u201d  There have been weekly visits to speech therapists, and summer programs to work on one thing or the other.  There was a move from our beloved home to another state to have better access to services, and to be closer to a remarkable physician who has had an immeasurable impact on our family. Through it all, there has been one person who\u2019s worked at it harder than my wife and me.  And as I watched that person walk to his bus stop, I came to a realization.  Sometimes a one-block walk can be a hell of a long journey.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RcPXsw-LGVM/TnU94hV7vZI/AAAAAAAAAJs/ADbvQUd7ukk/s1600/photo.jpg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2011/09/long-walk.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE LONG WALK\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Sunday, January 16, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n      In the debates about vaccine rights, just as in the parallel debates about autism, one does not need to search too far to find hypocrisy.    But then hypocrisy comes easily to those who want to oversimplify the issues. The desire to oversimplify complicated issues leads to the tagging of anyone who might question the safety of the one-size-fits-all vaccination policy as an \u201canti-vaxxer.\u201d  The moral myopia required to use such a misleading moniker and maintain a straight face while doing so is staggering.  It is nothing short of the demonization of concerned parents, physicians and scientists who are only asking legitimate questions. What we hear are broad moralizations about how casting doubt on the vaccination program disrupts herd immunity, leading to the rise of dreaded disease and the death of children.  One must first ask if there really is a rise in diseases such as measles among the population of, for the most part, vaccinated children?  I am always suspicious of any answer that comes to us courtesy of epidemiology, a peculiar science in which results are completely dependent upon the manner in which the researchers decide to classify data. Assuming there has been a rise in certain diseases like measles, is that rise due to a relatively small population that is avoiding vaccination, or is it the development of new strains that are resistant to any immunity flowing from inoculation?  (Keep in mind that the same people who make the connection between unvaccinated kids and outbreaks of measles are the same guys who always tell us that correlation does not mean causation.)  A similar question must be asked about whether the newly diagnosed cases of measles are necessarily more deadly than what we saw before the development of vaccines; this is a malady that was considered a normal part of childhood when I was growing up. Am I completely off-base here?  Let\u2019s look at outbreaks of polio that have arisen on occasion in recent years.  At first, we always hear how this was caused by a breakdown in herd immunity because some children weren\u2019t getting vaccinated.  Then comes the news that the strain of polio that had been diagnosed actually originated with the vaccine itself.  (See,  e.g. ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here ).  Although the authorities all emphasize that the outbreak is primarily among the unvaccinated, the question must still be raised.  Why should the eradication of a \u201cwild\u201d disease result in the creation of a new disease? But let\u2019s leave aside the question of disease outbreak.  Let\u2019s assume that having a relatively small subpopulation of children avoid particular vaccinations might result in isolated outbreaks of disease and perhaps even death.  I\u2019m not buying it, but let\u2019s assume it for the sake of a full discussion.  Why are those consequences more egregious than the consequences that sometimes flow from receiving routine vaccinations? Why do some people feel outrage over the death or hardship to a child who contracts a \u201cvaccine-preventable\u201d disease, but not one tear is shed over  Elias Tembenis ?  Elias had his life cut short by the DTaP vaccine.  The Vaccine Court did not want to address whether or not his all-too-brief life was made harder by autism brought on by vaccines, but the Special Master had to concede that his epilepsy and seizures, which led to his death, were the direct result of a vaccine reaction ( pdf of decision here ). The Tembenis family, who strive every day to have their lost son live through their own good works, are not alone.  The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has awarded billions for death and injury directly caused by vaccine reactions.  That money, however, can never repair the damage done. And then there\u2019s the damage and death that won\u2019t be acknowledged because the cost to the vaccination program would be too great.   How many young girls must die  because their parents thought they were protecting them from cancer by immunizing them from a STD?  How many other girls who get the Gardasil vaccine will live a life filled with suffering in the name of some \u201cgreater good,\u201d like the  daughter of Amy Pingel ? Then there\u2019s autism.  Despite the best efforts of the public-health/pharmaceutical complex to declare the debate over, we still have not determined once and for all what role might have been \u23af and might still be \u23af played by vaccinations in the environmental triggering of the ASD epidemic.  If those of us who believe that role is significant are correct, then the denialists have a lot of blood on their hands, for there have been far too many  lives lost to autism . I am not asking for anyone to change their mind if they truly believe that the costs of the vaccination program outweigh the risks.  It is clear that many of those people understand that vaccines can and do cause wrong, but they think the sacrifice is worth it.  I have to say, though, that they scare me more than those who are only in the argument to protect profits.  The willingness to ignore the harm is no less disingenuous just because they think they\u2019re right.   If people like that truly believe that the children whose lives have been ruined or even taken by vaccine reactions are regrettable collateral damage whose sacrifice serves the greater good, they should at least have the decency to acknowledge that sacrifice.  They should be willing to stand face-to-face with Harry and Gina Tembenis, and with Amy Pingel and her daughter, and explain why they think the sacrifice served society. And if there\u2019s anyone out there who thinks their child was harmed because some other child didn\u2019t get fully vaccinated, I\u2019ll be glad to talk to them and share with them the stories of countless children who have been harmed.

The estimates from the neurodiversity and \u201cskeptic\u201d bloggers grossly underestimated the size of the crowd in a range of \u201c100 or so\u201d to \u201cless than 200.\u201d  The smallest of those estimates came from Ken Reibel, who apparently was trying to dispel the myth that everyone on the spectrum is a math genius.  Based on his blog post, he seemed to base his estimate on the fact that we had lots of bananas left over (those bananas were available in plentiful supply after being donated by a kind sponsor).  Ken went so far as to address a comment to me on the previous post, asking if I was disappointed in the attendance.  The short answer is \u201cnot at all.\u201d Every permit application we filed with the Park District and various City agencies (and I should know; I personally completed, signed, and filed each of them) clearly stated that we expected no more than 500 people, including \u201cbystanders.\u201d  Indeed, if we had received the \u201cthousands\u201d of attendees one blogger said we were expecting, we would have faced some pretty stiff fines and penalties.  The fact is, we anticipated anywhere between 200 and 500 people, and we had attendance in that range.  And that was pretty good for a Wednesday mid-afternoon in downtown Chicago.  Add to that the hundreds that joined on-line, and this inaugural event for the Center for Personal Rights did quite well indeed. Some internet wags, who weren\u2019t there, based extremely low estimates on what they saw on various movies or on the internet feed.  Of course, most of those were shot from the middle of the grove, where the fewest number of people were congregated; most chose to sit off to the side in the shade (the day was quite hot). So Ken Reibel based his estimate on the number of bananas left over and the fact that not all of the prepared signs were used.  (The rally had 150 signs prepared; 100 were used; about half of the crowd held signs, and about one-third to one-half of those were signs made by the participants rather than provided by the rally.  You do the math.)  We chose a slightly more primitive method of crowd estimating.  We counted people rather than fruit.  I cannot represent any of our counts as being completely accurate given the roaming nature of the attendees at an event like this, but everyone who actually attempted to perform a count came in with a consistent figure of over 300. What makes the underestimating of our attendance all the more comical are statements by those same commentators grossly inflating the number of \u201ccounter-demonstrators\u201d there.  In truth, it was the least demonstrative counter-demonstration one could imagine.  Approximately five students stood on the sidewalk and passed out \u201cHug Me, I\u2019m Vaccinated\u201d leaflets to passers by.  And of course, there were a few self-styled \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d who have been quick to pat themselves on the back for their bravery on their various blogs, etc.  We were more than willing to tolerate their presence provided they behaved civilly, and they did for the most part. The one exception was the woman who gleefully approached Dr. Wakefield, pretending to be a fan so she could pose for a smiling photo, after which she passed him an insulting note.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m as big a fan of sophomoric humor as the next guy.  But it seemed an inappropriate act for someone who claims to be appalled by the societal dangers of making vaccination less-than-mandatory, particularly in the shadow of a stage where there were personal stories of death and crippling consequences of vaccines administered to susceptible individuals. And that brings me to what I really want to write about rather than the side issues trumpeted by the rally\u2019s detractors.  The program was outstanding.  To be sure, we heard experts in the law, history and public health give us solid intellectual reasons for viewing vaccine choice as a fundamental human right.  And the main attraction was, of course, Andrew Wakefield, who has been sacrificed by the medical community he has served so well on an altar to the public-health establishment.  But the true impact came from the people who were able to tell us in an all-too-personal way just why an inflated and mandatory immunization schedule presents a danger. We heard from Amy Pingle, whose teen-aged daughter now breathes through a tracheotomy and is fed through a tube, all because of an adverse reaction to the Gardasil vaccine.  We heard from Capt. Richard Rovet (U.S.A.F., Ret.), who as a nurse in the military saw what amounts to nonconsensual experimentation, and he kept records of thousands of adverse reactions to those who serve us.  Capt. Rovet tearfully described watching one of his friends die as a result of one of those events.  We heard from Alex Hintz, a brave 13-year-old boy, who has been recovering from a vaccine injury.  We heard from Allen Tate, a college student (and an outstanding young man I got to know), telling the world of the vaccine injuries to his two siblings. Those personal vignettes were not intended to deter anyone from making a choice to not vaccinate.  Rather, those speakers merely laid out what we have come to know; adverse events do occur, and more often than the vaccine manufacturers, medical associations and public-health authorities want to admit.  And if there is a risk, there must be informed consent.  The current religious and philosophical exemptions \u23af an all-or-nothing approach not even universally recognized \u23af are insufficient to protect the fundamental right to choose what foreign substances we place in our body in the guise of medical treatment.    High-quality videos from the rally, with minimal editing, are starting to be posted on the official site, and should also soon be available at F.A.I.R. Autism Media. Before closing this post out, I also need to say a few words about the annual  Autism One  Conference, also held last week (this year, with additional participation by  Generation Rescue ). I really didn\u2019t get to attend many of the sessions this year, as I was being kept pretty busy in my role as a volunteer for the conference.   My wife, who coordinates the medical treatments in our house, made quite a few (and also presented a couple of times).   The presentations I did see were all informative, and the presenters made themselves readily available for questioning. Beyond the formal sessions, however. Autism One has always provided an amazing atmosphere for attendees.  Parents are made to feel supported, and children are free to be as autistic as they are, without anyone batting an eye.  Even recognizing the fact that most of us would have preferred to forego the necessity of meeting under these circumstances, I have made friendships that will last the rest of my life.   My thanks to Ed and Teri Arranga, Laura and Shawn Rowley, Lisa Rupe, and a host of incredible volunteers.  I consider it nothing short of a privilege to have been a part of the AO family this year. Even Ken came to support vaccination choice, informed consent, and parental rights! \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmhrwax0QI/AAAAAAAAAGo/IUVG4wd2uIc/s1600/Louise-podium.jpg", "http://www.autismone.org/", "http://americanpersonalrights.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmnLiQ8KzI/AAAAAAAAAIY/zUby901v-qY/s1600/AndW.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmiUvhTRaI/AAAAAAAAAGw/tg6DWdSi-5c/s1600/crowd-1.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmilx-Y2fI/AAAAAAAAAG4/GRoG78Cixx8/s1600/crowd-2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmi667IzaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/MoFbDOJme5M/s1600/crowd:shade.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmjT0APrgI/AAAAAAAAAHI/nJqLjq71oX4/s1600/Ginger.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmkjaoSxqI/AAAAAAAAAHg/-7A3qxLeg98/s1600/HepB.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmk3hN6T9I/AAAAAAAAAHo/1BOqHJN7Tq4/s1600/BobK.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmlJhHmJjI/AAAAAAAAAHw/j39qPdRKYHQ/s1600/Rovet.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmmld1z8AI/AAAAAAAAAII/VH2gWA0bcsQ/s1600/Allen.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmm6r-9MjI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/zsZHT6O3-h0/s1600/Teresa:Dan.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmldoasMGI/AAAAAAAAAH4/WV3na9dPT4E/s1600/GroupSing.jpg", "http://www.autismone.org/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TAmmAwMK10I/AAAAAAAAAIA/u8a62-9ah6s/s1600/Reibel.jpg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/06/setting-record-straight-rally-recap.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT:  A RALLY RECAP\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, September 09, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      A couple of weeks ago, I observed a couple of anniversaries that raised some mixed feelings.  It\u2019s been five years since Hurricane Katrina devastated our beloved New Orleans and Gulf South, and it\u2019s been one year since I joined the ranks of America\u2019s unemployed. (If anyone wants to know our Katrina story, it can be found in the archives of that time.  Go to August 2005 in the archives in the sidebar of the blog, and then work your way up into September and beyond.) About a year after the storm, we decided to move away from South Louisiana because the sparse services our son was getting before Katrina were nonexistent after.  I left the practice of law and embarked on a new career path, working as a claims professional for a major insurance carrier.  There was no reason to study for and sit through the bar exam up here; I had a good job in a related field.   Things went pretty well for a while, but then the economic collapse hit.  It was a bad time to be employed in the financial services sector.  When my position was eliminated, I thought my down time would be relatively short.  After all, I lived in an area with lots of major offices for insurers, consulting companies, and other large corporations.  What I hadn\u2019t counted on was that my employer was not alone in scaling back.  As one prospective employer told me on during an interview, \u201cwhen we posted this position we had no idea there were so many of you guys out there.\u201d  I\u2019ve lost count of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that have gone out, but the result has been damn few interviews and no solid offers. So lately I\u2019ve had a lot to think about on the job front.  Do I separate the family and return to Louisiana to practice law, while my wife and son remain here to continue the healing process?  Do I invest time and money I don\u2019t have into bar admission up here, with questionable job prospects for someone with no major connections and who\u2019s been out of the game for a few years?  Or do I look into yet another new career path? Through it all, I have been able to maintain a sense of hope.  Perhaps that is by virtue of being a New Orleanian in exile. When we left Louisiana, we thought we could no longer call that part of the world our \u201chome,\u201d but we were wrong.  We love living in the Chicago area, and we don\u2019t picture pourselves moving back.  But as the last few years have passed, we have realized what is meant by the expression that one is not \u201cfrom\u201d New Orleans, but rather one is \u201cof\u201d New Orleans.  We miss the food, we miss the music, we miss the events, we miss the people, and we miss all of the little things that made it possible to live in what a truthful person has to admit was a banana republic (and please note my use of the past tense there). We find ourselves reconnecting through television.  Spike Lee\u2019s documentaries on the disaster were spot-on.  With  Treme , the entertainment world finally got it right.  Seeing our Saints\u2019 journey last football season, along with the post-Super Bowl partying, made us yearn for home.   And then there was the abundance of Katrina-related programming on television to commemorate the anniversary.   On occasional trips back home, we\u2019ve done more than just fill up on the cuisine and listen to a few tunes.  We\u2019ve been able to see first-hand how the area is moving forward with its recovery.  For a long time, it seemed like the entire populace still had the communal case of PTSD we saw in the year between the storm and when we moved away.  Over time, though, we began to see and hear about changes we didn\u2019t think possible.   Last spring, we saw for ourselves what Brad Pitt\u2019s  Make it Right Foundation  is doing to encourage affordable and sustainable housing in the Lower Ninth Ward.  We\u2019ve heard about Wendell Pierce\u2019s  Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corporation , and how it\u2019s working to restore a historic neighborhood that the government was ready to write off.  Now, the City is starting over with a new mayor who brings an added optimism for the future even as he honestly acknowledges the problems.   What we see in New Orleans is a place that is reinventing itself to preserve what\u2019s worth saving by reinventing the way it does things. And so it goes with me.  If my old career paths aren\u2019t working, I\u2019ll find a new one.  I\u2019m searching for a position that can use the talents and skills (analysis and writing) I\u2019ve worked hard to hone.  (Any prospective employers are encouraged to use the email link in the sidebar on the right.) Like New Orleans, I am embracing change to shape my future.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hbo.com/treme/index.html", "http://www.makeitrightnola.org/", "http://www.pontchartrainparkcdc.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/09/shaping-future.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SHAPING THE FUTURE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, January 29, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n      WITF, a public television station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania recently hosted a lively discussion on its show, Smart Talk.  The subject was the potential vaccine-autism connection, and the format essentially pitted Mark Blaxill against two representatives of the mainstream medical community.  It was not a fair fight; there were only two on the other side. There was a likely intent to stack the deck against the connection, but a couple of things stopped that from happening.  First, the moderator allowed Mark to finish sentences\u2014a mark of civility that seems to have been forgotten by the likes of Anderson Cooper.  The second thing that happened was that one of the doctors, Jeanette Ramer, seems to have ignored the script.  She clearly does not put any credence in the research suggesting a link (which may be due to the fact that she clearly had not actually read much\u2014if any\u2014of that research).  And she did not have as great a grasp on the facts as she might have.   For the most part, though, Dr. Ramer made her points in a calm and rational manner, without resorting to over-the-top arguments, other than an unfortunate use of what I like to call \u201cthe O.J. argument.\u201d  You\u2019ve heard it before; if only we didn\u2019t have to worry about those pesky vaccine questions, we could put all our resources into hunting for the \u201creal killers.\u201d  At least she did not try to make the absurd argument that there is no environmental factors at all, and that the rise in diagnosis is due solely to an broader diagnostic criteria and better awareness. That was the type of argument handed to us, though, by the other doctor on the panel, Cynthia DeMuth.  She was a through-and-through Offiteer.  Dr. DeMuth recited the standard talking points, and even cited (I kid you not) the Danish study as proof that thimerosal didn\u2019t play a role in the epidemic.  She also talked about the convincing nature of some goofy study in which \u201cexperts\u201d viewed birthday party videos of one-year-olds, who had not yet received the MMR, and they identified which children would later be diagnosed with ASD.   It seemed that at some point, the program became a two-person discussion between Mark and Dr. Ramer.  Dr. DeMuth was out of her league, and was properly ignored. I have no expectations that civility may spread to the ongoing debate in the media.  I won\u2019t hold my breath.  But it sure was nice to see what Mark can get across when given a chance.

And \u201crecovered\u201d is too final; who is to say how much recovery is possible?  But every now and then we get a little reminder of just how far we\u2019ve come. The Little Rankster has come a long way from the dire predictions we received with his diagnosis.  It\u2019s the little moments that drive the point home for us. Last night was the Fourth of July:  Independence Day.  To watch the fireworks display in our little suburban community, we found ourselves going to a nice green space some distance away from our neighborhood.  We were surrounded by hundreds of families, none of whom we had ever met. The fact that we were going to see fireworks at all would have been remarkable a few years ago \u23af too much noise.  A few years ago, the first time our son was able to just sit there and enjoy the beauty of the display, was one of those moments of victory.  He eventually became a pyrotechnic aficionado.  Last night, though, the Little Rankster was out for more than just sitting back with the noise and light. We were worried about how we could keep the boy amused for the 45 minutes or so between our arrival and the start of the show.  Our worries were needless.  As soon as we started setting up the chairs, the Little Rankster informed us that he really preferred to run with the other kids rather than hang out with us.  Many of the other families had come prepared with sparklers for their children.  We had to apologize to our son for being so unprepared, but he had never been so bold as to want one before.  But we watched as our little boy ran from family to family of complete strangers mooching sparklers.  My wife and I weren\u2019t sure if we should have been mortified or ecstatic.  We chose the latter. As it grew dark, we were having more and more difficulty keeping an eye on our son.  There was no anchoring him to us, however.  He was having fun joining in with other groups of kids.  He was declaring his independence from his parents. We\u2019re not ready to declare victory just yet.  The process of cure and recovery goes on.  Every now and then, though, it\u2019s good to just sit back, think about how far we\u2019ve come, and enjoy the fireworks.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/TDJ4uPBj9JI/AAAAAAAAAIg/kqOzIVv79xI/s1600/ar124630705088843.jpg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/07/independence.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t INDEPENDENCE\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Saturday, November 06, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      There was a time when a civil dialog sprung up between some of us within the \u201ccurebie\u201d community on the one side and a few members of the neurodiversity community (the folks who preach that the dignity of being autistic outweighs the value of recovery or cure) on the other side.  This blog was one of the places where those discussions took place.  Eventually, the thin patina of cordiality broke down, and the discussions ended. Two issues were raised by some members of the neurodiversity crowd that seemed to play a large role in the cold shoulder that eventually was turned in my direction.  One was my refusal to \u201cdisassociate\u201d myself from another blogger who was vociferous in his belief in a vaccine-causation theory and in the necessity of cure, but who I would nevertheless describe as being not-at-all-representative of the feelings of most of us in the cure community.  I saw no reason to  disassociate myself from someone I did not consider myself to be associated with in the first place.  (To be truthful, they also said I should disassociate myself from J.B. Handley; in that case, we had no formal association but I would have been proud to have had one.) The second issue that seemed to fester within the neurodiversity crowd was  my reluctance to immediately label the killing of Katie McCarron as a \u201cmurder\u201d  before all the facts were known and the matter had been adjudicated.  Eventually, the legal process took its course, and I then felt it appropriate to comment on  the justice of the outcome .  The response from those who had been so critical was a resounding \u201cwhatever.\u201d Those incidents immediately came to mind as I read a  recent blog post by Jonathan Mitchell .  Jonathan is the author of Autism\u2019s Gadfly, and he identifies himself as an \u201cAutistic who wishes a cure could be found.\u201d  That obviously places him at odds with the neurodiversity crowd, and not surprisingly, he has been the object of their frequent scorn. In this post, Jonathan commented on the lack or reaction to the  recent arrest of Nick Dubin , a psychologist who has aligned himself with the neurodiversity movement.  Dr. Dubin has been accused \u23af and I stress that it is only an accusation at this point \u23af of downloading child pornography.  More to the point, Jonathan\u2019s recent post was not about the arrest itself (although he has written about that previously), but rather to point out the lack of any reaction from the leaders of the neurodiversity  movement, with whom Dr. Durbin associated himself. Here\u2019s the real meat of what Jonathan wrote: Outside of the right not to be murdered, it would seem the right of disabled children not to be sexually molested would be about the most important of human rights that these august individuals would be crusading for. You would think that they would comment on this latest news story. Consistent with my past conduct and still-held beliefs, I will not join Jonathan in commenting on the possible guilt of Nick Dubin.  I\u2019ll let the judicial system do the work it\u2019s designed to do.  But I think Jonathan raises a very fair question with regard to Kevin Leitch, Michelle Dawson, and others in the neurodiversity movement.  If you\u2019re going to decry criminal conduct that has not yet been adjudicated as such; if you\u2019re going to call for others to disassociate themselves from people; well, you can\u2019t just reserve your outrage for situations involving the other side. Although Jonathan doesn\u2019t use the word, what we\u2019re really talking about is hypocrisy.  It\u2019s  something I\u2019ve talked about before .

Those who place an unquestioning belief in that program--a belief built more on taught lore than on actual scientific study--have realized that the questions and the questioners remain.  So now the almost predictable and thinly veiled cries have arisen that our words should not even be heard. I could not say it all any better tha does Louis Conte in a recent post over at  Age of Autism : That the concept of censorship is so comfortably proposed by seemingly main stream people is of profound concern to me. It seems that those who support the vaccine program have convinced themselves that the program is above discussion and public discourse. Vaccines are all good and unquestionably safe. Those who make them, administer them and supply them are all beyond reproach. Bringing up the radioactive \u2018autism\u2019 thing really throws them into a tizzy. Not only is discussion of vaccines and autism found to be against \u201cscientific consensus\u201d but it is now supposed to be described as a \u201cfringe theory.\u201d If you talk about this issue, you are a member of a lunatic fringe.

Unfortunately, her work environment has degenerated to the point where she needs to say it anonymously.   I am a teacher and like other teachers, I am afraid of speaking up on the increasing numbers of ill, disabled and IEP students as I fear that my job will be on the line.  I know others have spoken up who then had the hand of the dark Blogosphere then dial their Principals, Superintendents or Board of Education to make a complaint.  It was not a complaint from a parent of a child at the school, a teacher there, or even a known person in the school district.  It was a John Doe who scared that Administrator with words like \"confidentiality,\" or \"lawsuit.\"  Her fear is real. Both doctor and teacher have information to share of what they are witnessing with their own eyes.  Real evidence of a change, a pattern, a devastating increase in human suffering that they want to explore and discuss.  But that message is ugly, toxic and so damning in its connection to public health that the messengers are being attacked.   What this teacher has seen speaks volumes about what others choose to ignore. I am here to anonymously say that the number of teens with diagnoses of Autism, Seizure Disorders/Epilepsy, Specific Learning Disability, Non-Verbal Learning Disability, Speech and Language Disorder, Other Health Impaired (ADHD/ADD, Bipolar, Social-Emotional Disorder), Crohn's, Irritable Bowel Disorder, Allergies (with significant Food especially Peanut), Asthma, and Diabetes are horrific.  Connections, like seeing Specific Learning Disability AND Asthma as paired diagnoses in many children, makes one wonder if anyone is doing research on that curious and sad occurrence. I am also here to tell you that the increase is NOT because of improved diagnoses of the children or a loosening of criteria.  If anything, the elementary schools are really trying to raise the bar on entering special ed. Through the years, we have encountered so many teachers who see the truth, and support us as best they can, but find themselves frustrated by the system.

Anybody looking for justice need not look at the courthouse.  The Court has shut the door.  There was no finding as to whether Hannah Bruesewitz was actually injured by the DPT vaccine.  Rather, the majority opinion merely thought that the \u201ccompensation\u201d available through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is so \u201cgenerous\u201d that the vaccine industry should enjoy a complete pass on accountability for the safety (or lack thereof) of its products. Never mind that the proceedings in the NVICP lack the basic trappings of due process (right to discovery, fact finding by a jury of one\u2019s peers, etc.).  Never mind that the manner in which the government\u2014our government\u2014fights each and every claim eliminates the possibility of speedy compensation promised by the laws that created the program.  And never mind the fact that taking the manufacturers out of the equation altogether provides no incentive to create safe products that are tested for safe interaction with other vaccines. All in all, it\u2019s all just another brick in the wall.  The NVICP and the corresponding immunity granted to vaccine manufacturers serves the mandatory nature of the vaccine schedule, which feeds the profits of the manufacturers.  And all the while that the public-health/pharmaceutical complex enjoys freedom from oversight based on vaccines being \u201cunavoidably unsafe,\u201d they keep feeding us the party line that vaccines and the vaccine schedule are \u201csafe and effective\u201d for every child. If the truth will ever be revealed, and if justice ever comes for all victims of the arrogance of the public-health/pharmaceutical complex, we must first win the political battle.  An uproar must arise that is so loud that it drowns out the talking points being fed our legislators by high-paid lobbyists. These are perilous times for the basic human right of determining what goes into our bodies and our children\u2019s bodies.  That makes it the right time for  Vaccine Epidemic: How Corporate Greed, Biased Science, and Coercive Government Threaten Our Human Rights, Our Health, and Our Children  , edited by Louise Kuo Habakus, MA and Mary Holland, JD.  It\u2019s a project of the Center for Personal Rights, which grew out of last summer\u2019s  America Rally for Personal Rights . The format of the book lends itself to either reading from beginning to end, or simply browsing what looks most interesting at the moment.  It is a series of essays by different authors that look at every aspect of the debate.  The emerging science is discussed, of course, but primarily in the context of the suppression of valuable research.  Are there gut-wrenching tales of vaccine injuries?  Yes, and those stories lay the context for the real issue. The real issue is whether we, as a country, are willing to support the most basic right of self-determination:  the right to decide what goes into our bodies and our children\u2019s bodies.  It\u2019s all summed up in the book by James Turner, JD, in his chapter entitled \u201cDue Process and the American Constitution:\u201d In a moral society, there can be no mandated vaccinations.  In a moral society, citizens must be allowed to choose which vaccines they and their children receive and when.  Without vaccination choice, society places both public and individual health at risk.  Vaccination choice is a fundamental human right. The choice we now have is illusory.  It is, in fact, no choice at all.  Children cannot go to school without being vaccinated per schedule.   Our military cannot serve without having multiple vaccinations shot into their bodies (can anyone say \u201cGulf War Syndrome?\u201d).   Health-care workers are subject to enormous pressure to get mercury-containing flu shots.  And most of the states who allow religious and philosophical exemptions will only recognize those exemptions as an all-or-nothing deal.  Parents cannot make informed decisions on each individual inoculation. Exemptions have truly been labeled the \u201cno-choice choice.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s time to make your voices heard.  And this is a book that can help you find that voice.  As a matter of fact, I suggest that you buy four copies of  Vaccine Epidemic .  Keep one yourself, read it, and pass it on.  Send one copy to your elected Representative in Congress.  And the other two go to the United States Senators from your state.  And on those copies you\u2019re sending to Congress, inscribe them yourselves.  Personalize them to the recipients, and give them your story in a few sentences. Maybe, too, you should point the political leaders to another quote from James Turner\u2019s essay.  Throughout his chapter, Mr. Turner recounts investigatory work he did on vaccine safety through the years.  Back in the seventies, one of the people he turned to for education on the subject was Dr. J. Anthony Morris, who at the time was a senior vaccine regulatory researcher and a control officer for influenza vaccines at the NIH.  He recently asked Dr. Morris, now 92-years-old, what message he would give the American people.  The reply:  \u201cTell them I do not take the flu shot.\u201d Sorta says it all.

{"date": "Sunday, April 03, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n      So here we are again:  that time of year when everyone talks about \u201cautism awareness.\u201d  It too often means making useless gestures, like putting in a blue light bulb.   Sometimes though, it takes the form of a good, two-way discussion with a good friend.  I had such a discussion, albeit via electronic means, with an old and very valued friend.  Let\u2019s call him \u201cBob\u201d (mainly because his name is Bob). It all started with one of those Hitler videos.  You know the ones I\u2019m talking about.  They show up from time to time on You Tube.  They all use the same footage from a movie, taking place in World War II, called  The Downfall .  Hitler is meeting with his military staff, and the staff breaks some bad news to the F\u00fcrher.  That scene took on a whole new life when people with nothing better to do in their life  started adding their own subtitles , placing the scene in different contexts (e.g., Hitler finds out Michael Jackson died and won\u2019t be at his birthday party; Hitler gets banned from Wikipedia; etc.). A recent version (go  here  because embedding is disabled) places Hitler in the role of a school district\u2019s special-ed coordinator, meeting with his staff to plan their role in an upcoming I.E.P. meeting.  He starts discussing the program they will foist upon the unsuspecting family, and the staff breaks the news that the parents are demanding an outside placement to meet the child\u2019s needs.  Worse yet, some of the staff members appear to agree that the outside placement is necessary. It all sounds so familiar to far-too-many of us.  Our children need particular help to truly receive a \u201cfree and appropriate public education,\u201d as guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  But programs like that cost money, and so some districts instead try to throw kids into a one-size-fits-all program to partially address the needs of a lot of kids who sort of have the same needs.  It seems like all they\u2019re really trying to do is shut up parents for a while until it\u2019s too late to do anything. I did what so many of us do when we see stuff like that; I posted it to my Facebook wall.  And that led to a conversation with Bob, who is the kind of guy who knows that good friendships not only survive spirited debates, but thrive on them. Bob is a computer networking professional, who works with the special-ed folks in an area that takes its IDEA responsibilities very seriously.  They apparently do some very innovative things to actually serve kids with special needs. From his perspective, Bob thought the video painted with too broad a brush.  Like me, he was viewing the satire through the lens of personal experience.  Based on conversations with parents from across the country, though, I have to say that my experience may be closer to the norm. That is not the fault of the professionals who work with our kids on a daily basis.  Most of them want to see more done.  Rather, the blame is shared between the federal government, the school districts who are responsible for carrying out IDEA, and most of all, the well-intentioned but poorly defined mandates that IDEA sets forth. I can certainly understand that viewing the Hitler/I.E.P. video, if taken on its face, can lead one to the conclusion that an invidious comparison is being drawn between special-ed coordinators and the personification of evil.  On that level, it can be called unfair.  I have yet to meet any district representative who doesn\u2019t seem like a nice person.  This video, though, resonates with me as an expression of frustration with a system that tends to drive a wedge between people that might otherwise form a useful partnership. IDEA is a product of the early stages of the explosion of developmental disabilities.  Its noble purpose was to guarantee that kids with autism, ADHD, and other problems, could have the same opportunity to receive an appropriate education as any fully-abled child.  After it became the law, though, the explosion hit. The resulting situation is very similar to that described by the special services f\u00fcrher in the video.  The federal government mandated services, without properly funding them.  And the response is all-too-often taking the easiest path of throwing together in-district programs that are based on proven strategies but don\u2019t carry though the intensity needed to be truly effective.   That approach ignores the first word in IDEA:  individuals.  It pays lip service to the concept of \u201cno child left behind,\u201d but in fact, tries to sweep children along until they\u2019re past the age of IDEA\u2019s reach.  Those kids never reach their potential; they never have a chance. Almost as bad, that forces more and more parents, fighting for their individual children, to institute \u201cdue process\u201d proceedings, which sometimes lead to court suits.  Very rarely do the children get appropriate services during that process, and the districts waste precious monetary resources in the litigation (and make no mistake about it, \u201cdue process\u201d means litigation). To be sure, the opportunities and problems vary from district-to-district.  One of the reasons we moved from Louisiana back in late 2006 was to find some place with a better school system.  And we found that.  But \u201cbetter\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cgood\u201d or even \u201cadequate.\u201d  Had all else been equal, we would have wound up in a place where, like Bob\u2019s locale, the approach to special education is proactive and innovative.  Other factors, including career opportunities and, more importantly, access to other medical and therapeutic services, dictated our move to where we are. My point\u2014and as usual, I\u2019ve taken my own sweet time to get there\u2014is that this country needs to wake up.  We are in the midst of a true epidemic.  As our kids reach adulthood, without the necessary tools to live independently, more and more financial resources will be needed to support them (which doesn\u2019t even begin to address the tragedy of the impact on them as human beings).  We, as a country, need to make a serious investment in appropriate educational services.  And if that means spending more to outsource services, so be it. Just as important, this country needs to take a real interest in the hard questions of just how we got here in the first place. Stopping this epidemic and dealing with its victims is going to take more than screwing in a blue light bulb and talking about the fact that there\u2019s a lot of autistic kids out there.  We need more than a Khumbaya moment. Autism awareness must lead to action.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [" http://trailertrasher.com/2009/03/27/the-10-funniest-youtube-hitler-videos/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69w96cFdPMk&feature=player_embedded"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2011/04/heres-some-awareness-for-you-its-gonna.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t HERE\u2019S SOME \u201cAWARENESS\u201d FOR YOU.

As a blogger, I loved the fact that he always seemed to come to my rescue when I couldn\u2019t find anything to write about.  As if on-cue, Dr. O would say something outrageous and a blog post would practically write itself.   On the other hand, as a parent, I grew so weary of what I perceived to be his arrogance and cavalier attitude toward the victims of the autism epidemic.  Beyond all else, though, I have constantly wondered why the mainstream media kept buying the bill of goods this disingenuous salesman was pushing. Now it seems that someone is catching on. Back in August, 2008, the  Orange County Register  allowed itself to be used as a conduit for Offit\u2019s rage directed at Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News, one of the few journalists who was willing to look beneath the surface of the vaccine safety issue.  This week, though, the  Register  (at least in its on-line version) ran a \u201c correction ,\u201d having found that \u201cit appears that a number of Dr. Offit\u2019s statements \u2026 were unsubstantiated and/or false.\u201d Specifically, the  Register  stated: Unsubstantiated statements include: Offit\u2019s claim that Attkisson \u201clied\u201d; and Offit\u2019s claim that CBS News sent a \u201cmean spirited and vituperative\u201d email \u201cover the signature of Sharyl Attkisson\u201d stating \u201cYou\u2019re clearly hiding something.\u201d In fact, the OC Register has no evidence to support those claims. Further, Offit told the OC Register that he provided CBS News \u201cthe details of his relationship, and Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s relationship, with pharmaceutical company Merck.\u201d However, documents provided by CBS News indicate Offit did not disclose his financial relationships with Merck, including a $1.5 million Hilleman chair he sits in that is co-sponsored by Merck. According to the CBS News\u2019 documentation recently reviewed by the OC Register, the network requested (but Offit did not disclose) the entire profile of his professional financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies including: The amount of compensation he\u2019d received from which companies in speaking fees; and pharmaceutical consulting relationships and fees. The CBS News documentation indicates Offit also did not disclose his share of past and future royalties for the Merck vaccine he co-invented. Better late than never.

{"date": "Thursday, August 11, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      A large chunk of my family's day -- every day -- is devoted to administering a lot of supplements to my son.  It is all a part of the biomedical approach to treating autism spectrum disorders.  There are permutations and adjuncts, but generally biomedical treatment consists of three elements:  a gluten-free/casein-free (\"GFCF\") diet, use of dietary supplements and minerals, and chelation therapy. My wife and I jokingly refer to what we do for our son as \"voodoo,\" because some people seem to consider biomedical treatments to be the scientific equivalent of black magic.  To be sure, biomedical treatment for ASD is a controversial topic; raise the subject with most \"mainstream\" doctors, and they start muttering something about the lack of double-blinded control studies.  And, of course, those doctors are right.  There are no studies proving biomedical\u2019s efficacy, but neither are there studies showing it to be ineffective.  Embarking on this road requires a parental leap of faith and the willingness to have your child be an anecdote.  The only thing I know for sure is that it seems to help my little boy. Several months ago, I attended a professional seminar and ran into a friend; let\u2019s call him \"George.\"  I knew that one of his kids was diagnosed with ADHD, and he knew vaguely that my son had developmental issues.  Over lunch, George asked about my son, and I brought him up to date.  In the year or more since I last saw my friend, my son\u2019s diagnosis had changed from being a \"late talker\" to now being on the spectrum, and we believed that thimerosal exposure had something to do with it.  But it was okay, I explained, because we were making great progress using a biomedical approach.  George\u2019s customary smile rapidly turned downward and he began to shake his head. George told me how he and his wife attempted biomedical treatment for their son, he thought too much money was being spent without any results in return.  When I questioned him, George admitted that they just tried supplements for only a couple of weeks, and they had not strictly adhered to a GFCF diet, because his son didn\u2019t like it.  George\u2019s real objections to the biomedical approach as well as the thimerosal-causation hypothesis, however, was based on what his son\u2019s pediatrician told him.  George had not read any of the scientific literature himself, and he did not know if the pediatrician personally examined any of the source literature or if he was simply relying on the stated position of the American Academy of Pediatrics. My friend pleaded with me to stay away from chelation and turn to \"proven\" medications instead.  Knowing that George\u2019s son had been on Ritalin, I decided to avoid confrontation.  I knew better than to argue about my belief that the currently available drugs may do a good job of attacking symptoms, but do little to address the underlying cause of the problem.  Nor did I want to discuss how any medication\u2019s impact on symptoms will eventually wane as receptors adapt, requiring the shift to yet another drug as a short-term fix.  Instead of jumping into that debate, I tried to change the subject by asking George how his son was doing.  He responded that things were indeed going well after they changed his son\u2019s medication because Ritalin just wasn\u2019t working anymore.  That signaled the time for another change of subject and we spent the rest of lunch discussing LSU football (which can actually lead to more passionate debates than the thimerosal issue). One of my favorite bloggers, Ginger Taylor, recently posted a terrific commentary, she calls \" Duffy\u2019s Dilemma ,\" on decision making and biomedical treatments.     I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject.

This morning, I started thinking back to years past when my mother,  Betty \u201cBig Mama\u201d Rankin , hosted the  Moldy Fig Jam  every Saturday morning on  WWOZ  radio.  She showcased the best of traditional New Orleans jazz, and did so with love. On the day before Easter, she always threw in a heaping helping of hymns played in the New Orleans style, and she saved a little time to play some  Mahalia Jackson .  For Big Mama, it made sense to pay tribute to the Lord by sharing one of the most glorious voices He ever created\u2014a native voice that bridged the gap between the sacred and the secular souls.  Playing Mahalia also educated the listeners as to the roots of the jazz they so loved. So every year Big Mama played some Mahalia, and every year, like clockwork, some ignorant jerk would call the station and complain.  Typically, the faceless voice on the phone would declare that if he wanted to hear that $&@ gospel !*%#, he would tune in the next day to hear the gospel show; he wanted to hear real jazz.   Big Mama was not the kind of person who could easily shrug off the meaness of others.   She always left the studio in tears.  But within hours her tears of sadness would turn to \u2026 well, not exactly anger; I\u2019d call it determination.  She\u2019d immediately start planning out her Easter show for the next year.

The approach includes a gluten-free/cassein-free (\"GFCF\") diet, supplements (vitamins, enzymes, probiotics, minerals, and aminos), and chelation.  Some people liken biomedical to voodoo, a name I can live with.  Calling it by a funny name does not diminish the positive results my wife and I have seen in our son.  So, voodoo works, at least for us. I think it would work for a lot more people if utilized appropriately.   That is not to say that I think anyone who doesn\u2019t use a biomedical approach to treatment of ASD is shortchanging his or her child.  I respect any well-considered choice a parent makes.  We all want to do what is best for our children, and I understand the concerns of parents who opt for other approaches.  Indeed, we must all be comfortable in what we do, and we must all avoid being half-hearted in whatever treatment approach we use. Ginger Taylor\u2019s recent blog, \" Duffy\u2019s Dilemma ,\" covered the decision-making process better than I could hope to do, but I would like to share some of what my wife and I have learned about getting the most out of this approach.  If you\u2019ve already decided that biomedical is not for you, you can skip the rest of this post.   There is one common thread to any advice that can be given.  First, last, and constantly in between, exhaustively research the issue for yourself.  Learn about the various modalities before you consider going down the biomedical path, and keep researching it after you start.  Find a good discussion group on the web with other parents using biomedical treatments.  No matter how much you educate yourself, do  not  try a biomedical approach without appropriate medical direction and supervision.  This is a medical procedure; treat it as such.  Many dedicated doctors have affiliated themselves with the  DAN!  (Defeat Autism Now!) program developed by the Autism Research Institute.  Those physicians know the protocols and are best equipped to guide you in your child\u2019s treatment. Keep in mind that the various elements of biomedical treatment are intended to work as parts of a whole.  Don\u2019t start adding supplements until you have tried the GFCF diet \u2013 and you are sticking to the diet.  Don\u2019t start chelation to get rid of metals until you have started the supplements.   Just like standard pharmaceuticals, supplements interact with each other and with foods.  Make sure you are administering probiotics and aminos at the right time, and that your supplements are being given in the right combinations.  Ask your DAN! Doctor for specific guidance on this, and also listen to other parents\u2019 experiences.   Constantly reevaluate your child\u2019s progress and the process.  Keep in mind this is an emerging science and that every child is different.  Even within DAN!, there are differences of opinion regarding the protocols.  If your research and your observations tell you there may be a better way, do not be afraid to discuss it with your doctor.  We are now on our second DAN! Doctor even though the first one is a fine physician.  Based on what we knew, however, we thought it best to take our son\u2019s treatment in a different direction.  Once again, these are the types of decisions that can only be made if you do your homework We constantly fine tune our son\u2019s protocol based on his progress and what we have learned from our doctor, our research, and other parents.  Changes are a joint decision we make with our doctor. Be patient.  The process can take a couple of years.  In my house we aren\u2019t too worried about the time, because we\u2019ve already come a long way in a short time.  With every step we\u2019ve seen improvement.  We started the GFCF diet during a school break.  After my son returned to school, his teacher asked what we had done to provoke such an amazing improvement in just a week\u2019s time.  In the months we have been following a biomedical protocol, my son\u2019s speech and language rapidly progressed from pointing and using single words to speaking in complete sentences.  His attention and eye contact are vastly improved.  Most interesting of all, my son\u2019s impaired thyroid function, which we believe is related to the same factors that led to his ASD, has improved to the point he no longer needs medication.  (His endocrinologist is pleased but a little mystified.)  We still have a long way to go, but our little boy has already exceeded any hope we were given by the mainstream doctors who first diagnosed him.      Keep in mind that the underlying hypothesis upon which this treatment is based is that ASD has biochemical causes, and that your child\u2019s immune system is compromised.  The more you clean up your child\u2019s environment, the better he/she will respond.  We rely as much as possible on organic foods, without preservatives or pesticides.  We have worked to remove other potential dangers from our son\u2019s environment by focusing on toxins found in his laboratory tests. Finally, don\u2019t abandon more traditional therapies that may be appropriate.  Although we made a choice to avoid drugs like Ritalin, our son still receives speech and behavioral therapies.  Like anything else involved in raising an autistic child, implementing biomedical treatments is \"inconvenient,\" and it can be costly.  For my wife and me, however, the decision was a no-brainer.  Our son is worth it.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/08/duffys-dilemma.html", "http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/dan/dan.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/voodoo-works-part-ii.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t VOODOO WORKS!

{"date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      I live in the New Orleans area where we take food  VERY  seriously.  Analogizing everything to eating is a natural part of the local idiom, and that includes talking about \u201cfood for thought.\u201d  Here\u2019s a couple of morsels for you to chew on.  First is a  new story by Dan Olmsted , the UPI Consumer Health Editor.  (You may be familiar with Mr. Olmsted\u2019s much-talked-of series about the low incidence of autism in the Amish community.)  He leaves the Amish behind in this new story, instead taking a look at one of the original autistic patients diagnosed by Dr. Leo Kanner in the late 1930\u2019s.  Mr. Olmstead also examines the belief that this patient\u2019s autism improved after the administration of gold salts for arthritis.  As is true of Mr. Olmsted\u2019s Amish series, this story is not presented as a scientific study; it is merely food for thought. By the way, I agree that autism undoubtedly existed before Dr. Kanner gave it a name.  But isn\u2019t it interesting that the incidence was so rare that it remained unreported and had no name before Dr. Kanner discussed it, (or, as Dr. Kanner described it in 1943, a condition \"markedly and uniquely different from anything reported so far\")?  And isn\u2019t it interesting that its emergence into something that now needed a name came shortly after the introduction of thimerosal into vaccines?  Please note that the previous two sentences are phrased as questions.  I do not claim that the timing proves anything; it is merely food for thought. The second link I have for you comes from  Dr. Margaret Cook , a British hematologist (or haematologist as they say there) who \u201cretired\u201d to become a critic of the U.K.\u2019s health system.  Dr. Cook\u2019s contribution to this discussion is not a scientific study, but is simply an op-ed piece relating her perspective of the possible link between vaccines and the development of autism spectrum disorders.  The editorial breaks no new ground, but I think it is well-written, and it is noteworthy for raising an issue that does not get enough attention.  Simply stated, is there a combined impact from different kinds of vaccines?  Do thimerosal-containing vaccines impair a susceptible child\u2019s immune system to the point that live-virus vaccines (like the MMR) push the child over the edge into autism?  Again, I have no answer to those questions; I am merely providing food for thought.  I must point out that I am not opposed to vaccinating children.  I thank God for giving us the wisdom to find a way of fighting dreadful illness.  I thank God my children will not run the risk of contracting polio or measles.  Unfortunately, the wisdom with which we were endued did not adequately prepare us for the exercise of restraint in developing a safe vaccination program.  We (meaning society) vaccinate our children for everything, without regard for weighing the nature of the threat posed by any particular disease against the risk from the vaccine itself.  We vaccinate our children before their brains are fully developed \u2013 before there is even a blood-brain barrier.  (Can someone please tell me why it was necessary to give my son the first of three Hep-B shots when he was just a few hours old?  I would have gladly monitored his behavior to ensure he did not engage in unprotected sex or intravenous drug use for the first six months of his life.) Worst of all, we placed a neurotoxic additive into many of the vaccines, just for the sake of a little economy.  And we did it all without taking a little time to study the potential for harm in our actions.  Shame on \u201cus.\u201d Of course, that\u2019s just my opinion:  just a little food for thought. *  *  * P.S.  If anyone is interested in reading another view on how we should rethink our vaccination program, I recommend reading  Dr. Jay Gordon\u2019s thoughts  on the subject.  I don\u2019t disagree with some things he has to say, but I find Dr. Gordon\u2019s writing to be mentally nutritious food for thought.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&article=UPI-1-20050815-09441200-bc-ageofautism.xml", "http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=1790452005", "http://www.drjaygordon.com/pediatricks/vacc2004.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/food-for-thought.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t FOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      The comments to my prior post, \u201c Trying to Understand Neurodiversity ,\u201d convinced me to postpone my plans to cover other subjects.  This post won\u2019t be so much about the neurodiversity movement itself as about how we get past the differences to have a truly meaningful dialog.  The bad news is this is going to be a long post.  I know what you\u2019re thinking; all of Rankin\u2019s posts are long.  I mean this one is  really  long, so pour a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, and make yourself comfortable.   In writing my earlier post, I intended to express a willingness to explore what divides us and what unites us in a calm and productive manner. I was gratified, but not really surprised to learn that several people from the neurodiversity community shared that willingness and seized the opportunity to have cordial discussions.    One new friend, jypsy, noted my use of the term \u201canti-thimerosal/biomedical advocates\u201d to describe people who share my views on what triggered my son\u2019s symptoms, and what seems to be working.  My awkward choice of words reflected my struggle to find some shorthand means of describing the focus that many of us have in discussing ASD issues.  That struggle is almost a metaphor for the entire problem we\u2019ve been discussing.  We\u2019ve all become victims of semantics. The inability to find the right words lies at the heart of the separation between the neurodiversity and biomedical communities.  Parents in my position use words like \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201ccure\u201d because the disease model is readily understandable to us.  Yet it may not be adequate to really explain what is going on with our kids.  Misunderstanding occurs because our interpretation of any word is naturally colored by our own experience and perspective.  When I say \u201ccure,\u201d or \u201creversal,\u201d I\u2019m really referring to alleviating adverse biochemical and neurological processes that are interfering with an individual\u2019s ability to fully utilize all of the natural gifts that individual possesses.  Someone else may see the word \u201ccure\u201d used and worry that someone is attempting to remove their own gifts http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gifaltogether because the use of those gifts may not fit in with the \u201cnorms\u201d of society.  Still another person may cringe at the thought of that \u201ccure\u201d being taken one step further into the realm of genetic engineering.   The views I have regarding my son\u2019s condition are generally the same views expressed by organizations I respect like  Safe Minds ,  No Mercury , and  Generation Rescue .  As I\u2019ve said before, I call my son\u2019s condition ASD because that\u2019s what the last line of the evaluation said.  And yes, I think his condition, or at least the problematic part of his condition, was triggered by exposure to environmental toxins, including thimerosal.  Yet I wonder if we aren\u2019t all being myopic about ASD, its causes, the means of \u201ccuring,\u201d and even the necessity of \u201ccuring.\u201d Brett Miller\u2019s blog, \u201c 29 Marbles ,\u201d often explores the dynamic many of us struggle with:  how to balance the need for acceptance of our children with the desire to improve our children\u2019s lives.  In one of his  recent posts , Brett reviews a newspaper account of recent genetic studies.  One autism researcher is quoted in the article as saying that the \u201cmeasure of autism is usually the inability to cope in the real world,\u201d and autism is \u201conly a disorder if it causes stress or interferes with function.\"  The experience most common to members of the biomedical community relates to ASD severe enough to cause dysfunction, and it\u2019s that dysfunction we\u2019re trying to cure.   Robin Nemeth\u2019s comment to my earlier post demonstrates that there can be a pretty wide divergence in where an individual fits on the spectrum.  The comments by Lili present anecdotal evidence of a family in which ASD is pervasive without any identifiable environmental insult.  It\u2019s entirely possible that many high-functioning folks did not receive the same type of damage from vaccines that some of our kids did.  And I can\u2019t completely discount the possibility that just maybe our children would have been somewhere on the spectrum, albeit at a higher functioning level, without the thimerosal trigger.  Given the current state of the science, I can\u2019t say anything with certainty except that my son\u2019s regression after vaccines, and his improvement after biomedical intervention fit into the vaccine-damage hypothesis. Because our experience is so tied up in what we have witnessed in our children, we naturally think that everyone on the spectrum must have been \u201cdamaged\u201d in the same way.  Forgive my use of the word, \u201cdamage,\u201d but that\u2019s the point.  We see damage.  Could it be a comorbid condition to ASD caused by environmental insults to which persons on the spectrum may be particularly susceptible?  Sure, that\u2019s a possibility, but we call our children\u2019s condition -- including all of the manifestations -- ASD because that\u2019s the label the \u201cexperts\u201d put on our children. Context is everything.  The more I read of her writing, the more I am coming to respect and admire  Kathleen Seidel .  She speaks eloquently on behalf of people who should be considered valuable contributors to our society and culture.  We disagree on whether there is an epidemic, on whether thimerosal can act as a trigger in the development of autism, and whether biomedical responses are appropriate.  But I also believe that her real problem with \u201cus\u201d is with our semantics. Some of Ms. Seidel\u2019s postings are difficult for me to read.  Those writings detail comments and actions by some of us in the biomedical movement that Kathleen finds offensive.  Some of the complaints involve people in the anti-thimerosal and biomedical movements whom I admire.  I understand Kathleen\u2019s points, but I would plead with her to try and consider the context, and perhaps forgive any offense so we can all move on. Part of that context is the frustration anti-thimerosal activists and biomedical parents have known all too well in these past few years.  Despite an ongoing scientific process that we believe supports our opinions, we have been constantly derided and called kooks, conspiracy nuts, greedy plaintiffs, and uncaring parents.  We eagerly anticipated the IOM examination of the issue, and were bitterly disappointed when the panel chose to discard the emerging evidence in favor of epidemiological reports we believe are fundamentally flawed.  (I really don\u2019t want to discuss epidemiology\u2019s limitations and the IOM report in this particular post, but I mention our viewpoint only to help explain context.)  We constantly got our hopes up when we found out that a national media outlet would cover our issue, only to get disgusted at a story that paints a ridiculous picture of a monolithic scientific community patiently explaining to a group of misguided and misinformed mothers that they just don\u2019t understand science.  (The occasions on which the national media has presented a balanced picture have been rare indeed.)   All of that frustration tends to make us a little defensive.  And being human beings, we sometimes subscribe to the theory that the best defense is sometimes a good offense.  I am sometimes confronted with comments (at least one on this blog, and several at  The Huffington Post  where I sometimes leave comments) that my son\u2019s ASD can\u2019t possibly be related to thimerosal, and that my wife and I are, at worst, jeopardizing his health or, at best, encouraging quackery by following a biomedical path.  At first, I was offended at the harsh tone of some of those comments, but I soon realized two things.  First, I had placed my name and comments in a public place on the internet, thus inviting opposing views.  Second, and more importantly, the people giving me the \u201cbenefit of their views\u201d probably believed in what they were saying every bit as much as I believed the opposite.  Given that, they not only had the right to say what they did, but they probably felt obliged to write with missionary zeal.  The same can be said for most comments suggesting \u201ccures\u201d to high-functioning adults (or parents who share the neurodiverse viewpoint) who are quite able to make up their own minds. One must also consider where a heated exchange takes place.  Blog sites like this one or  The Huffington Post  are essentially electronic op-ed pages.  Indeed, my motivation for starting this site was to create a place where I could not only set the agenda, but also foster the free exchange of ideas with people who may disagree.  Internet discussion boards, on the other hand, serve a very different purpose. I do not personally monitor or participate in the Evidence of Harm board, but my wife is a member of that group as well as a few others.  She uses the groups to find out what is working and not working for others, as well as to hear the latest news on the issue that affects our family life the most.  Although such groups generally have an \u201copen\u201d membership, the nature of the boards is such that they function more as a closed support group than an open debate.  In that environment, thoughts are sometimes blurted out without a whole lot of thought given to carefully expressing one\u2019s true intent.  Then, when an element of dissent or debate is added, the natural result is often harsh rhetoric.   I might add that I have not researched the complete context in which the exchanges between Ms. Seidel and members of the biomedical community occurred, and so I cannot comment on whether the individual posters may have felt justified in saying what they did.  It is also clear that Ms. Seidel often gave as good as she got, a factor that sometimes makes it more difficult for a cessation of hostilities. From Kathleen\u2019s standpoint, all that may not excuse all of the harsh comments she describes in some of her writings, but I think the comments become more forgivable.  What seems more problematic are suggestions that were apparently made that one person or another should be inundated with emails or phone calls.  Even if not intended to be an actual suggestion, there is always someone that might think it a good idea.  Following through on such an idea crosses a pretty clear line into the realm of harassment.  Besides subjecting the harasser to legal difficulties, the only thing accomplished is to tarnish the cause that some of us hold pretty dear. My point in all this (geeze Wade, you sure took a long time to get to the point) is that we can have a pretty rational discussion about the issues that divide us and unite us if we can get past the urge to win debate points.  The comments to the prior post prove that we really can get along.  So let\u2019s shelve the harsh rhetoric, stop worrying about any perceived insults of the past, and start learning from each other.  But considering our disagreement on so many core issues, it seems fair to ask what we can work together toward?  Kathleen Seidel can answer that one: I am convinced that society must work to discourage the proliferation of dehumanizing characterizations of autism and autistic people. We have got to continue to work to develop our understanding of autism, to work to improve the quality of life for all autistic citizens from childhood through adulthood, to continue to identify means for autistic people to gain the skills and knowledge they need to get along in the world, and to learn to interact in a respectful way. It\u2019s pretty hard to argue with that. ************************************************************************** Eventually I plan to get back to more substantive topics, but I believe I\u2019ll take a little time in the near future to talk in general terms about \u201crespect,\u201d because that\u2019s really what all of this is about.  You can\u2019t be respected if you don\u2019t show a little respect.  And you can\u2019t change the world if you don\u2019t have respect.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.safeminds.org/", "http://www.nomercury.org/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/08/seeking-out-genetic-roots-of-autism.html", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/im-beginning-to-understand.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t I\u2019M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND NEURODIVERSITY (AND HOPEFULLY VICE VERSA)\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, August 18, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      A seemingly universal part of the human make-up is the steadfast belief each of us has that we are right.  A problem arises when we try to apply to others\u2019 lives that which is right for ourselves.  Sometimes when I make that mistake, I take a step back.  Only then do I realize how easy it was for the other person to interpret my compassion as arrogance. Lately I have noticed a great divide forming on the internet between those of us attempting biomedical treatments for our children on one side, and members of the neurodiversity community on the other.  That divide is difficult to put a finger on, partly because, by definition, the neurodiversity community is \u2026 well \u2026 diverse in composition and beliefs.  As parents, we know that our autistic children are capable of far more emotion than stereotypes portray.  I know the gut-wrenching experience of seeing \u201ctypical\u201d kids ignore my son, or, worse yet, seeing idiotic adults assume my son is mentally retarded.  Members of the neurodiversity community know that same pain, but they seem to feel it is caused as often by the actions or words of anti-thimerosal/biomedical advocates as much as it is by unfeeling members of the general public.  It is incumbent on all of us to learn why they feel that way, and perhaps look at ourselves.    One of the most visible commentators from the neurodiversity community is Kathleen Seidel.  I have been reading some of  her web site , but I need to read a lot more before I feel I can intelligently comment on what she has written.  At this time, all I can say is there is a lot I disagree with, but there is also a lot with which I agree.  I want to learn more from -- and about  -- Ms. Seidel before I condemn or praise her. Why should I want to learn anything about folks who seemingly believe that autism, Aspergers, and other parts of the spectrum are not so much diseases as the normal condition of their lives?  What can these folks teach those of us who treat autism spectrum disorders as diseases for which a cure may possibly exist? While trying to learn more about neurodiversity, I came upon a blog entitled \u201c Thoughts of a High Functioning Autistic Teen .\u201d  In her writing, an extraordinary young woman lifts up her frustration, her pride, and, yes, her anger for our enlightenment.  She is intelligent, articulate, and very self-aware.  And she does not wish to be cured.  Instead, she wants respect for who she has become and who she will become.  This teenager deserves that respect. For those of us who believe strongly in biomedical treatments, it is easy to think it is \u201cthe answer\u201d for everyone.  Most of us who practice biomedical do so partly because we know that, absent some form of intervention, the odds are that our children would never reach the extremely high functioning level of communication practiced by the teen-aged author of the above-referenced blog.  We want our children, when they reach their later teen years, to be able to tell us how they feel about the choices we make in their lives.  I hope the choices my wife and I make for our son may enable him to attain a level of independence he might otherwise not achieve.  But I am trying to learn to set aside my arrogance and respect the decisions that others make.  I am trying to learn to look beyond my own son when I see another autistic child.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.neurodiversity.com", "http://invisiblek.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/trying-to-understand-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE NEURODIVERSITY MOVEMENT\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, August 19, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      There\u2019s a pithy little saying I hear an awful lot in the debate over thimerosal; those who argue that science does not support a link between thimerosal and the development of autism spectrum disorders often recite it.  When confronted with the combined and consistent experiences of so many families, these defenders of the official position (including  Dr. Harvey Fineberg  in his recent appearance on  Meet the Press ) recite the mantra that \u201cthe plural of anecdote is not evidence.\u201d  Their use of that rusty saw in this context ignores the fundamental nature of the scientific method. I am not a scientist, but like anyone with any degree of education, I took science classes and learned about the scientific method.  As I recall, the process begins with a step called \u201cobservation.\u201d  Based on observations, the inquirer forms questions and then a hypothesis.  Then experiments are conducted to prove or disprove the hypothesis.  Until the hypothesis is proven or disproved, further observations, including observations resulting from the experiments, may be made that may alter the hypothesis, leading to further experimentation.  Anecdotes are observations. Any rational person must accept that anecdotal data cannot stand as evidence to support a failed hypothesis (i.e., a hypothesis that has been definitively refuted).  But the hypothesis that thimerosal plays a role in the development of genetically susceptible children has not yet been proven or disproved.  The absurd notion that the epidemiological studies cited by the Institute of Medicine\u2019s 2004 report disprove the thimerosal/autism hypothesis inflates the importance of epidemiology in determining biological causation.  Moreover, the flawed methodology of those epidemiological studies renders them practically useless for the inquiry. The late Carl Sagan coined a corollary to the plural-of-anecdote maxim:  The absence of evidence does not mean the evidence of absence.  The fact that the thimerosal/autism hypothesis not yet been proven means only that the process prescribed by the scientific method is ongoing.

{"date": "Sunday, October 02, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n       Foreword (a look back at this post with the perspective of time):  One of the few regrets I have about doing this blog is the title of this post.  It was childish and disrespectful -- not so much to Dr. Offit as to the tenor of the debate.  You see, it makes a joke, and I've come to realize that there's nothing at all funny about Paul Offit or anything he has to say.  For more, see  That's His Story and He's Sticking To It ,  A Response to JP ,  The Cutter Incident and Paranoia ,  Here We Go Again ,  The Disingenuous Salesman ,  The Willingness to Confront Uncomfortable Questions ,  Why Is Anyone Taking This Guy Seriously , and  A Friend Responds to the False (Pr)Offit . Regular readers might know that I make one exception to my rule of \u201ccivility at all times.\u201d  That exception exists for Paul Offit, who never met a neurotoxin-containing vaccine he didn\u2019t like.  Well, he\u2019s back!!!  Dr. Offitt recently published an  op-ed piece  in which he weighs in on the tragic death of Abubakar Nadama.  Like too many other people, Offit just couldn\u2019t wait for all the facts to come out.  Instead, he decided to use this boy\u2019s death -- before we even know what went wrong or what really happened -- to further his agenda of discrediting anyone who dares to question the wisdom of adding neurotoxins to vaccines, or who dares to question the wisdom of adding more and more and more vaccines to an already bloated schedule. We get unintended irony this time from Dr. Offit, who now complains that the press is being too sensationalistic because they don\u2019t give a balanced look at the issue.  Many of us, though, remember the hatchet job by Dan Rather when  60 Minutes  ran a story on the thimerosal controversy.  On one side was a small group of \u201cmercury moms,\u201d who were made to seem like modern-day Luddites shunning anything smacking of science.  On the other side was kindly Doc Offit, who oozed sympathy for the poor, misguided parents who just didn\u2019t seem to understand that there was no science at all behind this crazy theory about an environmental trigger for autism.  There was no mention of any of the scientists or physicians who believe there is evidence of a link between thimerosal and/or live-virus vaccines and the triggering of ASD.  There never is (except for the relatively recent segment on  Meet the Press ). Dr. Offit dismisses scientists and physicians who disagree with his position as a \u201cfew marginal scientists and clinicians.\u201d  Well, I\u2019ll stick with those marginal scientists and clinicians who freely admit that their clinical and biological studies are still in the early stages, rather than with a doctor, no matter how many titles he may have, who refers to a small handful of extremely flawed epidemiological studies as having \u201canswered the question of whether vaccines cause autism.\u201d  First, Dr. Offit misstates the hypothesis; the belief is that vaccines may play a role in triggering ASD in genetically susceptible children, not that vaccines, in and of themselves, \u201ccause autism.\u201d  Second, regardless of the hypothesis, the epidemiologicial studies did not answer any questions.  Certainly, safety studies for thimerosal prove nothing about long-term effects, primarily because there have been no such studies. Of course, Dr. Offit will never tell the whole story, because he will not even tell the whole story about himself.  The only information ever given about him is that he is the Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.   Not once in any of Dr. Offit\u2019s numerous media forays has it ever been mentioned that he holds a patent for a thimerosal-containing vaccine, or that he has numerous ties to the vaccine industry, including a consulting contract to \u201ceducate\u201d physicians and the public about vaccines.  In other words, when Dr. Offit appears on television or publishes a piece in the newspaper, he is paid to do so under the guise of \u201ceducating\u201d us. I\u2019ve had about all the \"education\" I can stand from Paul Offit.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2005/092005/09252005/131521"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/darth-offit-is-at-it-again.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t DARTH OFFIT IS AT IT AGAIN\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 31, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      If my last post seemed a little disjointed, it was because I completed it late at night after driving many long hours.  It was posted via the high-speed internet connection in a hotel room.  My family is on the road.  We are refugees.   When we went to bed Friday night, we believed that Hurricane Katrina was headed to the Florida panhandle.  By the time we awoke on Saturday morning, it was coming to the New Orleans area where we live.  We saw the predictions of a Category V hurricane coming so close, and we knew the only sane thing to do was evacuate.   We packed what would fit into the car and grabbed a few precious hours of sleep.  Around 3:00 a.m., Sunday morning, two adults, one teenaged boy, one autistic child, and one Cairn Terrier set off on what we assumed would be a one-to-two day trip.  (That assumption was a little too similar to the assumption of a certain group that their trip aboard the S.S. Minnow would be but a three-hour tour.) The \u201ccontraflow\u201d system designed to speed the flow of evacuation worked well.  In essence, the State Police shut off in-bound traffic on the major arteries coming into the area, and then designate all of the lanes for out-bound traffic.  Even in the middle of the night, there was a steady flow of traffic heading north on Interstate 55.   The second rest area in Mississippi resembled a refugee camp just outside of a war zone.  Vehicles were double-parked.  People were sleeping on picnic tables.  Impromptu parties were well underway.  About ten minutes after leaving the rest area, I realized that a pretty sizable percentage of that crowd probably had nowhere to go.  Many of the refugees were likely without sufficient funds to get a hotel room, and probably could not afford the gas to get much further than they already had traveled.  I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how many of the people in that rest area intended to ride the storm out right there.   Hotel rooms were unavailable in Monroe or Shreveport, so we drove all the way to Arlington, Texas.  It seemed a likely spot.  It was well away from the storm, had plenty to do, and was close to my oldest brother\u2019s home.  But we did not intend to move here.  It\u2019s Wednesday afternoon as I post this, and there\u2019s no indication that we will be able to go home any time soon. I was nine years old when Hurricane Betsy passed close to New Orleans in 1965, causing devastation to parts of the city.  My recollections of the week or so after that storm are relatively pleasant.  It was kind of like a camping trip; we had no electricity and my mother heated canned food over a sterno stove.  This time around, I have a lot more creature comforts, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll look back on Katrina with any degree of fondness. It hasn\u2019t been all bad.  Texans make for pretty friendly hosts (although I have to say they may be the most dangerous drivers I\u2019ve seen south of New York City).  There are plenty of diversions; the other night my sons saw their first Major League game (well, Rangers versus White Sox, which is close enough to Major League baseball).     About half of the hotel\u2019s guests are Louisiana evacuees, and it seems like over half of us have our dogs with us.  It\u2019s reminiscent of the hotel in the movie  Best of Show ; one can walk down the hallway and hear woofing at about half the doors.  The hotel staff just smiles at the unusually high number of four-legged guests, and all the dog families have formed a kind of community within a community within a community.   In general, the hotel has been great.  I\u2019ve been thinking of suggesting a new advertising campaign for the chain: Pet Friendly!  Free High-Speed Internet Access!  Free Continental Breakfast!  Coin-Op Laundry!   La Quinta:  the right choice for your next evacuation! One of the things we needed in a hotel room was a refrigerator for the supplements and special food items our son needs that require cooling.  Maintaining his biomedical intervention has been a challenge.  We have always been able to handle the biomedical routine on \u201cvacation,\u201d and we\u2019re doing okay with it on this trip.  But our son has been a little wild, emotionally volatile, and stimmy.  There has been too much of a break in his routine, too much inconsistency in our interventions, too many possible gluten or casein infractions, and too much distraction on the part of mommy and daddy who are constantly seeking more information about thehttp://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gif state of things back home. Although the \u201cpet friendly\u201d part was one of the most important things when we looked for a hotel, the internet access has become our real lifeline.  During Hurricane Betsy, I recall my family huddled around a transistor radio listening to the reports, and we felt less alone.  Even though we have kept the hotel television on the news reports, we have also used the internet, which has brought us closer to home in the same way the transistor radio did during Betsy.  Even when  WDSU  television could no longer broadcast its signal over the airwaves, they were streaming reports live on their web site.   WWL  television updates its site several times a day with the type of information we are desperate for, like how far did the floodwaters get in our community.  The information we get from the Louisiana media is more intimate than we get from the cable news networks, and somehow it\u2019s easier to get bad news from friends.  And the news has been mostly bad. There are no adequate words that can describe what it has been like to watch television and see the city I grew up in -- the city I love -- looking like it does right now.  We\u2019ve been seeing scenes that look like World War II newsreel footage, and then we recognize what\u2019s left of a building or a neighborhood.  It\u2019s surreal and it\u2019s heart breaking.  I know this town.  I know these people. So far, the word on our loved ones seems to be good.  I\u2019ve heard from my daughter who rode the storm out in Baton Rouge and, except for losing power for several hours, seems to have come through quite nicely.  We\u2019ve gotten word about some of my wife\u2019s family, who are well.  But we\u2019re still waiting to hear from others in both families along with a lot of friends.  We\u2019ve heard from friends, many of whom have lost everything they had but their lives.  Both cell towers and land lines are out through much of the affected area.  All we can do is wait, keep trying to get more information, and pray. The authorities are still not allowing residents of St. Tammany Parish, where we live, back into the area.  Most of the flooding in St. Tammany was in Slidell or the parts of Mandeville closest to Lake Pontchartrain.  Our house should have been safe from the flooding (although that\u2019s not necessarily a given), but we have many large trees around that could have easily been blown over onto our house in the storm.  We really do not know if we have a home to which we can return. I don\u2019t know if we have a home.  I don\u2019t know how much of my \u201cstuff\u201d has been lost.  I don\u2019t know if the firm where I work still exists.  But I look around me and see that my family is well.  We will survive this.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wdsu.com/index.html", "http://www.wwltv.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/just-another-refugee_31.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t JUST ANOTHER REFUGEE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 11, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      In my  last post , I offered a critique of Paul Offit\u2019s interview on  Autism One Radio .  That post prompted the following comment from \u201cJP,\u201d who maintains a site called  SupportVacination.org .  JP\u2019s comment reads as follows: Wade, Again, I believe you're off-base on a few comments. As I've stated numerous times on my blog - if you're trying to ask the question of whether vaccines (or mercury in vaccines) played a role in moving the needle towards the 1 in 166 number we see today, epidemiology is the ONLY way to answer that question. So I think Offit's right in that regard. I haven't heard Offit's interview, but I don't think that's necessarily inconsistent with saying that autism might have an environmental component, but that component isn't necessarily vaccination. I personally think that's a real possibility - there are MANY factors at work with the increase in autism throughout the years. Some of them are expansion of the ASD criteria and availability of services. Some of them may be external. I disagree with your assessment of the Burbacher study. The Burbacher study illustrated that ethylmercury clears the body faster than methylmercury, but leaves more inorganic mercury behind. In the study itself, Burbacher doesn't necessarily say that the inorganic mercury left behind is dangerous or even meaningful, because nobody knows if it is or not. (other than one study that postulates that fact) So Offit's again, right on that point. As to whether methylmercury exposure is more dangerous than ethylmercury exposure, well, there is the pesky fact that methylmercury is everywhere. We can't get away from it. It's in the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. If mercury is a cause of autism, it would be logical to assume that methylmercury is the prime culprit. You are correct in saying we have no studies to know that for sure, but it's a reasonable hypothesis. And as I said above, Offit giving more weight to epidemiology IS appropriate. It's how you're going to make decisions about population-based issues. Reductionist studies aren't going to help shape public health policy. They can't, they're not powerful enough, they're not right often enough. As to the Verstraeten study - while Verstraeten did classify the study as \"neutral\", I've now talked to three different folks involved with the study who disagree with that assessment. They all agree, however, that a more probative study (and there's one being conducted based on a similar Faroe Islands study several years ago) is necessary. And as I said on my blog (and confirmed by two different individuals involved with the CDC) the data used in the Verstraeten study IS available for anyone who wants to use it. I've heard that fallacy of the \"data is missing\" so long now that it's become almost a given, which is a shame. And as to your claim in a previous comment that Offit has deeply entrenched \"vaccine industry ties\" - I guess I'd like to see some actual proof of that. Offit himself has said, on numerous occassions, that he does NOT take money from drug companies. I've yet to see someone counter with hard evidence that he does, other than the claims of Merck hush money or misuse of \"unrestricted educational grants\" that is to date unfounded. Wade, all in all, I think that Offit's position - while anathema to you - has a fair amount of validity. And as I told Ginger Taylor a while back - you have every ability in the world to prove me wrong. Epidemiological studies. Clinical trials of chelation therapy. Rather than rush headlong into curing kids with treatments that are of questionable validity and effiacy, why not do the due dilligence to know you're right first? I started to compose a reply to JP in the comments section, but I soon realized there was enough to say for a whole new post. First of all, JP\u2019s comment that the astounding increase we saw in ASD over the course of 10 years results from changes in diagnostic criteria and availability of services is an argument that even the most tireless vaccine apologists are beginning to abandon.  Note that in Dr. Offit\u2019s interview, he acknowledged that autism \u201chas apparently become more common.\u201d  I hate to parse oral statements, but Dr. Offit did not say that \u201creported cases of autism have increased.\u201d  Granted, the use of the word \u201capparently\u201d leaves a little wiggle room, but Dr. Offit\u2019s phrasing is consistent with what we hear from public health officials who, even though they do not wish to give credence to a vaccine connection, admit that there seems to be a rise in the incidence of ASD.  Genetics cannot account for that rise.  For a less scientific confirmation, simply ask any elementary school teachers who have been on the job for more than 15 years if they see more kids on the spectrum. (I should note that statements attributed to Dr. Offit have been all over the board on the issue of whether there is an epidemic.) Epidemiology can get us to the one in 166 number, but it can not show the impact of the increased exposure to thimerosal (or the combined impact of thimerosal-containing and live-virus vaccines) after a large number of vaccines were added to the schedule.  Only clinical and biological studies can show that, and Dr. Offit\u2019s insistence that epidemiology can definitively provide and answer leads me to question either his intellectual honesty or his scientific competence. With regard to the Verstraeten report, let me quote the author:  \u201cThe bottom line is and has always been the same, an association between thimerosal and neurological outcomes could neither be confirmed nor refuted and therefore more study is required.\u201d  Dr. Verstraeten did not say that his study indicates a lack of an association, but it needs to be replicated.  Rather, he said his study was inconclusive. I believe that in making that statement, Dr. Verstraeten showed more intellectual honesty as a full-time employee of a vaccine manufacturer than Dr. Offit has ever displayed as a part-time consultant.  Dr. Verstraeten knew that limiting the scope of his study to a strictly defined definition of autism as opposed to the full scope of ASD, together with including a cohort too young to be diagnosed with autism, dramatically altered the outcome of his report.  It went from showing a probable association to being \u201cneutral.\u201d While I have not spoken to anyone at the CDC as JP claims to have done, my understanding is that the raw datasets are gone.  At least that\u2019s what the CDC indicated when  a member of Congress  looked into the matter.  What may be available are the final \u201carchived\u201d sets that do not include all data that was examined.  Moreover, anyone who wishes to examine the data is given very limited access, reportedly on privacy grounds, even though all personal identifying information has already been removed.  The only means of either replicating or refuting Dr. Verstraeten\u2019s published \u201cfindings\u201d is to have access to the original raw data with the same unhampered access as Dr. Verstraeten had.  The Danish and Swedish studies Dr. Offit finds so convincing as replication have no relevance at all to the Verstraeten report.  First, the level of thimerosal exposure in those countries was far lower than the exposure to our children here in the United States.  Moreover, the use of different populations in the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d numbers provides a textbook example of data manipulation. I can only assume that the \u201cFaroe Island\u201d studies to which JP refers are the same studies Dr. Verstraeten described as being \u201cas comparable to our issue as apples and pears at the best.\u201d  He fought against using those studies as part of his report despite the fact that \u201cmany experts, looking at this thimerosal issue, do not seem bothered to compare apples to pears and insist if nothing is happening in these studies then nothing should be feared of thimerosal.\u201d  Of course, Dr. Verstraeten wrote that before he left the CDC for the greener pastures of Glaxo-SmithKline.  One cannot help but wonder how Dr. Verstraeten\u2019s report would have ended up had he not opened it up to the \u201csuggestions\u201d of others with vested interests. JP correctly argues that a single reductionist study cannot control public policy.  But that is the nature of reductionist studies; they each comprise a single part of a larger puzzle.  When enough pieces of the puzzle come together, one can see the whole picture.  Enough of those pieces are coming together now that we can see the plausibility of a link, but Dr. Offit -- and apparently JP as well -- will not put the pieces together. For example, I cannot argue with JP\u2019s statement that the Burbacher study, in itself, does not show the harmful impact of inorganic mercury in the brain.  But it does show that inorganic mercury can accumulate in the brain, if ethylmercury is not excreted.  And the Jill James study shows the plausibility of some children being genetically hampered in their ability to excrete ethylmercury.  Moreover, I can\u2019t help but be reminded that Dr. Offit\u2019s primary criticism of Richard Deth\u2019s in vitro studies of ethylmercury was that there was no evidence that ethylmercury crossed the blood-brain barrier.  That answer was supplied by the Burbacher study.  Dr. Deth\u2019s study shows a probability that ethylmercury is every bit as dangerous as methylmercury.  But again, one has to put the pieces of the puzzle together by looking at a number of reductionist studies, something Dr. Offit apparently does not have the patience to do. JP\u2019s argument about the pervasive risk from methylmercury is almost word-for-word the same argument we often hear from Dr. Offit.  Certainly potential exposure from methylmercury is a risk factor, and can present a possible envoironmental trigger for all sorts of things, including ASD.  But the bolus dose of ethylmercury my child received in any of his thimerosal-containing vaccines exceeded the exposure of methylmercury from other sources, especially considering the ethylmercury was injected directly into his body.  Mercury poisoning just doesn\u2019t get any more efficient than that. JP may be willing to take Dr. Offit\u2019s claim that he does not take money from vaccine manufacturers at face value, but I think he is hopelessly na\u00efve to do so.  Dr. Offit acknowledged that he has been a  consultant for Merck , although he has refused to say what remuneration he receives for his services.  Dr. Offit and his partner received a $350,000 grant from Merck for the development of their rotavirus vaccine, and then got to keep the patent.  In essence, Merck paid to have the option to use the patent.  Merck purchased 20,000 copies of Dr. Offit\u2019s book,  Vaccines:  What You Should Know , to distribute to physicians. There is nothing dishonest about entering into these arrangements, but to pretend that the relationship doesn\u2019t exist is wrong.   Of course, Dr. Offit\u2019s grasp on the concept of a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d is a little shaky.  He served on the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices for the CDC.  While on the committee, Dr. Offit voted three times in favor of adding a Wyeth vaccine for Rotavirus to the national vaccine schedule.  Because his association was with another manufacturer, he saw no reason to cast a vote on the issue even though the first vaccine\u2019s approval would make it easier to gain later approval for alternatives like Merck\u2019s vaccine.  It was not until the committee met again -- after the Wyeth vaccine killed 10 children in a two-week period -- that Dr. Offit thought that the appearance of impropriety might be enough to prevent him from voting on the vaccine\u2019s removal from the schedule. I practice in a profession that takes conflicts of interest pretty seriously.  I should be thankful for people like Dr. Offit, because his actions make shady lawyers look relatively honest. Let us suppose for the sake of argument that Dr. Offit did not have close ties to the industry, and that he speaks out simply because he believes so very much in a vaccine program that has saved countless lives.  (Indeed, that is the reason JP gives for his own involvement in the debate.)  The arrogant statements Dr. Offit has made, such as \u201cfull disclosure can be harmful,\u201d from a New York Times Magazine article,  show his attitude toward patients and parents.  Look at the following quote from the interview he gave David Kirby for Evidence of Harm: \u2026 you did more harm than good in sort of, quote/unquote, allowing the parent to be fully informed.  There\u2019s no politically correct way to say this, but being fully informed is not always the best thing. I can picture Dr. Offit on the witness stand, shouting out:  \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth!!!\u201d Dr. Offit\u2019s stated concern in making those statements was that parents were being deterred from having their children vaccinated.  That concern may be laudable, but I would submit that Dr. Offit has done far greater damage to the vaccine program by making it easier to conceal the truth than would have been done if the problem would have been openly acknowledged.  In his view, it may be better to hide some of the truth and sacrifice a minority of the children for the greater good.  I have a hard time seeing that greater good, because I live with one of Dr. Offit\u2019s sacrificial lambs. JP says that we \u201chave every ability in the world\u201d to prove he is wrong.  I am not sure what planet JP lives on, but here on Earth, research takes a lot of money.  As long as men like Paul Offit provide cover for politicians and bureaucrats, some of whom benefit from the contributions of vaccine manufacturers, it will be difficult to convince government to allocate the necessary resources to definitively determine the causal connection between vaccines and autism.  So the inquiry will take much longer than it should.  Still, JP, tell Dr. Offit not to get too comfortable.  It may take some time, but we\u2019re going to find the answer.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismone.org/radio/", "http://www.supportvaccination.org/", "http://weldon.house.gov/UploadedFiles/RepWeldonMDonIOM.pdf", "http://www.whale.to/v/staff.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/response-to-jp.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A RESPONSE TO JP\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Sunday, October 09, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      I have come to the conclusion that I have been wrong to repeatedly refer to Dr. Paul Offit as Darth Vader.  Resorting to such juvenile name-calling is the style of some other bloggers (who shall remain nameless, since they don't use their real names anyway), not me.  Although I offer my apologies to Dr. Offit for my little joke, his appearance on  Autism One Radio  gave me no reason to actually start respecting the man or his opinions. Autism One Radio  provided coverage on the  Power of Parents Rally  in Washington being held to give the physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics a little something to think about.  In the midst of that, Paul Offitt was interviewed.  I suppose I should give Dr. Offit credit for actually agreeing to be interviewed live on October 8th by Teri Small, but it would be a lot easier to do so if direct answers had been given to Ms. Small\u2019s questions. I can\u2019t say I was very surprised at anything Dr. Offit had to say, other than his admission that autism \u201chas apparently become more common\u201d in the United States.  I suppose that is as close as he can come to using the \u201ce\u201d word.  Dr. Offit further vacknowledged that autism probably results from an environmental trigger acting on genetically predisposed children.  And he also agreed that some children have genetic predispositions to vaccine reactions.  Dr. O just can\u2019t admit that those two concepts have any relation to each other.  Why not?  In Dr. Offit\u2019s view, the epidemiological reports are irrefutable, no matter what clinical and biological studies indicate. When Teri asked for a comment about the  Burbacher studies , and its finding that ethylmercury crosses the blood-brain barrier, Dr. Offit chose to address the broader question of whether he thought thimerosal was delivered in harmful levels in vaccines.  (Was he trying to stick to a script?)  He tried to ignore the Brupbacher study, and instead focused on the four epidemiological studies that we have all discussed time and again.   Despite Dr. Burbacher\u2019s findings that indicate the opposite, Dr. Offit continues to insist that methylmercury accumulates in greater and more dangerous quantities than does ethylmercury.  With that opinion as a backdrop, Dr. Offit implied that the presence of methylmercury in the environment makes infant formula, or even breast milk, more dangerous than thimerosal in vaccines. Throughout the interview, Dr. Offit continued to stick to his baseless opinion that methylmercury in the environment presents a greater danger than ethylmercury that was directly injected into our children. Teri attempted to gently steer Dr. Offit back on track to discuss the implications of the Burbacher study, but he insisted that he had no idea why it should be significant for there to be inorganic mercury in the brain.  He insisted that animal studies are not predictive in the least, and that the only proper measure of harm is to study humans.  The superiority of human studies is difficult to argue with, but Dr. Offitt feels that the four epidemiological studies tell the whole study. After Dr. Offit brought up the superiority of human studies, Teri commented that some human tissue studies seemed consistent with the animal experiments, and questioned whether further tissue studies would be useful.  Dr. Offit made it clear that he prefers epidemiology to provide a complete answer rather than tissue studies he refers to as \u201creductionist.\u201d Let us be clear about reductionist studies.  That term refers to the concept that complex problems can be better understood by reducing them to simpler component parts.  Reducing complex problems is usually considered a pretty good approach in science; it prevents researchers from traveling down the wrong road.  Yet Dr. Offit spit out the word as if it were a curse. Dr. Offit believes that only epidemiological studies can answer the question of whether thimerosal can be related to the development of autism.  When confronted with the statements by Dr. Verstraeten that the study he prepared neither proved nor disproved a connection, Dr. Offit said Dr. Verstraeten merely meant that the study was not probative until it was replicated, and that the other three studies successfully replicated the findings.  Is he kidding??? The other three studies had nothing to do with Dr. Verstraeten\u2019s report.  They addressed different populations using different criteria.  If one wanted to replicate the Vertsraten study, one would need to access the same data upon which the report relied.  But as we all know, that replication cannot occur because the data is now \u201cunavailable.\u201d Epidemiology has a place in the inquiry, but it cannot form the only basis for answering the question of whether component parts of a vaccine can trigger autistic symptoms in a susceptible child.  Epidemiology can be too easily manipulated to produce the result the researcher (or the researcher\u2019s principle) wants.  For that reason, I have always likened epidemiology more to forensic accounting than to hard science.  A well designed epidemiological study (and I certainly do not think any of the four studies at issue were well designed) can help define the questions, but it cannot provide final answers.  Only if you are Paul Offitt can epidemiology be the only research one needs to perform. This is the one question I would like to address to Dr. Offit.  Why is it that vaccine manufacturers (and I hope we can all agree that Dr. Offit is an industry insider) have not conducted any clinical or biological research into the possible link between thimerosal-containing or live-virus vaccines and the onset of autism?  There seems to be huge fear of legal liability.  As an attorney who spends nearly all of his professional time defending corporations and insurance companies, including a lot of products-liability suits, I can tell you that a good scientific defense can save both indemnity and defense costs.  It seems to me that the manufacturers would be eager to definitively refute any connection, using the same types of science relied on by those of us who believe in a connection.  That would give them the best evidence of all.  Their failure to fund that research speaks volumes. Those studies will not be performed (or if they have already been quietly done, we will not hear of them) because the hypothesis of a connection is simply too plausible.  So industry spokesmen like Dr. Offit will continue to talk down to us as if we don\u2019t understand science.  And that\u2019s why I find Paul Offit so offensive.  He assumes we\u2019re stupid.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismone.org/radio/", "http://www.autismone.org/radio/", "http://www.nationalforce.org/", "http://safeminds.org/research/library/Burbacher-EHP-Primates-April-2005.pdf"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/thats-his-story-and-hes-sticking-to-it.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THAT\u2019S HIS STORY AND HE\u2019S STICKING TO IT\n\t \n    "},

Many of us in the pro-biomedical community -- and I count myself in that number -- rushed to express our self-righteous anger at a medical system that we presumed was not allowing a Pennsylvania doctor to admit a child to a hospital as an out-patient for an intravenous procedure.  Then I came to realize we did not know that for a fact, and we really know very little about what happened.  In a perfect world, parents of dysfunctional children (and not every child on the autistic spectrum meets that criterion) could wait for the years it will take to complete clinical studies of biomedical treatments in all their permutations. But many of us worry about the ability of our children to function independently as they grow into adulthood.  The commonly reported experience among parents who practice biomedical interventions is that their children were steadily regressing until beginning the intervention, after which they observed steady improvement.  Waiting until a child is approaching adolescence before deciding whether he or she will ever function independently is not a choice I would make for my son.  So we choose to intervene biomedically, and part of that is chelation of heavy metals. Does that mean we should jump at any potential treatment in the hopes of a \u201ccure?\u201d Only a fool would act so rashly. Like any course of treatment or intervention, potential benefits have to be weighed against real risks. And even the slightest risk requires safeguards. In general, mercury chelation with DMSA and/or DMPS has been performed safely, although continual monitoring and testing is required to ensure that no harm is done. As far as I know, IV-EDTA is not used for mercury chelation, but is sometimes used for lead chelation.  And so I must assume that Abubakar tested high for lead. Quite often, our kids test high for lead, which is probably due to the same glutathione deficiency that makes it impossible for our children to naturally excrete mercury.  High lead levels obviously become a matter of concern. Many biomedical doctors, therefore, prescribe EDTA even though it is not part of the official DAN! protocol. The reason for using EDTA -- which is considered an acceptable treatment for lead poisoning -- as opposed to DMSA is that many of our children have fairly severe \u201cgut\u201d reactions to DMSA (the same reason many parents opt for DMPS to chelate mercury). But chelating lead with IV-EDTA, a drug approved by the FDA for that purpose, should not be lethal.  What happened?  We don\u2019t know, and we are so frustrated that we feel the need to get angry.   If our initial anger was predictable, the response by the anti-biomedical crowd to the child\u2019s death was both predictable and perverse.  Out of one side of the mouth, some said the incident proved that all chelation was unsafe.  Out of the other side, the same people proclaimed that DMSA was the proven safe method for chelation of both lead and mercury.  Which of those contradictory statements was true?  Everywhere one looked on the web, fingers were pointed at the entire movement.  On  Kevin Leitch\u2019s blog , I tried to address some of the sincere anger expressed by those who do not share my support of biomedical interventions.  And I addressed our obligations in the biomedical community: I agree with you that we in the biomedical community should not be pointing fingers at anyone right now. If we really want to claim Abubakar as our own, we must also take ownership of his death. We must actively seek answers no matter where they may lead, and we must be willing to accept whatever blame belongs with us. But don\u2019t assign that blame until we know what happened. What I thought was a pretty balanced statement drew fire.  I had to explain to one person, who scolded me for trying to turn Abubakar into another Terry Schiavo, that all I meant by \u201ctaking ownership\u201d was that those of us who felt a kinship to the Nadama family have \u201cto earn that kinship by asking ourselves some difficult questions, even if they lead to answers we don\u2019t like.\u201d A comment was left at Kevin\u2019s blog by an anonymous (of course) person who called herself \u201cAngry Mom:\u201d I also hope that the family of little Abubakar, the healthy little autistic boy who was beautiful and who ran happily in his family\u2019s garden according to a neighbor, will become filled with anger at the autism biomed \u201ccommunity\u201d and expose exactly who it is that convinced them their son was \u201cmercury toxic\u201d and what lab told them that and which doctors promised quicker recovery with IV chelation. I hope his family ends up with everything now owned by Dr. Usman, Dr. Kerry, St. Martin\u2019s press, David Kirby, Dr. Gary Gordon, Autismmedia, DAN!, Arianna Huffington, Craig Westover, Lenny Schafer, Rick Rollens, Dr. Byrd, Sallie Bernard, Mark Blaxill, Lyn Redwood, Lujene Clark, \u201cmoms against mercury\u201d, \u201cdads against mercury\u201d, Dan Burton, Ginger Taylor, John Shestak, Poria Iverson, Rashid Buttar, Boyd Hayley, JB Handley, Dr. Deth, Any Holmes, Wade Rankin, the NAA, ASA, Autismlink, autism 1 and all the rest. That would be fair. Wow.  I must admit that I am extremely flattered to be mentioned in the company of people I consider to be heroes.  I am afraid I\u2019m being given a little too much credit.  This blog has only been up since August 7, 2005, and nobody really noticed it until the last couple of weeks.  I kind of doubt Dr. and Mrs. Nadama have ever heard of me, but if it puts me in a league with the other people mentioned, it would be worth the price of admission.  I would be interested, however, to know from this \u201cAngry Mom,\u201d who is encouraging legal action against all of us, if she is one of the people who always accuse the anti-thimerosal movement of being litigation driven. I still think we in the biomedical movement have a lot of questions to ask ourselves.  But before we can even formulate those questions, we need to have more information.  Was Abubakar\u2019s death the result of an anaphylactic reaction, hypocalcemia, or some yet-to-be-thought-of reason?  If hypocalcemia was the direct cause of death, was it brought on by a failure to replentish the child\u2019s minerals, including calcium, with supplements, or did the doctor use Disodium EDTA rather than Calcium EDTA?  Was the proper dosage used?  Did the doctor perform all appropriate pre-procedure checks?  Was the child properly monitored in between chelation procedures? When we have the answer to all those questions, we\u2019ll have a better idea of whether anyone needs to bear the blame for this tragedy.  In the meantime, let\u2019s try to respect a family that needs to mourn a child.  Let\u2019s all shelve our anger for a while.  And let\u2019s honor the Nadama family\u2019s mourning by redoubling our own efforts to protect our own children.  That includes  learning all we can  and being equal partners with our doctors. I commend to you David Kirby\u2019s latest post at  The Huffington Post .  Although Mr. Kirby doesn\u2019t have all the answers and, in fact, seems to be unaware of the occasional lead problems in our kids, he asks a very important question.  Why, four years after the Institute of Medicine called for studies of chelation\u2019s effectiveness and safety, why are we still waiting for any studies to be undertaken?\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=267", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/autism-and-chelation-whe_b_6286.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/anger-and-rush-to-judgment.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ANGER AND RUSH TO JUDGMENT\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Sunday, October 16, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n       DISCLAIMER:  The following post includes commentary on legal matters, including suits filed several years ago in the State of California.  Although the author is licensed to practice law in the State of Louisiana, this commentary is by no means exhaustive or definitive.  First, the author is not terribly well-versed in California law, and second, the author has career and family responsibilities that simply won\u2019t allow time for the type of research this subject probably merits.  Under no circumstances, should the following be considered as legal advice. I really do not want this blog to become a continuous rant against Paul Offit.  So hopefully this will be the last post devoted to him for quite a while. Over the course of the last few posts, I have looked at some of the opinions Dr. Offit puts forth; I have discussed why I think he is wrong; and, most intriguingly, I have speculated on the reasons why Dr. Offit would continue to engage in questionable thinking and actions even though he should know better (thanks for that  turn of the phrase , Kristina). Much of what people on my side of the fence write about Dr. Offit is devoted to the issue of his conflicts of interest:  perhaps too much.  I must admit that I find it hard to believe that Dr. Offit\u2019s passion stems solely from self-interest.  It may well be that Dr. Offit\u2019s motivation has more to do with a desire to protect a vaccine program that he looks upon with a certain degree of pride. The two cries we hear so often from vaccine apologists are:  (1) that the claims of a link between vaccines and autism discourage parents from having their children vaccinated, and (2) that we are all just tools of greedy plaintiff lawyers who don\u2019t care if they wrongfully destroy a vital component of our national health-care policy.  The first argument obviously has no teeth.  Just this past July, the CDC  announced  that vaccination rates were at an all-time high, with about 81 percent of the nation\u2019s 19-to-35-month-old children receiving all the vaccinations in the recommended series.  So the real issue is whether vaccine manufacturers should be worried about baseless litigation. Paul Offit gave an  interview  recently to U.S. News and World Report, and it certainly provides some illumination as to how seriously he takes the litigation threat.  The word \u201cthimerosal\u201d was never mentioned in the interview; the occasion was an opportunity for Dr. Offit to hawk his new book,  The Cutter Incident .  For those who are not familiar with the story, Cutter Laboratories was one of the manufacturers of the original Salk polio vaccine.  The Salk vaccine relied on killed polio virus to create the immunity, but somehow Cutter mixed in live polio virus into some of the doses.  As a result, thousands of children were infected with polio, including 10 who died. Despite the acknowledged mistake of putting a live virus into some of the doses, Dr. Offit blames the incident on a reliance on animal studies.  (Of course, we know the low esteem in which Dr. Offit holds animal studies.)  Dr. Offit blames the Cutter incident for what he sees as the sorry state of affairs in the vaccine industry today. Does that mean that vaccines now can be just as dangerous? No.  Because of Cutter, vaccines go through thousands of tests to make sure they contain exactly what they are supposed to contain.  They are tested in thousands of people before they are licensed, and they\u2019re watched carefully afterwards to make sure they don't cause any rare side effects. So things are good with vaccines? Also no.  Cutter spawned a lawsuit that eventually brought the vaccine industry to its knees, which is where it is today. By \u201cto its knees,\u201d Dr. Offit is specifically referring to the dramatic reduction in the number of vaccine manufacturers that produce a greater number of required vaccines.  Of course, Dr. Offit doesn\u2019t attribute any other factors that just might have contributed to that reduction, such as the increased cost of testing that rightfully must be part of the development of a vaccine, or even the merger of pharmaceutical companies.  But could a single lawsuit bring an industry \u201cto its knees?\u201d  Possibly, but it certainly wasn\u2019t the suit Dr. Offit describes in his interview. Shouldn\u2019t people who were harmed by Cutter have sued? And won? They got polio, after all. I'm not saying they shouldn\u2019t sue.  But the jury found that Cutter was liable even though they were not negligent.  That meant vaccine makers could be sued for any harm.  And juries who don\u2019t understand science, and who don't understand the difference between causality and coincidence, award giant sums of money.  That scares companies away from making vaccines. Group B strep infections -- the leading bacterial killer of newborns -- could be prevented with a vaccine for pregnant women.  We have the technology to do it. But nobody is willing to risk lawsuits from women with babies born with unrelated birth defects. Once again, we\u2019re confronted with Dr. Offit\u2019s attitude that lay people are simply too stupid to understand the intricacies of medicine and science.  But was he right about the Cutter suit and its impact on the law?  No. The suit to which Dr. Offit apparently refers resulted in a reported decision that reviewed the jury\u2019s verdict.   Gottsdanker v. Cutter Laboratories , 6 Cal.Rptr. 320 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1960) actually involved only two of the infected patients, with a total jury award of $147,300 (including medical expenses).  Now in fairness to Dr. Offit, there were undoubtedly many other suits that resulted from this incident, and this suit acted as somewhat as a precedent for those suits (at least for suits filed in California), but it hardly seems that $73,650 per child qualifies as a \u201cgiant sum of money,\u201d even in the 1950\u2019s economy.  Some children probably were awarded more, but some probably got less.   Dr. Offit\u2019s description of the suit is almost accurate, but only \u201calmost.\u201d  It is true that the jury inexplicably determined that Cutter was not negligent.  Perhaps the judge charged the jury that actual knowledge of a defect was required; I really don\u2019t know.  The point is the verdict against Cutter was not without a legal basis existing outside of the negligence theory.  What the jury found, with eventually the court of appeal agreeing, was that Cutter breached an implied warranty of fitness.  In other words, Cutter\u2019s express disclosure that \u201clocal and other untoward reactions have been very minimal\u201d was not sufficient to counteract the implied warranty that the vaccine would not cause the very disease it was supposed to prevent.  The court of appeal addressed the same sorts of policy issues that Dr. Offit claims have been lost through the imposition of liability in cases like this: Defendant strongly argues that public policy will best be served by denying recovery in warranty for \u201cnew\u201d drugs. The argument is that development of medicines will be retarded if manufacturers are held to strict liability for their defects. While this argument might have merit if the warranty involved had to do with the mere failure of a medicine to cure or of a vaccine to prevent, it seems to be of but little weight where, as here, the warranty is limited to an assurance that the product will not actively cause the very disease it was designed to prevent. 6 Cal.Rptr. 326. The real question becomes the extent to which  Gottsdanker  had an impact on the development of liability claims against vaccine manufacturers.  The answer to that question is \u201cnot very much.\u201d   When the Sabin oral polio vaccine was introduced, it used a live virus to create the desired immunity, and predictably, some doses contained viruses that were not properly attenuated, and patients wound up contracting polio as a result of receiving the vaccine.  One reported California decision reviewing jury verdicts against a manufacturer (for the \u201cgiant sums\u201d of $60,000 and $80,000) discussed the Gottsdanker holding.  The court in  Grinnell v. Charles Pfizer & Co., Inc. , 79 Cal.Rptr. 369 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1969) noted that the appropriate theory for suits against vaccine makers was really the more traditional tort theory of strict liability rather than a theory of implied warranty.  (In most jurisdictions, strict liability denotes a species of liability in which the plaintiff must show a defect, but because of the superior position of the defendant to be on notice of the defect, the plaintiff is not required to show that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the defect.  The recent trend in most states is to eliminate theories of strict liability, particularly in products liability claims.) The continuing trend in California continued to be that courts became increasingly protective of vaccine manufacturers.  In  Sheffield v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 192 Cal.Rotr. 870 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1983), the court refused to apply strict liability on an industry-wide basis for defects in certain doses of the Salk vaccine, nor did it allow the plaintiffs to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.  That doctrine (literally, \u201cthe thing speaks for itself\u201d) would have shifted the burden of proof to the defendants to show themselves free from fault.  The court\u2019s ruling kept the burden of proof on the plaintiffs to prove all elements of liability. Finally. the decision in  Kearl v. Lederle Laboratories , 218 Cal.Rptr. 453 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1985), signaled the death of the type of decision that Dr. Offit claims to be such a threat to the vaccine program.  Therein, the court of appeal reversed a finding of liability against a manufacturer of the oral polio vaccine, and limited the causes of action available to plaintiffs: We hold that although in standard products liability litigation a plaintiff may utilize a strict liability design defect theory, such a strict liability cause of action must be prohibited for public policy reasons if the court determines, after taking evidence, that the product complained of is \u201cunavoidably dangerous\u201d; in such special cases, a plaintiff may proceed on a design defect theory only on the basis of negligence. 218 Cal.Rptr. 454. That holding specifically addresses the concerns of Dr. Offit, as stated in his interview, that we \u201clearn things the hard way in medicine, when things do go wrong.\u201d  In essence, the court held that vaccine manufacturers could not be held to a standard of perfection. I have not conducted in-depth research into the current state of affairs in California products-liability law.  And while I am not an expert in products-liability law on a nationwide basis, I do have a more-than-passing familiarity with the national scene, and my knowledge of Louisiana law on that subject is pretty good.  If any state allows the completely baseless manufacturers\u2019 liability that Dr. Offit claims is out there, I certainly am not aware of it.  Even the  Gottsdanker  case, while on the liberal side, had a rational basis under the law. All industries are subject to being sued, and sometimes those suits turn out to be factually unwarranted.  The medical field, including pharmaceutical companies, are no exception.  Even when defendants prevail, just being sued can be an expensive proposition.  Unfortunately, that is part of the cost of doing business in this day and age.  By and large, however, the courts and legislative bodies do a pretty good job of providing a favored status for medical providers and pharmaceutical companies.  For example, claims cannot be brought directly against a vaccine manufacturer unless they first go through what has become known as the \u201cvaccine court.\u201d The vaccine court is an arm of the United States Court of Claims.  Instead of suing vaccine manufacturers directly, plaint5iffs file suit against the United States, and awards come from a fund built up from a tax on vaccines.  Not one penny of vaccine profits go to funding the awards.  After going through the vaccine court process, plaintiffs who are dissatisfied with the outcome may opt out and refile their claim in an ordinary court, but, of course, that can delay the ultimate resolution of their claims by years.  The system is designed to handle vaccine claims without threatening the economic viability of vaccine manufacturers. Also, courts are now required to adhere to what has become known as the  Daubert  test for determining whether expert opinions are allowed to go before a jury.  Not only must the party demonstrate that the witness is qualified as an expert, but a valid basis for the opinion must be established.  That is, it must be shown that the expert\u2019s opinion was formed through the scientific method, or the jury never hears from the expert. As I have mentioned before, I represent corporations and insurers.  My practice includes the defense of products-liability claims.  I am all for putting an end to lawsuit abuse.  If Congress decides to provide more protection to an already protected industry, that option is always available.  The American people would prefer that we see no more last-minute riders to unrelated bills, but we would all have to live with any further provisions that are subject to a national debate.  In my humble opinion, though, the vaccine industry already has all the protection it needs. The perceived threat of litigation is simply not sufficient to provide a rational basis for the paranoia that fuels the deception we get from vaccine apologists.  What worries Paul Offit and those like him is not the threat of frivolous litigation.  It is the growing reality that parents of autistic children just may have a legitimate claim.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=15203355&postID=112908865596037693", "http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r050726.htm", "http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/051011/11book.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/cutter-incident-and-paranoia.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE CUTTER INCIDENT AND PARANOIA\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, October 31, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      The first day of November, is designated by some denominations, particularly the liturgical churches, as All Saints Day.  When we speak of saints, we may be speaking of  either of two different kinds of people, depending on our point of view.  One group includes those who have been formally canonized by the Church, having earned their halos, usually through intercessory miracles occurring after their very holy lives on earth.  The second group consists of more ordinary souls who may not be formally recognized as saints, but whose lives and faith stand out as an example to us all.  To some extent, the Church draws a distinction by designating the day after All Saints Day as  \u201cAll Souls Day.\u201d  I tend to blur the distinction between the two \"classes\u201d of saints. In New Orleans, where Roman Catholicism has shaped the culture, All Saints Day is taken pretty seriously.  People flock to our unique  above-ground cemeteries  to clean their family\u2019s tombs and vaults.  (The more literal minded folks say this is in preparation for All Souls Day.)  This year, that custom will take on an added poignancy because some of the cleaning is necessitated by damage from Katrina. I don\u2019t have any graves to spruce up, so I choose to observe All Saints Day by thinking fondly of the one real saint I knew:  my mother.  Okay, I know what you\u2019re thinking; everybody thinks his or her mother is a saint.  But my mother really is.  (She even has one miracle, but that\u2019s another story for another day.) Betty Bursley was born to an old New England family, a direct descendant of Mayflower pilgrims.  Her father was a landscape architect for the United States Park Service, and she grew up primarily in Cleveland and Richmond.  Education was valued in the family, and my mother earned a degree in biology from Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College.  During World War II, she met and married a handsome lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers,  Hugh F. Rankin .  After the war, Dad went back to school, and wound up becoming a professional historian.  Throughout graduate school and beyond, my mother worked (mostly clerical jobs), helped entertain Dad\u2019s professional colleagues, served as Dad\u2019s typist and most-trusted editor, and raised three sons.  She was not only our mother, but was also the best teacher any of us ever had.  There was little about the world around us that my mother could not explain and help us understand. Eventually, the family came to New Orleans, where Dad joined the faculty at Tulane University.  Faculty pay in the fifties being what it was, my mother needed a job, and she became the secretary for the newly formed Jazz Archive (now called the  William Ransom Hogan Archive of New Orleans Jazz ) at Tulane\u2019s Howard Tilton Memorial Library.  She took notes at jazz funerals and second-line parades, assisted the curators in conducting oral histories, and helped organized a priceless collection of recordings, sheet music, photographs, and memorabilia.  She developed a passion for the music and a genuine love for the musicians.  Despite no academic background in musicology, Mom eventually became an associate curator of the Archive. After retiring from the Archive, my mother (by that time known as \u201cBig Mama,\u201d a nickname she acquired partly because Dad had been dubbed \u201cBig Daddy\u201d by his graduate students) took on several volunteer positions with various groups.  In the early eighties, she heard about a fledgling community radio station,  WWOZ , which needed volunteers.  For the uninitiated, WWOZ plays a wide variety of genres, but specializes in the musical forms that help to define South Louisiana.  My mother started out typing letters and stuffing envelopes, but somebody soon realized the resource they had, and she was thrown in front of a microphone.  For the next several years, Big Mama hosted what became known as the \u201cMoldy Fig Jam,\u201d a popular 90-minute program of Traditional Jazz and Ragtime on Saturday mornings. Mom took enormous pleasure in sharing her love of New Orleans music, and included far more background on the musicians than could be found anywhere else on the radio dial.  After decades of being known as Hugh Rankin\u2019s wife, she was now an internationally known personality (WWOZ\u2019s web feed has made it a world-wide favorite). Of course, the fact that she was a nice person who had a knack for teaching others what she knew did not qualify her for sainthood.  The remarkable thing about Big Mama was the nature of the lessons she taught.  And the best way to explain that is to write about her parting lesson. During a heart operation in the eighties, Big Mama received some tainted blood, and contracted Hepatitis C.  It went undetected for years, until she eventually started having active liver disease.  My mother expressed no bitterness, and she blamed nobody.  She faced this problem as she faced everything in life, good or bad:  with equal parts optimism and acceptance. In late 1997, Big Mama\u2019s liver began to fail altogether, and she spent the next few months alternating between improving and falling into hepatic comas.  Whether she was conscious or comatose, my brothers and I, and often our wives, were at the hospital a lot:  reading to her, helping to feed her, or just spending time.  She had a spell in the middle when she was alert, happy, and as full of life as anyone could hope to be.  We talked for hours about lots of things:  philosophy, religion (Mom was a lifelong Presbyterian; I am an Episcopalian), music, politics, and whatever happened to be going on in the world.  It was important small talk, because no matter what plans we made, the unspoken reality was that she probably wasn\u2019t going to be coming home. Sure enough, Big Mama fell into another hepatic coma, from which she clearly wasn\u2019t going to come out.  A few days before she died, I got out the Bible from which we read during her last alert interval.  Struggling to figure out what to read to her, I went to the assigned readings of the day listed in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer I had left in her room.  One of the readings was the familiar exhortation by St. Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians: If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude.  It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. There could be no more fitting passage to describe my mother\u2019s relationship with her family, her friends, and the world around her.  I looked up and saw my mother sitting upright in bed nodding her head.  Her meaning was clear:  \u201cThat\u2019s it; that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d  She put her head back onto her pillow, still beaming a beatific smile.  That was the first time in almost a week that her head had been off of the pillow or that any expression could be discerned on her face.  It was the last time she communicated in any way. My mother passed away on February 24, 1998, as I held her hand and my wife, Sym, stroked her hair.  (In a last act of kindness, Big Mama held on until Sym could get there so I wouldn\u2019t be alone.)  Of all days, it was Mardi Gras morning.  We were at Touro Infirmary, a hospital just a block off of St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans.  Along the Avenue, families were gathered to celebrate life as it can only be celebrated in New Orleans.  I like to think Big Mama, hoping to second line one last time, wandered around until she found the  Irish Channel Corner Club  making their annual \u201cmarch\u201d downtown to the beat of the  Paulin Brothers Band .  I can only hope the band was playing \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In.\u201d\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.experienceneworleans.com/deadcity.htm", "http://www.tulane.edu/~lmiller/JazzHome.html", "http://www.wwoz.org/", "http://mardigrasdigest.com/html/walking_clubs_in_new_orleans.htm", "http://www.louisianamusicfactory.com/showoneprod.asp?TypeID=70&ProductID=878"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/all-saints-day.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ALL SAINTS DAY\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, October 27, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      One of the reasons I write this blog is to hear challenges that make me reconsider an opinion.  I maintain that nothing is worth believing in if it cannot withstand questioning. After writing \u201c Why ,\u201d I found myself in a lively dialog with  Michelle Dawson  who left comments to the post.  She invited me to review some materials, which I did.  Although those materials, impressive as they are, do not convince me that my wife and I are wrong in responding to our son\u2019s ASD with a biomedical intervention, the process has made me think a lot more about the decision-making process. My post was part of an unplanned \"blog swarm\" that  Ginger ,  Kyra , and I had addressing the propriety of our decisions to attempt \u201ccuring\u201d our children.  Ginger posed the  question  of whether an intervention may not only reduce the adverse impact of autism, but also change the child\u2019s personality.  Ms. Dawson feels that the question is irrelevant:  Autism has nothing to do with personality, any more than gender or sexual orientation or handedness do. That doesn\u2019t mean that parental interventions against the gender, orientation, or handedness of their offspring--for whatever reason--are just fine. . . . This whole non-argument arises from a lack of understanding of what autism is, of how autistic brains are different, and of what this means with respect to cognition (perception, attention, memory, intelligence, and learning).  Notice this has nothing to do with personality. My response to Ms. Dawson was to restate Ginger\u2019s question by asking if an intervention -- be it biomedical or behavioral -- ever diminished the cognitive gifts in an autistic child.  I then arrogantly provided a presumptive answer that I \u201ccertainly don't think we'll find anyone say they were diminished by an intervention.\u201d  After thinking about it some more, I am not so sure about the impact.  But I am still sure of the decision my wife and I made.   Autism is a complex thing that defies any real understanding.  Mental health professionals define  autism ,  Aspergers , and  PDD-NOS  by a constellation of deficits, a construct that may be too simplistic.  As a definitional tool, however, the DSM-IV-TR criteria are probably more accurate -- and are certainly more widely accepted -- than the proposition that autism is nothing more than a different way of thinking, in essence a genetic state of being.   In a comment to my last post, Anne made this point: I think a good example for you might be perseveration -- defined in the criteria as \u201crestricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities.\u201d It is treated as a dysfunction, with a couple of reasons usually being given:  it \u201cinterferes with learning\u201d and it bugs other people, especially when the special interest is one that is not widely shared.  Interventions are deployed to discourage perseveration. Yet maybe perseveration is part of autistic cognition.  Maybe autistic kids learn better by engaging in perseverative activities than by learning to suppress their desire to do them.  Learning driven by intense interest is much different (I would say better) than learning driven by forced compliance. Ms. Dawson and Anne focus on cognitive differences, and they may be correct in saying that is a part of autism.  But the clinical definitions of autism are not based on cognitive differences, but primarily by social deficits.     The parents who practice biomedical interventions, and I am certainly in that number, look upon autism spectrum disorders in primarily negative terms.  Members of the neurodiversity community tend to look upon it in a more positive, or at least neutral, light.  Perhaps we all are right, and we all are wrong.   My friend on the other side of the argument (and other side of the ocean),  Kevin , likes to say we are doing nothing but treating comorbidities.  Perhaps he is right, but many of us have seen enough to believe that treating those comorbidities seems to reduce the severity of the deficits by which our children have been diagnosed as being autistic.  If those deficits are completely remitted, can we really call them comorbidities?  Frankly, I don\u2019t care what we call them.  The more serious question asks whether positive traits, or \u201cgifts,\u201d or so entwined with the same processes that create the deficits that they can be lost as well. When one looks at  Dr. Temple Grandin , one sees an extraordinary example of how autism may shape a person\u2019s thinking in a positive manner, resulting in a real benefit to society.  Indeed, Dr. Grandin has contributed to bodies of knowledge in multiple fields, and the mental processes leading to those contributions may, at least to some extent, be attributed to her autism.  There\u2019s no way to know if Dr. Grandin would have retained those gifts had she undergone comprehensive biomedical or behavioral interventions as a child.  But we must consider the very real possibility that those gifts would have disappeared.  On the other hand, Ginger recently posted the  story of an adult on the spectrum  who is missing, and may be in harm\u2019s way, due in no small part to his autism.  No doubt that gentleman has positive gifts, but he is unable to communicate that to those around him. The fact is not all autistic children grow up to be high functioning.  But neither are all autistic children destined for a lifetime marked by significant impairment.  The problem is nobody can tell us at an early age which of our children will grow up to be a  Temple Grandin , a  Kathleen Seidel , or a  Michelle Dawson .   As parents we have to weigh the potential benefits of any intervention against the known risks.  As part of that weighing, we must also consider the fact that we might take something positive away from our children, and we must decide if the good we hope to achieve outweighs the gifts we may be taking away from our children. Ginger  received a couple of very interesting comments in response to her initial question.  Jackie M. said: Your question at the bottom struck home to me.  This summer we heard the wonderful news that my son no longer could be considered Autistic.  The one thing that I noticed was he no longer had that amazing ability to spell any word after hearing or seeing it once.  For example, at 2-1/2, a friend\u2019s father was over at our house while the boys were playing.  I have a magnetic board with letters.  My son picked up the letters and started to spell his son\u2019s name, which was a very long name. The man\u2019s jaw almost hit the floor. His son (same age) could only identify one letter in the alphabet and my son could spell about 20-30 words including his son\u2019s 8-letter name.  He no longer has that amazing ability.  He can spell but not only after seeing a word or hearing the letters once. Personally, I\u2019ll trade the super human spelling for a child that can tell me what he wants, what is wrong, how he feels, and what he did that day. And Angela wrote:  My experience has been that my son has become less savant-like with nutritional supplement therapy and Pivotal Response Training.  This time last year, he was constantly adding numbers and into spelling big-time (he was 4 then).  Today, he is very interested in play-dates and has become aware of friendships the other kids have. His personality has changed to become more social, more engaged, less inwardly focused.  He is also more willful -- which I view as a good thing.   I try to avoid discussing specifics of my son\u2019s ASD on this site, but I will say this.  He is at an age at which we have a pretty good idea of his strengths and his deficits.  And we have a very strong belief that there is far more to be gained by a successful intervention than there is to be lost. One of the more aggravating criticisms often directed at us is that we desperately seek a cure not for our children\u2019s autism but really for our own shattered dreams.  Nonsense!  As the father of two older, neurotypical kids, I can confidently state that I gave up on having my children live out my dreams a long time ago.  I simply want all of my children to live out their own dreams.  But I still must confess that I have one dream about my young son.  In my dream, he has reached the rebellious stage of adolescence.  He angrily confronts me, and he demands to know how he could possibly be the offspring of someone so thoughtless as to deprive him of an integral part of his personality.  Why, my son asks rhetorically, did I ever think it necessary to \u201ccure\u201d him; did I consider him \u201cdefective?\u201d  Without waiting for a response, my son storms out of the house the house and walks outside to his waiting friends, to whom he complains about how I just don\u2019t understand him the way his friends do.  If my son would only look to the front window of the house, he would see me peeking out from behind the curtain, listening to him interacting with his friends.  And he would see me grinning from ear to ear.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sentex.net/%7Enexus23/naa_02.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.thismom.com/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/does-autism-treatment-change.html", "http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm", "http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm", "http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/nos.htm", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/home.php", "http://trainland.tripod.com/temple.htm", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/autistic-man-missing-since-saturday.html", "http://trainland.tripod.com/temple.htm", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/", "http://www.sentex.net/%7Enexus23/naa_02.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/does-autism-treatment-change.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/why-part-2-postscript.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WHY, PART 2:  A POSTSCRIPT\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Tuesday, December 06, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      For months now I\u2019ve been trying to understand why there should be such a gulf between the neurodiversity community and the biomedical communities.  Of course, to call either group a \u201ccommunity\u201d is a bit of a misnomer.  There\u2019s enough diversity of thought (euphemism alert:  \u201cdiversity of thought = rancorous disagreements) that both sides claim ownership of the adage about herding cats.  But certainly the conflict between the two groups seems insurmountable at times. I have  opined before  that the differences in thought between the NDers and the biomeds is really just a matter of semantics, and it really comes down to a single word:  \u201ccure.\u201d I have tried in the past to explain that I don\u2019t think trying to help a child move past the more problematic aspects of autism is irreconcilable with supporting the dignity of autistics.  Sometimes, however, it\u2019s hard to be heard when the more extreme members of either community are shouting out absolutes.   One of the voices that sometimes cuts through the noise is that of Ian Parker.  I really don\u2019t know much about Ian, except that he occasionally visits this site and leaves great comments.  In response to a  recent post , and the comments it brought, Ian wrote the following.  I thought what he said was important enough to bring it out of the comments section and put it front and center.  After quoting a few of the folks who left comments, Ian wrote: I don\u2019t want to put words anyone\u2019s mouth, but it sounds to me like the authors of some of the comments in this post do not see autism as a disease (in some cases the quote is illustrative, in others I\u2019m also bringing in an interpretation of a pre-existing body of writing). The definition of disease I\u2019m using is \u201can impairment of the normal state of the living animal or plant body or one of its parts that interrupts or modifies the performance of the vital functions and is a response to environmental factors (as malnutrition, industrial hazards, or climate), to specific infective agents (as worms, bacteria, or viruses), to inherent defects of the organism (as genetic anomalies), or to combinations of these factors.\u201d Source: Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, \u00a9 2002 Merriam-Webster, Inc. The reason I bring this up is that I may be misinterpreting, but it seems to me that more than a few who subscribe to a ND POV often bundle together the ideas that a) autism is not a disease but another way of thinking, with b) if one believes in treatment for autism (as distinct from co-morbidities) then one is not being respectful, and c) that therefore one either wishes to deny autistics their rights or may influence autistics to feel that they are not deserving. If I\u2019m interpreting their words correctly then I have to disagree. On the first point, I would suggest that autism can be both a disease and another way of thinking. Some of what I\u2019ve read suggests that a common thread among autistics is a tendency to have an impaired ability (which is NOT the same as no ability) to carry out Emotional Coordination and Experience Sharing.  From Dr. Gutstein\u2019s \u201cSolving the Relationship Puzzle,\u201d pg. 33:  \u201cWhile typical children carry out Emotional Coordination effortlessly\u2026 it is actually a highly complex process, requiring the integration of a number of different brain centers.  Success requires rapid attention shifting, careful observation and evaluation of subtle emotional states, an awareness of personal space and internal reactions to a number of other elements.  If at any point even one of the many components does not function, the entire process of Emotional Coordination breaks down.\u201d  Presumably this at least occasional \u201cbreak down\u201d is responsible for some of the social impairments that many with autism face. If you interpret the condition described in the quote above as meeting the definition of a disease then autism could be classified as such, regardless of views of whether other symptoms (e.g., sensory integration difficulties, etc.) are part of the pathology or \u201cmerely\u201d co-morbidities.  I would argue that there\u2019s nothing pejorative in the above statement, and that the described condition DOES NOT a priori diminish other cognitive or reasoning capabilities.  Difficulty in integrating incoming information does not invalidate the thought processes of autistics, or render them more or less distinct, diverse, or valuable, regardless of whether the thought processes are influenced by genetics, environment, or both.  The above does suggest a disease state though. And Kev, just as you mentioned in posts this week that you fear an autism = mercury link may force certain types of treatment on your daughter, I fear that \u201cautism as merely an alternate state of being\u201d lets people off the hook for treating an expensive disease on the grounds that it is not a disease at all. For the record, my daughter is not part of an RDI program, although it is something that we (my wife and I -- our 29 month old daughter very much enjoys some of the activities but has yet to state an opinion) are interested in pursuing and are currently looking into. Second, implying that calling autism a \u201cdisease\u201d or suggesting treatment shows a lack of respect suggests that disease, treatment, and respect for the person cannot go together.  I think it would surprise and anger a lot of people to hear that the three cannot co-exist.  Are people with CF considered less worthy of respect?  How about MS?  Cancer?  Angelman Syndrome?  Down\u2019s Syndrome?  Depression?  All of the above are recognized as diseases.  Or is autism the only disease for which those afflicted are unworthy? There is a legitimate concern that some people may see any physical, mental or neurologically based disease as rendering a person less \u201cwhole\u201d or less \u201cworthy.\u201d  But the issue is with the person who holds such thoughts, not with the person who has the disease.  The answer is to educate and enlighten those who hold these opinions, not to deny that the disease exists and label it as an alternate way of being, giving people a way to ignore it. Third, the linkage is made between belief that autism is a disease and the lack of rights of an autistic person, through either denial by others or lack of assertiveness due to self-worth issues. My daughter is entitled to all of the same rights as anyone else, including the right to treatment (coupled with the right to not be subjected to unnecessary or risky treatments), the right to security of person, the right to an education, and the right to assistance (equality of opportunity) to enable her to become the best, happiest, and most self-actualized person she can be.  As a parent I'll do my best to teach her to stand up for herself and exercise those rights.  By recognizing her autism and challenging it, my goal is to give her opportunities and choices for her to make that she might not otherwise have.  I don\u2019t believe that this will change her personality or thought processes.  But I do believe that it will add to her capabilities.  Not doing all that I can -- if I believe that it will help her -- would be a denial of her rights. I will oppose anyone who seeks to deny her rights because they see her as unworthy or less deserving, for whatever reason, including her autism.  But I will also oppose those who feel that her right to treatment interferes with who \u201cthey\u201d think \u201cthey\u201d are or who my daughter should be. I respect others\u2019 right to treat or not treat, depending on their view of risk and effectiveness.  But it sounds like not all on the other \u201cside\u201d are willing to allow me the same latitude, implying that I am disrespectful or want to deny them their rights if I disagree with them. \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/12/ians-take.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t IAN\u2019S TAKE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Sunday, December 04, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      It\u2019s been quite a week in the autism blogosphere.  And at the center of the \u201cfirestorm\u201d (as  Kevin Leitch  called it) was none other than J.B. Handley, the co-founder of  Generation Rescue . Around the time I was trying to explain that I do not subscribe to everything said or done by Mr. Handley and Generation Rescue just because I have the audacity to actually say positive things about him and it, Mr. Handley\u2019s recent cyberprank came to light.  For those who have been away from their computer for the last week or so, Mr. Handley purchased domain names that were similar to the names of blog sites of  Orac ,  JP , and  Autism Diva .  The similarly named sites sent users to the  Generation Rescue  site.   After much howling and gnashing of teeth -- too much howling and gnashing in my opinion -- JB issued an apology to Autism Diva and relinquished one of the new domains to her, but retained the other new domains.  You can read JB\u2019s explanation for yourself -- and judge that explanation for yourself -- in the comments to  Ginger\u2019s post  on the subject.  As for myself, I will not judge JB or his actions one way or the other.   In general, I agree with Ginger\u2019s assessment of the man:   The picture that I am getting of Handley is of a well intentioned, pissed off bull in a china shop. He is mad about what was done, and is being done, to his, and other autistic children; and he is pushing back with his full weight to fix the problem. ... and he has a lot of weight to throw around.     I understand JB being pissed off; I\u2019m pissed off too at what happened to my son and the children of others I have come to know.  My anger tends to get channeled a little differently than JB\u2019s, but I certainly understand where his attitude comes from.  Still, there\u2019s no denying that JB, on occasion, has pushed the envelope of civility. Did he cross any lines by purchasing domain names that three bloggers chose to leave unprotected?  The on-line debate that sprung from this incident has included accusations of legal, or at least ethical, breaches.  Those accusations might be accurate if JB\u2019s intent was to deceive unsuspecting surfers into thinking they were visiting a blogger whose viewpoint is distinctly different from that featured on the Generation Rescue site.  I doubt, though, that was JB\u2019s intent.  He strikes me as being intelligent enough to understand that nobody is going to believe that Orac, JP, or Autism Diva would ever endorse the Generation Rescue site. That being the case, I see JB\u2019s little prank as being humorous, albeit a tad sophomoric. Speaking of humor that some might find sophomoric brings me to the other big event in our little corner of the Web:  the appearance of  The Proffit Motive .  All of a sudden a blog parody appeared, the name being an obvious nod to that noted defender of vaccines and thimerosal, Paul Offit.  One section, lampooning the owners of the former blog entitled supportvaccination.org, exceeds the boundaries of propriety and acceptable satire.  Other than that one section, however, the site is wickedly funny, and includes faux comments from stand ins for various familiar names.  The objectionable section of the parody managed to open the site up to great criticism, and the critics predictably placed the blame on Mr. Handley.  Never mind that JB denied any involvement.  And never mind that the satire of The Proffit Motive shows a bit more subtlety than is JB\u2019s style.  In the eyes of some, J.B. Handley has become the  de facto  cause of all things unsavory in the ongoing discussion of autism, its causes, and its treatment. J.B. Handley has become a much larger figure to those who disagree with the biomedical community than he is within the community.  He has become an obsession to many who ignore what some of us have to say, preferring to believe that we are all Generation Rescue clones who believe exactly the same thing.  Well, I am getting a little tired of being told what I believe.  As I have said on many occasions, I disagree with JB and Generation Rescue about the contention that autism is nothing more than a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning.  I believe that autism is autism, and is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  Nevertheless, it bears stating that I believe that the most prevalent environmental trigger for ASD in the recent past has been mercury, particularly in the form of thimerosal in vaccines.   With the \u201cmisdiagnosis\u201d theme being so prominent a part of the Generation Rescue site, and with JB\u2019s tactics and rhetoric being so extreme at times, some suggest that I should disassociate myself from JB.  The first time that was suggested, my immediate reaction was that there was no association to \u201cdis.\u201d  I have never met JB, I\u2019ve never spoken with him, and I\u2019ve never exchanged emails with him.  But it\u2019s really not that simple; there really is an association of sorts. First, the most obvious connection is that I have a link to the  Generation Rescue  site.  Frankly, that\u2019s not much of an association.  If you look at my links, I include several blogs that deal with ASD, and I doubt that you can find a whole lot of consistency of opinion among us.  I even include links to Kathleen Seidel\u2019s  neurodiversity site  and  Kev\u2019s blog , albeit in their own special section (primarily because I\u2019m not sure how they would feel being \u201cassociated\u201d with my other links).  All of my links are there for a simple reason; all add an important voice to the types of discussions we should be having.  That is, these voices would be heard if we all weren\u2019t too busy with silliness. So it\u2019s not just a link that creates an association with JB.  It\u2019s really a matter of us sharing a goal.  We both believe that our sons regressed needlessly into autism, and we both want to do something about it.  We may disagree on the nature of the problem, but we agree on a major contributing factor.  Moreover, we agree on the basic approach to intervening in our sons\u2019 disorder to try and alleviate the resulting dysfunction -- or as we sometimes call it, a \u201ccure\u201d -- although we might not follow the exact same protocols. JB and I might disagree on many particulars, and his style is certainly not mine, but there can be no denying an association.  That does not mean I condone everything he has done or might do.  It simply means that I will keep a link to his site, and I will keep the car\u2019s bumper decorated with the \u201cAutism is Reversible\u201d bumper sticker my wife picked up from a Generation rescue table at a conference.  It also means that if we ever meet, I will thank JB for what he brings to our struggle.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=309", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://oracknows.blogspot.com/", "http://www.supportvaccination.org/", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/11/orac-gets-punked.html", "http://drproffit.blogspot.com/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/home.php"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/12/mercurial-mr-handley-and.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE MERCURIAL MR.

{"date": "Sunday, December 11, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      With just two weeks to go before the big day, I\u2019ve had a real Christmasy weekend.  Last night was the firm Christmas party, and I managed to get through the evening without making an ass of myself.   Today we took the little fella to see Santa, and he waited patiently in lined to sit on the lap of the jolly old elf. I use things like  Santa pictures  to provide a visual record of my son\u2019s descent into autism, and the gradual decline of his autistic symptoms.  From the excited look on his face before his regression, to the blank expression of a little boy who would only stand in front of Mr. C, to the happy smile of a boy trying to forge a relationship with Santa.  A good picture just makes for a happier Christmas. We try to do Christmas right around the Rankin house.  Like many people in post-Katrina Louisiana, we decided to scale back our decorations a little.  That means it only took me one full day instead of two to string up the lights outside.  Although we have not done \u201cthe full Griswold,\u201d you can see our house from a pretty good distance at night. The radio stays tuned to holiday music, and we actively seek out Christmas movies on television.  Every year I add to a long list of Christmas movies I love.  From old favorites like  White Christmas  to newer movies like  Elf .  I\u2019ll sit and laugh with  National Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation  or get into a little more sentimental mood with  Love Actually .  I\u2019m still trying to figure out an appropriate reaction to  Bad Santa , but I think I liked it. There are five movies I consider classics, with at least one viewing of each being required for a complete Christmas season.  In reverse order my favorites are: 5.      Miracle on 34th Street   (1947) This one\u2019s been remade a couple of times.  Nothing can touch the original for two reasons:  Natalie Wood as the little girl struggling with what to believe and Edmund Gwenn as the real deal. 4.      It\u2019s a Wonderful Life Because NBC now owns the exclusive air rights to this movie, we don\u2019t see it quite as much as we used to.  It\u2019s worth a little extra effort to catch it.     3.      The Polar Express It\u2019s rare that a movie can become a classic from the moment it is released.  This one qualifies.  Believe. 2.      A Christmas Story In what other movie can you hear Santa utter the immortal words:  \u201cYou\u2019ll shoot your eye out, kid.\u201d 1.      Scrooge  (a/k/a  A Christmas Carol )  (1951) Dickens\u2019 classic tale of redemption has been made and remade more probably than any other story.  At least two of the versions have been entitled Scrooge, including my favorite, the 1951 movie starring Alistair Sim as the miser.  He never stoops to stereotypes playing Ebeneezer, and every moment rings true. The heart of Scrooge comes toward the end when Ebeneezer, for the first time in many years, decides to seek out the company of others.  He goes to the home of his nephew, Fred, to seek forgiveness and share in the joy of the day, but he isn\u2019t at all sure what reception he might find.  Scrooge is let into Fred\u2019s house by a young maid, a person that wouldn\u2019t have even registered on Scrooge\u2019s consciousness just 24 hours before.  Now he looks to her for encouragement, and it is only after she gives him a little nod, that Ebeneezer can walk into the room where his nephew\u2019s party is being held. The scene between Scrooge and the maid, in which no words are spoken, is among the finest 30 seconds of film ever presented.  That brief encounter reminds me that nobody is truly alone at Christmas.  All one has to do is reach out a little.

One of those reasons is that, as a lay person, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as giving unqualified expert opinions.  But even lay people are capable of understanding the basics of science, just as lay people are capable of understanding the basics of my field (law) given a little effort.  Parents of autistic children need to take note of ongoing scientific developments if they want to understand what is going on with their children.  A very interesting  new study  has been the subject of internet discussion the last couple of days that deserves mentioning.   Researchers, based at the University of Texas Health Science Center set out to determine if a link can be drawn between environmental releases of mercury and the incidence of autism.  The abstract reads as follows: The association between environmentally released mercury, special education and autism rates in Texas was investigated using data from the Texas Education Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. A Poisson regression analysis adjusted for school district population size, economic and demographic factors was used. There was a significant increase in the rates of special education students and autism rates associated with increases in environmentally released mercury. On average, for each 1000lb of environmentally released mercury, there was a 43% increase in the rate of special education services and a 61% increase in the rate of autism. The association between environmentally released mercury and special education rates were fully mediated by increased autism rates. This ecological study suggests the need for further research regarding the association between environmentally released mercury and developmental disorders such as autism. These results have implications for policy planning and cost analysis. The implications of this study, scheduled for future publication in  Health & Place , are obvious.  If environmental mercury has a casual connection to autism, then shouldn\u2019t the same hold true for the injection of thimerosal into our children?  Critics will argue that a possible link to environmental mercury discharges diminishes the impact of thimerosal by showing an alternate causal source.  (The underlying causation theory of this study is that the burning of fossil fuels discharges inorganic mercury into the air, which, after being deposited onto soil or water, is converted into toxic methylmercury by chemical reactions or exposure to bacteria.)  On the other hand, common sense (there I go again, resorting to common sense) dictates that if environmentally released mercury poses a danger, wouldn\u2019t mercury injected directly into children be even more dangerous?  And assuming the danger posed by mercury in general, it\u2019s hard to argue against thimerosal being the most pervasive source of mercury exposure, at least prior to the much ballyhooed, and debateable, cut-back of thimerosal in vaccines.   I have often stated that autism is too complex a problem for us to oversimplify explanations for a cause of the recent ASD epidemic in the United States.  But a hypothesis that mercury exposure, particularly from childhood vaccines, is a big piece of the puzzle makes sense to me.  So when I see a study that links mercury and autism, I take note.   The Texas study is not going to be immune from criticism.  I expect that we will see some commentary decrying the use of a Poisson regression analysis.  I am not a statistician, and I would certainly invite any comments from those who are better versed in that discipline than I am.  That being said, my understanding is that a Poisson distribution predicts probabilities of occurrence based on average rates in a discrete time period.  If I understand the Texas study, the regression was used to account for demographic differences between various school districts included in the statistics.  But the use of any regression analysis opens up the study to claims of bias. Methodology aside, the real criticism we may expect is that the study can only show association and cannot show causation.  That is a criticism with which the authors of the paper agree: . . . these results indicate that the association between mercury release and school district special education rates was completely accounted for by increased rates of autism.  This indicates that, in Texas, the increase in special education rates attributable to environmental mercury can be explained by increases in autism. The results of this study are consistent with our prior nation-wide study where an association between various developmental disabilities and environmentally released mercury was observed at the state level (unpublished manuscript). However, the results of this report should be interpreted with caution for a number of reasons.  First, this is an ecological study that precludes interpretation at the individual level. We have used aggregate units in this analysis to investigate differential rates of autism as a function of pounds of mercury at the county level.  While we properly addressed the potentially biasing effects of clustering (school districts nested within counties) by utilizing appropriate analytic methods (e.g. multilevel-analysis), individual data are required to make a better case for the observed associations and their interpretations.  Nevertheless, ecological studies of this type are often an important first step in identifying subsequent areas of investigation. Second, a causal association between environmentally released mercury and developmental disorders cannot be determined from this cross-sectional data. Data availability permitting, future studies could investigate this association by using longitudinal data where changes in mercury levels over time may be used as a predictor of the rate of change in developmental disorders over time.  Third, we should consider that school-based administrative autism data, such as these, are only a proxy for true community prevalence.  However, these autism rates are most likely biased downward. R.F. Palmer, et al,  Environmental Mercury Release, Special Education Rates, and Autism Disorder: An Ecological Study of Texas. My own reservation with the Texas study is the same problem that any statistical analysis has.  It cannot prove causation.  Indeed, I would be hypocritical if I did not acknowledge the weaknesses of a statistical analysis like this one after so often criticizing the epidemiological studies relied upon by those who deny a connection between vaccines (particularly those containing thimerosal) and the triggering of ASD because the input data can be too easily manipulated -- by either design or error -- to be a reliable indicator of causation.  There is no such thing as a perfectly designed analysis as long as the conclusions depend on arbitrary decisions concerning what data to use, and how to use it.   So as enticing as the Texas results are, let\u2019s not overstate the case.  The study is no more than what the authors call it:  \u201ca necessary first step in identifying plausible contributing factors of risk for developmental disabilities.\u201d  I could certainly quibble with the use of the term \u201cfirst step,\u201d as I believe the first steps have already been taken.   On the other hand, let\u2019s not understate the case either.  The Texas study is an important step toward gaining an understanding how a combination of genetics and environmental factors can trigger ASD; it\u2019s another piece of the puzzle.  It cannot be ignored; it must be followed up.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=16338635&query_hl=1", "http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/30519/description#description"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/12/enviromental-releases-of-mercury-and.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ENVIROMENTAL RELEASES OF MERCURY AND AUTISM\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, December 22, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      The reaction of NBC Chairman Bob Wright and his wife to their grandson\u2019s autism was the same reaction many of us have; they decided to do something about it.  Of course, the Wrights have more resources at their disposal than most of us.  One thing that happened was a week of special reports several months ago on the  NBC Nightly News  and  Today , which many felt gave too little exposure to the ongoing mercury controversy and biomedical treatments (with others, no doubt, feeling that any mention was too much).  The other contribution by the Wrights was to found  Autism Speaks , an organization that, thanks to its exposure on NBC, quickly became a fund-raising powerhouse. Despite statements supporting research for biomedical interventions, Autism Speaks has, until recently, said little about environmental insults as a possible trigger for autism.  Many saw this as an indication of its founder\u2019s likely hesitation to offend the pharmaceutical industry that provides a major source of revenue for NBC.  Perhaps those who thought that may have been a little hasty in coming to their opinions. Autism Speaks recently issued a very balanced  statement  concerning a possible connection between mercury and autism.  That statement reads, in part: The body of evidence gathered through epidemiologic research to date does not currently support a causal relationship between thimerosal in childhood vaccines and autism risk.  However, it is very difficult for even the best epidemiologic study to rule out the existence of small susceptible subgroups of children with autism in whom thimerosal exposure may have played a causal role.  Unfortunately, there are currently no means of identifying individuals with increased mercury susceptibility nor are there proven methods allowing researchers to separate individuals with autism into groups more or less likely to have different sets of causes. The thimerosal question has highlighted a number of points whose further consideration should significantly advance autism research.  First, although genes are believed to play a major role in autism, more attention needs to be paid to mechanisms where genes exert their influence by altering susceptibility to environmental exposures and mechanisms by which environmental exposures may alter gene expression.  Second, there is a great need, when studying environmental exposures, to find ways of identifying highly susceptible individuals.  And, third, because autism is a complex condition possibly having multiple causes, researchers need to find reliable ways to distinguish autism subgroups with distinct etiologies. I interpret that statement to express an opinion that the science is not yet at a point where a causal connection may be drawn, which, admittedly, implies that a connection may not be there to discover.  Yet the statement also emphasizes the key element of genetic susceptibility that has not received enough attention from scientist for the hypothesized connection to be fully explored. In its statement, Autism One spells out what it intends to do about helping us all move closer to resolving the controversy: Autism Speaks plans to strongly support a multidisciplinary research agenda on environmental exposures and autism.  We believe that projects acknowledging the role of gene-environment interaction and incorporating markers of exposure susceptibility and etiologic heterogeneity will be the most productive in the long-term.  Given present knowledge, there is a fairly broad array of neurotoxic environmental exposures worthy of further study but, moving forward, the type and timing of exposures under investigation should continue to comport with emerging developments in autism neurobiology. I feel the above expression of commitment should be welcomed.  We need to look at the processes at work rather than focusing on a single hazard.  Moreover, approaching the issue from the standpoint of genetic susceptibility should lead to a complete answer that will help end the controversy.  I happen to think the role of mercury -- including thimerosal exposure -- will be clearly implicated by the type of research Autism One suggests, but the main point is to find the truth. Autism One is now  inviting researchers to submit grant proposals  to study a wide array of questions: We recognize the need for new approaches to making an objective diagnosis of autism, studies to explore exposures that might trigger autism in susceptible populations, and the applications of the latest technologies to identify the basis for familial susceptibility to autism.  Intensive behavioral therapies are generally accepted to improve the outcome of autism in some children, especially when begun in early life.  Studies to build on these successes and to better understand the predictors of who may or may not respond to behavioral therapy, and what augmentations to current therapies might improve the success rate, are certainly appropriate.  These are a few examples of areas that would benefit from additional investigations. Autism One\u2019s stated interest in looking at the complex interaction of genetics and environment is laudable.  Here\u2019s hoping they follow all the leads to find the truth.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/mercury_autism_policy_statement.php", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/inthenews/autism_research_grants.php"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/12/christmas-gift-from-autism-speaks.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM AUTISM SPEAKS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 20, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      Today our son\u2019s kindergarten class held its Christmas program -- and yes, it was called a \u201cChristmas\u201d program and not a \u201cHoliday\u201d program.  The children, dressed like cowboys and cowgirls for a Wild West Christmas, approached the microphone in groups of two or three and recited little lines in between songs sung by the entire class.   When it came time for his lines, our little man performed like a champ.  He walked up with the two little girls he was teamed with, and recited his part without a hitch, albeit with the articulation problems that make his speech a little difficult to understand for the uninitiated: Next to the chimney we sit and wait, We hope that Santa won\u2019t be late. Some hang stockings, but we put boots, To be filled with sweets and horns that toot. Not only did he get all the words out, just as we had rehearsed so many times, but he even pulled the mike a little closer to him and stayed a few seconds longer than his friends to relish the spotlight a little.  My son has clearly inherited my proclivities to hamdom. The songs were another story.  From the first song, it became clear that our boy was over-excited.  Instead of singing and dancing along with his classmates, he stood at the end of the line and stimmed.  Apparently, our son\u2019s excited inability to fully participate was anticipated, for his aide was sitting on the floor adjacent to the line, and he sat out most of the musical numbers in her lap. Being the parent of an autistic child in a mainstream classroom tends to make one defensive.  I stood poised to answer any ignorant comments or inappropriate eye-rolling with Kristina\u2019s deceptively simple explanation of \u201c my son has autism .\u201d  As it turns out, explanations were unnecessary.   To be sure, our son elicited more than his share of smiles and chuckles from the assembled parents, but I detected no hint of mean-spiritedness.  Instead, it seemed like every person in the room was rooting for our little boy.  How in the name of Father Christmas did we end up in such a pocket of enlightenment?  After thinking about it awhile, the answer was obvious. From the very beginning of the school year, our teacher made sure that the other children understood their classmate\u2019s \u201cdifference.\u201d  On occasion, we\u2019ve heard from other parents how much their kids talk about our son, and we\u2019ve never been sure how to take that.  But now we know.   The other parents of the class have been getting lessons in compassion from their children.  Those children accept our son as one of them.  And their parents are not going to be caught being less mature than the average kindergartner.   Despite a  spirit of cooperation  on the part of our local school system, my wife and I are still struggling to get our son the services he needs to realize his potential.  Much of the problem appears to be that the special education personnel seem unprepared to deal with the level of autism -- both quantitative and qualitative -- we now see in our schools.  It then becomes incumbent upon the parents to become the specialists, and educate the educators about what needs to be done.  That process can become frustrating.  Until I see the process fail, however, I\u2019m not prepared to say that our local school district has become mired in what  Tina Giovanni  calls the \u201cepidemic of denial.\u201d In the meantime, we\u2019ve been given a glimmer of Christmas hope, not by the special education teachers and specialists, but by an extraordinary kindergarten teacher and the children of her class.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/09/codeword_msha_6.html", "http://autism911.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/12/learning-from-children.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t LEARNING FROM CHILDREN\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      For a while back in late August and early September, this autism blog turned into a hurricane blog, chronicling my family\u2019s  evacuation  from South Louisiana,  our time away , and our  return .  Around here we still live with Katrina every day.  I\u2019m lucky enough to live in a part of the New Orleans area that got up and running pretty quickly, although \u201cup and running\u201d is a relative concept. Our area\u2019s struggle to rebuild is being played out in the national press.  The other day, the  New York Times  printed an  editorial  noting the critical point in time at which New Orleans finds itself.  The City and State need to devise a real blueprint for the future, but all efforts will be meaningless unless the federal government is willing to not just rebuild, but improve the levee system to withstand a category-five hurricane. Rebuilding the physical city is only half the battle for New Orleans.  The other half is to recapture the culture of the City.  No other place has the unique mixture of music, food, and soul of New Orleans.  And no other City celebrates Mardi Gras the way we do.  Some of the traditions were imported from elsewhere (primarily Mobile, Alabama), but New Orleans is the place everyone thinks of when Mardi Gras is mentioned. Mardi Gras is the culmination of the liturgical season of Epiphany.  Starting on January 6th ( i.e. , twelfth night of Christmas), various organizations in town start the celebration with balls and banquets that will last through the season that ends on the day before Ash Wednesday.  (Mardi Gras literally translates as \u201cFat Tuesday,\u201d meaning it is the last day for fatted meat before entering the Lenten season of penitential fasting.)  Technically, only the last day is Mardi Gras, and the rest of the season is referred to as \u201cCarnival.\u201d  But modern usage has now bestowed the tile of Mardi Gras on the entire season.   Carnival kicks into high gear in the week-and-a-half before the big day, and the streets are filled with parades put on by private clubs called \u201ckrewes.\u201d  We line the streets to listen to high school bands play with a beat that could not be reproduced anywhere else, and to catch beads and trinkets thrown by float riders.  We place our small children in home-made seats atop step ladders so they can see, and more importantly be seen by the riders who will shower the youngsters with goodies.   The parades form the centerpiece of the celebration, but they are not the whole story.  On Mardi Gras itself, \u201cmarching\u201d clubs make their way downtown from the Irish Channel, stopping at various watering holes.  The \u201cIndian tribes\u201d of the African American community make their own way through the streets, wearing feathered costumes that rank among the finest folk art in the nation, and raising their voices in chants that helped to form the unique brand of New Orleans funk that contributed to the development of rock and roll.    And everywhere, throughout the season, families and friends gather simply to share a good time in New Orleans style. In 1979, the parades were cancelled due to a police strike in New Orleans, but Mardi Gras went on in a hundred different ways all over the City.  That was the year we realized that Mardi Gras was not something we did, but was part of who we are.  As we say down here, you know you\u2019re a New Orleanian if you think purple, green, and gold (the Mardi Gras colors) actually look good together. Many people -- including a large number of \u201crefugees\u201d who have not yet been able to return home -- are saying that New Orleans cannot afford Mardi Gras this year when so much of the City needs fixing.  It\u2019s an easy argument to make, and it makes perfect sense.  That is, it makes perfect sense for anyplace other than New Orleans.   Obviously, things will be different.  Mayor Nagin, who understands all too well that celebrating as we have before makes little sense, has ordered a scaled-back Carnival season as far as parades go.  But if we had no parades at all, New Orleans will still observe Mardi Gras.  Chris Rose, the great columnist for the  Times-Picayune   explains it all  better than I can.  Before you say you can\u2019t understand why we would want to celebrate anything, read what he has to say.  Let me know if you don\u2019t understand all of the local references, and I\u2019ll gladly explain.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/opinion/11sun1.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fEditorials", "http://www.nola.com/rose/t-p/index.ssf?/base/living-0/1134457657226780.xml"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/12/some-hurricanes-wont-go-away-but-new.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SOME HURRICANES WON\u2019T GO AWAY (But New Orleans is still New Orleans)\n\t \n    "},

Well, what a year this has been! In this past year, Sym and I have seen our little boy make great strides in overcoming the obstacles imposed by his autism.  He still has a way to go in his recovery, but he will get there. Five months ago I started blogging after having spent a couple of months visiting other sites.  I got into this based on the arrogant supposition that I had a lot to say.  Very soon after getting this site up and running, I found that I had a lot to learn.  To all those who stopped by and kept the conversation going, I extend my sincere thanks whether or not you agreed with me. Of course, the biggest event for my family this last year was Hurricane Katrina.  To those who gave their good wishes and prayers while we were refugees, you have my eternal gratitude.  As it turned out, my wife and I were extremely lucky in that we had jobs and a relatively intact home waiting for us, but the evacuation was (and the ongoing recovery for this region is) nonetheless frightening.  While we were away, the computer became our lifeline.  You helped us more than you can imagine.

That many, if not most, of my resolutions will be broken in a relatively short time does not necessarily imply a lack of dedication to being better.  The simple truth is, resolutions are based on the world we faced in the last year.  Each new year brings challenges that we simply cannot visualize in advance.

But there really was no argument that the numbers can\u2019t really be considered a reliable indicator of autism prevalence in California.  What I found interesting is how the conversation steered itself to both fears that the decreasing numbers would be used to cut needed services, and the explanation that changes in the way the services are being delivered actually accounts for the downward \u201ctrend.\u201d As ever, we can count on one issue to unify all parents of ASD kids:  the less-than-adequate delivery of services, particularly by our schools.  I wrote before about a  positive change of attitude  we encountered in our local school system, but  attitude doesn\u2019t get the job done .  The problem is getting real assistance to the teachers and aides on the front lines. The universality of this problem was underlined recently by an article from across the big pond.   The Scotsman  reported on a study by Glasgow University to assess the implementation of a mainstreaming policy.  That study showed that \u201cnearly a third of local authorities are having difficulty including children with special needs in mainstream secondary schools.\u201d  Of course, that should not have been a surprise considering that \u201cfewer than half of Scotland\u2019s councils had carried out the necessary preparatory work in order to implement the policy effectively.\u201d The frightening part of the Scottish report was its drawing a link between an increase in the numbers of autistic students and a rise in \u201cindiscipline\u201d in the classroom: The report said: \u201cChildren on the autistic spectrum may exhibit behaviour that is incongruous and challenging, and which severely disrupts teaching and learning. \u201cIt is possible that the perceived rise in the incidence of challenging behaviour in schools, and indeed in the incidence of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, is related to the reported increase in the number of children on the autistic spectrum.\u201d One council official told researchers that the worst part of the mainstreaming policy was the \u201cinsufficient recognition of the challenge facing schools in dealing with behavioural issues\u201d. The article also cited a recent report by the General Teaching Council for Scotland that made a similar link: Teachers said they were not given enough support to deal with pupils with behavioural difficulties, and warned that some of the indiscipline displayed by children with special needs affected the learning of their classmates. Sadly, the schools seem to be looking on the problem as a failing of autistic children rather than a failing to address the needs of autistic children who are being mainstreamed.  Still I was struck by the Scottish teachers\u2019 insistence that much of the problem lay in inadequate support. Inadequate support is something my son\u2019s teacher, aides, and principal understand all too well.  And their situation is not unique; I hear similar complaints from nearly everywhere.  Our teachers are simply overwhelmed with the challenges presented by autistic students. That prompts me to ask:  why are teachers suddenly overwhelmed?  Did teachers suddenly get stupid?  Or has there really been either an increase in the numbers of autistic children entering our schools or a qualitative leap in the severity of autism in students?\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=63402006"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/01/does-this-sound-familiar.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, January 07, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Soon after the death of Abubakar Tariq Nadama, I wrote about the  rush to judgment  that was going on by both sides of the chelation debate.  There were those that wanted to blame the medical establishment for not fully supporting the admittedly experimental treatments many of us use.  On the other side, many proclaimed that the tragedy proved that chelation -- in any form -- was inherently dangerous and anyone who said anything at all positive about such procedures was an accomplice to murder. What I said back then was: I still think we in the biomedical movement have a lot of questions to ask ourselves. But before we can even formulate those questions, we need to have more information. Was Abubakar\u2019s death the result of an anaphylactic reaction, hypocalcemia, or some yet-to-be-thought-of reason? If hypocalcemia was the direct cause of death, was it brought on by a failure to replentish the child\u2019s minerals, including calcium, with supplements, or did the doctor use Disodium EDTA rather than Calcium EDTA? Was the proper dosage used? Did the doctor perform all appropriate pre-procedure checks? Was the child properly monitored in between chelation procedures? When we have the answer to all those questions, we\u2019ll have a better idea of whether anyone needs to bear the blame for this tragedy. In the meantime, let\u2019s try to respect a family that needs to mourn a child. Let\u2019s all shelve our anger for a while. And let\u2019s honor the Nadama family\u2019s mourning by redoubling our own efforts to protect our own children. That includes learning all we can and being equal partners with our doctors. Unfortunately, those questions remain. In the last couple of days, the Pennsylvania media\u2019s coverage of the release of findings by the Allegheny County Coroner concerning the Nadama case.  The  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  reported the following: The manner of death of Abubakar Tariq Nadama, of Monroeville, has been listed as accidental while the investigation continues. The findings released by the Butler County coroner\u2019s office don't say whether the treatment itself is dangerous or the child died from the way the treatment was administered. In layman\u2019s terms, the administration of ethylene diamine tetra-acetate, commonly known as chelation, resulted in a lack of oxygen to the brain as well as irreversible heart damage, said Allegheny County Deputy Coroner Ed Strimlan. The Allegheny County morgue conducted the autopsy on the child at the request of Butler County Coroner Bill Young. \u201cWe determined there\u2019s a direct correlation between the EDTA and the lack of oxygen to the brain and the heart muscle damage. It\u2019s a total package, based on the autopsy, the histology [tissue sampling] and the toxicology [blood sampling],\u201d Mr. Strimlan said. Note that the coroner\u2019s report does not state any opinions on the efficacy of EDTA chelation, nor does the media give any details about the manner in which Dr. Kerry performed the chelation prcedure. Despite the lack of what I would consider pretty important information, a couple of bloggers I have respectfully disagreed with in the past, but both of whom I have a relatively cordial relationship with, have regrettably restarted the parade of anger.  Kevin Leitch  had this to say: Now we know for sure that Chelation did play a role in a young boys death -- a boy who\u2019s dead solely because he was autistic -- I invite commenter\u2019s from an anti-vax, anti-thiomersal, pro-chelation perspective to call for investigations into Dr Roy Kerry under who\u2019s treatment Tariq died and to call for Rashid Buttar to exercise more care. Okay Kev, you\u2019re on.  I\u2019m not sure whether I fit into any or all of those categories, or that those categories are even relevant.  Talking about vaccines or thimerosal seems a little off-base because this young man was apparently being chelated for lead rather than mercury.  Susceptibility to lead that can arguably aggravate autistic symptoms, may -- and I emphasize the word \u201cmay\u201d -- be related to immunological problems that originated with mercury in vaccines, but the connection is indirect.  Moreover, I do not advocate any particular therapy because each child\u2019s condition is too unique for there to be a one-size-fits-all protocol.  But inasmuch as I\u2019m usually thrown into those groups, what the heck, I\u2019ll issue the calls.   I hereby call for a complete investigation into the circumstances surrounding the treatment of Abubakar Tariq Nadama by Dr. Roy Kerry.  We need to know exactly what was in that IV.  We need to know what protocol was being followed.  We need to know what other factors were present in the patient\u2019s history that might bear on what happened, and whether Dr. Kerry paid enough attention to any such factors.  Until we know, however, we\u2019re all just talking though our hats. And I\u2019ll go even farther than asking Dr. Buttar to exercise care.  I call upon every doctor who comes near our children to exercise the highest degree of care humanly possible.  But that really has nothing to do with whether chelation should be considered as an acceptable protocol; rather, that call is for practitioners and parents to understand what needs to be done to perform any and all procedures, including chelation, safely.   The other blogger I mentioned was the renowned skeptic,  Orac , who was, not surprisingly, more pointed in his post: No doubt chelation advocates will cry foul, but it looks as though the autopsy definitely indicates that chelation therapy killed the boy. Given the circumstances of the boy\u2019s death, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the cause was almost certainly hypocalcemia due to EDTA leading to cardiac arrest.  At the time, I was afraid that the autopsy findings might not reflect EDTA as the cause of death, mainly because deaths from sudden cardiac arrest due to acute electrolyte abnormalities don\u2019t always produce concrete findings that let the pathologist pin down the exact cause.  Such a result would have given the chelationists an \u201cout\u201d to claim that it wasn\u2019t the EDTA that killed Tariq.  Fortunately, that didn\u2019t happen in this case.  Too bad the parents are highly unlikely to sue Dr. Roy Kerry, the ENT doctor turned alternative medicine practitioner, because he wouldn\u2019t have a prayer of winning a malpractice suit against him.  (If doctors in this country can be sued and lose for bad outcomes that aren\u2019t their fault, one hopes that someone like Dr. Kerry can be sued for bad outcomes that are his fault.)  Maybe a big settlement or a big malpractice judgment against one (or, preferably more) of these autism chelationists would be what it would take to cool their love of this particular ineffective autism therapy somewhat. I don\u2019t want to argue semantics with Orac, but saying it was chelation that caused this death is way oversimplified.  There are so many methods of chelation that the real issue is what was it about this particular instance of chelation that caused the problem. Let\u2019s focus on IV-EDTA.  Among those practitioners using it to chelate for lead in autistic patients, there is a difference in opinion as to whether a push or a more gradual drip is more appropriate.  But the one thing nearly every doctor performing the procedure agrees on is that Calcium EDTA should be used rather than Disodium EDTA.  This is not exactly news, it has long been known that using the latter  can lead to fatal hypocalcemia .   There have been many unverified rumors that Dr. Kerry was using Disodium EDTA rather than Calcium EDTA.  I hate to rely on rumors, and with various legal and administrative investigations pending, the facts are not likely to be made public any time soon.  That being said, the use of the wrong substance is the most obvious explanation for what happened.   If Dr. Kerry did indeed use Disodium EDTA, the problem is not with the protocol; the problem is a doctor who didn\u2019t follow the protocol.  It would be a matter of negligence -- medical malpractice in other words -- rather than a procedure being unreasonably dangerous per se. If Dr. Kerry made such a basic error as using Disodium EDTA rather than Calcium EDTA, he would, as Orac says, be subject to a lawsuit.  (It may be a little off-topic, but I can\u2019t help but observe that Orac\u2019s reasoning that liability concerns may help deter malpractice is similar to the best argument against eliminating liability for vaccine manufacturers.)  The choice to take private legal action, however, lies with the Nadama family, and not with Orac or me.  Discussing the relative pros and cons of filing a lawsuit would take far too long.  I can only trust that Dr. and Mrs. Nadama will make the right choice for their family. Whenever we discuss personal experiences that lead us to believe in a connection to particular toxic insults, like thimerosal in vaccines, live viruses, or lead exposure and the onset of autism, or when we relate positive experiences regarding biomedical treatments, the response is often that the  plural of anecdote  is not evidence.  It\u2019s funny how the same people that shout out that mantra are now willing to base their argument about the safety of a class of procedures on a single incident. In an exchange of emails I had today with our friend, Mary Webster, she raised an analogous situation of a transplant surgeon who failed to compare the blood types of the recipient and donor.  That failure was fatal to the patient.  The failure to follow the simplest and most basic of procedures does not mean that organ transplantation should not be preformed in appropriate cases, but it does underline the need to follow all the right procedures.  I think that\u2019s a pretty apt analogy. I truly hope that the whole story will come out someday, and that we can all learn something.  For now, though, we should all resist the urge to pass judgment.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06006/633541.stm", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=317", "http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2006/01/update-on-abubakar-tariq-nadama.html", "http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000801/545.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/01/rush-to-judgment-revisited.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT REVISITED\n\t \n    "},

Every parent of an autistic child, every special-ed teacher  (every teacher for that matter), every school therapist, every principle, every district special-ed coordinator, and particularly every school superintendent, should read Tina Giovanni\u2019s blog, now retitled  Autism:  The Epidemic of Denial .

SquareGirl  is a more recent -- and most welcome \u2013 addition to the bloggosphere.  Her posts are somewhat less episodic than Tina\u2019s, and she covers a lot of ground in addition to autism and education.  When she tells of her experiences with her students, it is clear to see that she brings the same creativity, humor, and love to her career that she brings to her writing.  Read her  latest post  in which she wisely speaks of what she learns from her students. Both of these teachers understand that there is no one formula that works for every autistic child; each student requires an individual approach.  And both of these teachers fight for our children.

I say \u201cseems\u201d because the nature of the statistics kept by the California Department of Developmental Services limits their value, as is discussed by Ginger in her post and in the comments.  A well-designed epidemiological study might shed more light on whether we\u2019re seeing a real trend (although epidemiology is a poor indicator of causation).  Unfortunately, we have yet to see a well-designed study in California or anywhere else. What makes the California DDS statistics so interesting is that -- unlike most of the epidemiological studies we have seen in the past -- these numbers compare apples to apples on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  So while the new report doesn\u2019t provide any answers, it definitely raises the question of what may be causing the apparent trend.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      A  few posts ago , I revisited the tragic death of Abubakar Tariq Nadama, an autistic child who was stricken while undergoing chelation with intravenous EDTA.  My purpose was not to extol the virtues of chelation, or any particular species of chelation, as I have never considered it my place to recommend any particular protocol.  Indeed, every case of autism presents a unique clinical situation, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  But in some cases, chelation may well be a component of a comprehensive program. My real purpose in revisiting a painful incident was to critique opinions that the tragedy proved that all chelation is unreasonably dangerous.  Because one of chelation\u2019s  most vocal internet critics  expressed a reasonable opinion that the direct cause of death was hypocalcemia, I took pretty seriously the rampant rumors that the treating physician, Dr. Roy Kerry, mistakenly used Disodium EDTA rather than Calcium EDTA.  Although I ordinarily believe it wise to avoid spreading rumors, it seemed the most likely explanation for hypocalcemia.  Moreover, the rumor\u2019s liklihood provided reason enough not to express firm opinions about the lessons to be learned until we knew the full truth.  It now appears that the rumor was true. The  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  reports that the autopsy report was obtained and reviewed by Dr. Mary Jean Brown, chief of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The CDC is not generally known for its endorsement of the hypothesized link between heavy metal toxicity and autism.  Nor can Dr. Brown, a recognized authority on chelation, be considered a proponent of chelation as a treatment for autism (as is apparent from the article).  Despite any reservations Dr. Brown may have regarding the efficacy of chelating autism patients, she does not place the blame for this death on chelation itself, but rather on the wrong form being EDTA used: \u201cIt\u2019s a case of look-alike/sound-alike medications,\u201d she said yesterday.  \u201cThe child was given Disodium EDTA instead of Calcium Disodium EDTA. The generic names are Versinate and Endrate.  They sound alike.  They\u2019re clear and colorless and odorless.  They were mixed up.\u201d The article indicates an opinion by Dr. Brown, that \u201cif it were administered accurately, the procedure would be harmless.\u201d  That statement is debatable.  We must never ignore the fact that chelation, like most medical procedures, carries a degree of risk.  And that risk must be carefully analyzed and weighed before chelation is considered.   Like any prudent parent, I want to see appropriate clinical trials conducted to determine both the efficacy and specific safety of various forms of chelation for treatment of autism in cases in which metal toxicity appears to have played a role.  But it is worth noting that Dr. Brown, described by the Post-Gazette as \u201cone of the nation\u2019s foremost experts in chelation therapy,\u201d obviously believes the relative risk to be the same regardless of whether autism is involved: Dr. Brown said the same mix-up happened in two other recent cases: a 2-year-old girl in Texas who died in May during chelation for lead poisoning and a woman from Oregon who died three years ago while receiving chelation for clogged arteries. Dr. Brown said that in each case, the blood calcium level was below 5 milligrams. Normal is between 7 and 9. The correct chelation agent -- Calcium Disodium EDTA -- would not have pulled the calcium from the bloodstream, she said. . . . She said it is well known within the medical community that Disodium EDTA should never be used as a chelation agent.  She quoted from a 1985 CDC statement: \u201cOnly Calcium Disodium EDTA should be used.  Disodium EDTA should never be used ... because it may induce fatal hypocalcemia, low calcium and tetany.\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt that this was an unintended use of Disodium EDTA.  No medical professional would ever have intended to give the child Disodium EDTA,\u201d Dr. Brown said. So it appears that I was right to urge waiting for facts before making broad generalizations.  But it gives me no pleasure to be right.  No matter what caused this tragedy, the Nadama\u2019s loss remains.  The way any of us can honor their grief is to learn from what happened.   The knowledge that the evidence now shows this incident to be a single case of malpractice rather than an inherent and fatal problem in the protocol will not stop the controversy.  There will still be voices screaming of the dangers, although their anger is truthfully less about the dangers of chelation and more about the audacity of using a medical procedure to decrease the impact of autism.   Not long after this is posted, we will start to see comments urging a very different lesson than the facts suggest.  Some of those comments will likely accuse me of using a dead child to make a point.  That might be fair criticism so long as the accuser is not doing the same.  Ironically, however, I expect that some of those who shout the loudest will be the same ones who will invoke this child\u2019s name often to support their own narrow views.  I am tired of the shouting and I am tired of the disrespect shown to the Nadama family.  I pray that this will be the last time I feel the need to write of this incident, but I suspect that the actions of others will dictate otherwise. Not long ago, we were urged to light a candle for  Liz Birt .  That was appropriate; she was a remarkable woman who deserved a great tribute.  But tonight, I\u2019m going to light a candle for Abubakar Tariq Nadama, and then I\u2019m going to give my son an extra hug before he goes to sleep.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2006/01/update-on-abubakar-tariq-nadama.html", "http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06018/639721.stm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/01/sometimes-rumors-turn-out-to-be-true.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SOMETIMES RUMORS TURN OUT TO BE TRUE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, January 23, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      It\u2019s not exactly a secret that  Camille Clark  and I rarely see eye-to-eye.  We have sparred here and there, occasionally coming to the brink of ugliness but never really crossing the line of personal attack.  I hope what I am writing now does not seem to be an assault on Ms. Clark\u2019s personality, because I really don\u2019t know her well enough to say what kind of a person she may be.  But a  recent post  she put on her Autism Diva blog disturbed me.   Initially, I wasn\u2019t going to write about this for a couple of reasons.  First, I wasn\u2019t sure if I found the post offensive merely because it was Ms. Clark who posted it.  But when I couldn\u2019t get it out of my mind, and I spent a lot of time reflecting on it, I realized my reaction was the same as it would have been regardless of the author.  My second reason for hesitation was that it involves  the Nadama tragedy , something I feel has been written of enough, with too few people thinking of the family\u2019s ongoing grief.  Then I decided that was precisely why something should be said. Ms. Clark has written probably more about the incident than anyone else on the internet, and yet she really hasn\u2019t said anything more than anyone else has.  The second half of her recent post rehashes much of what she has said before, quoting an email from Dr. Garry Gordon regarding the apparent and egregious error made by Dr. Roy Kerry in using the wrong form of EDTA.  The Autism Diva post goes on to point out specific risks of EDTA.  That is a responsible and appropriate commentary regardless of one\u2019s agreement or disagreement with Ms. Clark\u2019s conclusions.  Unfortunately, that\u2019s only the second part of the post; the first portion sets an inappropriate tone that undermines the credibility of her argument. Although the name of Abubakar Tariq Nadama is not mentioned once, Ms. Clark presents the lyrics of a paraody entitled \u201cIt\u2019s Fun to Play with the EDTA,\u201d (attributed to \u201cAnonymous 5 \u201c), intended to be sung to the tune of The Village People classic \u201cYMCA.\u201d  In another context, most of the lyrics would be just an annoying satire, expressing the \u201cdesperate and embarrassed parent\u201d mythology Ms. Clark uses to stereotype parents who turn to biomedical interventions in general, and chelation in particular (and, contrary to what some think, not every biomedical protocol is based on chelation): Young man, please stop flapping your hands.  I said, young man, please don't stare at the fan.  I said, young man, stranger in a strange land  There's no need to be autistic.  Young man, there's a place we can go.  I said, the DAN, but we'll need lots of dough.  You can't stay there, but I'm sure you will find  Many things they say are white lies.  It's time to chelate with E-D-T-A It's fun to mix it with D-M-S-A.  They have everything, but you won't have a choice,  You can be just like all other boys ... Of course, in the context of the current debate, there is a definite connection to the Pennsylvania tragedy.  And just in case the connection is too subtle for some of us, the end of this little ditty drives home the point.  In so doing, Ms. Clark\u2019s post leaves the realm of \u201cannoying,\u201d and moves into \u201cutterly offensive:\u201d That's when someone, sent an email to me,  And said, you man, can be mercury free.  There's a place where, out near Pittsburgh PA.  They can start you back on your way.  It's time to chelate with E-D-T-A  While you're there you can Buy-R-N-A  They have everything, that you can afford,  Just ignore the whole medical board...  E-D-T-A ... don't ever ask Why-F-D-A Young man, young man, look in my eyes.  Young man, young man, don't believe all the lies.  E-D-T-A ... you'll find it stings E-D-T-A.  Young man, young man, there's no need to lie down.  Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.  E-D-T-A ... just need to defibrillate.  Young man, young man, are you listening to me?  Young man, young man, young man, young man?  I apologize for repeating that here, but I believe that hypocrisy sometimes needs to be highlighted.  And I can think of no other word but \u201chypocrisy\u201d to describe such a post, complete with displays of dancing molecules, which is signed by: Autism Diva not laughing If Ms. Clark is not laughing, why does she feel it necessary to post what -- in the mildest of terms -- is a sick joke? Ms. Clark has professed great anger at the Pennsylvania tragedy, and I can understand that.  Many people on all sides of the discussion/debate are angry and saddened.  As much as I have disagreed with her other writings on this (or just about any other) subject, however, those other statements have at least been articulate and, for the most part, respectful.  And that\u2019s why I\u2019m dumbfounded by this inane attempt to treat a tragedy as a laughing matter. Ms. Clark has made many contributions to the internet world of autism.  She has proven to the world that she is an intelligent and forceful, albeit narrow-minded, commentator.   As Autism Diva, she has an international following.  I have no doubt that some of her loyal readers will leave comments here to explain and defend her actions.  Explanations would be most welcome, but I don\u2019t believe there is any good defense.

We are the blessed.  But we know so many that have not been so lucky. Members of various groups of people are helping their own, and the autism community is no exception.  An effort is underway by  Unlocking Autism  to help families with ASD kids.  That is certainly a worthwhile effort.  Another means of helping is to focus on individuals.

Sheila\u2019s husband, Ron, recently retired from the military, and planned to get a job in the corporate sector in New Orleans.  Ron is the most likely candidate one could hope to find for an executive position; he has an M.B.A. and served as a District Comptroller for the Coast Guard.  Unfortunately, the economy in New Orleans is such that Ron did not receive any offers, and the Ealeys have been living and trying to raise three kids, two of whom have special needs, on a military pension. Like so many of us, Sheila and Ron have a son on the spectrum.  Sheila faced this challenge as she faced every other challenge in her life.  She decided to do something not just for her son, but for all autistic children.  Sheila co-founded the Creative Learning Center, a special school with the specific goal of being able to completely transition autistic children into a mainstream environment at the earliest possible age.   Sheila, whose academic background is behavioral psychology, designed a program and curriculum to address the needs of the whole child, relying on teamwork between specially educated and trained teachers and aids working with qualified therapists, psychologists, physicians, and other professionals.  The Creative Learning Center was to be one of only four schools in the nation to use the latest behavioral and play therapies, as well as autistic based language therapies.  The therapies offered by the school were not the once-or-twice-a-week-if-you\u2019re-lucky routine that we have all come to know with public schools.  The children were to have intensive therapy, along with inclusion sessions with neurotypical children, every single day.  Sheila struggled to raise funds, she found a host school with the local Catholic Archdiocese, and spent untold hours scrounging, painting, and getting ready. The Creative Learning Center was to have had its first day of classes this past Monday.  Around the same time the first bell was to have rung, Hurricane Katrina was blowing through.  We don\u2019t know if the building is still there; when last we heard it was under water. Sheila and Ron have apparently lost their home.  And  Sheila worries that she has lost not only the physical site for her school, but also her dream of a school that would help her son and others like him. This family needs a home.

Ginger ,  Pat Sullivan , and  Random John  have all posted about this article, and I decided to join in.   The article breaks no new ground, but it gives a pretty fair overview of some aspects of the debate.  Of course, with such an incomplete debate, one cannot expect a very complete review.  Along those lines, the article managed to spark an incisive commentary by  Random John , who, responding to a sidebar to the article that noted the difficulty in testing for mercury toxicity, wrote: So, there are two issues here. First, it\u2019s possible that mercury does its damage and then gets out, or that mercury just hides out in the cells and destroys proteins while evading any type of testing we can do.  Second, the article notes that chelation therapy does not remove methylmercury (and presumably ethylmercury, the type found in the vaccine preservative thimerosal).  Now, it is possible for methylmercury to be metabolized into inorganic Hg2+ which is how it does its damage, and which may open it up for chelation therapy if it is accessible to the chelation agent. At any rate, it\u2019s still pretty unclear why chelation therapy seems to be successful for some children, but not for others.  The polarity of the thimerosal and chelation debates does not seem to cover the ground necessary to understand what's really going on. I am clear on one thing, though.  I want to limit mercury exposure from all sources. John poses the kind of questions that need to be addressed regarding what might actually happen to mercury in our kids.  He also hits the nail on the head when he talks about the \u201cpolarity of the thimerosal and chelation debates.\u201d  Too many people on all sides of the debate(s) seem to wear blinders that prevent them from acknowledging how little we all know.  My opinion remains that we do our children a disservice if we focus solely on the question of mercury exposure as a causative factor in autism.  Conversely, we do our children a disservice if we fail to explore the probability that mercury exposure plays a major -- perhaps the single most significant -- role.  Until we start taking a broader look at all of the genetic and environmental factors involved, we won\u2019t begin to understand why some protocols work for some kids and do not for others.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.discover.com/issues/mar-05/features/our-preferred-poison/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2006/01/discover-mercury.html", "http://www.patsullivan.com/blog/2006/01/mercury_america.html", "http://www.randomjohn.info/wordpress/2006/01/27/discover-magazine-on-mercury/", "http://www.randomjohn.info/wordpress/2006/01/27/discover-magazine-on-mercury/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/01/mercury-my-two-cents-worth.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t MERCURY:  MY TWO CENTS WORTH\n\t \n    "},

I need a little more time before I can finish telling my family's story.  I suspect the only moral to be taken from any personal account I can add will be that some people can incredibly fortunate.  So today, I want to post the following first-hand account, which is far more enlightening than anything I can say.

The writer details some of his observations at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center (or the PMAC as we Tigers call it) and LSU Field House, which were being used as evacuation facilities.  After my rant against the FEMA leadership in the last post, I thought it might be appropriate to highlight the tremendous effort being made by both volunteers and federal employees.    Little did I know what I would be doing following Hurricane Katrina\u2019s aftermath but as I type right now, there won\u2019t be a more gratifying or more surreal experience than what I went through tonight.  We went up to the office today and held a press conference regarding the postponement of the game  [the football game between LSU and North Texas State that was scheduled for September 3, 2005]  and it was the right decision.  As the PMAC and Field House are being used as shelters we decided as an office to do everything we could to help the situation. At first, we were just supposed to make copies of this disaster relief form for all of the people.  The copiers will never print a document more important than that.  It\u2019s weird.  Nearly 12 hours ago we were running off copies of game notes for a football game that is now meaningless.  We printed the copies and carried them over to the Field House at 6:30 p.m.  I wouldn\u2019t leave the area for another eight hours. On the way back to the PMAC in a cart, it looked like the scene in the movie Outbreak.  FEMA officials, U.S. Marshals, National Guard, and of course the survivors.  Black Hawks were carrying in victims who were stranded on roofs. Buses rolled in from New Orleans with other survivors.  As Michael and I rode back to the PMAC, a lady fell out of her wheelchair and we scrambled to help her up. We met Coach Miles and Coach Moffit  [LSU\u2019s head football coach and strength coach]  in the PMAC to see all the survivors and it was the view of a hospital.  Stretchers rolled in constantly and for the first time in my life I saw someone die right in front of me. A man rolled in from New Orleans and was badly injured on his head.  Five minutes later he was dead.  And that was the scene all night. What did we do, we started hauling in supplies. And there were thousands of boxes of supplies. The CDC from Atlanta arrived directing us what to do. One of the U.S. Marshals was on hand so the supplies would not become loot.  I asked him what his primary job was. He serves on the committee of counter terrorism, but once he saw the disaster, he donated his forces to come help.  He said the death toll could be nearing 10,000.  It was sickening to hear that. After unloading supplies, I started putting together baby cribs and then IV poles. Several of our football players and Big Baby  [LSU basketball player, Glen Davis]  and Tasmin Mitchell  [another LSU basketball player]  helped us.  At the same time, families and people strolled in.  Mothers were giving birth in the locker rooms. The auxiliary gym \u201cDungeon\u201d was being used as a morgue.  I couldn\u2019t take myself down there to see it. I worked from 8 p.m. until 2:45 a.m.  Before I left, three more buses rolled in and they were almost out of room.  People were standing outside.  The smells, the sights were hard to take. A man lying down on a cot asked me to come see him.  He said, \u201cI just need someone to talk to, to tell my story because I have nobody and nothing left.\u201d He turned out to be a retired military veteran.  His story was what everybody was saying.  He thought he survived the worst, woke up this morning and the levees broke. Within minutes water rushed into his house.  He climbed to the attic, smashed his way through the roof and sat there for hours.  He was completely sunburned and exhausted.  Nearly 12 hours later a chopper rescued him and here he was. We finished the night hauling boxes of body bags and more were on the way.  As we left, a man was strolled in on a stretcher and scarily enough he suffered gunshots.  The paramedic said he was shot several times because a looter or a convict needed his boat and he wouldn\u2019t give it to him.  Another man with him said it was \u201can uncivilized society no better than Iraq down there right now.\u201d  A few minutes later he was unconscious and later pronounced dead.  I then left as they were strolling a three-year old kid in on a stretcher.  I couldn\u2019t take it any more. That was the scene at the PMAC and it gives me a new perspective on things.  For those of you who I haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with because of phone service, I pray you are safe.  God bless. Bill Martin LSU Sports Information There\u2019s a lot of good people doing some pretty incredible things around here. Last night, I listened on the satellite radio in our car as Chief Eddie Compass of the N.O.P.D. told us about the unbelievable job being done by the officers who stayed on the job even as many of their comrades deserted the City.  And the New Orleans area is getting help from its friends and neighbors, including many who may recall Louisianians coming to their aid in times of need.  Things will never be the same around here, and that is both a blessing and a curse.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/09/another-perspective.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, September 05, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      Well, we decided to extend our \u201cvacation\u201d a little longer, so we drove to the Chicago area to visit some of Sym\u2019s relatives.  Hopefully, the craziness back home will subside a little while we\u2019re here.  In the meantime, I thought I\u2019d post a few thoughts and such concerning the hurricane.   First,  Sheila and Ron  have been touched (as have Sym and I) at the response to their situation.  Just knowing that people care does a lot, and the options that many of you have suggested give the Ealeys a real choice to make.  And choice is a valuable gift indeed.  Like all of us, Sheila and Ron are still trying to catch their collective breath before they decide what they will be doing.  I\u2019ll keep you posted. I hope that those of you outside of the New Orleans area can understand the anger many of us are feeling these days.  As we were driving toward Texas almost 24 hours before Katrina made landfall, we listened to an interview with the director of FEMA.  He bragged that, due to his foresight, the supply lines were already moving, and that the federal government would be there as soon as the winds stopped blowing.  That is the role FEMA is supposed to play.  State and local governments cannot be expected to make an adequate response at a time their infrastructure is in shambles.  The delayed response by the federal government was inexcusable, and helped feed the violence and chaos that we\u2019ve all seen on the television.  Certainly, not all of the lawlessness resulted from need or even frustration (but some did).  Even before the hurricane, New Orleans had too large of a criminal subculture arising from the extreme poverty in which so many live.  Many in the criminal element stayed behind to take advantage of the opportunities that can arrive with a disaster.  But if the federal government had been on the scene when they promised they would, there would have been far less of an atmosphere of chaos to shield the lawlessness, and certainly an earlier presence of ground forces would have helped control the situation.   The problem was not just the lawlessness.  One has to ask how many people died simply because food, water, and medical attention were not made available promptly.  I fear the casualty numbers from this event will be more horrific than any of us can imagine.   The cries of racism arising out of the mishandling of the federal response are understandable, but are just plain wrong.  The local governments of predominantly white areas of St. Bernard and St. Tammany Parishes have tried in vain to get anyone from FEMA to contact them.  In the case of St. Bernard Parish, the failure of the federal government to respond is particularly puzzling because that area has been hit hard.  No, the federal government\u2019s failure is not due to racism; it is plain incompetence mixed with perhaps a little indifference to the plight of all fellow human beings.   Leaving aside my anger at FEMA, I have to express my complete admiration for the military forces who responded to the disaster.  The helicopter crews who rescued so many under the most challenging circumstances are to be commended.  When the ground troops finally arrived, the cool-headed leadership provided by General Honore helped diffuse the anger and violence.  While I am passing out kudos, let me say how grateful I am to the Republic of Texas for the manner in which they responded.  Perhaps they recall how we in Lousiana have always responded to disasters that befall our neighbors.  Still, the unhesitating charity Texans have shown my fellow Louisianians has been breathtaking.  As for those of us who were lucky enough to stay at hotels in Texas, we could not have asked for nicer treatment.  On the day we left, we saw young people everywhere holding car washes or doing whatever they could to raise funds for disaster relief.     The Rankin family has been very lucky.  We have jobs to go back to.  The reported damage to our home has been relatively minor.  We plan to stay up here in Chicago for another day, and we will return to Louisiana on Wednesday.  So I may be away from the blog for a couple of days.  When I can, I\u2019ll try to post something about what we find at home.   Before I close this chapter, I want to thank everyone for the public and private expressions of love and support.  Even though we lost relatively little in this storm, the pain at watching our beloved city die two deaths was often excruciating.  The other autism bloggers (particularly Ginger, Kristina, Brett, Tamar, David, and Kelly) all provided words of encouragement.  My new friends from the neurodiversity community ( Kevin ,  Katherine , Clay, jypsy, et al) all touched my heart.  And even a certain  respectfully insolent individual  with whom I have disagreed in the past (and with whom I will continue to agreeably disagree in the foreseeable future) made sure I received some good wishes.  I received countless private emails from people I didn\u2019t know but who wanted to take the opportunity to express their sympathy to somebody who could hear them.  I heard all of you, and I assure you all that I will not forget your kindness.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/", "http://www.neurodiversity.com", "http://oracknows.blogspot.com"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/09/still-refugee-but-doin-well.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t STILL A REFUGEE (But Doin\u2019 Well)\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, September 12, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      Thanks to the coverage of Hurricane Katrina, the rest of the world has been learning a lot about the geography of the New Orleans area.  By now, most of you realize that we refer to our counties as parishes.  Orleans Parish (i.e., the City itself) and suburban Jefferson Parish are on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain.   To the north of the Lake lies St. Tammany Parish where I live. Trees define the different locales.  I grew up in Uptown New Orleans, surrounded by lots of oak, magnolia, and pecan trees.  \u201cLive oak\u201d trees, covered in Spanish moss, are as emblematic of the City as the Superdome or the St. Louis Cathedral.  Those trees are particularly stout and can stand up to a lot.  Indeed, there are live oaks in the Midcity area, particularly in City Park, that are older than the City itself.  Many of those trees are now thought to be in peril because they have been submerged for too long in toxic flood waters. Although we have many different species of trees in St. Tammany Parish, including live oaks, we are really known more for our pine trees, some of which soar to heights in excess of 150 feet.  Pine trees are very supple, and will bend and sway even in strong winds.  But pine trees have very shallow roots, and the trunks are not terribly strong.  If they are hit by hurricane-force winds, they may either topple over or simply snap in the middle.  Residents of the gulf states know all too well the sight of snapped pine trees after hurricanes. As we drove home from Chicago this past Wednesday, I tried to picture broken pines so that I would not be shocked when I actually saw them.  I had a long time to think about it.  It was an 18-hour drive in a very crowded car.  And the youngest occupant was an autistic child who apparently had ingested a little gluten and or casein the night before.  Anyone who doubts the efficacy of the gluten-free/casein-free diet should see what happens when an autistic child on the diet actually ingests even a little wheat.  I\u2019ve heard it described as an opiate-like reaction, and that seems accurate.  My son was on the wild side, and he had no way to work off the nervous energy, except to run around road-side rest areas.  It all added to the stress level in the car. Another thing adding to the stress level was the realization that we would soon be driving into the hurricane-affected area.  Relatives had already seen our house, and we knew the damage would be relatively minor.   We found out that afternoon that electricity had been restored to our neighborhood.  But we also knew that there were a lot of trees down.  By the time we got about halfway into Mississippi, however, it was too dark to see the trees on the side of the Interstate.    We got a call from our friend, Reed, who had a key to our house.  He stopped by to spend the night in between two days of trying to salvage personal goods from his home in Slidell, a very hard-hit area.  The call was to warn us that coming into the house might not be terribly pleasant.  After eight days without electricity, all of the meat stored in the freezer thawed. We pulled into the subdivision a little after midnight.  Trees were down everywhere.  A willow near our front door was pushed completely onto its side.  The top half of a 40-foot pine lay across our front lawn.  Another 40-footer from a neighbor\u2019s yard lay across our fence with the top branches on our roof.  We were lucky.  The neighbors on the other side of us had a 60-foot pine through their roof. Reed was right about the aroma emanating from our refrigerator.  There are no words to adequately describe just how bad rotting meat can smell.  Despite the late hour, we spent a couple of hours cleaning out the contents of the refrigerator and freezer, and starting the long process of attempting to deodorize the unit.  (That process continues a few days later.) Getting home did my son a world of good.  His routine is still a shambles; school will not reopen until early October at the earliest, and it\u2019s not very clear whether his school will be able to provide the services he needs.  But the morning after we arrived home, my son woke up, unpacked the Buzz Lightyear suitcase in which he carries his toys, and just enjoyed being in his own room. A return to normalcy has not come so easily for the rest of us.  National Guard troops are everywhere.  Many large parking lots have tents set up for use by disaster response teams from FEMA, the Red Cross, or insurance companies.  The sounds of helicopters and chain saws are ubiquitous.  The stores still prominently display generators, batteries, and chain saws, but the post-disaster necessity that is the hardest to find is the simple television antenna.   With cable out of service for the indefinite future, rabbit ears are a valuable commodity.   Downed trees created the need for the chain saws.  Downed trees took out the power to the entire Parish, the full restoration of which is not yet complete.  Downed trees brought down the phone lines.  Downed trees took out cable television.  Downed trees damaged my roof and destroyed part of my fence.  And the sight of downed trees greets us everywhere we go.   When confronted with strong winds, pine trees either bend or they break.  Arborists say that whether they bend or break depends on whether the tree was planted in the right place.  Nevertheless, when you see two seemingly healthy pine trees of about the same size that were just a few feet from one another, and one is still standing and the other is lying across the lawn, you can\u2019t help but believe that the lot of pines is determined by random fate.  Some seem destined to be survivors. I spent much of this past weekend working with trees.  We have several small trees of different species (mostly pears) that had blown over onto the ground.  Their roots remained in the soil, and there was no significant damage to the trunks.  I pulled those trees to an upright position, staked them in place, added a little soil, and watered the roots.  They seemed to be survivors who needed a little help.  A globe willow, a water oak, and a pine that were down could not be saved.  So the sound of a chain saw closed out the weekend in my yard. We took from working around the house to take a ride Saturday evening.  We drove along the lakefront in Mandeville.  The lakefront is a place of beautiful old homes, many built in the latter-19th or early-20th centuries by well-to-do New Orleanians for use as summer homes.  The lakefront is the one place where majestic live oaks outnumber pine trees.  Live oaks stand up to wind far better than pines, but many of them were no match for Katrina\u2019s storm surge.  Neither were the houses and buildings. As much damage as hurricane-force winds can do, the real deadly force in a hurricane is the storm surge.  The hurricane pushes water onto shore, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.  Katrina pushed water from the Gulf of Mexico into Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain, and then pushed the water from the lakes onto shore.  In Mandeville, the surge brought a huge wall of water that destroyed everything on a first-floor level.  Houses were missing their fronts.  Restaurants were reduced to empty shells.  But the most amazing sight was of huge live oaks tossed to the ground as if they were accessories to a model train set.  Just as wind had been the bane of so many pines, water destroyed some of the live oaks.  Just like the wind-whipped pines, though, some of the oaks stood up to the surge and survived.  Again, it all seemed so random. There is a bar and pool hall named Donz on the Mandeville lakefront.  It has always been somewhat of a notorious landmark, a thoroughly unpretentious dive in the middle of the high-rent district.  Katrina\u2019s storm surge reduced Donz to an empty shell:  no doors or windows, no interior walls, no fixtures: just four incomplete walls.  As we passed Donz Saturday evening, it was packed with people -- no doubt the regular weekend clientele -- who all sat on folding chairs or on debris, drinking beer they brought themselves.  They too were survivors. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Before leaving behind discussion of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, I wanted to once again thank everyone who expressed concern for Sheila Ealey and her family, and especially thank everyone who helped give Sheila real options to turn an unbelievable loss into something positive.  Sheila is moving to Austin.  As anyone who knows Sheila could surmise, her decision was made not on the basis of what would be most rewarding for her, but on where her children would have the most opportunities for success.  I doubt I will need to give any further updates on her progress, for we will all be hearing more from this lady.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/09/pine-trees-and-oak-trees.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t PINE TREES AND OAK TREES\n\t \n    "},

Although I hope to have that \u201creal\u201d post ready in the relatively near future, I wanted to drop a quick note to say we stayed home for \u201cthe Second Coming\u201d (a/k/a Hurricane Rita), and made it through just fine.  But some friends of mine did not do so well. In my first year out of law school, I was given the wonderful opportunity to serve a one-year term as the law clerk for the Honorable H. Ward Fontentot.  Judge Fontenot is the presiding judge -- well, the only judge to be precise -- of the 38th Judicial District Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  (And a fine judge he is, I should add.)  Cameron Parish is a geographically large, but sparsely populated, area on the Gulf Coast.  Many of the residents work in the oil fields or raise cattle, but the big industry there is fishing.  The people down there are hard-working and fun-loving.  And 22 years ago, they showed great kindness to a wet-behind-the-ears city boy. Cameron Parish is no stranger to hurricanes.  Back in 1957, Hurricane Audrey decimated the area.  Everyone I met down there had a story about someone who didn\u2019t make it that time. Once again, Cameron Parish was ground zero for a major hurricane.  Officials have estimated that 100% of the homes down there have been damaged, and perhaps 90% are a total loss.  Just as occurred during Hurricane Audrey, the only building left standing in the town of Cameron is the courthouse.  The only good news is that most of the residents safely evacuated before the storm.   The people of Cameron Parish have been down this road before.  I suspect they\u2019ll do what they did last time.  They will rebuild.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 14, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      I was privileged to have the parents I had.  We were not wealthy, but the lessons they gave me were beyond any price. My father, Hugh F. Rankin, was a relatively well-known historian specializing in the American Colonial period.  In the 1930\u2019s he studied engineering and worked in the construction field, building roads and bridges.  During World War II, Dad served in the Army, building airfields.  He injured his back so badly that he was forced to leave his original field behind.  He returned to school on the G.I. Bill, and rekindled a lifelong love affair with history. Dad was part of a group of post-war graduate students, many of them at the University of North Carolina, who became legends among southern historians.  A couple of decades ago, another great historian, the late, great Dewey Grantham, interviewed many of his peers from that era for a project of the Southern History Collection at the UNC Library.  My father was one of the interviewees. Years after my father\u2019s death, I came across a transcript of Dewey\u2019s interview with him.  They discussed everything but history:  influences, the joys of teaching, family background, etc.  In the middle of their conversation, Dad discussed one of the most important life lessons he ever learned. My father was raised in a small town in North Carolina\u2019s tobacco country.  Although he was raised in a family that was relatively free of racial hatred, the culture of the time was one of class and race divisions.  It was just understood.  One day, Dad was supervising the construction of a road, and they encountered an unanticipated problem with the terrain.  All of the engineers, designers, and supervisors were huddled, trying to determine the solution.  None of the decision makers paid any attention to a middle-aged African American gentleman standing nearby.  He was employed in the only position available to him:  delivering water to the white workers. As the group argued about potential solutions, Dad grew more frustrated because each suggestion he heard was impractical.  After he pointed that out, the water man, who had been listening intently, decided it was time to pipe up:  \u201cIt\u2019s simple Cap.  You just move that over there.\u201d  As the others rolled their eyes and went back to arguing over their elegant solutions, Dad looked to where the water man had pointed.  He then looked at the water man, and then turned to the others in the group and argued for the simple and direct solution that the ignored African American suggested until the others reluctantly gave in.  The solution worked.  And my father vowed to himself that he would never again dismiss anyone based on their appearance or station in life. Dad never told me that story while he was alive.  He didn\u2019t need to.  Every moment I spent with him was a lesson in respect learned from observing the way he interacted with people.  On family road trips -- in the pre-Interstate Highway days before self-serve gas stations -- we would pull in to rural filling stations with attached country stores.  Whether the person working the pumps was an elderly African American, a 12-year old, barefoot boy, or a young adult in a starched shirt, my father\u2019s request was always worded the same and delivered in the same respectful tone:  \u201cFill it up with high test, please, sir.\u201d  In whatever context I witnessed Dad interacting with anyone, he always deemed every human to be worthy of respect until he or she showed otherwise.  My father never had to tell me that; he just lived it and I absorbed the lesson. About a month ago, before a hurricane rudely interrupted my life, I posted some thoughts about what is known as the neurodiversity movement.  The rhetoric I saw on other sites from both the neurodiversity and biomedical communities seemed harsh and defensive.  I wanted to see if we could all stop shouting long enough to listen to each other.  The dialog that was started exceeded any hopes I could have had.  Since those posts, I have continued to get to know some of the neurodiversity crowd through comments at blogs and through email.  I may disagree with some of what is said, but I respect those people and their opinions.   When you get right down to it, we have far more in common that we have real divisions.  The divisions are largely the result of semantic differences.  As we continue to discuss things in a rational and respectful manner, we develop a common lexicon and we learn. Anything worth believing in should be able to stand up to scrutiny.  I firmly believe in what my wife and I are doing for my son through biomedical interventions.  The respectful conversations I have had with those who think otherwise have not shaken my belief.  I will continue to encourage others to consider walking the same path we are walking.  But I have learned enough from my new friends that I am starting to recognize the limitations of what we are doing. In the biomedical community, we often throw around the word \u201ccure.\u201d  When I use that word, I know what I mean and most other people who practice biomedical know what I mean.  We are seeking to alleviate the dysfunctional aspects of ASD in our children.  We will never alter the genetic makeup of our children, and to the extent genes make them autistic, they will remain autistic.  I can live with that.  But I believe that one or more environmental insults has acted in concert with my son\u2019s genetic makeup to create stumbling blocks that keep him from using all of this gifts.  I cannot believe I am wrong in trying to reduce the effects of those environmental insults.  On the other hand, when I am confronted with the eloquence of  Kathleen Seidel  or the extraordinary testimony of an  adult with autism  who wants no \u201ccure,\u201d I have to realize that the issues surrounding ASD are not easily addressed by one-size-fits-all answers.  Could the \u201ccure\u201d we seek help other people who reject biomedical interventions?  Perhaps, but that\u2019s not a necessary given.  More importantly, that\u2019s not my choice to make. We have much to learn from each other, but we cannot learn if we don\u2019t listen.  It\u2019s called respect.

But Sydney wasn\u2019t getting the services that Swenson thought were crucial to her development. \u201cI wasted three years of Sydney\u2019s life,\u201d she said as she stood in front of more than 40 people, including two state representatives and Hillsborough\u2019s new school superintendent.  \u201cWe want a partnership, not a pity party.\u201d Ms. Swenson, tired of trying to fight for what her child is entitled to under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), wound up starting a new school to specifically address the needs of children like Sydney.  But to make it work, she\u2019s looking to the local school system for funding: \u201cInstead of fighting me, embrace me, because I can take you where you need to go in one year instead of five,\u201d she said. Like many parents, Kathy Swenson has learned far more about how to deal with autism than most of the so-called experts.  And her cry is the same one many of us shout out.  The schools are required to give our children the same opportunity to be educated in the least-restrictive environment that is reasonably possible.  \u201cLet us help you,\u201d we say to the schools, \u201cuse your resources wisely to accomplish that task in the most efficient and effective way possible.\u201d In Hillsborough County, the new school superintendent said all the things we\u2019re used to hearing.  She said that the system does not have enough certified teachers because those teachers can earn more money in schools elsewhere.  It\u2019s always about the money, isn\u2019t it?  But that superintendent was at the meeting and actually listened to what the parents were saying, and she offered some hope in that they were looking at other systems across the nation to see what was being done to attract and retain teachers.  Moreover, the superintendent vowed to talk over the parents\u2019 concerns with her staff, and she made a frank admission: \u201cThere are some situations you have told me about today that should not have occurred,\u201d she said.  \u201cWe have a lot to learn.\u201d With that attitude, they may be on the right path in Hillsborough County, but the superintendent needs to understand that it will take more than keeping teachers.  Those teachers need to work with the parents to determine and meet the individual needs of each autistic child, for they are all individuals with unique strengths and weaknesses. My wife and I hope that we are on the right track in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana.  Like many parents of autistic children, we tried to work through the usual process of evaluations and I.E.P. meetings.  But despite being in a school with a principal who is willing to \u201cthink outside the box,\u201d and who believes in integrating \u201cspecial\u201d students into the general student body, we still weren\u2019t able to get our son what he needed at school.  Without going into too much detail, we felt like last year was wasted. So far this year, even with the chaos caused by Hurricane Katrina, we are off to a far better start.  Before the start of the school year, we sent correspondence to the superintendent of our system that made it clear that we were not satisfied with the status quo, and we laid out specifically what we expected the school to do for our son this year.  That led to a meeting between the superintendent and my wife, Sym, who brought along our friend,  Sheila Ealey , who was at that time in the process of starting a new school program for ASD kids in the New Orleans area (a project that literally drowned in the post-Katrina flooding less than two weeks later).  A little bit into the conversation, the superintendent decided that a new meeting was required:  one with her special education team present.   A couple of weeks ago, we finally had that hurricane-delayed meeting.  True to her word, the superintendent brought in the head of special education, the system\u2019s top speech therapist, the head of occupational therapy, and a couple of other staff members who needed to be in the loop.  They listened as we (well, to be honest, Sym did most of the talking) explained how the system must move beyond using cookie-cutter solutions because each autistic child falls somewhere different on the spectrum.  We made clear what our son needed, and they gave us an idea as to how they would try to meet those needs. Everything has not turned completely around instantaneously.  We are still struggling to get some of the school therapists to understand what works with our son.  But slowly they are starting to realize that although our expertise may not match theirs in their respective fields, we are the experts when it comes to our son.  Things may not be perfect, but we\u2019re finally moving in the right direction. Would all this have come about if we had not made it clear that we would do whatever was necessary to get our son everything he was entitled to under IDEA?  I don\u2019t know.  But I believe our school system is acting in good faith, and I hope that we are helping them realize that there may be different ways of serving the autistic community.  I hope that the progress they see our so make will change the way they approach educating all autistic children.  And it all begins with allowing parents to be partners.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sptimes.com/2005/11/04/Brandontimes/Superintendent_takes_.shtml"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/aggressively-seeking-partnerships.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t AGGRESSIVELY SEEKING PARTNERSHIPS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, June 04, 2011", "body": "\n\t \n       This year\u2019s Autism One/Generation Rescue Conference was filled with the usual opportunities for education and fellowship, and the annual attempt by a certain someone to show up for the sole purpose of being asked to leave (he wasn\u2019t disappointed).  And as often happens, the conference provided the stage for a special announcement.   On Friday, May 27th, the  Age of Autism  trio (Mark Blaxill, Dan Olmsted, and Kim Stagliano), along with my pal,  Ginger Taylor , invited all to join with them in the  Canary Party .  Judging by the reaction within the packed room, it is an idea whose time has come. Although it will have some of the trappings, this is not a party in the traditional sense of the world.  It is, rather, a political movement.  It\u2019s a movement to use political means to bring honesty to the scientific endeavors of our nation\u2019s public health sector.  It\u2019s a movement to use political means to bring fairness to the legal system.  It\u2019s a movement to steer our nation\u2019s political leaders toward asking tough questions.  It\u2019s a movement that embraces all sides of the political spectrum:  left, right, liberal conservative, and all other descriptions that have lost all of their traditional meanings in the mess of partisan politics. Some, who are nonetheless enthusiastic about the mission, expressed some concern over the name of the party.  The name, of course, comes from the old use of canaries in coal mines to warn miners of dangerous toxins.  What I heard from some was \u201caren\u2019t the canaries the ones who die?\u201d  Yes they are.  And they do.   Too many of our kids\u2019 lives are cut short . The fact is that the children of the autism epidemic  are  the canaries in the coal mine.  They are the outward and visible sign of a much broader public health crisis; this is not just about autism spectrum disorders.  Anyone who has worked in health care for 20 years or more\u2014at least any that are willing to honestly answer\u2014will tell you that the growth of all autoimmune problems in younger populations is alarming. And the causes for this public health crisis include, but are by no means limited to a vaccine program that has run amok.  Those causes include pollutants in the air, water, and soil.  They include the adulteration of our food supply.  They include the indiscriminate use of pharmaceutical products.   And all of those toxic insults have occurred with the cooperation of various federal regulatory agencies that were charged with protecting the public.   Political pressure must be brought to bear on a regulatory system that has become nothing more than a career path for bureaucrats who want subsequent jobs in the various industries we pay them to protect us from. Reaction from the \u201cother side\u201d has been predictable.  One self-styled \u201cskeptic,\u201d a medical blogger with no child to worry about, dismissed us by commenting that the color adopted by the party reminds him more of a certain bodily fluid than it does canaries.  Wow, that was profound.  To him, and to those of like mind who would rather treat us with scorn and derision rather than debate us with intelligence, we have a message:  bring it on. This is the right movement the right time.  Concern for the future health of our population is steadily increasing, and our numbers will increase with that concern.  The only ones that can stop us are ourselves.  We have a history in our community of letting internal politics tear us apart.  That cannot happen with this endeavor.  That\u2019s why it was so important that this announcement came at a conference with a history of bringing together a wide range of groups who can coexist. If we\u2019re going to make this thing work, we need to check our egos at the door.  We have to worry less about who is speaking and acting within our ranks, and worry more about who is doing what to the most vulnerable people.  We must keep our eyes on the prize.  There can be only one agenda:  our children. Our children have been endangered canaries for too long.  It\u2019s time to clean up the mines, and let them fly.   Join us . The only thing I did was wrong Stayin' in the wilderness too long Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on The only thing we did was right Was the day we started to fight Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on Hold on, hold on Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UUoFK0oACqo/TeqBmcvbEmI/AAAAAAAAAJc/rwCwOzCxS8U/s1600/6a00d8357f3f2969e2015432c1119d970c-450wi.jpg", "http://www.ageofautism.com/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.canaryparty.org/", "http://liveslosttoautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.canaryparty.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2011/06/taking-flight-from-coal-mine.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t TAKING FLIGHT FROM THE COAL MINE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, October 06, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      Little by little life is getting back to normal where I live in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana.  We no longer hear the constant sound of helicopters overhead.  Slowly, the debris crews are getting to various neighborhoods to pick up the remains of  trees .  The make-shift radio network that sprung up in New Orleans, with on-air talent from most of the stations in town sharing the mike is starting to break up, with some of the stations returning to their normal broadcasting. My brother,  John , came in from his temporary home in Nashville to check out his home in the Mid-City section of New Orleans for the first time since Katrina.  He was unbelievably lucky.  The flood waters stopped rising a mere inch from the floor boards of his raised house, thus saving the musical instruments by which he earns his living.  With the passage of time, the scale of the destruction of lives and property that Katrina caused seems to diminish.  But whenever I start to forget that people are still suffering, I\u2019ll see something that jolts me back into the reality of the hurricane\u2019s aftermath.  Yesterday I got that jolt from  Operation Eden . Clayton Cubitt is a frighteningly talented photographer who lives and works in New York.  For the last week or so, though, he has been posting to a blog called  Operation Eden , in which he chronicles his journey to Pearlington, Mississippi to help his mother and brother.  There are pictures of gut-wrenching devastation, but what really got to me were the portraits -- in both pictures and words -- of the people of Pearlington and New Orleans. Pearlington was a quiet little town that hardly exists anymore.  After the storm, it was forgotten by FEMA, by the media, and by people like me who were too focused on the petty inconveniences Katrina caused.  Clayton Cubiit made sure I will never again forget Pearlington.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.johnrankin.net/", "http://operationeden.blogspot.com/", "http://operationeden.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/clayton-cubitts-eden.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t CLAYTON CUBITT\u2019S EDEN\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, November 11, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      A reporter for the  Los Angeles Times  recently wrote of a  major development  in the treatment of learning disorders.  It seems that clinical trials are about to start on protocols for certain learning disabilities, which scientist believe can be alleviated with Lovastatin, a drug used primarily to treat high cholesterol.  Lovastatin is marketed by Merck under the name, Mevacor. What does this story have to do with autism?  Nothing.  What this story highlights is hypocrisy. The newspaper story doesn\u2019t mention whether Merck funded the laboratory studies that gave rise to the upcoming trials, but the company will surely participate in the trials.  And if all goes well in the trials, Merck stands to make a lot of money.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with a corporation making money or helping to develop treatments.  But participation in the trials and subsequent profits would be an act of hypocrisy on Merck\u2019s part. The discovery that Mevacor might be useful for this purpose came about when Dr. Alcino Silva, a neurobiologist at UCLA, was approached by a former student who hypothesized that statins would impede a body\u2019s overproduction of a protein called Ras, which many believe leads to some learning disabilities.  So how did they test the hypothesis? Postdoctoral fellow Weidong Li in Silva\u2019s lab tested the theory using specially bred rats that had the neurofibromatosis 1 mutation and had previously been shown to have learning problems similar to those seen in humans with the disorder. In one test, he trained adult mice with the mutation to follow a blinking light to obtain a food reward.  After the animals received the drug, their performance improved 30 percent so that they outperformed normal mice. Two other tests provided similar results. \u201cWe think we have a real, fundamental reason to be optimistic,\u201d Silva said.  \u201cNow, we are ready to go and treat the human disorder.\u201d Many of you are probably aware of the ground-breaking study by Dr. Mady Horning, of Columbia University, which showed the impact of thimerosal on immune-suppressed mice.  That study provides much of the foundation for proving the connection between thimerosal and autism. I\u2019m really not certain if Merck promulgated a formal response to Dr. Hornig\u2019s study, but we may safely assume that they did not issue any proclamations using the adjective \u201cground-breaking.\u201d  We do know that various parties, including  one doctor with a connection to Merck , criticized the study, with the most common criticism being that mice do not provide a good model for the human brain for things like developmental disabilities. Now Merck stands to profit from experiments that rely on the reliability of mice brains as being good models for humans.  I can only hope that Merck will take one of two actions.  They can issue a statement acknowledging that Dr. Hornig\u2019s use of mice in her experiments was valid (I know better than to expect them to agree with the results of the Hornig study).  The second option is to insist that language be inserted into the informed consent forms for the trials, telling the patients (or the patients\u2019 parents) that the manufacturer of the drug to be administered cannot vouch for the reliability of the underlying experimental work because they do not believe mouse studies to be valid. Silence would be hypocritical.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/08/MNGGAFKL921.DTL"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/of-mice-and-merck.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t OF MICE AND MERCK\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 09, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      I suppose I should be grateful to Paul Offit.  It seems that any time I start to worry that I won\u2019t be able to think of anything to write about in this blog, Dr. O goes and says something that cries out for a response.  Well, he\u2019s done it again. Not too long ago I posted my thoughts on  Dr. Offit\u2019s paranoia  about the American legal system.  Once again, he has seen fit to pontificate on that subject, and once again he shows just how little he knows about the law and how little he thinks of lay people. In an editorial called \u201c Vaccine Courts ,\u201d published in the  Long Beach Press Telegram , Dr. Offit discusses why he thinks the so-called \u201cvaccine court,\u201d which is really part of the United States Court of Claims, is far superior to the court system to which any other defendant would be subjected.  And he does it in the most irrational manner. Dr. Offit devotes the first six paragraphs (of a 16 paragraph article) to an absurd comparison between the American court system and the Instant Replay system used by referees in the National Football League.  In Dr. O\u2019s opinion, submitting cases against vaccine manufacturers to civil juries is akin to submitting instant replay decisions to 12 non-football fans.   The first reaction to a comparison between a foot ball game and a serious matter concerning the legal rights of our children is to take offense, but it\u2019s really just Dr. O\u2019s rather clumsy way of saying he too considers legal proceedings to be serious: Few football fans would accept this.  Yet we're perfectly willing to accept this scenario when it comes to complex questions about pharmaceutical products and medical wrongdoing.  Jurors, without any knowledge in these fields, are specifically asked to determine their validity.  They often explain their verdicts by first saying \u2018\u2018The science was way over my head, but ...\u201d For a guy who supposedly doesn\u2019t become involved as an expert witness, Dr. Offit seems to think he knows what happens with jurors.  With all due respect, Doc, I think I have a little better idea. For over 20 years, I have litigated civil cases, almost exclusively defending corporations and insurance companies.  Most of those cases have involved technical evidence of one sort or another, including issues of medical causation, engineering, and various scientific fields.  Customarily, after a verdict is rendered, informal discussions tend to spring up between lawyers and jurors in the courthouse hallways.  The lawyers like to hear what they did right and what they did wrong, and the jurors always have questions about those little things that can\u2019t come out in the courtroom.  Not once have I heard jurors declare after a trial that the technical information was over their heads.  Rather, what I usually hear is gratitude that the evidence was presented in such a way that they were able to understand the subject; they genuinely appreciate having learned something. Another thing jurors appreciate is someone who does not talk down to them or patronize them.  People always want to know about courtroom tricks; what successful litigators know is that there are no \u201ctricks.\u201d  There is just careful preparation.  That includes assuming the people on the jury will understand a technical explanation that is clearly expressed, and then mapping out an easily-understandable presentation.  It also means retaining an expert witness who not only understands the field, but can communicate that understanding by neither talking over juror\u2019s heads nor talking down to them.  Most lawyers who complain that \u201cjurors are too stupid to get it\u201d are merely trying to deflect attention from their own laziness. Doc Offit\u2019s football analogy misses the mark.  In a courtroom, we don\u2019t bring in 12 people who know nothing and expect them to make a decision without guidance.  The situation is more akin to watching the replay with able commentators telling us why the ruling on the field should be upheld or overturned.   Jurors have a judge to guide them in applicable legal principles, and expert witnesses are used to guide them in technical areas.  In admitting expert testimony, courts are guided by what has come to be known as the Daubert rule to keep \u201cjunk science\u201d out of the courtroom, a process which involves the expert showing that his opinion was derived in a scientifically acceptable manner before the jury ever sees the witness. That is not to say that miscarriages of justice do not occur, but they are not as common as many people seem to think, and those ridiculous jury verdicts the press loves to report are more often than not reversed by the trial court or the court of appeal.  In general, however, referring disputes to the common wisdom of 12 (or sometimes six) disinterested (which is not the same as \u201cuninterested\u201d) individuals works quite well. The whole idea of the jury system is to bring in people from a broad cross-section of our society, and choose a group of 12 who can take a fresh look at a dispute.  Over 20 years of practice has left me jaded and cynical about many aspects of the American legal system, but not about the role of the jury in that system.  That\u2019s because those 12 people are rarely jaded and cynical when they step into the courtroom and take their seats in the jury box.  Most are eager to serve and do their best to learn about why a dispute exists, and what can be done to resolve the dispute.  In short, jurors listen.  A special master, a magistrate, or even the finest judge, on the other hand, is far more likely to have formed a definite opinion before formal evidence is presented.  The more specialized the tribunal, the more likely the fact finder is to have formed a premature opinion. And that brings us to \u201cVaccine Court.\u201d  Vaccine Court operates as part of the United States Court of Claims, which ordinarily handles claims arising out of government actions.  Before a claim can be brought against a vaccine manufacturer in a state or federal district court, the plaintiff must first file his/her claim in Vaccine Court.  The selling point for the creation of Vaccine Court was that it would handle the claims more quickly than most courts.  Of course, \u201cquickly\u201d can be a relative term.  And \u201cquickly\u201d is not always the right thing.  The \u201cMaster Autism Petition\u201d in Vaccine Court is now in a bit of a holding pattern, which will hopefully allow the science of the controversy to get a little more settled.  A more-settled science in this case should make true justice more possible, at least in theory.  But justice always becomes problematic when you put it into the hands of an elite group. Almost every commercial endeavor one can undertake in this world carries with it the risk that one may be sued for a bad outcome.  It is simply part of the cost of doing business.  Sometimes, groups with very good lobbyists get a little extra protection.  For example, here in Louisiana (generally considered a plaintiff-friendly state) before a patient can sue his/her doctor for medical malpractice, the claimant must first file a claim with a state agency.  That claim is heard by a panel of three physicians, with an attorney guiding them.  Even if the panel determines that there was no malpractice, the plaintiff can still file an ordinary suit.  Plaintiff lawyers refer to the panel as a \u201cspeed bump.\u201d Vaccine Court is also a speed bump.  If that body determines there is a valid claim, an award is made.  If the plaintiff is dissatisfied, an ordinary suit can be filed.  That is, a suit can be filed if the plaintiffs and their attorney still have the money and fortitude to fight a defendant who, to that point, has not incurred one penny of cost in the fight. That\u2019s right.  In Vaccine Court, the plaintiff is technically suing the government, so government lawyers vigorously defend the claim at taxpayer expense.  And where does the money come from if the Vaccine Court makes an award?  It comes from a fund that was created by per-dose taxes on vaccines, a cost that was passed on to the patients who received the shots. In his editorial, Dr. Offit doesn\u2019t directly describe all the current legislative moves by which the industry with the sweetest immunity deal ever seeks to throw a little more honey into their jar.  He simply mentions that it makes sense to have flu shots included \u201cin advance of the next pandemic.\u201d  But the tone of his writing makes it clear that, like some others, Paul Offit would be very happy to see Vaccine Court become the only avenue of available \u201cjustice.\u201d Paul Offit is ready to discard over 700 years of legal tradition because he thinks only doctors are intelligent enough to understand science.  His arrogance is breathtaking.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.presstelegram.com/opinions/ci_3189346"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/here-we-go-again.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t HERE WE GO AGAIN\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, November 18, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      You may be aware that a documentary, entitled  Finding the Words , has been produced for airing on PBS.  The film will examine the hypothesized link between vaccines and the onset of ASD, as well as the use of biomedical interventions.  Originally scheduled for this past summer, it is apparently now slated for April.  In the meantime, the  San Fransisco Chronicle  posted a  story  about one of the children featured in the documentary. Nine-year old Humza Iqbal developed many of the signs of autism at an early age.  Judging by the account in the  Chronicle , Humza was profoundly autistic.  Over the years, his parents tried various behavioral therapies, with limited results.  Then, after seeking a way to help her son\u2019s gastro-intestinal problems, Humza\u2019s mother, Sara, found a new path. She found information on the Internet about diets that were free of gluten -- wheat protein -- and casein -- dairy protein. Other parents said they\u2019d found these diets alleviated gastrointestinal symptoms and resulted in behavior and learning improvements.  She ordered videotapes about the dairy- and wheat-free diet and started Humza on one.  She began attending conferences run by Defeat Autism Now, an education and advocacy group that believed autism could be treated biomedically. In the first days of the diet, she agonized as he refused foods she offered him.  But then, slowly, he started to eat pureed food.  Within about three weeks, she said, she noticed a difference in his digestion problems and his behavior.  After a month and a half on the diet -- and receiving behavioral therapy at the same time -- Humza began looking at his parents. Sara Iqbal delved deeper into the biomedical approach, adding supplements and weekly intravenous glutathione treatments.  As is commonly reported among those of us using a biomedical approach, the Iqbals noted the association between new improvement and the addition of new elements into the protocol. And what was the result?  This is the observation by Katherine Seligman, the Chronicle reporter: He has grown into an articulate child who excels in school and has friends and play dates and all the ordinary trappings of a 9-year-old life. He comes home from school, does his homework (\u201cI don't like to procrastinate,\u201d he says the first time I meet him), then might read, pop in a video game or play with his sisters who, he admits, sometimes bug him. Predictably, Humza\u2019s pediatrician says he\u2019s not sure whether the remarkable progress came about because of the behavioral therapies, the biomedical ineterventions or just the passage of time.  But Humza\u2019s mother has a definite opinion. \u201cHad we stayed with the conventional therapies, I don\u2019t think we would have made the initial headway we made in the first month (with biomedical treatments),\u201d said Sara Iqbal.  \u201cWe\u2019d add another supplement and boom, we saw a change.   We looked at it as a disease.  The more we started fixing, the more he improved.\u201d Is Hamza \u201ccured?\u201d  The article does not use the word in relation to his progress; in fact Ms. Seligman notes that a part-time \u201cspecial circumstance assistant\u201d is still assigned to the young man by the school district.  That aide, nevertheless, is rarely needed, and: A school psychologist who observed Humza in early October found he consistently paid attention in class.  He asked questions and practiced independently in his handwriting workbook.  He got along well with other kids and they appreciated him, she wrote. Overall, she concluded, his social and academic behavior was \u201cappropriate when compared to his peers.\u201d So Hamza clearly needs less help than most autistics in dealing with school.  But again the question becomes whether he is \u201ccured.\u201d A few weeks ago, I was part of what  Ginger  called a \u201cblog swarm,\u201d addressing the reason many of us are seeking what some call a \u201ccure\u201d to autism (see  Why  and  Why, Part 2 ).  One of the questions that came out of those posts was whether it was appropriate to cure the dysfunctions of autism when that same process might diminish the cognitive strengths that often accompany the condition.  It was a fair question, and I concluded that potential improvement had to be weighed against potential improvement in individual cases. The  Chronicle  article does not clarify what special abilities, if any, Humza had before his parent\u2019s remedial efforts, or even whether he was able to even communicate any abilities or gifts he had.  After the intervention, however, Hamza seems to be a child of above-average intellectual abilities.  Just look at the second quote from the article above; how many nine-year olds correctly use the word \u201cprocrastinate?\u201d Humza has scored at an advanced level in math, and he also has literary interests. The following is from the interview he had with the reporter: We started talking about what he likes at school -- P.E., especially a kickball game called Two Touch.  And he loves reading \u2013 \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,'\u201d \u201cJames and the Giant Peach\u201d and \u201cMatilda,\u201d although the author \u201cdoesn't use as much craft\u201d in that one, Humza said. Hamza\u2019s story may just be an anecdote.  I\u2019m sure Sara Iqbal can accept that.  It seems, though, that we hear more and more of these  anecdotes  every day. Autism is different for each autistic person.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.  But Sara Iqbal seems to have found an answer for her son.  Of course, some do not think a solution is needed for their own condition; not everyone wants to be \u201ccured.\u201d   How does Hamza feel about being \u201ccured?\u201d  The  Chronicle  article doesn\u2019t specifically address that, but a clue might be found in a letter he wrote his mother. In January, Sara Iqbal returned from a trip and was annoyed to find the house in such a mess and not one of her three kids willing to help clean up.  Humza went upstairs to finish his homework, but came down later, handed her a letter and hugged her.  \u201cI thank you for everything not just now but always,\u201d he\u2019d written.  \u201cI fully thank you I can\u2019t even write how much I thank you because it is way, way, way, way (x10) too long.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n      Lately, it seems I\u2019ve been talking a lot with other parents about school issues.  Every parent of an autistic child in a public school knows the frustration of trying to get appropriate services for their child.  Every school system in the nation that accepts federal funding is obligated to provide those services under the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d).  Getting an agreement on what is \u201cappropriate,\u201d however, can sometimes seem as likely as the New Orleans Saints making it to the Super Bowl.   Recently, I wrote of a  relatively positive experience  in dealing with our local school system.  For the first time, the movers and shakers in the system (as opposed to the principal and teachers who have supported us for awhile now) met with my wife and me, and actually seemed interested in cultivating a partnership to provide my son with the best possible opportunity to advance.   I remain cautiously optimistic about this year, but progress is agonizingly slow.  Our son is getting more attention on the basic services the school is used to providing (i.e., a little speech therapy and a little sensory integration).  The more intensive therapies autistic kids need are still absent, but there are definite signs that we might start seeing them.  All in all, our experience is a little better than it was last year.  Sadly, that little bit better beats the experience many other parents across the country are reporting. Why do most school systems do such a bad job teaching autistic kids?  In part, it\u2019s money.  Delivering the intensive therapies our children need costs money, and many systems are already stretching every dollar (although many waste more than they stretch).  In recent years it has just been easier for schools to deliver minimal services and see which children can improve on their own.  Those who can\u2019t find their own way wind up in segregated classes where they won\u2019t distract the typical kids.  Special autism classes fill a real need for kids that aren\u2019t ready for an inclusive setting, but too many systems use them as a final destination.   It would be interesting to see how many kids could successfully stay in inclusive settings if they received the therapies they need on an individual basis.  For some children, that means ABA, Greenspan for others, Verbal Behavior for some, and RDI for others.  Instead, most schools cling to a one-size-fits-all philosophy, and they institute one-size-fits-few programs that incorporates very little from any of the above-listed programs. Tina Giovanni writes a terrific blog called  Autism 911 .  Tina is a teacher with years of experience working with autistic children, and she brings a unique perspective to the discussion.  Recently, she used a very descriptive phrase for the attitude of too many school systems:  \u201cthe epidemic of denial.\u201d It\u2019s too true.  As long as schools can deny there\u2019s a problem of immense proportions, they can redirect their resources in other directions they may feel will reap greater rewards.  In the meantime, our kids don\u2019t get what they need to learn to function independently.  I\u2019m still not sure how serious our local school system is about being partners in our son\u2019s development.  We\u2019re determined that he will stay in an inclusive setting, and that he will progress both academically and socially.  Although the change in attitude by the system has not been as complete as we would like, there has been enough movement that I am willing to assume that the administration is acting in good faith.  And isn\u2019t that ironic?  A school system that has its resources stretched because of Hurricane Katrina is finding a way to bend and stretch a little more, while other systems across the nation are still finding ways to deny.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism911.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/other-epidemic.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE OTHER EPIDEMIC\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Here in the New Orleans area, it\u2019s Fat Tuesday:  Mardi Gras.  When I was growing up, the news director of WWL television, an imposing gentleman by the name of Phil Johnson, gave editorials on the air.  His editorial on Mardi Gras was always the same.  He simply stated that the station reserved the right to be serious tomorrow, but that was just not possible on Mardi Gras.  Of course, that was before Katrina changed so much.  Today, my wife was one of the unlucky people who actually have to work on Mardi Gras.  So my son and I took in the parade in Covington, with its decorated trucks and worn-out floats that were handed down from a third-rate parade of years gone by.  The small-town festivities are a far cry from the parades on St. Charles Avenue I have known my whole life.  But low key can be good sometimes.   This afternoon, we took Captain Percival (that most noble of Cairn Terriers) to the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, where people gathered in the informal Mardi Gras celebrations that are as much a part of the day as the parades or the craziness in the French Quarter.  Yes, low-key can be good sometimes. Last night \u23af Lundi Gras as it\u2019s called around here \u23af was our real carnival.  We drove into New Orleans to catch a couple of the better parades of the season:  the old-line Proteus with its beautiful wooden-wheeled floats and the newer \u201csuperkrewe\u201d of Orpheus, a star-studded extravaganza with giant floats and the best bands.   Driving into town, we passed through neighborhoods that were hit hard by the storm and the subsequent flood.  The water line was still visible on many buildings that were no longer usable or habitable.  Spray-painted on the outside of nearly every structure were the signs left behind by the search-and-rescue squads from the National Guard.  The symbol they painted on each building consists of a large \u201cX\u201d with information painted into each quadrant, including the date the building was checked out and the unit that was there.  On one quadrant of the \u201cX\u201d is entered a digit:  the number of dead found inside.  Most of the buildings we passed were marked with zeroes, but we saw the occasional \u201c1\u201d and one house with a \u201c5.\u201d   Passing through the devastation, I had to ask myself the same question that so many people have asked:  why is New Orleans actually staging Mardi Gras at all this year?  Then we got to The Avenue (as we know it locally), and only then did it make sense.  The combination of the floats, the bands, the flambeaux, the beads, and the crowds made it impossible not to get lost in another world for just a brief time.  It\u2019s a world where hurricanes don\u2019t exist and where autism truly is just a difference and not a daily struggle. Yes, that world faded somewhat as we drove home through the rubble.  But I was comforted by the knowledge that New Orleans is still New Orleans.   Mardi Gras is not something we do; it\u2019s who we are.     The fleur-de-lis has been the symbol of New Orleans ever since there was a New Orleans.  It now graces various logos and flags noting our region\u2019s determination to rebuild.  More than one outlander has noted the similarities in outlines between the fleur-de-lis and a hand with one finger raised in \u201csalute.\u201d  Those wags say it symbolizes our telling the world to go to Hell while we go our own unique way.  That\u2019s not quite right.   The fleur-de-lis is the representation of a flower.  It\u2019s our way of giving you a gift as we invite you to spend some time with us as we shout out in unison:  \u201cLaissez les bon temps roulez.  Enjoy the way we are different from you.\u201d Contrary to what some seem to think about me, I am not frightened by differences in people.  I celebrate diversity.  But different is not always better.   Life in New Orleans is not all crawfish and beads.  We had problems with crime and poverty before Katrina.  Traditionally, our governments have been as corrupt as any in the United States, and we\u2019ve been too lazy or ignorant to do anything about it all.  And now, we wonder if a lack of vision on the part of our leaders will prevent this area from rebuilding.  Sometimes being different is good, and sometimes it\u2019s just plain dysfunctional. Today the difference is good. Sometime in the next week, I\u2019m going to pick up the conversation where we left off.  But not today:  today is Mardi Gras.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/ColumbiaSt.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/Flag_Small.jpg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/in-some-places-its-just-another.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t IN SOME PLACES, IT\u2019S JUST ANOTHER TUESDAY\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, November 26, 2005", "body": "\n\t \n       [Note:  the following post is NOT about Dr. Buttar or about the relative merits of IV-EDTA; it\u2019s about who I am and why I do this.  Please keep that in mind when posting comments.] Like most bloggers, I spend a little time every now and then checking out what other people are saying.  I try to include blogs by people with whom I disagree and yet respect.  One such blog I visit on occasion is Kevin Leitch\u2019s  Left Brain/Right Brain .  Although Kev usually maintains an appropriate tone of civility, the public comments to his posts always seem to degenerate into bitter mud fights because people on both sides of the issue can\u2019t seem to control themselves.  For that reason, I decided not to post comments there as often as I once did.  Sometimes, though I feel compelled to join in the conversation, hoping to make it a dialog of diverse ideas, but a recent experience shows the folly in doing so. Kev  posted  his thoughts on recent reports that Dr. Rashid Buttar now offers IV-EDTA as a chelation protocol.  I really don\u2019t know Dr. Buttar; in fact, I may be the only person on the internet that does not have strong feelings one way or the other about the man.  But I do maintain an interest in various biomedical protocols that are being tried in the autism world, and that interest includes finding out why IV-EDTA has been used by some doctors.  I left a simple comment on Kev\u2019s post trying to explain its place in the biomedical world, and, as could be predicted, the attack came.  This time, it was from \u201cMs. Clark.\u201d Here\u2019s an excerpt from the first salvo she fired in my direction: Wade Rankin, you have no idea what you are talking about. \u2026 I wish you and your friends, and people like Craig Westover, would stop influencing parents to chelate their kids when you yourselves have no idea of what you are discussing. You pass around third-rate, third-hand knowledge and if you think that you couldn\u2019t contribute to another child\u2019s death you are wrong. Where is your conscience in this? I\u2019m really appalled at your behavior, not that you should care what I think of you, but I really must comment. I hope you will all stop playing doctor before another child is killed. Ms. Clark gives me far too much credit.  If she saw my Site Meter reports, she would know my capacity for influence is pretty darn limited.  Heck, I think I\u2019m probably on a first-name basis with everyone who visits the site.  And judging by the comments that are usually left, I can\u2019t think of anyone who I\u2019ve influenced to try any particular protocol.  I can only think of one post that I devoted to the particulars of biomedical treatments for ASD, and that one was pretty much ignored (for good reason; it was not my best stuff).  Even that one emphasized that parents who wanted to consider a biomedical approach should only do so in consultation with a qualified physician, and should educate themselves on every aspect of the process.  I made the same point that I state pretty often whenever and wherever I write about all this; there is no one-size-fits-all solution. After I responded at Kev\u2019s blog to some specific mischaracterizations by Ms. Clark, she favored me with yet another comment, and that\u2019s when I decided to write this post.  I suppose I could have posted it as another comment to Kev\u2019s blog, but that would have taken the discussion too far from his original point.  In any event, Ms. Clark\u2019s second comment that spurred me to respond went back to her original accusation: You are influencing people to believe that autism can be caused mercury poisoning.  That\u2019s what I believe. If my opinion is not true in the least, then no parents will say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry my child is dead now. I wish I hadn\u2019t believed that autism was the result of mercury poisoning, but we thought that Mr. Rankin had some crediblity and that he must know what he was talking about since he\u2019s a lawyer and educated, and he\u2019s so nice, too.\u201d Ms. Clark probably doesn\u2019t read much of what I write.  While it\u2019s true that I believe thimerosal exposure played a key role in the dramatic increase in autism rates in recent years, and I further believe it played a key role in the development of ASD in my own child, it\u2019s not the whole story.  Indeed, I am somewhat of a heretic in that I think ASD is too complex of an issue to place all of the blame on one factor.  But that being said, I\u2019ll accept as true that I have stated that mercury poisoning can help trigger ASD.  I still find Ms. Clark\u2019s estimation of my influence -- and her underestimation of the intelligence of parents with children on the spectrum -- to be laughable. I can just picture parents sitting around discussing worries over their child, and one says to the other:  \u201cLet\u2019s go to that nice lawyer\u2019s blog \u2026 you know, the one who talks about everything but science.  He\u2019ll tell us what to do.\u201d  Give me a break.  I concentrate my efforts on issues other than the science of autism.  I tend to address educational issues, the semantics that unfortunately separate the biomedical and neurodiversity communities, the hypocrisy of some vaccine manufacturers, the ridiculousness spouted by one particular doctor, and the propriety of seeking a cure for ASD.  The closest I come to writing about scientific issues comes when I discuss the lunacy of the IOM\u2019s reliance on very flawed epidemiological studies.  To a certain extent, science has to be mentioned as part of my general discussions, but science is not the focus.  I\u2019m more interested in improving the tone of the dialog than I am in trying to win a debate.    Ms. Clark apparently feels my failure to debate anyone on the scientific studies is because I either haven\u2019t looked at the science or because I don\u2019t understand it: You have bought a lie if you think that in any way your child has become autistic because of mercury in vaccines and that any form of chelation will help an autistic child become less autistic. If you can counter my statement with science then do it.  But you can\u2019t. I have looked at the science.  I don\u2019t know what you are looking at but it\u2019s junk if it\u2019s telling you that any treatment to remove any heavy metal is going to cure your child or in any way rewire his brain. Teaching him can rewire his brain, up to a point.  Mercury is not going to stop him from learning and taking out imaginary or real mercury is not going to improve his learning to the point where he can learn not to be autistic. What about the minicolumns, what about the Purkinje celsl[sic]?  What about the extra white matter.  Have you read any of Casanova or Courchesne\u2019s work? It might surprise Ms. Clark to know that I have looked at the types of studies she mentions, including some of the work of Dr. Manuel Casanova and Dr. Eric Courchesne.  In fact I even understand them pretty well.  The fact that certain brain architecture is found in some autistics does not necessarily tell me that the clinical indications by which our children are diagnosed with ASD were not triggered in whole or in part by an environmental insult.  Nor does the fact that an increase in brain size -- after birth -- has been noted to coincide with diagnosed autism does not necessarily mean that environmental insults, including but not limited to mercury poisoning, do not play a role in causing autistic dysfunction.  A decrease in Purkinje cells certainly makes sense in all models of autism to explain the hows but not the whys. All the studies Ms. Clark mentions, along with numerous genetic and neurological studies not usually cited by \u201cour\u201d crowd, have a place in our developing understanding of the autism spectrum.  The biological and clinical studies we more often cite (e.g., James, Burbacher, Hornig, Deth, Wakefield)  also contribute to our understanding of the problem.  But none of the studies begins to tell the whole story.  Despite a mountain of paper, science has only begun to scratch at the surface of autism.  We can\u2019t even agree on what autism is! And that\u2019s why I avoid debating science; there\u2019s simply not enough to debate.  Until we know enough to start putting together the pieces, all we can do is talk in broad generalities.  That\u2019s why the main comment I make on science is that we need more of it. I will gladly admit that Ms. Clark may know more than I about the specifics of some studies bearing on a particular model of autism.  But just as I believe ASD is too complex to be explained by an explanation that it is merely misdiagnosed mercury poisoning, I likewise believe that neurological studies do not tell the whole story.  I cannot and will not debate someone who refuses to acknowledge that autism is about more than what the brain looks like. It is no secret that I believe we are in the midst of an autism epidemic (something Ms. Clark disagrees with, I know), that the epidemic results from increased exposure to environmental insults in genetically predisposed children, and that it may be possible to reduce or eliminate some of the clinical manifestations of ASD by various protocols.  I don\u2019t claim to be an expert in any of this.  I am only a parent trying to make sense of it all.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/home.php", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=308"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/11/ms-clark.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t MS.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 21, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      A story was reported recently in the Canadian press that was of interest to me as it involves Michelle Dawson.  It has been quite some time since Ms. Dawson left any comments on this blog.  She is well known in the autism world as an extremely high-functioning adult autistic with very strong opinions.  Although I disagree with many of those opinions, the intelligence with which she states her views is undeniable.  And intelligence is what the recent story is all about. An  article in  The Globe and Mail  discusses a recent study released by a group of researchers led by Dr. Laurent Mottron, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal.  Despite having no college education, Ms. Dawson has become an integral part of Dr. Mottron\u2019s team researching autism.  Their most recent published study indicates that autistic children who might score in the retarded range on the standard Wechsler I.Q. test actually score closer to the level of a college student on the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices.  Their conclusion is that autistic children tend to be more intelligent than once was thought. It\u2019s nice to know that science is finally catching up to what most parents of autistic children already know; our children are smart.  That point is a rare point of agreement between both sides of the  needless conflict  between so-called  neurodiversity  advocates and those of us they refer to as \u201ccurebies.\u201d  The issue that leads to disagreement may be summed up by questions posed by Dr. Mottron in the article:  \u201cWhat do we do with that intelligence?  How do we let that person achieve his potential?\u201d  If Dr. Mottron\u2019s research leads to increased opportunities for autistic individuals \u23af without regard for their level of \u201cfunctioning\u201d \u23af I would be happy indeed.  How can anyone really argue with that goal.  But Ms. Dawson has other goals as well: She makes no secret of the fact that her participation in the research is guided by self-interest, that it gives her more credibility when she is fighting other battles \u2014 of which there are many. In much of the autistic community \u2014 support groups dominated by parents of autistic children \u2014 Ms. Dawson is public enemy number one. \u201cThey want autism to be a sickness that needs to be cured,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say horrible disgusting things so they can get more money for their lobby groups. They make me sick,\u201d Ms. Dawson said. Personally, I have never considered Ms. Dawson an enemy, much less \u201cpublic enemy number one.\u201d  I\u2019m not a part of any \u201clobby group,\u201d nor do I raise any money for a \u201clobby group.\u201d  I respect Ms. Dawson and agree with much of what she says.  And yet there is so much with which I disagree. If Ms. Dawson has become controversial, it has much to do with her crusade against anything that might smack of labeling autism as a disability.  She famously intervened in the  Auton  case, in which parents went to court to get the British Columbia government to fund ABA for their autistic children.  The catch was that it had to be established that ABA was a medically necessary treatment.  There were certainly arguments to be made in the case; I certainly wouldn\u2019t argue that treating autism as a mental disorder is factually incorrect.  But Ms. Dawson\u2019s  Factum  to the Supreme Court attacks the morality of intervention: 62.   Ms Dawson submits that if the Respondents\u2019 position is adopted, autistic people will not have the same equality rights enjoyed by non-autistics. Autistic people will be seen as unworthy and undeserving of equal protection and benefit of the law. Their equality rights will amount to an obligation to be or to act much less autistic or not autistic at all. 63.   Further, accepting the Respondents\u2019 position will have the direct effect of demeaning all autistic individuals and rewarding those who have chosen to demean autistics in order to fulfill their goals. I wish Ms. Dawson would stop seeing people like me as the enemy.  Most of us have no intention of forcibly making every autistic individual undergo any particular intervention, be it ABA, RDI, biomedical, or anything else.  But many autistic children need some form of intervention.  Not all of them are destined to find ways to meaningfully utilize their intelligence in the way Ms. Dawson has without intervention. The arguments about the nature of autism and whether it acts as a disability so often center on the issues of intelligence and pure science.  To be sure, it would be stupid to  summarily dismiss the value of studies like that which Dr. Mottron\u2019s group has given us.  I can\u2019t help but think, however, that we err by concentrating on simply the question of intelligence, while we ignore the social and cultural questions that also define dysfunction. Ms. Dawson correctly argues that autistic individuals should not be forced to think or act like so-called \u201cnormal\u201d people.  Nevertheless, the human race has a social construct that favors those that are able to use their individual gifts in ways that benefit society as a whole.  We may struggle to change the negative views that have traditionally been assigned to autism, but humankind\u2019s basic social nature will not change.  Even for someone like Ms. Dawson, who has overcome adversity and prejudice to a remarkable extent, making a contribution is not easy.  Again, from  The Globe and Mail  article : . . . Like many autistics, Ms. Dawson has reduced social skills and, while she can put forward brilliant ideas, she is incapable of managing simple tasks that are essential to the research process. \u201cI have some spectacular deficits,\u201d Ms. Dawson said matter-of-factly. Nevertheless, Dr. Mottron said \u201cshe is changing the way the world views autism and that will have a lasting impact.\u201d I don\u2019t dispute Ms. Dawson\u2019s positive impact on the way autistic individuals are viewed by the neurotypical world.  I only wish she would not judge us \u23af and especially not judge our children \u23af based solely on her own experience.  For that, too, is stereotyping.

According to that stereotype, we are all desperate parents who can\u2019t face the fact that our genetic makeup will prevent our children from living up to the aspirations we have for them, and so we are willing to risk their health and well-being by resorting to dangerous treatments.  The only part of that description that might fit is the word \u201cdesperate.\u201d Yes, I\u2019m desperate.  I\u2019m desperate to help my son achieve a measure of independence.  I\u2019m desperate to prevent my son growing up to be seen as a victim.  I\u2019m desperate to see my son grow up with no barriers to hold him back.  In other words, I\u2019m a normal parent. For awhile, I was getting wary of even mentioning the word \u201ccure,\u201d mainly because it seems to mean something different things to different people.  I tried to explain  my concept of a cure  for autism, and hopefully I can use the word again and it can be understood that I am not trying to alter the laws of nature.  So, why do we feel it necessary to resort to what some think of as experimental medicine to cure our children? Ginger, over at  Adventures in Autism , has addressed the \u201cwhy\u201d question in a couple of recent posts.  First, in \" How Autism Threatens Children's Lives ,\" she passed on a recent news item about a young autistic boy who was found walking down the street in a town to which his family just moved.  My immediate reaction was to recall the most terrifying 10 minutes of my life.  We were in DisneyWorld not quite two years ago, and my son managed to elope from the stroller without our noticing his absence.  The story had a happy ending; between a wonderfully trained staff and a big assist from the most potent child-finding force in the world, the volunteer \u201cmommy brigade,\u201d we soon had our son back in our arms.  But at the time, \u201csoon\u201d seemed like an eternity. My son could not tell anyone who he was, who his parents were, or even that he was lost.  A mother who heard us describing our boy to the security staff walked up a hundred yards or so, saw him standing off to the side, and found the nearest employee (oops, sorry Mickey, I mean \u201ccast member\u201d).  Had that happened anywhere other than DisneyWorld, would we have had our happy ending? Ginger\u2019s post drew a comment from  Kevin , a blogger from the \u201cother side\u201d with whom I have developed a mutual respect and something of a friendship despite strong differences in opinion.  Kev didn\u2019t see how a lost child is related to a parent\u2019s desire to \u201ccure\u201d the child\u2019s autism.  Specifically, Kev, the parent of an autistic child questioned the right to make a decision to cure: \u2026 if our daughter came home to us in her teens and said on balance she wanted to be \u201ccured\u201d then I would move heaven and earth to make that happen.  What we all do, we do for our kids right?  But who are we to make such a drasticaly altering choice as \u201ccuring\u201d their autism when they can have no appreciation of the way it would alter the core of who they were as people? Ginger\u2019s response was nothing short of perfect: Who are we?  We are their parents. Making choices that will impact who our children will become is the blessing and burden of parenthood.  We have to make HUGE choices for our children and we don\u2019t get to find out the final impact and totality of those choices until their lives and personalities completely unfold. We are flying with blinders on, with the only view in the rear view mirror and out the side windows, and we can only make the best choices we can make with that information.  Every time we make a choice for our children, we unchoose every other possibility for them. Ginger expanded on the subject with a post entitled \" Does Autism Treatment Change Personality ,\" in which she explained: \u2026 I think we have different ideas of what \u201ccure\u201d means.  To me it is that he [Ginger\u2019s son, Chandler] would no longer fit the DSM IV criteria.  Most specifically, and most importantly, he would be able to accurately size up his environment, act appropriately in his own best interests and advocate for himself. You see, the point is not trying to keep our children from being lost in a theme park or on the streets of a new city.  It\u2019s to keep our children from being lost in the world! In addressing the usual criticism of seeking a cure -- that we\u2019re robbing our children of that which makes them unique -- Ginger again hit the nail on the head: The changes we have seen in Chandler have not made him different so much as they have made him \u2018more\u2019.  We are finding that he has talents we didn\u2019t know he had because now he uses them and even shares them with us. I certainly recommend reading  the entire post .     My wife and I remain committed to using whatever means seem appropriate to help reverse the dysfunctional characteristics we see in our son.  That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have bad days.  But we often have the kind of day that opens our eyes to see the progress our son has made. The other day I was talking to a good friend of ours who now lives in Texas, having lost the family home in New Orleans to Katrina.  It has been a few months since I last saw her son, and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing in the background of the conversation.  A six-year old child who just a few short months ago was struggling to put words together, was now stringing multiple sentences together in real conversations.  He now shows interest in other people, and most especially, the feelings of other people.  What made the difference?  His biomedical treatment progressed to the point where chelation was added to the mix, and metals are being removed from his tissues. That young man and my son have a long way to go before we can say they have reached maximum improvement.  But we see improvement that seems to be related to particular changes in protocols.  Yes, it would be nice to wait for the science to be all in place so we could know exactly what will work and what won\u2019t.  Autism, however, is a complex problem, and learning the solutions will take a long time.  It may be that we will never learn one solution, because the impact on each child is so different.  Perhaps the exact combination of genetic and environmental factors that leads to autism in each child is different. We do what we can.  As part of a responsible decision-making process, we weigh the potential benefits of any treatment against the known risks.  And it doesn\u2019t take much risk to outweigh uncertain benefits.  Our friend in Texas put it this way:  \u201cI would rather have my wonderful boy the way he was than to put him in harm\u2019s way.\u201d   That statement shows the biggest fallacy in the stereotyped view so many hold of us.  They think we\u2019re only concerned with the destruction of our own self-image and our own dreams.  Those who think of us in that way can\u2019t see into our hearts.  If they could, they would see that our response was, is, and ever shall be about the kids.  I believe that those parents who reject biomedical interventions have the same motivations, the same fears, and the same love for their children.  Their decisions may be right for their children; I am in no position to judge anyone but me. Yes, we all do what we can.  None of us, regardless of how we view and respond to our children\u2019s ASD, know any other way to raise our kids.  We\u2019re parents.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/how-autism-threatens-childrens-lives.html", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/home.php", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/does-autism-treatment-change.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/does-autism-treatment-change.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/why.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WHY\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, April 29, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n       It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve posted anything.  Life has been a little too hectic.  That\u2019s what happens when your autistic child recovers to the point that he gets involved in the world around him. I\u2019ve also been involved in helping with some of the arrangements for an extraordinary event that will take place next month.  And I\u2019d like to invite everyone to be a part of it.. It\u2019s called  The American Rally for Personal Rights , and it will be held in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park on May 26, 2010.  Starting in the late morning, there will be a family gathering, and the formal rally program begins at 3:00 p.m. The reasons for being there are becoming more apparent every day. Americans are steadily losing the right to direct the course of their own health care.  The \u201creform\u201d of the health-care system has the potential to strip us of rights to choose particular treatments.  Congress is also currently considering measures that threaten to greatly increase the cost of safe alternatives to prescription pharmaceuticals or even take many such supplements off the market altogether (even though the Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2010 ran into some roadblocks, Senator Henry Waxman is trying to revive the threat by slipping it into a fiscal reform measure And then there\u2019s the single greatest intrusion into our ability to choose effective health care for our families:  the vaccine schedule promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and school districts nationwide.   Why does the overall health of our citizens keep declining as the vaccine schedule expands?  Why are we seeing a sharp increase in autism, allergies, and other auto-immune disorders?  Why are babies inoculated for Hepatitis B \u23af a disease spread primarily through unprotected sex and intravenous drug use \u23af on the first day of their life, before their immune systems are developed?  Most importantly, why do we, as citizens of a nation that values freedom, not have the right to determine which vaccines our children receive, and when they will receive them? The reach into this most basic of personal decisions has an impact on adults as well as children.  Throughout the country, health-care workers are forced to submit to vaccinations for influenza.  It is not a stretch to imagine that many more of us, including police and teachers will be next.  Billions of dollars were spent on the false swine flu pandemic of 2009.  It is now recommended that all Americans over 6 months of age get the flu shot (most available doses contain thimerosal).  We\u2018ve been told that the 2010\u20132011 flu shot will contain the H1N1 strain, despite several adverse reactions (including development of Guillen-Barre).  It\u2019s even being recommended that sixth-grade boys get the HPV vaccine (which was disingenuously justified to the American public as a preventative for cervical cancer).  Where will it al end \u23af with Paul Offit\u2019s dream of 10,000 vaccines?   The American public must take a large and visible stand against further intrusion into our lives. All of this is being done with copious cover being provided by the mainstream media, whose presentations have, in effect, been bought by powerful interests.  Even PBS has not been immune (no pun intended) from the influence of a lot of money.  Its recent  Frontline  program on the vaccine wars perpetuated the falsehood that the controversy is between science on the one side and a bunch of deluded parents on the other.  The producers chose not to present anything \u23af or even mention the existence of \u23af all of the physicians, scientists, researchers and public-health experts who question the safety of the current vaccine program.  Instead we just got the usual suspects ( e.g. , Paul Offit) offering sound bite after sound bite with no mention of their own vested interests.  And how can any unbiased look at the issue discuss the Danish studies without even mentioning the criticisms leveled at the methodology (or lack thereof). Those of us who will gather in Chicago will, of course, be labeled as \u201canti-vaccination\u201d activists.  I have a lot of problems with semantic oversimplifications in general, and this one in particular.  This is not about condemning the concept of vaccination.  This is about the right to choose what vaccinations your child should get, and when he/she should get them. Do not miss this opportunity to join with others who believe that compulsory vaccination cannot be legally and morally justified and that Americans should have the freedom to make personal health care decisions guided by the professionals of our choosing.  You can hear what  Dateline  didn\u2019t tell you.   Whether you attend or not, you can help support the rally (which is an expensive undertaking) by clicking on the \u201cChip In\u201d widget on the sidebar of this blog.

{"date": "Thursday, January 28, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      During the struggle to try and secure civil rights for all Americans in the sixties, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. found himself incarcerated in Birmingham, Alabama.  His time in jail was put to good use, as he wrote a letter to a group of clergymen who, although sympathetic to Dr. King\u2019s cause, were critical of the Birmingham demonstrations as being too confrontational.  In other words, Dr. King was rocking the boat. The letter Dr. King wrote from the jail, in my opinion, is one of the greatest pieces of prose in the English language, a call for all to do what is right.  The whole letter is summed up in its most famous sentence: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Those were the first words that came to me when I heard of the decision by the GMC in the ethics case against Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues, John Walker-Smith and Simon Murch. Their wrong was simply to tell the truth.  There were others who joined in the  Lancet  case study that found a potential connection between the MMR vaccine and autistic enterocolitis.  The others were pressured to repudiate the article \u2013 or to say it more accurately, to repudiate a finding that was not made by the study.  Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues never stated that the vaccine caused autism, but merely that there was a need for further study.   Even the recommendation for further study was a threat to a lot of powerful influences in the public health establishment and its allies in the pharmaceutical industry.  And the Wakefield findings have been replicated on more than one occasion, so merely throwing competing studies out there would not kill the controversy. Enter Brian Deer, a British \u201cjournalist\u201d looking to make a bigger name for himself.  By mangling together two different studies and reports Dr. Wakefield participated in, Deer presented ethics charges that objectively do not hold water.  But the charges were not to be heard objectively. For an excellent and dispassionate look at the charges and their fallacy, see the article by William Long (originally printed in  The Autism File ), which can be found  here  in pdf format. Now, after years of proceedings, wasting God-knows-how-much money and resources, the General Medical Council found that there were violations.  As a result, Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues will likely lose their professional licenses.  Ironically, the evidence presented to the GMC against the three was primarily testimony by witnesses with far more-extensive conflicts of interest than those ascribed to Dr. Wakefield (see  here ). Of course, there will be many who will say that this outcome proves the fallacy of the case study\u2019s conclusions.  It is a further piece of irony, that those who will most loudly deliver that collateral attack include many of the same people who would defend epidemiological studies performed by those with fatal conflicts of interest. I listened to live coverage of the verdict on the  Linderman Live  program on  Autism One Radio .  I heard that Brian Deer made a statement that, \u201cit\u2019s a great day for children, a great day for medicine, and \u2013 dare I say \u2013 a great day for journalism.\u201d No Mr. Deer, in fact it is a tragic day for children, a tragic day for medicine and science, and \u2013 dare I say \u2013 a tragic day for journalism.  We\u2019ve already seen over on this side of the pond the kind of yellow journalism practiced by Deer.  The once mighty  Chicago Tribune  has sold itself to the powerful interests who are more interested in the status quo than they are the truth. Even if we were to take the provincial position that today\u2019s announcement was an injustice only in the UK, there is a serious threat to justice here in the US.  Without doubt, there will be moves made against many of the physicians and scientists who are helping our children.  And the truth may not be a strong enough defense for them. The truth will only be strong enough to defend us all when the emerging science progresses to the irrefutable point, at which time the Paul Offits, Julie Gerberdings, and Brian Deers of the world will not be able to deny what has happened to our children.  Unfortunately, the research needed to bring out that truth is not being funded. The attacks on Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues are also attacks on us and on our children.  We stand with them.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wesupportandywakefield.com/documents/AutismFile_US31_Wakefield.pdf", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/01/-false-testimony-denies-lancet-doctors-a-fair-hearing.html", "http://www.autismone.org/content/autismone-radio"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/01/threat-to-justice-everywhere.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, January 21, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      January 21, 2010 Mr. Tony Hunter President, Publisher Chicago Tribune Company 435 North Michigan Avenue Chicago, IL 60611   Dear Mr. Hunter: A few days ago, we called the circulation department to cancel our subscription to  The Chicago Tribune .  We thought it appropriate to write and explain why we thought this necessary.  Put briefly, the  Tribune\u2019s  continuing written assault on the autism community and those who serve us has caused us to lose the high degree of respect we once held for your newspaper.  Specifically, articles written (or co-written) by Trine Tsouderos have, in our opinion, strayed from the principles of balance, fairness, and the truth. By way of background explanation, our family is one of the hundreds of thousands in this country who have felt the impact of the autism epidemic.  We are part of a growing number of people who have chosen not to meekly embrace our son\u2019s disability, but rather to seek biological explanations for the clinical manifestations that led to the diagnosis and to utilize the best medical treatments to treat the underlying physical conditions.  We are not alone on this journey, and like most of the parents who embark on this course, we are well-educated.  Both of us have professional backgrounds (including a background in mainstream medicine). Each case of autistic spectrum disorder is unique from a standpoint of both cause and treatment.  We have utilized some so-called \u201calternative\u201d therapies together with more traditional treatments.  The continued improvement of our son\u2019s clinical manifestations has been nothing short of remarkable.  Our story is not unique; there are many of us who have seen first-hand the success that can result from treating underlying physical conditions instead of just the symptoms by which autism traditionally has been defined. Many in our community have attempted to speak to Ms. Tsouderos about the healing we have seen in our children, but she has shown little interest in exploring our perspectives.  Instead, she chooses to rely on the same talking points we have so often heard from groups and individuals with vested interests, while ignoring scientific studies providing a basis for the treatments..  On those occasions when she does quote someone \u2013 whether a parent, a practitioner or a scientist \u2013 that quote is invariably taken out of context and is either inaccurate or incomplete.  For example, an article this past November, mined several quotes from Dr. Martha Herbert, a distinguished neurologist at Harvard.  This was Dr. Herbert\u2019s response to the  Tribune , which your paper chose to ignore: I did a rather long interview with the Tribune to explain my thoughts on chelation and additional approaches to solving the health issues connected to autism. The only consequence of my interview is that you use a solitary quote to make me sound contentious and defensive.  Is there a reason you chose not to use something I said that would actually illuminate the discussion surrounding chelation and other medical treatments for medical compromises that may exist in these children? To be sure, this is a complex and often controversial subject.  The  Tribune\u2019s  editorial stance on autism treatments, however, seems inconsistent with other positions it has taken.  Recently, your paper printed an expos\u00e9 on overuse of drugs at nursing homes, a worthwhile subject.  Why is the only focus of your autism coverage upon so-called \u201calternative\u201d treatments?  Why is no attention paid to the frighteningly large number of physicians who want to treat autistic children under the age of five with dangerous stimulants and psychiatric pharmaceuticals? And why does the Tribune not show outrage at the fact that the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses that off-label usage of pharmaceuticals in their published treatment recommendations for autism? The  Tribune  has run recent articles on rising numbers of allergies (including one noting the difficulties the Army is having in filling its ranks due to high incidences of allergies and asthma).  Is your paper at all interested in exploring the interrelationship in the alarming rise of various auto-immune disorders:  childhood cancer, asthma, allergies, ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (although not unanimous, more and more scientists are acknowledging that disorders in the immune system can cause clinical manifestations of autism)?   Our kids are the canaries in the coal mine.  Something is going wrong with an entire generation, and it is rooted in environmental causes:  adulteration of our food supply, chemical pollution, contamination of our water, overuse of antibiotics, and quite possibly a public vaccination schedule gone haywire.  It\u2019s not just scientific research that\u2019s needed to put these puzzle pieces together; we also need the illumination of the questions in order to solving the questions a public priority.   The role of the press is to present the issues in such a manner as to fairly raise the questions.  In that, the Tribune has fallen well short of its duty. The articles by Ms. Tsouderos were given front-page treatment, including the latest, which came at a time when every other organ of the press was focused squarely on the recent tragedy in Haiti.  The lack of proportionality in that is summed up in one question.  Why did the  Tribune  not show equal alarm with a major front-page article last month, when the Centers for Disease Control announced new autism statistics?  According to the CDC, autism spectrum disorders effect one-in-110 children (one-in\u201370 boys), which is a dramatic increase from the one-in 150 the CDC announced just two years ago.    This country is facing a public-health crisis of catastrophic proportions, in which too many families are having to make difficult decisions.  Instead of amplifying the seriousness of the situation, the  Tribune  has chosen to blindly criticize some of the scientists and clinicians who are searching for the answers. We have no doubt that the loss of our subscription will have little economic impact on your company.  Further, the publication of the articles in question will have little adverse impact on the  Tribune\u2019s  reputation \u2013 at least not immediately.  What the  Tribune  has lost, however, is far more precious.  It has lost the integrity upon which the paper\u2019s reputation was built through generations.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      Fairly soon after our open letter to the  Chicago Tribune  (see last entry) was  reposted at Age of Autism , some fellow by the name of Prescott Carlson posted a criticism at Chicagoist.  That entry, entitled  Parents of Autistic Boy Rail on Trib for \u201cEditorial Bias,\u201d  referred to the letter as a \u201clengthy screed.\u201d    Reading through Mr. Carlson\u2019s brief post gave me the distinct impression that somehow the meaning of our letter had gotten lost, and that left me in a bit of a quandary.   I felt an explanation was in order (even though the letter itself was already pretty clear), but a real explanation needs a little length, something which Mr. Carlson apparently disapproves of.  So it would be rude to post a lengthy explanation as a comment at the Chicagoist, but here, on my own blog, I can be as long-winded as I please.  Length of prose is always a delicate matter of balance.  Too short, and the message might not be clear.  Too long, and some readers might focus on individual trees rather than the forest.  Such is the case here.  Mr. Carlson stated that we: accuse Tsouderos of \u201c[straying] from the principles of balance, fairness, and the truth\u201d in her articles, and even hinted that the Trib's deciding to focus on the subject at all was misguided, saying: The articles by Ms. Tsouderos were given front-page treatment, including the latest, which came at a time when every other organ of the press was focused squarely on the recent tragedy in Haiti. We did not attempt to imply that the  Tribune\u2019s  exploration of the issue was \u201cmisguided.\u201d  Had that sentence been read in the context of the complete paragraph from which it was cherry picked, the point becomes obvious.   Believing that the OSR story (or non-story depending on one\u2019s opinion) was more important than the tragedy in Haiti is a bit ridiculous, especially when the same paper has yet to devote any appreciable space anywhere in the front section to the latest CDC numbers released in December.   The  Tribune  is unwilling to acknowledge there is a public health crisis, but they are sure willing to say they know how not to treat the non-crisis.  That is not just an editorial bias; it is nonsensical.   Moreover, the  Tribune  reporters have gone about their work in an intellectually dishonest manner.  I spoke to one parent who Ms. Tsouderos interviewed for one of her early stories; that parent felt she had been lied to by a reporter who kept leading her into statements that did not reflect what was truly intended.  And it\u2019s not just parents Ms. Tsouderos misquotes.  As was noted in our letter, a distinguished physician and scientist at Harvard, Dr. Martha Herbert, complained about being quoted out of context, resulting a misleading expression of Dr. Herbert's opinions.  But accurately quoting Dr. Herbert or any of the other qualified doctors and scientists who are looking into potential treatments does not serve the  Tribune\u2019s  bias.  It\u2019s far easier for them to paint a picture of Dr. Boyd Haley as a snake-oil salesman than it is to acknowledge his extensive qualifications and his solid research. I generally try to steer clear of discussing specific interventions and protocols we use.  I will say that, based on what we have heard and seen, the Lupron protocol and OSR #1 (both of which were the subjects of  Tribune  smear pieces) may be appropriate treatments in particular circumstances.   Each autistic child presents a unique clinical picture.  What is right for one is not necessarily right for another.   Whether a particular intervention is appropriate for an individual depends on the nature of the problems underlying the autistic symptoms, and should be chosen after a careful weighing of potential benefits against risks. The  Tribune , however, is not interested in the successes of our families, as they do not sell papers as well as sensationalism does.  Nor is Ms. Tsouderos interested in the successes parents have had.  For it\u2019s far easier to get promoted to science reporter from the entertainment beat if you write a sensational expos\u00e9 rather than a human interest story about families helping their kids. It\u2019s all a matter of proportionality.  One of the comments left at the Chicagoist illustrates the lack of recognition that the  Tribune\u2019s  articles are far too choosy in picking their targets.  Somebody using the handle \u201cWard Up,\u201d wrote: The Rankins are frustrated and that is understandable. However, their frustration should not trump scientific evaluation. If an autism drug has not been proven in a randomized, prospective trial, then that drug cannot be recommended by the Tribune or by anyone, for that matter. Doing so would be a disservice to families of children with autism. The Tribune deserves praise for its articles on this subject. We need more light shined on these therapies to separate effective medicine from snake oil. You know what\u2019s frustrating, Ward?  I\u2019m frustrated that the same people \u2013 like Ms. Tsouderos, Mr. Carlson, and well \u2026 you \u2013 are so willing to decry so-called \u201calternative\u201d therapies, but very few of you seem to have a problem with the all-too-common pediatric practice of prescribing Ritalin, Risperdol or even Prozac to autistic children under the age of five.  Those are off-label uses of very dangerous controlled substances, and yet the FDA and AAP seem to condone it.  Where is your outrage about that?  Where is the  Tribune\u2019s  expos\u00e9 on that? There\u2019s nothing at all wrong about reporting on a controversial issue and newspapers are allowed to have an editorial bias.  That all adds to a healthy debate of issues, which was certainly contemplated by the drafters of the First Amendment.  Part of the bargain, however, is that the issue needs to be presented fairly, accurately, and completely.  The  Tribune  reneged on its part of the compact between itself and its readers, and that was our complaint.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/01/autism-father-to-chicago-tribune-cancel-my-subscription.html", "http://chicagoist.com/2010/01/25/parents_of_autistic_boy_rail_on_tri.php"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/01/here-i-go-railing-again.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t HERE I GO, RAILING AGAIN\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, May 13, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      Early in his movie career, Kevin Bacon played a character named Chip Diller, in the seventies classic,  Animal House .  His role was small, but he contributed two scenes that were oh-so-memorable. During a pledging ceremony at the evil and exclusive Omega house, young Chip is repeatedly paddled on his posterior.  With each new helping of pain and potential harm, the new pledge is made to exclaim, \u201cThank you sir, may I have another.\u201d  Later in the movie, we see Chip, dressed in his ROTC uniform, acting as a parade marshal for the homecoming festivities.  In response to the mayhem created by those bad boys from Delta house, Chip screams out that everyone should \u201cremain calm; all is well.\u201d  Of course, all is not well. I\u2019ve been thinking of Chip lately while observing the coverage \u23af or to be more precise, the lack of coverage \u23af of the disclosures that extraneous DNA from pig viruses (and other foreign bodies) was found in both of the Rotavirus vaccines. For a good discussion of the problem, see these posts ( here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here , and especially  here ) in  Age of Autism .   Here\u2019s the basic background.   First, in March GSK\u2019s Rotarix vaccine was found to contain DNA from PCV-1, a pig virus.  The FDA suspended its use, pending review.  Of course, in the meantime, that left the market clear for the sole competitor, Merck\u2019s RotaTeq (developed by our old pal, Paul Offitt).   Then shortly before the FDA hearings on the Rotarix tainting, it was discovered that the RotaTeq vaccine, in fact, contained DNA from two pig viruses, PCV-1 and PCV-2. The FDA meeting on the Rotarix fiasco occurred, predictably on a Friday.  Traditionally, Friday afternoon tends to be when one releases news that one hopes will never be heard.  The FDA\u2019s (in)action was all too predictable.  No vote on further suspension of the vaccines was taken.  Although the panel did say that further long-range studies were advisable, and that parents should be informed that the errant viruses were found in the vaccines (and, of course, Friday afternoon is the ideal time to disseminate that thought, isn\u2019t it?), the overall impression is that nobody on the panel thought there was any immediate concern. One of the FDA panel members,  Dr. Harry Greenburg, was quoted  as saying:  \u201cThe benefits (of the vaccine) far outweighs the risk.\u201d  Apparently there was a script floating around the meeting room, because another panelist,  Dr. Melinda Wharton, was quoted  as saying, \u201cBased on where we are with current knowledge, to me the known benefits clearly outweigh the risks.\u201d And that was the theme of the scant attention paid by the media.  The benefits outweigh the risks.  Remain calm; all is well.  That theme was based on two elements:  the vaccines are effective, and there is a low risk of infection. Despite lots of chatter in the media that the Rotavirus vaccines have been proven effective in preventing the disease, some studies presented to a recent WHO meeting, suggest that the  reported efficacy rates in specific countries vary and depend in large extent to the overall development  of the respective areas.  In other words, it is difficult to determine whether it\u2019s the vaccines that are preventing Rotavirus, or whether it\u2019s improvements in sanitation, water supplies, and health care. As to the risk of infection by humans, the FDA panel seems to take as gospel that there is little or no risk because there are no reported incidents of humans contracting PCV-1 or PCV-2 by ordinary contact with infected swine. Apparently pigs are quite choosy about what infections they will transmit to humans. Do the FDA panel members not appreciate that there might be a very real difference in transmission by external contact and by internal exposure to DNA?  And even if the panel members base their lack of concern on the fact that no vaccinated children have been reported as having the same symptoms as pigs display, the assumption seems to be that clinical manifestations by one species, with no real means of communicating \u201cwhere it hurts,\u201d would be identical to the clinical picture in a very different species.   Autistic kids \u23af at least those from families practicing biomedical interventions \u23af tend to be exhaustively tested.  Anecdotally, I am aware of numerous children on the spectrum who have been found to be carrying exotic diseases normally found only in primates, swine, and other non-human critters.  I am certainly not proclaiming that those diseases, which are likely contracted through routine vaccines, contribute to the triggering of autistic symptoms.  Nor do I know whether there is any harm at all.  And that\u2019s the point.  We really don\u2019t know.  Nobody has been concerned enough to fund appropriate studies. Maintaining a presumption of safety in the face of legitimate concerns does not serve our children\u2019s interest.  It serves only the profits of vaccine manufacturers and the eroding confidence in the sacred cow of public health:  the vaccine schedule. No, all is not well.  But the response by the CDC, AAP, FDA, and the rest of the alphabet soup that delivers our health care, is that we should grit our teeth and say:  \u201cThank you sir, may my child have another.\u201d \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077975/fullcredits#cast", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/fda-suspends-use-of-glaxosmithkline-rotavirus-vaccine-tainted-with-pig-virus.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/dna-from-pig-viruses-found-in-paul-offit-merck-rotateq-vaccine.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/dna-from-pig-viruses-found-in-paul-offit-merck-rotateq-vaccine.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/today-fda-public-meeting-to-discuss-dna-from-pcv1-in-rotavirus-vaccines-.html#more", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/fda-recommends-us-allow-use-of-rotavirus-vaccines-while-safety-being-studied.html#more", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/paul-offit-rotateq-pig-viruses-and-the-rest-of-the-world.html#more", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/fda-recommends-us-allow-use-of-rotavirus-vaccines-while-safety-being-studied.html#more", "http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0712973220100507", "http://www.examiner.com/x-40801-Vaccines-Examiner~y2010m5d13-Rotavirus-vaccines-Studies-on-efficacy-the-rest-of-the-story"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/05/all-is-not-well.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ALL IS NOT WELL\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Friday, May 07, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n        Last week I blogged about the  American Rally for Personal Rights , to be held in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park on May 26, 2010.  I thought I might say a little more about our personal commitment to this event and this cause. Questioning our country\u2019s regulation of vaccine safety could not be more timely.  Every day we hear about more and more extraneous viruses being found in vaccines.  A May 7th hearing by a FDA committee looked at such problems in the RotaRix vaccine, and it was acknowledged that there may be far more such viruses than have been identified.  That meeting came just one day after the announcement that the competing  RotaTeq vaccine developed by Paul \u201c10,000 in a day\u201d Offitt contained PCV1 and PCV2 virus DNA fragments .  That\u2019s right; kindly Doc O has been injecting our kids with a pig virus, with unknown effects on humans. Just seven weeks before that news came out, the FDA announced that there was no such contamination in the RotaTeq .  I wonder who at the FDA will get the same treatment afforded to Julie Gerberding, the former head of the CDC who is now the president of Merck\u2019s vaccine division, the same company that manufactures and sells \u23af you guessed it \u23af RotaTeq. Safety concerns are routinely swept under the rug, which should surprise no one considering the cozy relationship and revolving door between the industry and the agencies that are supposed to regulate it. It makes us mad that science has been perverted into a vehicle to make huge profits with no concern for the safety of the consumer.  And it makes us mad that our government aids and abets that process. My wife has spent her professional life working in hospitals, and has seen an explosion of chronic disease and autoimmune disorders in recent years.  All of this is happening in younger patients than ever before.   That\u2019s on top of the breath-taking rise in developmental disabilities in children.  And nobody is asking why.   The causes of all these problems are no doubt complex, and include various environmental exposures and a tainted food supply, but one can\u2019t help but observe that the rise in these problems has occurred at the same time our vaccine schedule has increased.  Unfortunately, it took something happening to our family to open our eyes. A few hours after he was born, our son\u2019s pediatrician injected him with a vaccine for Hepatitis B, which contained thimerosal. Our son\u2019s speech developed slower than normal, but he was otherwise a bright and engaging child. Like all good parents, we continued to let our child receive more vaccinations whenever our pediatrician said he was supposed to get them.  What else were we supposed to do? When he was a little over four-years-old, the Little Rankster received seven vaccines in one day.  Overnight, he stopped making eye contact, all of his developing speech disappeared, and he lost control over his emotions. Our son was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum.  We were told to put him on Ritalin, get him into a special school, and to start searching for an institution that would almost certainly be needed.  Instead, we looked for the reasons our son regressed.  It was then that we learned of the growing controversy and the possibility that vaccines or their components might play a role in triggering ASD.  Our response to all of this was to try undoing some of the damage vaccinations did. Almost immediately after commencing biomedical interventions, we started seeing remarkable improvements, and we continue to see that.  The Little Rankster has progressed far more than multiple \u201cexperts\u201d told us he would.  He functions quite well in a mainstream academic environment, sings in the school chorus, and this past year was elected by his classmates to serve on the student council.  We can\u2019t say he\u2019s completely \u201ccured,\u201d but he\u2019s a lot closer than we were told he could ever be.   Yet the whole time we have followed this path, the mainstream doctors who saw our son told us that everything we were doing was quackery and unproven, because there were no double-blind placebo studies.  The fact that our son has progressed remarkably, and is well on the road to a meaningful recovery, has impressed few of those mainstream physicians.  Truly, there are none so double blind as those who will not see. Those same doctors who told us we were following a false path, also told us that vaccines could not have played any role in triggering our son\u2019s ASD.  How could they be so sure?  Did they make detailed studies of the science themselves?  Well no, but they could assure us that public-health officials have studies the problem extensively, and have proved there is no connection.  Ah yes, let\u2019s just trust the public-health establishment \u23af an unholy alliance between government regulators and the institutions they\u2019re supposed to be regulating, and the  14 studies  they keep citing to reassure us that our concerns are unfounded. The problem is that nobody has yet asked the really hard questions.  The science is far from settled, and the more the public-health establishment keeps protesting that it is settled, the more we all have to wonder why they aren\u2019t interested in asking those hard questions.   Dr. Bernadine Healy, the former head of the National Institutes of Health, is one of the rare administrators who found a life outside of the industry.  She is a vaccine advocate, who nevertheless believes that  the issue is far from resolved .  Why did she have to wait until after she left the NIH before acknowledging doubt in the safety of vaccines for particular individuals, as opposed to the general population? The vaccine schedule is the sacred cow of public health.  The protectiveness shown by so many comes from two different sources.  For one group, it is purely a matter of profit; there\u2019s too much money to be made on vaccines.  The profit margin per dose may not be as high as some pharmaceutical products, but then again, there is no other product that is virtually mandatory for every child who will attend public school.  The other group of protectors are those who might realize there is some danger, but act on the misguided belief that collateral damage is acceptable for the protection of a larger number of the population. One-size-fits-all approaches to health care, though, are more than just bad medicine for individual patients; they represent a morally bankrupt policy.  No child should be sacrificed for a hypothetical \u201cgreater good.\u201d It is past time for our public health establishment to ask difficult questions about the official vaccination schedule and the harm that might be resulting.  Until those questions are asked, the regulators and regulated are not deserving of any credibility.  In the meantime, all parents should have the right to make informed medical choices that are right for their particular situations. The idea of a religious exemption recognized by some states is wrong not just because it encourages even atheist parents to claim religious views.  It is wrong because it robs parents of the right to weigh the potential benefits against known risks with regard to each vaccine on the schedule. As Americans, we deserve the right to make informed decisions regarding each medical procedure our children may undergo.  That includes vaccinations.  And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be at the American Rally for Personal Rights.  We owe it to our son, and we owe it to the grandchildren we will someday have.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/S-TYDkkq5ZI/AAAAAAAAAGg/1kup-XABIDM/s1600/web_banner_160x600.jpg", "http://www.americanpersonalrights.org/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/dna-from-pig-viruses-found-in-paul-offit-merck-rotateq-vaccine.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/fda-said-rotateq-did-not-contain-pcv1.html#more", "http://www.14studies.org/", "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/managing-your-healthcare/brain-and-behavior/articles/2008/04/10/fighting-the-autism-vaccine-war.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-rally.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WHY RALLY?\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      It\u2019s times like these that I always default to the plaintive cry of Rodney King:  \u201cCan we all just get along?\u201d We are not a rich family.  When I was actively engaged in the practice of law, I was very good, but I wasn\u2019t one of those guys who made piles of money.  The kind of practice I had and the region I in which I practiced were not conducive to wealth-building.   And of course, a child on the spectrum has a tendency to drain economic resources, even in a family with two working professionals. When we uprooted our family and  moved to build a better life for the Little Rankster , it was with the knowledge that life was not suddenly going to be easy.  The disparity in the cost of living meant going from a 3200-square-foot house on a quarter-acre lot to a 2000-square-foot townhome.   It\u2019s a very nice townhome, but a townhome nonetheless.  That means we have all the joys of having our next-door neighbor being just a common wall away.  It wasn\u2019t too bad for a year or so.  The neighbors kept pretty much to themselves, and didn\u2019t seem to require an explanation of the noises that very occasionally emanated from our side of the wall.  They had a baby of their own, and even having a typical child these days exposes one somewhat to the fact that there are a lot of kids out here on the spectrum.  Then they sold their unit. Our new neighbor was a young lady, in her early-to-mid twenties.  She seemed pleasant enough, and was terribly embarrassed when her little dog kept squeezing through the fence to come into our courtyard (I kept assuring her it was perfectly okay).   We first became aware of a problem in early April, when we got a phone message from the property manager who said she had received  \u201cseveral complaints and numerous e-mails regarding the noise\u201d coming from our unit.  She specifically mentioned our dog barking at an early hour, and \u201cwild banging on the walls.\u201d  She then threatened to take the matter to \u201cthe Board\u201d if we didn\u2019t eliminate the problem. We were taken aback by the fact that our neighbor (we are in an end unit with just one common wall, so there could be no doubt who the complaining individual was) would not simply approach us and discuss the matter as a neighbor.  Instead, she took her complaint to the property manager, who compounded the problem by letting \u201cseveral complaints\u201d amass before deciding to tell us. The dog thing was easily taken care of.   My wife and I both need to leave early for work, and we would occasionally let our dog out in the front courtyard to answer nature\u2019s call before we would leave him alone.  Captain Percival would signal the need to come back in with a bark.  In fact, there are other unit owners in the area who have their dogs out at that time of the morning, and there is often barking coming from across the street, but we assumed the objectionable noise came from our dog.  So we no longer let the dog out in the front during those hours, and I started getting up even earlier to take him out for a walk.  In other words, we considered that complaint to have a reasonable basis, and we acted accordingly as neighbors should. The wall banging was a little more difficult to deal with.  We assumed, though, that what our neighbor was hearing was the Little Rankster occasionally dealing with his sensory issues by banging on the tub during bath time, or very occasionally on his headboard when he was frustrated.  Those were the loudest things we could figure out that could be coming from our unit.  But he never, never banged on the wall. Armed with our assumptions \u23af and they were only assumptions since the property manager wouldn\u2019t return our calls and didn\u2019t provide (and still hasn\u2019t provided) copies of the complaints \u23af we wrote to management explaining the situation, and reminded her and the Board that the Fair Housing Act really took the situation out of their hands. It was really a matter to be discussed between neighbors, and we expressed our willingness to discuss the matter with out neighbor. And indeed our neighbor did come to discuss it.  Unfortunately, she chose a time in the morning when my wife was loading up the Little Rankster in the car to get him to before-school care and herself to work (I had long since left for work).  My wife let the young lady know that it was not a good time to discuss the matter and suggested that she come back later.  Our neighbor stormed off.  At a later date, after not hearing anything further, my wife tried to approach the neighbor, and was met with what can only be described as overt hostility. We heard nothing further until a couple of weeks ago, when we got a certified letter from an attorney claiming to represent our neighbor.  I noted that it was the same kind of letter I used to find myself writing for friends and regular clients, albeit not as well written as those I used to write.   Still the letter was interesting.  For one thing, counsel indicated that his client had begun complaining in the Fall of 2008.  That meant that several months had gone by before we were made aware of the situation.  Had our neighbor taken a chance on actually speaking to us directly when she first felt aggrieved, could we have talked it out?  I\u2019d like to think that would be the case for most people, but I\u2019m not so sure that would be the case here. You see, the letter referenced having been informed that one of our family members had a medical problem, which was leading to the noise.  She could only have heard that from the property manager:  the same property manager we instructed to keep our son\u2019s condition confidential, so that we could control the manner in which his ASD was explained.  We\u2019ve learned the hard way that leaving the explanations up to other people tends to result in the wrong message.  And indeed, in this case the manager\u2019s breach of our confidentiality create a misapprehension that no amount of explanation could cure.  There were little clues in the lawyer\u2019s letter that it was the ASD that was causing more of a problem than the noise itself.  Although counsel said he was \u201csensitive\u201d to our son\u2019s condition, he alleged that his client\u2019s \u201cown health has been detrimentally affected by the interruption of her sleep and by the stress caused by this constant pounding.\u201d  Moreover, it seems our neighbor\u2019s property values are also affected because \u201cno one who would be aware of this problem would want to buy her unit, and, given the severity of this on-going problem, the seller would be legally required to disclose it.\u201d If the problem is excess noise coming through the walls, a seller might be required to disclose a problem with construction, but to state that living next door to an autistic child decreases one\u2019s property value is absurd . . . and more than a little prejudicial. As it turns out, we no longer think our son is the source of the alleged noise problem.  That was short-sightedness on our part, caused primarily because we have never been given the opportunity to learn any specifics about the complaints.  But the lawyer letter cited an ongoing problem of pounding on the walls:  i.e., a problem that was continuing.  Again, there has never been any pounding on the walls.  More to the point, however, the Little Rankster\u2019s been going through several good months, and hasn\u2019t really been pounding on much of anything for a long time.   After reading the letter from learned counsel, I came to the conclusion that the problem stems primarily from our neighbor\u2019s unrealistic expectations about living in a home with common walls (be it an apartment, a condominium unit, or a townhome).  She is likely hearing the same things we hear from her side:  people walking on the stairs, washer/dryer activity (in her case, that activity has often been late at night), and dogs barking (our neighbor\u2019s dog is particularly enthusiastic about alerting passers to her presence).   None of these things are \u23af nor could they be \u23af as disruptive as our neighbor seems to believe. We could easily voice the same complaints about our neighbor that she has been so forceful in voicing.  It is true that there might be more noise of one kind coming from a unit with a child in it, regardless of whether that child is autistic or neurotypical.  Our child, on the other hand, has never thrown a loud party into the late hours (as our neighbor did on a recent Saturday), and our child does not leave behind a trail of cigarette butts on the sidewalk (one would think that someone who is in such a delicate state of health might want to refrain from smoking).  We never considered complaining about her conduct because we understand the setting we are living in, and we have adjusted our expectations accordingly. Any question that the problem is our neighbor\u2019s expectations was put to rest about a week after we got her attorney\u2019s letter.  I got home from work, and found a message on the machine.  That morning, probably no more than five minutes after my wife left for work, the 911 operator called to say that the police were outside and would like a word.  My wife called 911 and got the story.  Our neighbor had called in around 7:15 am, to report that there was an awful pounding on the walls that wouldn\u2019t stop.  By that time, the Little Rankster had been out of the house for at least 15 minutes.   The only thing that could have made the noise was the dryer my wife briefly ran to take care of something she need to wear to work.   That\u2019s right, the police were called out because we had the temerity to run the dryer after 7:00 am.  The police came, heard nothing and left.  Upon getting the whole story, the 911 operator had a pretty good laugh. There is an obvious irony here.  Some people label autistics as being self-absorbed and uncaring.  The Little Rankster most certainly does not fit that absurd stereotype.  But someone else surely does. Actually, now that we\u2019ve been up here for a while, we\u2019re starting to think about taking advantage of the low housing prices and look for a real house.  The only problem is selling our townhome.  Who would want to purchase our unit after we have to disclose what kind of neighbor we have?\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/07/self-absorption.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SELF-ABSORPTION\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Sunday, March 01, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      The other day,  Age of Autism  posted an item  about a recent article in  Pediatric News .  AoA labeled the article as \u201cirony.\u201d  I have a few other descriptive terms for it, but the bounds of civility precludes their use here. The  Pediatric News  article, by Dr. Barbara Howard , addresses the ongoing struggle many physicians have in convincing us that \u201call is well,\u201d despite all that we have seen and learned. Specifically, Dr. Howard is trying to give advice to her peers as to how they can regain a semblance of credibility as they attempt to tell us about the \u201cabundance of research disputing the connection between vaccines and autism,\u201d when at the same time the mainstream medical profession \u201cstill can\u2019t fully explain to parents or even [themselves] why rates of autism are increasing at a rapid clip.\u201d  Dr. Howard\u2019s willingness to accept the conclusions from that \u201cabundance of research,\u201d without truly looking at how those conclusions were reached, is typical of the intellectual laziness that permeates not just medicine but other professions as well.  In the legal field, we used to refer to such practitioners as being \u201chead note citers.\u201d  Those were the guys who, when writing a brief, cited certain cases for points that were abbreviated in a \u201chead note\u201d inserted by editors from the legal publishing house.  Yet when the judicial decision itself was read, it became crystal clear that the case was being wrongly cited.   That\u2019s how lawyers lose credibility with their audience (the court). A similar loss of credibility occurs when doctors tell us that the potential connection we worry about was disproven by the Danish studies, in which the criteria for inclusion in the populations studied changed between the two groups being compared.  And how can we believe in their professional judgment when they tell us that the Verstraeten study \u00ac\u23af which we know showed a link that was later lost after the Simpsonwood conference radically altered the parameters of the study, resulting in what the authors termed a \u201cneutral\u201d result neither proving nor disproving a connection \u23af likewise stands as concrete evidence that there are no safety concerns. Hey, I\u2019m still convincible.  All it would take is a little honest talk from a doctor armed with enough real science to refute the questions that have been raised.  But what do I know.   I\u2019m just one of those lay persons Dr. Howard referred to when she wrote: If their concerns are based on faulty logic or scientific confusion, remember that their theory could make perfect sense if you hadn\u2019t studied microbiology, immunology, physiology, and metabolism, not to mention statistics. There you have it:  the irony.  Once again, we\u2019re subjected to the myth that the only people feeding this issue are the uneducated parents who really don\u2019t understand science.  Like so many others, Dr. Howard completely ignores the work of Boyd Haley, Jill James, Thomas Burbacher, and so many others.  Although those scientists have not necessarily proven a definite connection, their work has raised serious questions to which mainstream medicine has not yet given any answers.  And unlike the \u201cabundance of research\u201d Dr. Howard and others rely on, the work giving rise to those questions is in the nature of microbiology, immunology, physiology, and metabolism.  What Dr. Howard relies on consists primarily on epidemiology:  i.e., statistical analyses that often fall victim to the accounting principle of GIGI \u23af garbage in, garbage out. I don\u2019t question Dr. Howard\u2019s sincerity.  My problem with her, and others like her, is that they are willing to use flawed logic and compromised science to prop up a program they believe in with the best of intentions.  Dr. Howard\u2019s motivation is obvious in her advice to the profession: Finally, if we\u2019re being perfectly honest here, we must admit to ourselves that we have a covert agenda when it comes to vaccines. Vaccination protects individual children, but its real value is in mediating risks across populations. Are we really prepared to tell Mr. and Mrs. Johnson that we do care about Susan, but we also have an obligation and a responsibility to consider societal benefits and risks in an ever-increasing ripple effect from our office door to the neighborhood, the community, the state, the nation, and the world? This is the same crap we\u2019ve heard from Paul Offit and his ilk over the years.  But every time we hear them say something, it\u2019s only hinted at.   Their belief in the concept of \u201cherd immunity\u201d (a theory based upon the inherent unreliability of vaccines) is so strong that they feel the sacrifice of a statistically small set of children is acceptable to ensure a relatively small percentage decrease in the incidence of some diseases.  That\u2019s what they believe, but convincing us that our children may be part of a sacrifice is not easy.  It\u2019s far easier to give us the false reassurance that our fears are unfounded. Sometimes I think these mainstream physicians picked up their sense of morality from  Star Trek .  Like many, I wiped away some moisture form my eyes at the end of  Star Trek 2:  The Wrath of Khan , when Spock sacrificed himself for his shipmates.  That sacrifice was based on his logical conclusion that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.  That\u2019s an awfully easy maxim to believe in when you aren\u2019t the one or the few, or the one.  But even more to the point, what made Spock\u2019s sacrifice noble was that he willingly took it on.  Our kids didn\u2019t volunteer to be sacrificial lambs.  There\u2019s nothing noble about their sacrifice other than the courage with which they and their parents get through each day. If the theory of herd immunity is sound \u23af and that\u2019s a might big \u201cif\u201d \u23af I certainly understand that there are other parents who could just as easily say that I am suggesting their children be put at risk of being sacrificed.  There are no easy answers to the question of whose needs are more important.  To reach the correct answer, we need an honest dialog.  Dr. Howard, however, thinks that is too difficult: One of our many arguments in favor of vaccines has to do with the balancing of weighted risks and benefits, according to statistical models. There\u2019s a big disconnect here, because people in general, and even doctors, are not particularly good at making decisions when we\u2019re given information in SAT-like formulas.  (\u201cThis vaccine would reduce your chances of getting disease x by a certain percentage; disease x carries this percentage risk of serious sequelae or death; the vaccine carries this percentage risk of serious sequelae or death.\u201d) Try us doc.  We\u2019re really not as dumb as you think.  We can have an honest discussion of the risks of not vaccinating, including the risk to other kids in society.  But before we can have that discussion, you need to be willing to acknowledge that there just may be a potential for serious sequelae from not just a particular vaccine, but from rigid adherence to the recommended vaccination schedule.  At the very least, you need to acknowledge that there is an open question needing further study.  And that\u2019s the hard part, isn\u2019t it?\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/chpm6g", "http://www.rescuepost.com/files/pednews-feb09.pdf"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/03/sacrifice.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SACRIFICE\n\t \n    "},

Over the last couple of decades, as we\u2019ve seen the vaccine schedule expanded to include more and more shots \u23af and earlier and earlier sat that \u23af we\u2019ve seen a steady decline in overall health.  (Okay, I don\u2019t really have any stats to back that up; I\u2019m relying mostly on the observations of heath-care professionals I know who tell me they are seeing more and more autoimmune problems in younger and younger people.)  Isn\u2019t that the opposite of what we should be seeing? The amazing expansion of the vaccine schedule runs counter to the constant pronouncements from the defenders of the vaccine program (who have become known as \u201cthe Offiteers\u201d) that pharmaceutical companies really don\u2019t make much in the way of profits from vaccines.  Why would the companies go to great lengths to develop new vaccines and get formal approval for them?   How can they afford to pay such tremendous royalties to patent holders if they aren\u2019t making money. Barbara Loe Fisher (founder of the  National Vaccine Information Center ) addressed those questions in a recent post on her blog.  The post, \u201c Politics, Profits & Pandemic Fear Mongering ,\u201d could not be more timely.  With everyone going into panic mode over the outbreak of swine flu, thee is a legitimate fear that our government might repeat the mistakes of the last swine flu panic back in the seventies.  The feared pandemic never appeared, and the emergency vaccination program was nothing short of disastrous in terms of the number of deaths and diagnosed cases of Guillen-Barre.

Although I grew up in Louisiana, I was born in Virginia, and spent many happy days visiting my grandparents up there.  That\u2019s why it hurts a little to find out their politicians play the same games that are played elsewhere.  I always hoped they were above that sort of thing in the birthplace of presidents. Over at  Autism Online Today , Curt Linderman posted a couple of items out of the Old Dominion State that unfortunately rove that things are just as bad there as anywhere else  Like many states, there are efforts afoot to pass legislation to mandate health coverage for autism treatments.  To get passed, however, the bill first has to be reported out of the subcommittee to which it was assigned.  A convincing argument for the bill was put forth at a hearing, and the subcommittee\u2019s response \u23af or to be more precise, their lack of response \u23af was breathtaking.   After what Lansdowne resident Pat DiBari called 45 minutes of \u201ctestimony and great questions and dialogue back and forth\u201d there was \u201cabsolute silence\u201d from the eight present subcommittee members, he said. \u201cNothing.  No action.  Zero,\u201d DiBari said Tuesday evening.  \u201cThey chose not to vote.  Families are stunned, outraged, disappointed, you name the emotion.\u201d The Delegate who introduced the bill, Republican Bob Marshall, was every bit as angry as the parents who are counting on the bill to have a chance of helping their children: In a statement released Feb. 4, Marshall said the lack of action on the part of the subcommittee was a \u201cdisplay of complete indifference\u201d and said he had told the members of the subcommittee who were present that \u201csilence is not a morally acceptable response to this situation.\u201d Of course, state legislatures are not the only battle ground these days.  Much is going on in the halls of Congress.  I am planning to write more about that in the very near future, but for now, we\u2019re just going to talk about the kind of representation Virginia is getting in Washington. Again from  Autism Online Today , we have a letter from Rep. Robert Wittman to a constituent who expressed concern about the plans to yet again run away from the idea of funding studies to determine whether the rise in ASD might be at all connected to the most sacred cow in the public health system.  The Congressman\u2019s letter is quoted here in its entirety: Dear Friend: Thank you for contacting my office regarding the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) and the Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Research.  I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with me.  I value your views on the important issues facing our Commonwealth and the Nation. As you know, the IACC coordinates ASD-related research within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The IACC also promotes federal and public collaborative efforts through public forums, educational initiatives and public outreach programs. As you may also know, the IACC does not have a dedicated research program on vaccines and autism.  The IACC noted limited funding resources and inconclusive scientific evidence as an important factor in this decision.  You may be pleased to know, that the IACC proposed to pursue autism and vaccine research through existing research programs.  I am committed to continuing the effort to review emerging scientific data concerning vaccines and autism. I want you to know that on the judiciary front, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled on February 12, 2009 that childhood immunizations containing Thimerosal, a preservative found in some inoculations and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, are not linked to autism.  The court noted that scientific evidence from medical studies conducted in various countries have failed to demonstrate that Thimerosal-containing vaccines can contribute to immune dysfunction, autism or gastrointestinal dysfunction.  For more information on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims' ruling, I encourage you to visit the court's website at: http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026. Additionally, as Congress considers the funding levels for FY2010, please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as the House of Representatives considers funding for autism research in the FY2010 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. Thank you again for sharing your views and opinions with me.  I am committed to serving you to the best of my abilities.  If I can ever be of assistance to you or your family, please do not hesitate to call me at (202) 225-4261 or contact me online at: www.wittman.house.gov. Sincerely, Robert J. Wittman Member of Congress www.wittman.house.gov The whole point of there being a federally funded study into the issue is to at least try to avoid the conflicts of interest that make everyone so wary of \u201cexisting research programs.\u201d  It\u2019s hard to tell if Rep. Wittman understands that.  He clearly doesn\u2019t want to actually have to discuss the issue.  He would rather issue letters that are the written equivalent of a pat on the head and an \u201coff you go.\u201d   Condescension has been elevated to an art form in American politics. I sometimes think back to an experience I had in Louisiana many years ago.  I got one of those newsletters put out by my representative in the State Legislature, which solicited my opinion on a number of issues.  On at least one issue (it\u2019s been long enough that I don\u2019t even recall what it was), I had a very sharp disagreement with the stated position of this particular Representative.  I noted that disagreement in the form, and mailed it back. A couple of weeks later, I got a phone call from the Representative, who was calling from the floor of the Legislature during a lull in the \u201caction.\u201d  We spent nearly 20 minutes in a very honest exchange, discussing the issue.  By the end of our conversation, we both maintained our original views, but I felt as though I was dealing with someone who was willing to listen to the complete reasoning behind disagreement so he could re-examine his own views, as well as show the moral courage to face disagreement and fully explain his own reasons.  A guy who didn\u2019t have my vote when he first ran had it when he was up for reelection.  Unfortunately, his honesty did not play so well with the rest of the district, and he lost his seat to someone who was more willing to play the \u201cpolitics as usual\u201d game. On other occasions when I have let elected officials know my views, the responses I have received have been along the lines of what our friends in Virginia are now getting:  either silence or condescension.  Maybe it\u2019s time we make it clear that we expect more.  We always talk about that, but we never take the time to back up our views.  We need to make it clear to our elected officials that we will no longer allow them to cop out.  They should not fear losing our votes if they express honest disagreement, for they will surely lose those votes anyway if they run away from discussing the issues with those who put them into office. I expect to write more about this kind of issue in the future.  In the meantime, remember to maintain an air of decorum and respect when communicating with your elected officials (such as Rep. Wittman).  To turn the tide, we must be taken seriously, and that means expressing your opinions in a serious and sober manner.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismtodayonline.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/03/politics-as-usual.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t POLITICS AS USUAL\n\t \n    "},

It\u2019s been hard to know what to say; there are so many questions and so few answers.  The whole situation is tragic on so many levels. Now I feel a little guilty for not writing sooner about a mother and son who are both victims.  (For a great explanation of what I mean, see this  recent post by Kim Stagliano  at  HuffPo .)   I don\u2019t feel ashamed for ignoring the true tragedy, but I cannot deny not speaking out sooner, and that\u2019s to my discredit. Recently,  Age of Autism  posted  the comments of Sondra Williams .  For those unfamiliar with her, Ms. Williams is an adult on the autism spectrum.  For far too long, however, she was diagnosed as being mentally ill, and was subjected to a torture of institutionalization and medication.  She now takes to task \u23af and properly so \u23af all of us in the on-line autism community (whether we be in the cure or ND side of things) who simply didn\u2019t want to face this situation squarely: . . . So this story itself is of making me quite ill but what is of making me more ill is the way much on the various list turn their backs away from such stories, as if wishing it away but this could be of any of our sons,  and how would we be to have felt if those in the autism community turned of their backs to our child in such cases and left of him vulnerable to the systems.  It sickens me to know of the heart of so many might have of compassion but not willing to discuss or be of proactive to this.   And Ms. Williams personal story carries a message for those who deny a connection between what happened and Sky\u2019s condition:  that is, to those who think all autism represents nothing more than a different point of view: Autism is of so many things but often only to those who are of much higher functioning and or Asperger\u2019s is it just a different frame of mind, but to me it has been of my hell much of life\u2026\u2026the only things life powerfully teached me was the humans were to be avoided because they would cause of me great harm.  My life grew up in mental wards designed for adults with mental illnesses and drug addictions and so it left me vulnerable to that situation and not appropriate for a child, Because of being of a female and also reacting to much abuse and neglect my presentation was of intermeshed and most were of not looking at autism in females so was of misdx much years much much year. And finally correctly dx with autism spectrum in 2001 and confirmed by 3 psychologist and 3 psychiatrist of autism.  Not asperger\u2019s type. After the Katie McCarron murder, many in the cure community were rightly chastised for showing greater sympathy to Katie\u2019s mother than to the victim.  Some of the loudest of those accusers now seem to be oddly devoid of sympathy for anyone in the present tragedy.  And that\u2019s just wrong, as Ms. Williams points out: Please do not let of them treat of him this way. Hims mother can in no way ever rest in a peaceful fashion as long as he is of not well. He is of being punished enough by removal of the home, not having hims main source of love and care being there for him, he has no awareness of where she is or why she is not coming and why he cant go home to the only place were all of hims life is. \u2028 \u2028 The sad is when one looks at the parents who murder their children of disabilities they are of often given less punishment towards them when they killed with intent and he not having the ability to be aware and did not do anything with intent is of punished by far more harshly.

{"date": "Monday, October 13, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      Yeah, I\u2019ve been away from blogging for awhile, but I haven\u2019t been in a cave.   The news lately has been overwhelming:  the economic collapse (and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too strong a word), the ongoing tragedy of the war we\u2019ve found ourselves in, and in our little corner of the human race, the continued pronouncements that all is well and there\u2019s really nothing to all this wild theory about a connection between autism and over-vaccinations (pronouncements that are empty of true backing when the basis is critically examined).  And permeating everything is the trauma our nation inflicts upon itself every four years:  the presidential election. As has increasingly become the case with each election, it\u2019s getting ugly.  The mud that has traditionally been slung by surrogates in the print media and airwaves has now moved to the internet, where it has gotten way out of control.  Because there are no checks or restraints on what gets anonymously posted on the web, any rumor can take on a life of its own and quickly be magnified.  Where once we rolled our eyes at half-truths being spouted about one candidate or the other, now we have to sift through outright falsehoods. Add to that the rhetoric designed to appeal to our prejudices.  When times are perilous \u2013 and surely they are perilous now \u2013 the language of the debate begins to include those little code words that impugn the \u201cother guy\u201d because he or she is what he/she is. The bitterness spills from the campaigns into the community a large.  Recently the on-line autism community has gotten as ugly as I have ever seen it.  What usually unites us now divides us, and all based on our perceptions of who is \u201cour guy.\u201d  We dissect their stated positions and examine their past records viewed through the lenses of our own self-interest; and we buy so deeply into one side or the other that we fail to see the big picture. There are two things we all need to keep in mind. First, these are perilous times (I know I said that before, but it bears repeating).  The issues our country faces are many, and all of the issues will have an impact on all of our lives.  As deeply as autism effects my family, the economy and healthcare issues are almost as important to that concern (and other concerns) as who will support particular research on autism.  And those of us with neurotypical children at or near military age all feel the anxiety of what our foreign policy may bring next.  The world is larger than our little corner. Second, acknowledging that autism is the number one issue in my family and possibly yours as well, we have to recognize that talk is cheap and good intentions don\u2019t always translate into reality.  Nothing will be accomplished for our families without action by both the executive and legislative branches, and arguably the judicial branch as well.   And the only way that will happen is if we continue to stick together, concentrate on what unites us, and make our collective voice heard by whoever is in the Oval Office, and in Congress as well.  We cannot count on politicians to be advocates for our children; we must fill that role ourselves. I can\u2019t help but believe that whoever wins will be a huge improvement over what we\u2019ve had the last eight years.  Like everyone else, I have preferences in this election.  No matter what the outcome of the election is, however, we all have to recognize that our civic rights and responsibilities do not end when we step out of the voting booth.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      This past November 4th, I sat in my living room and watched an incredible moment unfold on television.  The first African American to be elected President was giving an electrifying speech from Chicago\u2019s Grant Park.  I thought of just how far our nation had come in my lifetime.  And I thought of  John Hope Franklin . I was raised as a white boy in the Deep South, but my parents did their best to keep me from growing up with the prejudices that had infected that part of the country \u23af and the rest of the country as well \u23af for too long.  It was through my parents that I met John Hope Franklin. Dr. Franklin, grew up in Oklahoma, and was raised to overcome the prejudices that would otherwise stand in the way of success.  He attended Fisk University and Harvard, earning his Ph.D. in history in 1941.  He went on become one of the eminent historians of his time, and even served as a consultant to the legal team arguing for the plaintiffs in the landmark desegregation case, Brown vs. Board of Education.   He strove to tell the complete story of America, especially the lasting legacy from the early nation\u2019s reliance on slavery.  For his efforts, he was awarded a richly deserved Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995. I didn\u2019t really know that man:  the famous John Hope Franklin.  The John Hope Franklin I knew was a warm and courteous man who was devoted to three things:  his family, educating, and growing beautiful orchids.  He and my father, himself an eminent historian, may not have been necessarily close, but they shard a friendship having its roots in a deep mutual respect for each other as historians and writers.  In the few times I got to speak to Dr. Franklin, I came to share my father\u2019s respect for a remarkable man. One experience with John Hope Franklin stands out particularly in my memory. Dr. Franklin and his wife, Aurelia, came to New Orleans for a professional meeting.  My mother offered to show them some of the sites, and she mentioned that she often took out-of-towners to see some of the nearby plantations.  Mom immediately winced, realizing she had just volunteered to take the nation\u2019s preeminent authority on the evils of slavery to a sugar-coated version of the scene of the crime.  Dr. Franklin graciously declared that he would find such a trip to be interesting.  I\u2019m not sure if my mother thought including her youngest son, then in high school, would offer some level of emotional support for her, or if she merely thought I would get a little enlightenment courtesy of John Hope Franklin.  In either event, I went along. I don\u2019t recall which plantation we were at, or exactly what was being said.  I do recall that the tour guide was well into the Gone With the Wind version of history when I saw a slight smile come to Dr. Franklin\u2019s face.  He raised his hand, and proceeded to deliver a five-minute lecture that destroyed all of the myths that had just been thrown at us.  Although it was indeed a lecture, it was delivered without a trace of anger, bitterness, condescension, or accusation.  This was simply another opportunity for John Hope Franklin to do what he loved best:  educating.  He did it with a soft voice that demanded attention. I looked at the others in the room.  The tour guide looked impatient and upset that someone had gotten her off of her script.  The other people taking the tour, however, looked thoughtful.  None of them knew just who this gentleman was, who looked distinguished even in walking shorts and a sport shirt.  It was clear, though, that he was someone who merited attention. That was the key to John Hope Franklin\u2019s genius as an educator.  He was able to reveal the truth about the most inhumane acts, while never denying the humanity of those who benefited from the evil institution.  And that drove the point that much farther toward home.   Dr. Franklin has been quoted as saying, \u201cMy challenge was to weave into the fabric of American history enough of the presence of blacks so that the story of the United States could be told adequately and fairly.\u201d   For him, it was a simple matter of setting the record straight. John Hope Franklin passed away last week the age of 94.  I thank God he lived long enough to see the last election, an outward and visible sign of the progress he worked so hard for.  I also thank God that I knew the man, even if it was only a slight acquaintance. \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hope_Franklin"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/03/john-hope-franklin.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN\n\t \n    "},

It\u2019s always enlightening to get reactions from people who don\u2019t see our Little Rankster on a frequent basis.

There is someone who has a more-balanced view of that organization than I have:  Katie Wright.  It is, of course, ms. Wright\u2019s son\u2019s regression into autism that gave birth to the organization.  Her parents, Bob and Suzanne Wright saw a need and created what has quickly become the 900-pound gorilla in the room.  The arrogance with which the organization has run roughshod over other organizations, autistic individuals, and just about anyone that doesn\u2019t subscribe to their views has been nothing short of shameful. Through it all, Katie Wright has remained loyal to her parents, even after they threw her under the bus for making public pronouncements on the issue of vaccines as a potential trigger for ASD.  She has always been careful to separate the role of her parents from the influence of other officers and directors of Autism Speaks.  I tend to think she underestimates Bob Wright\u2019s influence on the organization\u2019s direction, but she is certainly in a better position to know what\u2019s in her father\u2019s heart.

But now, it seems he doesn\u2019t know the difference between \u201cinsightful\u201d and \u201cinciteful.\u201d  It seems that Mr. Leary recently wrote a book with the provocative title,  Why We Suck:  A Feel-Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid .  In it, he decided to include a chapter that could have been written by  Michael Savage .    It has been reported that the book includes the following : There is a huge boom in autism right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids can\u2019t compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of shrinks . . . to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons.  I don\u2019t give a [bleep] what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you \u2013 yer kid is NOT autistic.  He\u2019s just stupid.  Or lazy.  Or both. In a recent interview, Mr. Leary said he wouldn\u2019t mind if his book tour would be picketed by Jenny McCarthy because it would help sell more books.  I suppose that\u2019s what it is all about.  Spout out anything that comes to mind as long as it sells.     Maybe I wouldn\u2019t mind if his ignorance was pointed in another direction.  That\u2019s my failing; I should be just as pissed off at any of his rants that picks unfairly at one group or another.  I suppose I should be grateful.  Mr. Leary has showed me something about myself that is a little uncomfortable.  I can work on that.  He\u2019s also shown me something about himself, and I can work on that too.  I can henceforth ignore Mr. Leary in all of his endeavors. ADDENDUM : Within a half-hour of posting the above, I got a Google news update indicating that Denis Leary is trying to explain his comments.  According to  one story , Mr. Leary says that we all need to read the book so that we may see: . . . the sections I thought made my feelings about autism very clear:  that I not only support the current rational approaches to the diagnoses and treatment of real autism but have witnessed it firsthand while watching very dear old friends raise a functioning autistic child. He goes on to say: The point of the chapter is not that autism doesn't exist\u2014it obviously does\u2014and I have nothing but admiration and respect for parents dealing with the issue, including the ones I know,\" Leary continued in the statement he released today. The bulk of the chapter deals with grown men who are either self-diagnosing themselves with low-level offshoots of the disease or wishing they could as a way to explain their failed careers and troublesome progeny. Of course, this entire misunderstanding can be easily avoided simply by doing one thing \u2014 reading the book.  Taking one or two sentences out of context \u2014 especially when it involves an entire chapter devoted to the subject \u2014 is unfair and ill-advised. Fair enough.  I haven't read the book.  But assuming the quote from the book is reasonably accurate \u2014 not necessarily complete, but reasonably accurate \u2014 there is an obvious disconnect between what he wrote and what he says he intended.

It\u2019s not that there hasn\u2019t been anything to write about; rather, it\u2019s a matter of other things having higher priority than spouting off my opinions.  As could be predicted, it took a condescending comment from Paul Offit to spur me to sit at the keyboard.\r \r In  an Associated Press report  on the next test case in the Court of Claims, the reporter decided to get a quote from Doc O, the infectious disease guy who holds a vaccine patent and is a consultant for Merck (and, as is usually the case, those parts of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were left out of the article).   In an apparent reference to the fact that there is more than one theory being explored, Dr. Offit said:  \u201cI think that what\u2019s so endearing to me about the anti-vaccine people is they\u2019re perfectly willing to go from one hypothesis to the next without a backward glance.\u201d\r \r For those who aren\u2019t able to recognize it, that statement is an example of what we call \u201csarcasm.\u201d  And what is he being sarcastic about?  It seems that some of us have the temerity to constantly reexamine our opinions in the face of emerging science.  I always thought the evolution of an idea lay at the heart of the scientific method, but apparently I was wrong.  (Okay, that\u2019s a little sarcasm on my part.)\r \r Dr. Offit chooses to cling to a static concept, without regard to mounting evidence against that concept.  It\u2019s simply too uncomfortable for him to challenge his notions.\r \r Contrast Dr. Offit\u2019s smug attitude with the open mind of Dr. Bernadine Healy.  Dr. Healy\u2019s about as mainstream as it gets; she\u2019s a former head of the National Institutes of Health and she\u2019s a current member of the Institutes of Medicine.  She\u2019s hardly an antivaccine zealot.  But in  a recent interview  with Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News, she stated her opinion that the question of a potential link between vaccinations and autism in genetically susceptible individuals is not yet settled and deserves serious study \u23af study that has not yet been undertaken by the institutions charged with the protection of public health.\r \r According to Healy, when she began researching autism and vaccines she found credible published, peer-reviewed scientific studies that support the idea of an association.  That seemed to counter what many of her colleagues had been saying for years.  She dug a little deeper and was surprised to find that the government has not embarked upon some of the most basic research that could help answer the question of a link. \r \r The more she dug, she says, the more she came to believe the government and medical establishment were intentionally avoiding the question because they were afraid of the answer. \r Dr. Healy has not formed an opinion that vaccines are definitely a trigger of ASD, or that vaccines are a major contributing factor to the current epidemic.  She\u2019s merely saying that there\u2019s enough evidence to warrant a real examination.\r \r As a commentator \u23af albeit an amateur \u23af on the issue of autism causation, I must admit that I\u2019ve always found Paul Offit to be . . . well, endearing.  Whenever I can\u2019t seem to find anything to write about, Doc O comes to my rescue by saying something that just calls out for a comment.  It\u2019s nice, though, to have someone like Dr. Healy, who invites comment of a more flattering nature.  \r \r Check out an extended version of the interview with Dr. Healy to hear what a reasonable scientist sounds like.\r \r \r \r \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/57w9wj", "http://tinyurl.com/5kr9rg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/05/willingness-to-confront-uncomfortable.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE WILLINGNESS TO CONFRONT UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS \n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 01, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      The inability to agree on a definition of autism has always fueled the debate over appropriate responses to Autism Spectrum Disorders.  The truth is that one could easily define autism in as many ways as there are autistic individuals. I have occasionally read the musings of Donna Williams, a/k/a \u201cthe arty autie.\u201d  Although our views rarely intersect, I have usually found her to be thoughtful and a good writer.  Last week, I came upon her latest piece,  What is autism? Beyond the symptoms and stereotypes .  She hits this one out of the park: In my view, autism is NOT ONE CONDITION and hence there is no one-size-fits-all approach which will best fit ALL people diagnosed with autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  Ms. Williams refers to the constellation of autistic manifestations as a \u201cfruit salad,\u201d the ingredients of which are sometimes inherited and sometimes acquired.  Leaving aside the question of how much is inherited and how much is the result of external factors \u23af and that is likely to differ with each individual \u23af the focus turns to our response.  Ms. Williams seems to believe, as do I, that the appropriate response depends upon the manifestations: What determines the abilities and progress of any person with autism, is how the fruit salad is respectfully managed based on solid understanding of those components. Some aspects of an \u2018autism fruit salad\u2019, in some people (and may not be present in all for them to be equally \u2018autistic\u2019), will require treatment, others management, others adaptation and some only understanding, respect and acceptance. I\u2019m not familiar enough with Ms. Williams\u2019 views to speak for her.  Based on her background, though, I can surmise that she does not approve of many of the \u201cbiomedical\u201d or \u201calternative\u201d interventions many of us believe are appropriate in the individual cases of our children.  As a statement of general principle, however, I could not agree more with her on the nature of ASD, and the spirit with which we must formulate a response.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=47460"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/01/defining-autism.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t DEFINING AUTISM\n\t \n    "},

But maybe not in the way you think. The fact is, the  concession  has very  little  impact on the rest of the cases pending in the Court of Claims.  There is no  precedential  effect at all.  The most that can be said about the legal side of the development is that for the first time the Department of Justice was willing to concede that \u23af at least in one case \u23af there just might be a problem.  It\u2019s hard to say why they did that, but I suspect they had problems with the defense experts, and perhaps they were afraid to risk a fully  ajudicated  loss in a case in which the plaintiffs could not be easily dismissed as wackos. It\u2019s obvious that the  DOJ  hopes their concession will not have any impact beyond the  Pollings .  The tortured semantics of the concession display the intent to make the action more narrow than logic would allow.  I mean, really, what the hell can \u201cautism-like symptoms\u201d mean?  Autism is not so much a distinct disorder as it is a descriptive term for a constellation of clinical indications.  By definition, autism is nothing more than a  collection  of \u201cautism-like symptoms.\u201d The  DOJ  gambled that their little concession would not make much of a splash, and that they could continue to rely on the perception that all of us who believe that vaccines may have played a role in triggering our children\u2019s \u201cautism-like symptoms\u201d are anti-science zealots who  practice   voo   doo  on our kids.  (When I originally noted that some of the  Pollings ' public statements led me to believe that they rely primarily on more conventional interventions.  See Ginger's comments to this post for further clarification.)  Of course, a truly critical examination leads to the opposite conclusion:  that the \u201cjunkier\u201d of the competing sciences are the  epidmiological  number crunches that try to disprove a connection. The government lost its gamble.  And that\u2019s the true significance.  The mainstream media now acknowledges that the debate may not be as close to over as was previously portrayed.  Many people are now taking a fresh look at the issue, who once took for granted the party line that \u201cvirtually all reputable studies,  yadda ,  yadda .\u201d  And this time, those who are taking that fresh look are exercising a more critical attitude, and they are not so willing to assume that the official story is correct. Courts of law have never been very adept at determining scientific truth.  When it comes to science, they are designed to maintain the  status  quo .  That\u2019s been the problem with the vaccine court process from the beginning.  The statute of limitations \u23af and to an equal extent the financial needs of the claimant families \u23af have demanded that the legal system make decisions prematurely, before science can give us a real handle on the truth.  Justice has never been guaranteed (or even expected). But now we have an admission that there might be something worthy of further study, an admission that\u2019s getting a lot of attention.  It is now much harder to argue against funding studies that are designed to take a fair look at the issue. If the  Polings  are the last family to receive compensation in these cases, we all have still won a  great  victory.

The ascending autism tsar who will have enormous influence on how government funds will be doled out to the NIH and others, shares a home and her life with a guy who probably doesn\u2019t see much point in researching potential causes and treatments.

{"date": "Thursday, January 24, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n       The word \u201cfan\u201d is defined as \u201c[a]n ardent devotee; an enthusiast\u201d with the derivation being from the word \u201cfanatic\u201d ( The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language , Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004).  Of course, the word has taken on a more generalized meaning in which the devotion is not necessarily fanatical. I consider myself a fan, in the more casual sense, of numerous sports teams, individual athletes, actors, writers, and musical artists.  But my truly fanatical interest has always been reserved for  John Stewart .  That\u2019s why the news of his passing last weekend was like a kick in the stomach. He was an incredibly prolific songwriter and recording artist, who is considered one of the pioneers of what came to be known as the \u201cAmericana\u201d style of folk music.  His songs were of America and Americans, a land and people for whom patriotism was neither blind nor mute.  In one of my favorites, a song called \u201cSurvivors\u201d from the vastly underrated  Wingless Angels  album, he tells us that we can and will endure, despite the \u201coutlaws in office\u201d that shatter our lives. An irony he undoubtedly enjoyed was that for all his folk credentials, his best-known song was the Monkees\u2019 hit \u201cDaydream Believer.\u201d  For that song, the record company infamously decided that Davy Jones could not possibly sing the line \u201cnow you know how funky I can be,\u201d so the word \u201chappy\u201d was substituted for \u201cfunky.\u201d  The change of that one word managed to render a great song utterly senseless.  With characteristic good humor, Mr. Stewart was able to laugh about the bowdlerization of his work because \u201chappy\u201d worked just fine for him after the song shot to the top of the charts. I first heard John Stewart\u2019s unmistakable voice as a child on old Kingston Trio records lying around the house.  Later, when I started collecting my own albums, I bought a copy of his  Phoenix Concerts  and was hooked for life.  It is one of those rare live albums where the connection between performer and audience is palpable. I was lucky enough to have experienced that live connection twice back in the eighties and nineties.  New Orleans was pretty far removed from where most of his fan base was located in the West, so the opportunities didn\u2019t come often. The first time I saw him was in a reformed disco in the suburbs, called \u201cRichie\u2019s 3-D Lounge.\u201d  It was the most incongruous venue I could imagine for John Stewart, with its mirrors, disco balls, and tables spread out on a dance floor meant to be lit from below.  And to top it off, he played before a \u201ccrowd\u201d of about 15 people (including the bartender and the guy working the sound board).  Still, he sat on a stool and played as if we were all sitting in his living room.  It was an amazing performance. The next time I saw him a few years later was at a French Quarter club called \u201cStoryville\u201d (the location is now Mararitaville for those who know the City).  With that better location, I hoped he would draw a larger audience, and I suppose he did.  I think I counted 23 people that night.  A lot of guys with international reputations would have shrugged their shoulders and phoned it in.  Mr. Stewart came out on stage, suggested that \"we all room together next semester,\" and launched into an unforgettable set, including an encore. Although I didn\u2019t get each and every album he released (the number is estimated to be in the mid forties), I probably wound up with over half of them.  He continued to release them on a variety of labels, each one containing brilliant lyrics set to a constantly evolving guitar style. Just before he suffered the stroke that led quickly to his death, he completed work on yet another album.  Reportedly, the recording included contributions from his friend, Lindsey Buckingham (who helped record what was to have been his biggest hit as a performer, \u201cGold,\u201d back in the seventies).  One of the new songs is entitled \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive Any More,\u201d a nod to his recently diagnosed Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  He was determined to continue writing, recording, and performing as long as his mental state would allow. It\u2019s difficult for me to believe that the next album will be the last.  Fortunately, he left a large catalog of music to discover, rediscover, and savor. ADDENDUM: After posting the above last night, I spent some time on You Tube looking at videos, and came across a couple I thought I'd share.  The first was taken from a Kingston Trio reunion in the eighties, which was put together as a PBS fundraiser.   John was at the peak of his career, and was given a solo spot in the show.  He chose to do \"Kansas,\" one of his older songs that had always been done acoustically.  Here, before an audience of folkies, he performed it electric (and then some).  For that occasion, it was an interesting choice lyrically, made even more interesting by his performance.  The second came from a performance last April, and it's really poignant.  In the last couple of years, Mr. Stewart had aged tremendously.   His voice, like that of his friend, Johnny Cash at the end of his life, had taken on a crusty aura. Although the Alzheimers may not actually have been diagnosed at that time, he was obviously frail.  He was struggling with playing the guitar (and he had always been known as a fine guitarist).  The song is \"Mother Country,\" one of the tunes off of the classic  California Bloodlines  album, which marked the beginning of the style that came to be labeled \"Americana.\"  If the first video was John's Dylan-goes-electric-at-Newport moment, this one is his E.A.Stuart moment.  Any Stewartistas out there know what I mean; the rest of you will understand after watching the whole video. It's a brave performance. \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/R5lN4kbbkvI/AAAAAAAAADA/u_SGjEGDZss/s1600-h/johnstewart.jpg", "http://www.chillywinds.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/01/john-stewart-fans-remembrance.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t JOHN STEWART:  A FAN\u2019S REMEMBRANCE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, January 19, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      I have only mentioned Karen McCarron\u2019s killing of  her daughter, Katie, a couple of times on this blog.  The  more recent occasion  was to respond to someone I considered a friend, who had taken me to task for not discussing something I really didn\u2019t understand.  The  first time  was to politely suggest that restraint might be called for in discussing the matter until we truly knew what happened.  I still can\u2019t pretend to fully understand it all \u23af I seriously doubt I will ever come to that point \u23af but it seems appropriate to say something now. Like most people in the greater autism community, I followed the news reports about the trial, but my experience in litigating cases (including some of a high-profile nature) taught me that the press sometimes misses nuances.  So I don\u2019t always trust the press.  But I do trust juries.  Although juries occasionally get it wrong, they get it right far more often. People who serve on juries, almost without exception, take their task very seriously.  That\u2019s not to say that judges do not; most do.  Jurors, though, listen with ears that have not heard it all.  They watch with eyes that have not become jaded.  Most importantly, jurors infuse a human element into the proceedings; they understand that their decision will have an impact on everyone involved.  It is that human element that adds an extra measure of justice to the law. In this case, the jury found Karen McCarron guilty of murder.  That jury heard all of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense.  They were able to observe the manner in which the witnesses testified.  Their decision is entitled to respect.  Moreover, all indications point to their having got it right this time. There were two things reported in the press during the trial that stood out for me.  The first came in the testimony of Paul McCarron, Katie\u2019s father.  This is  how the  Pekin Daily Times  described it: After Paul and Katie spent several months in North Carolina, where Katie received therapy, both Paul and Karen decided to move Katie back to Morton.  While Paul was in North Carolina finishing his work as an engineer with Caterpillar Inc., Karen brought Katie back. However, prior to Katie\u2019s return, Karen asked Paul what he thought about putting Katie up for adoption. When asked by Johnson how he replied to this, Paul said, \u201cNo way in hell.\u201d As a parent, I immediately identified with Mr. McCarron\u2019s sentiments.  There is no way in hell I would ever disown any child of mine, autistic or neurotypical.  Karen McCarron\u2019s idea of doing that to her child displayed a complete disconnection to her daughter that I cannot fathom.  She committed the worst sin a parent can commit; she lost hope. Of course, the defense in this case was based on mental illness.  And the presence of mental illness seems pretty likely.  Did it stem from the inability to accept a child\u2019s disability after trying so hard to have a family (the  Daily Times  report cites two prior miscarriages)?  Was it because Karen McCarron went off of her medications, or could it even have stemmed from being on the medications in the first place?  Although it is human nature to speculate on such things, at the end of the day the cause of the mental illness is irrelevant.  Whatever role mental illness played in Karen McCarron\u2019s actions, the illness does not absolve her of legal or moral culpability for the murder. I\u2019m not sure what standard Illinois recognizes for an insanity defense, but I assume it is either the traditional  McNaughton  rule, or something similar.  This is  what I previously wrote  on that subject: There have been many comments made in various places about the mental state of the mother, but that does not begin to provide an answer about her moral culpability, or lack thereof. As a very general statement, I think the McNaughton rule, recognized by most American jurisdictions in determining insanity as an exculpatory defense, stands as one of the rare instances in which law and morality actually match up.  The test is whether an alleged perpetrator could appreciate the distinction between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d at the time of an otherwise criminal event. That test is not satisfied if the defendant was unaware of a specific law, or if the defendant felt a mere moral justification.  Rather, the rule tests whether the specific individual was intellectually, mentally, and emotionally capable of understanding that the ethics and mores of society hold the act to be wrong. My personal feeling has always been that any person who is capable of that understanding is under a moral obligation to seek help if he/she feels that he/she may have difficulty controlling an immoral or illegal impulse. That leads to the second telling moment of the trial,  as reported in the Associated Press : In a videotaped confession played in court Thursday, McCarron said she began having thoughts of hurting her daughter a year before the May 2006 slaying but put them out of her mind.  On the day of the killing, though, the thoughts were stronger than ever. \u201cThey were so intense,\u201d McCarron said. The video continued with Karen McCarron\u2019s description of the murder \u23af a description that is detailed, graphic, and horrifying.  Then came the kind of question that good, experienced investigators ask: Interviewers asked McCarron if she knew what she did was criminally wrong. \u201cI have enough education to know that,\u201d she answered. The jury got it right.  Karen McCarron is guilty.  And it\u2019s important that we in the \u201ccure\u201d community say it. It\u2019s important because the excuses Karen McCarron threw out in that videotaped confession were themes that are identified \u23af correctly or not \u23af with us.  She said she felt guilty over the vaccinations Katie received and she was distraught because the interventions she used failed to deliver a child free of autism.  And it\u2019s important for us to say it because, after the murder occurred, many in our community questioned what external problems may have been a factor.  Many were folks who were struggling to understand how someone they considered a friend could have committed the worst of crimes.  Well, we may not fully understand the \u201cwhy,\u201d but we now know that a lack of services had nothing to do with this tragedy. This murder occurred because a mother stopped seeing humanity in her child.  She couldn\u2019t see her child at all:  only the autism.  Despite what our friends in the neurodiversity movement may say, I refuse to believe that such a failure is common among cure-oriented parents.  But if that failure is part of any parent\u2019s thought process, it is something we must all fight. After the verdict, Paul McCarron released a statement that has found its way onto several sites.  This is how it ends: I ask all parents and especially those of children with disabilities to ALWAYS love your children and be proud of them.  Cherish every moment you have with them.  Love, patience and tender efforts are the best therapies. Indeed.  I have said before that the love of a parent is the most important intervention for an autistic child.  That love must be our guide in all other interventions.  That love must keep us honest so that we may constantly examine our path anew lest we put our children in harm\u2019s way.  That love must give us hope to persevere. \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pekintimes.com/articles/2008/01/08/news/news3.txt", "http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gzi4G83F97PxaZn6ctuLeZ9l5tkwD8U453JG0"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/01/measure-of-justice.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A MEASURE OF JUSTICE\n\t \n    "},

And the first episode promises to be memorable.  The title character will represent a family suing a vaccine manufacturer, alleging that a toxic component in a vaccine triggered their son\u2019s autism. Generally I\u2019m not a big fan of lawyer shows, because they tend to oversimplify things to fit into a one-hour time slot.  Likewise, I think focusing on thimerosal \u23af and the fictional vaccine component in the  Eli Stone  episode sure sounds like the regrettably non-fictional thimerosal \u23af has been counterproductive.  Instead of establishing the process by which various toxins can trigger autism, which I believe would assuredly lead to mercury and thimerosal as a major, and perhaps the single greatest, contributing factor, we have focused solely on that one \u201cwhat\u201d before we have established the \u201chow.\u201d  This has allowed those who would fail to see the forest (i.e., the CDC, the IOM, the AAP, and, of course, the vaccine manufacturers) to hack at that one tree with half-truths and half-baked epidemiology. Still, we must be on to something because those guys keep acting scared.  When word got out about the premier episode of  Eli Stone , the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) prepared an over-the-top letter of protest to ABC, filled with self-righteous indignation.  They are demanding that ABC not run the show.  They protest that the American public \u23af you know, us idiots without medical degrees \u23af will believe a fictional television drama rather than their doctors.  That protest speaks volumes of how our country\u2019s pediatricians view their own credibility ... or lack thereof. Since none of us has actually seen the show, it\u2019s a bit premature to talk about its merits or deficits.  The AAP\u2019s heavy-handed attempt at censorship, however, is in front of us and deserves comment and censure.

{"date": "Sunday, June 08, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      Before I joined the corporate world, I spent many years as a litigator.  One of my most frustrating experiences in the courtroom came when a judge (who was well past his prime) allowed the other side\u2019s expert testify in technical areas well beyond his expertise.  I have much the same reaction whenever I hear Paul Offit speak. Dr. Offit, of course, is a specialist in infectious diseases.  My understanding is that he does not have a private practice.  Indeed, he would have almost no time for it.  He spends his time working on the development of new vaccines, acting as a spokesman for the vaccine industry, writing books, and generally holding himself out as an expert in a variety of fields regardless of any expertise he may have in those fields.  Reportedly, he is presently at work on a book about autism, although I doubt he has ever treated a single patient for autism.  And without really understanding what autism is, does he really have the qualifications to expound on what may trigger ASD? Of course, Doc O has never let a little thing like lack of qualifications stop him before.  It is his repeated pronouncements on the deficiency of the American legal system \u23af an area I know a little about \u23af that drives me crazy.  Doc O recently presented at a teleconference for pediatricians sponsored by the Pennsylvania Immunization Education Program.  It\u2019s  now available on-line .  The subject was how to reassure parents that they should continue to rigidly adhere to the official vaccine schedule in the post- Poling  era. Although he spent time discussing his opinions on the theoretical dangers of the number of vaccines (or in Offit\u2019s opinion, the absence of any potential danger at all), most of the presentation was devoted to a hysterical rant about the manner in which the legal system deals with cases alleging vaccine damage. Keep in mind that Doc O was speaking as an expert in public policy and the legal system, yet he insisted on parading his ignorance of that system by continually referring to the \u201cdecision\u201d made by \u201cthe court\u201d in the  Poling  matter.  There was no decision by the court; there was a concession by the attorneys representing the government  (i.e., the defense), which has paved the way for the Poling family to recover damages (an award has not yet been determined).  Offit repeated that mischaracterization of what happened several times, to the point of specifically criticizing the special masters (attorneys appointed by the Court of Claims to hear the matter in much the same way as a judge does and to make findings of fact).   Finally, when the floor was opened for questions, one of the doctors listening corrected Doc O, the \u201cexpert\u201d brushed aside the distinction as mere \u201clegal language\u201d and pronounced that it was a \u201cdecision\u201d because they had to decide to concede.  Huh?!?! Offit\u2019s believes the vaccine compensation system once served a purpose, but has now gone into dangerous turf because the court is having to address claims that do not fit neatly into the vaccine compensation injury table.  Parenthetically, I have to admit to getting the giggles when I heard Doc O extol the virtues of the table, which in his own words, \u201cincludes injuries, which clearly have been shown either biologically or epidemiologically to be caused by vaccines.\u201d  In criticizing the hypothesis of a vaccine connection to ASD, Offit has relied almost exclusively on epidemiology, especially since the mounting biological evidence does not support his beliefs. In any event, Doc O\u2019s thesis is that we shouldn\u2019t have lawyers making medical decisions.  Indeed, there is always a danger of empowering courts of law to determine broad scientific or technical issues.  Nobody should believe that the issue will be decided simply because a legal decision is made.  The only thing that  can happen is that the court will attempt (or not, if one remains skeptical) to reach a just decision based on an understanding of the present state of scientific knowledge.  The court\u2019s understanding, of course, may be right or wrong. The answer, though, is not to take the decision-making power away from the courts.  That is the answer Paul Offit clearly wants:  to take the issue away from courts of law altogether, and hand such cases over to some kind of body run by the mainstream medical community.   That solution puts us on the slippery slope of removing the power entrusted by the founding fathers to the judiciary simply because the subject matter is technical.   There is no doubt that the system is a mess.  By mandating the filing of claims within a short temporal window, we are seeing the Court of Claims trying to make sense of a scientific question that is far from settled.  There s no easy solution.  The interests of potential claimants, dealing with a relatively short period of limitations, have to be balanced against the interest of potential defendants (the industry and/or the Vaccine Compensation Fund) in a reasonably certain period in which they must face liability.   But Dr. Offit advocates a lack of balance. The debate as to how we fix the system is legitimate, and it is important.  All interested parties deserve to be heard, but having a spokesman like Paul Offit does nothing to foster a reasonable discussion.   Dr. Offit, in addition to apparently not understanding the most fundamental aspects of the legal system ( i.e. , the difference between advocates and the finders of fact), continually resorts to utilizing the plaintiffs\u2019 bar as a bogeyman to scare the bejeesus out of us all.  He\u2019s done it before in his well-accepted (an acceptance I don\u2019t understand) book on  the \u201cCutter Incident,\u201d  in which he deconstructs a very bad court decision from a few decades ago, and then waves it around as a cautionary tale while ignoring some very real corrections the courts took upon themselves.   He\u2019s still using the same scare tactics.   In the recent presentation to the pediatricians in Pennsylvania, Doc O said one of the dangers of the  Poling  \u201cdecision\u201d is that personal injury lawyers will now be alerted \u201d to an area that might become \u201clucrative,\u201d and they\u2019ll take their claims to state courts.    Now, I am not a big fan of the plaintiffs\u2019 bar.  I\u2019ve spent my professional life fighting those guys.  I think I know pretty well what motivates them, and they\u2019re not going to see a defense concession in a single case as being a green light on the road to riches.  Those guys want easier pickings with a lot less waiting time.  That\u2019s why the vast majority of plaintiff lawyers who jumped on the bandwagon jumped off a long time ago.  But using scare tactics and misrepresenting his opponent\u2019s position is what Paul Offit does best.   He is finally acknowledging that the debate is broader than just the MMR or just thimerosal.  But he does so by sneering about \u201cshifting hypotheses.\u201d  Maybe I\u2019m just a layman when it comes to science, but I thought the entire idea was to keep exploring until you find the truth.  What we seem to be finding is that neither the MMR hypothesis nor the thimerosal hypothesis were wrong per se, but neither were right in an of themselves.  Both appear to be part of a broader process that we are only starting to understand.  Understanding the problem, however, may not be in Paul Offit\u2019s interest. My overriding interest in this question is the health and wellbeing of my son.  That interest dictates that I constantly reexamine the validity of what  I believe the truth to be, so that I may help my child.  Paul Offit\u2019s interest in seeing that the status quo is not disturbed seems to be a very curious approach for someone who constantly preaches science and the scientific method.  Science, like the law, is not meant to be static.  Our understanding must evolve as we continue to learn.   In a casual conversation, a pediatrician once told us that he really didn\u2019t have the time to take a good look at issues like the potential connection between vaccination and the triggering of autism.  Rather, he simply adopted the position of the AAP as a default.  And that\u2019s the same attitude demonstrated by some of the doctors who asked participated in the recent Pennsylvania teleconference.  They wanted to know when they could get a \u201ctear sheet\u201d of talking points.  One pediatrician bemoaned having to spend five minutes of uncompensated time whenever she was asked questions about vaccine safety.   She said that Offit\u2019s argument s would be convincing to \u201cintelligent parents,\u201d a comment which triggered a sarcastic, \u201cyeah, good luck\u201d from Doc O. That\u2019s the arrogance of Paul Offit.  He refuses to use the words \u201cintelligent\u201d and \u201cparents\u201d in the same sentence.  He refuses to acknowledge that lawyers and other laypersons are capable of understanding scientific explanations that come forth in a court of law.  He refuses to acknowledge that he may not have a monopoly on \u201cthe truth.\u201d   Paul Offit is an expert in the field of infectious diseases.  Although one may disagree with his opinions in that field, he certainly deserves a respectful listen when he speaks on issues relating to his specialty.  He is woefully ignorant, however, about autism, and he has demonstrated repeatedly a complete lack of understanding about the American legal system (which one would think is a lot easier to understand than infectious diseases).  Why is it that he continually speaks as an expert on the issues he is least qualified to address.?  Why is anyone taking this guy seriously? ADDENDUM: After drafting this post, I found out that Paul Offit will be on a panel for the 2008 US Court of Federal Claims Judicial Conference.  The session is entitled \u201cVaccine Compensation Under the Act: A Mix of Science and Policy?,\u201d and it appears that Offit will be the only physician to participate.

{"date": "Saturday, November 08, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      I always wince a little whenever I see phrases like \u201cred herring\u201d and \u201cstraw man\u201d bandied about in our little internet discussions.  I always get the impression that the person using such a phrase is more interested in scoring debate points than he/she is in actually listening to the other side.  So it is with great irony that I find myself writing these words.  Our old pal, Dr. Paul \u201cI\u2019m not really interested in the millions I\u2019ve made; only in your children\u201d Offit recently published his latest manifesto, entitled  Autism\u2019s False Prophets .  As I mentioned in my last post, I don\u2019t intend to review the book, as that would involve actually purchasing it.  But I am fascinated by the recent media coverage surrounding the release of the book. The press seems content to accept at face value Doc O\u2019s pronouncements that there have been all those epidemiological studies that refute any connection between the increases in the vaccine schedule and the rise in diagnosed autism spectrum disorders.  After all (insert sarcastic tone here), it\u2019s far too difficult for the average reporter to actually look at the studies and see what was actually being measured, or even to find the various published critiques of those studies.  And surely kindly Dr. Paul wouldn\u2019t mislead anyone by asserting that there is absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest the possibility of a connection.  (For the umpteenth time, let me emphasize here that I do not believe the connection has been established beyond doubt, but I do believe that there is enough clinical and biological evidence to warrant a lot more study). No, the press isn\u2019t interested in taking a critical look into the science.  They aren\u2019t asking why a pediatrician who has never been active in the treatment of autism should be considered an expert in causation of autism.  And they sure aren\u2019t troubled by the vested interest Paul Offit has in absolving vaccines of any guilt in being one of the possible triggers of the ASD epidemic.  But what they are interested in is lurid details that have nothing whatsoever to do with Dr. Offit\u2019s thesis \u23af that\u2019s right, a red herring. Reportedly in his book, and certainly in his interviews, Dr. Offit has alleged getting hate mail, assaults, and even death threats.  He specifically has spoken of getting an anonymous phone call, mentioning the name of one of his children and the name of the school the child attended.  Now before I go any farther, let me emphasize that nothing could possibly condone that kind of conduct.   If  Dr. Offit did indeed receive such threats, I would certainly hope that the authorities aggressively investigated the incidents.  No matter who is the recipient of such threats, I would hope that the perpetrators are found, prosecuted and appropriately penalized. It\u2019s terrible that I have to show any skepticism as to Dr. Offit\u2019s veracity, but let\u2019s face it, we only have his word for it and he\u2019s not someone that I find very credible.  But assuming  arguendo  that there is at least some shred of truth in what he\u2019s reporting, the question arises:  what does that have to do with whether overvaccination and/or vaccine components may be a potential trigger of ASD.   Yes, I get it.  This is an emotional subject for many of us, and part of Dr. Offit\u2019s argument is that we are so blinded by our rage that we are willing to listen to the \u201cfalse prophets\u201d instead of the \u201creal doctors\u201d like him.  Bullshit!  That does nothing to prove that Paul Offit is right; it is merely a red herring that he threw out as bait for a ravenous press, and they bit down hard. As at least  one story by ABC  reports, there has been an ugliness to the debate that goes beyond the bounds of decency.  The ugliness extends to both sides.  One  TACA  representative recounted being labeled a \u201cbaby killer.\u201d  I can relate to that.  I\u2019ve been called a child abuser because my wife and I choose to attempt curing our son of the disabling aspects of his ASD, and I\u2019ve even been called an accomplice to murder because I dare to talk about biomedical interventions in public.  I\u2019ve never received anything that I would consider to be a credible threat to my safety or to the safety of my family \u23af but it would only take a minor bit of exaggeration to imply the existence of threats.   Is Paul Offit exaggerating when he describes the threats to his and his family\u2019s safety?  I hope so; I really don\u2019t want to believe that anyone\u2019s safety has been placed in jeopardy because of participation in our little debate.  And as I have said, if threats have actually been made, I truly hope enough of a trail was left so that the authorities can take appropriate action.  But again, real threats would not make Dr. Offit right. For some reason, the issues of cure (and I always feel the need to clarify that I view that concept as a process rather than a result) and the potential connection between vaccinations and the triggering of ASD wind up creating a passionate debate in which there is no middle ground.  All too often the words that are used can easily be termed \u201chate speech,\u201d and gas is thus poured onto the fire.   To be sure, that gas has been thrown by both sides.  On \u201cour side,\u201d there was a blogger named John (he probably still has a blog, but his irrelevance has finally caught up to him) who regularly engaged in the worst imaginable hate speech.  Some on the \u201cother side\u201d called upon me, on multiple occasions, to disassociate myself from John.  And on multiple occasions I made clear that I saw no need to disassociate myself from someone with whom I did not associate in the first place.  I went so far as to warn one of the prominent voices from the \u201cother side\u201d that he and his friends were spending too much energy directing hatred at that blogger, and they were making John a much more important figure than he otherwise would be. Ironically, those people who railed at John were the same ones who forever scream at the logical fallacies they believe they can spot in others arguments.  And here they created the ultimate straw man to try and knock down.  I\u2019m still not certain that the creation of that straw man was not intentional, so that there would be an easy target to direct hate at.  Likewise, I\u2019m not at all sure that the focus on the alleged threats against Paul Offit \u23af which threats may or may not be genuine \u23af  is not intentional.  Threats are a sexier issue than sufficiency of science, and there is no bait the press enjoys more than fresh red herring.  As long as the press is biting down on that bait, they\u2019re too busy to ask real questions.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ColdandFluNews/story?id=6150482&page=1", "http://www.talkaboutcuringautism.org/index.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/11/of-red-herrings-and-straw-men.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t OF RED HERRINGS AND STRAW MEN\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, November 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      David Kirby has a  new piece on the  Huffington Post , looking at the development of autism in American-born children of Somali refugees in the Minneapolis area.  Those families are now seeing an ASD rate that is truly alarming:  one-in-28. Not surprisingly, many of the affected families are focusing on one of the aspects of American life that is different than their native country:  the vaccination program.  Mr. Kirby covers that, and also one hypothesis addressing what might make for the difference among the Somalis.  Dr. Gregory A. Plotnikoff, medical director for the Institute for Health and Healing at Abbott Northwestern Hospital, believes that the move to an area at a higher latitude has had an impact on the Somalis, who may have a naturally lower ability to produce Vitamin D.  And the decreased Vitamin D levels translates to less creation of glutathione in the body, and that deficiency makes it more difficult for children \u201cto handle heavy metals and oxidative stress.\u201d  (I need to point out that potential exposures to heavy metals and oxidative stress may include vaccines, but are certainly not limited to them.) It should go without saying (but I\u2019ll say it anyway) that the Somali cases \u23af at this point anyway \u23af are nothing more than anecdotal, and prove nothing.  But as  I have tried to point out before , anecdotes are an important part of any scientific inquiry.  They signal the need to ask particular questions.  And the questions in Minneapolis require the full attention of the scientific and medical communities.   Unfortunately, the medical establishment is predictably slow in responding.  At least one mother states that she brought the Somali-autism problem to the attention of state and local health officials as early as April, 2007.  Those pleas for help were ignored until the news media began to ask questions.  Now the state\u2019s health department has assembled a team under an epidemiologist.  That team will soon be meeting to discuss what they need to do to figure out if there is even a problem that needs to be studied.

Predictably, the mainstream media has taken him very seriously, despite the fact that he has not actively diagnosed or treated autism.  It\u2019s enough that he is Paul Offit. Of course, one part of the story feeding the media attention is the claim by Dr. O that he has been the target of death threats.  I have no way of determining whether those threats actually exists, or if their existence is nothing more than the \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d magnification of seriousness of the crap that all of us who have publicly debated this issue receive from one side or the other.  I have said before that I find any personal attacks to be distasteful, and I gladly join in condemning threats of violence directed at anyone \u23af even Paul Offit.  Whether or not such communications are intended to be serious, they are potentially illegal and morally reprehensible. No matter how sympathetic I might be toward Dr. O\u2019s concerning the alleged threats made toward he and his family, however, I still find myself disgusted at his disingenuous arguments, and his cavalier attitude. I have not read his most recent book, so I can only comment on what he is saying in his media blitz to promote the publication.  But I would only be repeating the things I have written time and again because Paul Offit is saying nothing new.  Instead, I\u2019ll let someone else do the talking. In connection with a recent fluff piece on Dr. Offit\u2019s book,  Newsweek  posted a few videos on its website.  In one, kindly Doc O talks about how sad it is that we\u2019re all too dumb to understand science.  In another, the blogger, Kristina Chew, explains why she does not believe vaccines had anything to do with her son\u2019s autism.  But  Newsweek  also posted the video I include below, consisting of an interview with Bob Krakow, a guy who gives lawyers a good name and who I am proud to call my friend.  As always, Bob speaks for a lot of us, even when he is just talking about the singular experience of his own family. ADDENDUM: Please see the comments section to see what Bob Krakow has to say about this video.

{"date": "Saturday, May 09, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n       The Autism File , in both its print and on-line incarnations, has paid tribute to autism mothers everywhere.  It\u2019s oh-so-timely, and oh-so-deserved. I am in constant awe of the mothers of special needs kids that I have met over the last several years.  They are relentless.  They spend endless hours searching for answers, and wind up becoming the real experts.  I\u2019ve seen some of them, with little or no formal medical training, not only become conversant in technical jargon, but they have learned the fine points of clinical application.   Special needs mothers do whatever it takes to stand up for their kids.  They educate themselves on their children\u2019s rights, and they become tireless advocates. I have the privilege of sharing my life with such a woman.  There is not a day that passes without my looking at her and marveling that God could create such a person. It\u2019s not entirely inaccurate to say that what motivates special-needs mothers is the same thing that motivates any mother:  an endless supply of unconditional love for their children.  That\u2019s the saintly quality of motherhood.  What sets apart \u201cspecial needs\u201d mothers is the opportunity to show an extra measure of maternal devotion on a daily basis. With that in mind, I\u2019d like to re-post a portion of something I first wrote at the end of October, 2005.  I posted it for All Saints Day of that year [the complete post is  here ], because I wanted to explain to the world why it was that I claimed sainthood for my own mother. Betty Bursley was born to an old New England family, a direct descendant of Mayflower pilgrims. Her father was a landscape architect for the United States Park Service, and she grew up primarily in Cleveland and Richmond. Education was valued in the family, and my mother earned a degree in biology from Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College. During World War II, she met and married a handsome lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers, Hugh F. Rankin. After the war, Dad went back to school, and wound up becoming a professional historian. Throughout graduate school and beyond, my mother worked (mostly clerical jobs), helped entertain Dad\u2019s professional colleagues, served as Dad\u2019s typist and most-trusted editor, and raised three sons. She was not only our mother, but was also the best teacher any of us ever had. There was little about the world around us that my mother could not explain and help us understand. Eventually, the family came to New Orleans, where Dad joined the faculty at Tulane University. Faculty pay in the fifties being what it was, my mother needed a job, and she became the secretary for the newly formed Jazz Archive (now called the William Ransom Hogan Archive of New Orleans Jazz) at Tulane\u2019s Howard Tilton Memorial Library. She took notes at jazz funerals and second-line parades, assisted the curators in conducting oral histories, and helped organized a priceless collection of recordings, sheet music, photographs, and memorabilia. She developed a passion for the music and a genuine love for the musicians. Despite no academic background in musicology, Mom eventually became an associate curator of the Archive. After retiring from the Archive, my mother (by that time known as \u201cBig Mama,\u201d a nickname she acquired partly because Dad had been dubbed \u201cBig Daddy\u201d by his graduate students) took on several volunteer positions with various groups. In the early eighties, she heard about a fledgling community radio station, WWOZ, which needed volunteers. For the uninitiated,  WWOZ  plays a wide variety of genres, but specializes in the musical forms that help to define South Louisiana. My mother started out typing letters and stuffing envelopes, but somebody soon realized the resource they had, and she was thrown in front of a microphone. For the next several years, Big Mama hosted what became known as the \u201cMoldy Fig Jam,\u201d a popular 90-minute program of Traditional Jazz and Ragtime on Saturday mornings. Mom took enormous pleasure in sharing her love of New Orleans music, and included far more background on the musicians than could be found anywhere else on the radio dial. After decades of being known as Hugh Rankin\u2019s wife, she was now an internationally known personality (WWOZ\u2019s web feed has made it a world-wide favorite). Of course, the fact that she was a nice person who had a knack for teaching others what she knew did not qualify her for sainthood. The remarkable thing about Big Mama was the nature of the lessons she taught. And the best way to explain that is to write about her parting lesson. During a heart operation in the eighties, Big Mama received some tainted blood, and contracted Hepatitis C. It went undetected for years, until she eventually started having active liver disease. My mother expressed no bitterness, and she blamed nobody. She faced this problem as she faced everything in life, good or bad: with equal parts optimism and acceptance. In late 1997, Big Mama\u2019s liver began to fail altogether, and she spent the next few months alternating between improving and falling into hepatic comas. Whether she was conscious or comatose, my brothers and I, and often our wives, were at the hospital a lot: reading to her, helping to feed her, or just spending time. She had a spell in the middle when she was alert, happy, and as full of life as anyone could hope to be. We talked for hours about lots of things: philosophy, religion (Mom was a lifelong Presbyterian; I am an Episcopalian), music, politics, and whatever happened to be going on in the world. It was important small talk, because no matter what plans we made, the unspoken reality was that she probably wasn\u2019t going to be coming home. Sure enough, Big Mama fell into another hepatic coma, from which she clearly wasn\u2019t going to come out. A few days before she died, I got out the Bible from which we read during her last alert interval. Struggling to figure out what to read to her, I went to the assigned readings of the day listed in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer I had left in her room. One of the readings was the familiar exhortation by St. Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians: If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing. Love is patient; love is kind; love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. There could be no more fitting passage to describe my mother\u2019s relationship with her family, her friends, and the world around her. I looked up and saw my mother sitting upright in bed nodding her head. Her meaning was clear: \u201cThat\u2019s it; that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d She put her head back onto her pillow, still beaming a beatific smile. That was the first time in almost a week that her head had been off of the pillow or that any expression could be discerned on her face. It was the last time she communicated in any way. My mother passed away on February 24, 1998, as I held her hand and my wife, Sym, stroked her hair. (In a last act of kindness, Big Mama held on until Sym could get there so I wouldn\u2019t be alone.) Of all days, it was Mardi Gras morning. We were at Touro Infirmary, a hospital just a block off of St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans. Along the Avenue, families were gathered to celebrate life as it can only be celebrated in New Orleans. I like to think Big Mama, hoping to second line one last time, wandered around until she found the Irish Channel Corner Club making their annual \u201cmarch\u201d downtown to the beat of the Paulin Brothers Band. I can only hope the band was playing \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter whether there is a label; every child is a \u201cspecial needs\u201d child.  Each is unique.  Each is deserving of the saintly love of a great mother. Happy Mother\u2019s Day to all the wonderful women who give that kind of love.

{"date": "Sunday, May 17, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      Most of us are tired of the whole concept of \"autism awareness.\"  Shouldn't the world be aware enough already?  But every now and then I see something that tells me the job is not done yet. There was apparently a recent letter to  The Arizona Republic , in which some cranky individual decried the fact that disruptive children are seen in public.  In response, Mr. David Cuddeby wrote the following response (go  here  to see the original post and comments): The behavior of some children in the store where letter writer Cherie Anderson works describes the way my 3-year-old grandson occasionally acts (\"Stores no place for unruly children,\" Letters, Friday). I guess we could get him a little T-shirt that says, \"This is how autism looks.\" Perhaps we will take her advice and just leave him at home. As she points out, it is our problem, not hers. The sarcasm in Mr. Cuddeby's last sentence was lost on the folks around there.  Here's one of the comments left at the on-line posting of the letter: Mr. Cuddeby, you're quite correct in you last statement in your letter; it IS your problem, not anyone else's. Is your child better served, during those periods of time his behavior becomes uncontrollable, in a public place, where he can - and does - become an object of ridicule by others unaware of his health condition or with his other parent, at home, in an environment he knows to be safe for him? I want to be clear - I am not saying you should lock your child away at home. I'm suggesting that you, as a responsible parent, need to determine what lengths outside activity has a beneficial effect on your autistic child, and have an option available for those periods of time you child enters one of his autistic fugue states. Actually, that was one of the nicer comments.  Here's one that seem to lay the real feelings of some folks in Arizona on the line: Okay, let's give a little of this unruly behavior to autistic children who represent 1 out of 150 kids. Now please explain away the other 149 brats screaming at the top of their lungs. God, we have become such wimps and seek to victimize every thing we do. Nipple sucking liberals always have a \"reason\" for why criminals committ [sic] crimes and how it;s [sic] not their fault and why kids act like brats. Sad. The general tone of the more civilized comments was that parents of autistic children should not subject their kids to more than they can handle.  Loosely translated, that means, \"please don't bring your children anywhere where we might be reminded that this autism thing exists.\" So despite our desire to move on, we still need autism awareness.  We need for the world to be aware that this is not just our problem; it is everyone's.

{"date": "Friday, November 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n       I was approached a little over a month ago, and was asked if I would be interested in reviewing a new book,  Against Medical Advice  (Little, Brown and Co., 2008).  In the email I got from the publisher\u2019s representative, I was told that I, and visitors to my blog would \u201cfind it very relatable and moving.\u201d  [Disclosure:  I was sent a free copy of the book in order to read and review it.] The book is written by James Patterson, the well-known novelist ( Kiss the Girls ;  Along Came a Spider ), and an old friend of his, Hal Friedman.  Despite Patterson\u2019s background as a writer of thrillers, this is a piece of nonfiction.  It tells the story of the struggle by Friedman\u2019s family to deal with \u201can agonizing medical mystery:\u201d  his son\u2019s Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. I\u2019ve been struggling with this review ever since I read the book.  It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t find it \u201cvery relatable and moving;\u201d I did.  I think it\u2019s a very good book that\u2019s well worth the time spent reading it.  It\u2019s just that I wanted to like it a whole lot more. The book\u2019s strong points are also its weaknesses.  The story is told not from the standpoint of Hal Friedman or his wife, but rather it\u2019s written as if by his son, Cory.  This was done with the full cooperation of Cory (now a young adult), and is seemingly based in part on his own writings.  Presenting the story with Cory\u2019s point of view, filtered through the fast-paced style of an experienced novelist, takes the reader on a harrowing ride through what can only be described as Hell.   And Hell it was for Cory.  His Tourette\u2019s has unique aspects (some would call them comorbidities) that befuddled the \u201cexperts,\u201d and made everything that much more difficult: In sophomore year, it\u2019s becoming clear that obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, is a bigger part of my condition than we thought.  Right now I\u2019m mostly experiencing the kind of OCD they call intrusive thoughts \u23af ideas that can take over your thinking.  The worst thought I have now is that there\u2019s no point to anything in life.  This obsessive idea has suddenly paralyzed my desire to do anything  . . .  The fact that the focus is on Cory\u2019s own Hell rather than that of his family keeps it from becoming a \u201cpity party.\u201d  On the other hand, knowing that the book was written as nonfiction by experienced writers makes the use of Cory\u2019s point of view to be almost gimmicky at times.  Moreover, there\u2019s a lack of perspective, which can be somewhat effective but leaves the reader wanting more information that actually comes through. And it\u2019s that lack of information that is somewhat maddening.  There are gaps in the chronological narrative that leave many questions unanswered.  And indeed, one of the central questions the book raises \u23af why Cory got better \u23af is answered only by the educated guess of Hal Friedman in one of the few passages not told in Cory\u2019s voice. Enough information comes through, though, to make clear the real theme of the book:  that the medical establishment the family relied upon to help Cory deal with his condition did nothing but make things a whole lot worse.   After years of being moved from one pharmaceutical to another, with ever-increasing dosages, Cory eventually resorts to self-medicating with alcohol.  After a particularly bad episode involving alcohol, Cory wrote a long letter to himself, that includes the following: Am I insane?  It would seem so.  I can\u2019t stop hurting myself. My parents don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve gone through.  If they did, they\u2019d be saying every word to me as if it were their last. I deserve the world. And I am stronger than the worst things that happen to me. That episode is the turning point of Cory\u2019s life.  In the view of Hal Friedman, in the only chapter written in his voice rather than his son\u2019s, Cory\u2019s \u201crecovery\u201d comes about because \u201che made the decision to change.\u201d At some point, Cory\u2019s parents joined in that decision as well.  The opening chapter of the book relays the incident from which the title is drawn.  Mr. and Mrs. Friedman are checking their son into a rehab facility to combat the alcohol addiction that is claiming their son.  Cory is the one who recognizes that particular institutional setting will be a huge mistake, and he pleads with his parents to not leave him there.  For the first time, the parents decide to trust their son\u2019s instincts rather than the mainstream medical advice that has led them from one pharmaceutical product to another.  They leave \u201cagainst medical advice.\u201d Unfortunately, it is hard to tell just where that incident falls in the otherwise chronological narrative following that chapter.  As most of the latter part of the book details Cory\u2019s success with various programs and strategies, more context would have made that section stronger. As I mentioned, the only part of the story told from the father\u2019s perspective consists of a five-page epilogue, indicating that Cory\u2019s improvement is attributed to Cory\u2019s desire to get better, and also to the elimination of the \u201cmedications prescribed in good faith but with unhappy results.\u201d  Although Mr. Friedman uses the word \u201crecovery,\u201d it is acknowledged that Cory still experiences many clinical manifestations of his Tourette\u2019s.  It is unclear how much of Cory\u2019s \u201crecovery\u201d is due to an acceptance of the level of the syndrome Cory lives with in the absence of the aggravating factor of being treated as a walking pharmaceutical experiment. At 269 pages (not including some appendices), the book is a little on the \u201clight\u201d side.  I think some time could have been devoted to the parent\u2019s experience (including their expectations) without removing the focus from Cory.  Moreover, giving voice to the parents might have made the representation of Cory\u2019s perceptions to be less awkward. All that being said, I liked the book \u23af just not as much as I wanted to.  Its flaws notwithstanding, it\u2019s a good read.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/SScA_yknIdI/AAAAAAAAAEw/JfoGrvABbwM/s1600-h/Against+Medical+Advice+Cover.jpg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/11/against-medical-advice.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Sunday, May 24, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      Another  Autism One  Conference has come and gone.  A-1 has become the best of the autism conferences.  It covers the biomedical side of things in an inclusive and comprehensive manner, but it also includes so much more to connect attendees to the often-scary world of autism, from political and legal issues to educational strategies.  Just as importantly \u23af maybe more importantly \u23af the people who come from around the country, and beyond our borders, meet and learn the most important lesson of all.  We are not alone. This year, I volunteered and made fewer of the sessions than I did in the past.  (I was under orders to attend the talk my lovely-and-talented wife, Sym Rankin, gave with the also-talented Sonya Hintz, giving advice on getting mainstream physicians to look past the autism and understand the underlying physical problems.  They did a great job.)  Instead, I filled most of my time manning the registration/information desk, and just talking to people.   I did make a couple of sessions that helped to place a context on where we are in this troubling time.  One was Friday evening\u2019s talk by Mark Blaxill, entitled, \u201cIntellectual and Moral Failures in Autism Science.\u201d   It was thoughtful, provocative, and perhaps a little controversial.  The basic theme was that the autism epidemic demands moral action, and we simply aren\u2019t getting it from the intellectual elite.  Rather than open their eyes, most people in the sciences are content to let the elite do their thinking for them; they are caught up in \u201cexpert worship.\u201d  (As we saw in recent examples of the worst in mainstream \u201cjournalism,\u201d the elite have a willing partner in the media:  see  here  and  here ). Mr. Blaxill drew parallels \u23af and he was very careful to note that parallelism is not the equivalent of proportionality, so this is not meant to be an invidious comparison \u23af between the silence of the \u201cgood Germans\u201d in Nazi-controlled Germany and that of scientists who might suspect there is a truth beyond what they are told to believe.  There is a moral requirement to bear witness that is simply not being fulfilled, and we all need to hold the world of science accountable. Mark Blaxill was also part of the other session I want to mention.  He, Kim Stagliano, and Dan Olmsted were part of a panel discussion ostensibly about  Age of Autism , which has become the daily news organ of record for some if us.  And while they did discuss the history and mission of  AoA , they decided to focus on the single most important story they have covered (see  here  and the links therein).  To do that, they turned the program over to three members of the Somali community (two from the community in Minnesota, which has been deeply affected by autism, and one from Toronto).  They spoke of the incredible outbreak of ASD within their ethnic group, a people that had no need for the word \u201cautism\u201d in their language until they came to America.  What they experienced here told them that the regression of their children into ASD was a result of vaccinations being forced upon them with little explanation and no real justification. At first, I shared the Somalis\u2019 anger.  I felt a twinge of shame that my country, with its tradition of doing right by those who seek its shelter, could first force these newest Americans into a vaccination program that triggered a disease they had no prior knowledge of, and then the same country ignored their plight.  But their story did not end with anger.  They took action.  They organized and found ways to get people to listen to them.  And they have hope. Action and hope:  that pretty much sums up my 2009 Autism One experience.  I was expecting to see a smaller-than-average turnout, considering the economy and the media attacks on our opinions.  I was surprised to see that attendance was actually quite heavy.   Many old friends were unable to make it, but there were lots of new friends to be made.  And they weren\u2019t shy about asking the veterans for help.  I referred several people to the  TACA  moms, who took a lot of time to give fantastic advice (you ladies are the absolute best, and a special shout-out to Linda and Christina).   The newbies there helped to energize me for the continuing fight.  They are already taking action to help their children.  And they are filled with hope, something I share with them.   Action is required, and the hope is real.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismone.org/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/05/olmsted-on-autism-welcome-to-illinois.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/05/on-media-the-chicago-tribune-fails-children-with-autism.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/", "http://www.talkaboutcuringautism.org/index.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/05/people-of-action-and-hope.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t PEOPLE OF ACTION AND HOPE\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Sunday, February 15, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      After the Court of Claims issued its ruling denying recovery in the thee vaccine-induced autism cases,  SafeMinds issued a statement , which included the following quote: \u201cThe government has its thumb on the scales of justice,\u201d said Jim Moody, director of SafeMinds and an advisor to the Petitioners Steering Committee of the U.S Federal Court of Claims.  \u201cThe Vaccine Injury Compensation Act passed by Congress in 1986 gave immunity to vaccine manufacturers and removed the incentive to create safer products.  Meanwhile, the law only gives the illusion that parents will have their day in court.  The process is dysfunctional and many families will not see justice done.\u201d As was stated in  the reaction issued by the National Autism Association:   \u201cAdvocates say they are disappointed in today\u2019s rulings, but not surprised.\u201d  Indeed, the decision did not come as a shock to anyone who as spent time around the legal system.   For the last several years that I actively practiced law, I often said that the last place one should go to find justice is the courthouse.  As a corollary to that idea, I would add that the further removed from a jury decision one gets, the more remote the chance of achieving justice becomes.   And it doesn\u2019t get much further removed than special masters. The cases pending in the so-called vaccine court never really stood a chance.  No matter what anyone says about a reduced burden of proof, the fact remains that there was still a burden imposed on the plaintiffs, and that burden made ruling against the plaintiffs the far  easier path for the finders of fact (in this case, the special masters).   Add in the fact that a plaintiffs\u2019 ruling would have meant taking a stand against a powerful, mainstream establishment of vested interests, and the ruling of February 13th was a  fait accompli . Even though the \u201cscience\u201d supporting the defense in these cases was bullshit \u23af and there\u2019s really no other word for it \u23af that bullshit had widespread support in the mainstream, and the emerging science showing a connection between vaccines and the onset of ASD did not.  The court system is not prone to accepting emerging science. I need to make it clear that I am not questioning the personal integrity of the special masters.  But judges (even the in-for-life federal judges who will determine the appeals of these cases) tend to take the easy road.  There\u2019s nothing easy about questioning what too many in the medical community accept as an unquestionable article of faith.  Unfortunately, the science demonstrating a link between the currently insane vaccine schedule and the triggering of disorders on the autism spectrum is \u201cemerging.\u201d  Science always takes time; in this case, it is taking even more time than it should.  It\u2019s hard to march uphill carrying the weight of the conventional \u201cwisdom\u201d that is being challenged.  So it\u2019s going to be a while longer before the rest of the world is ready t even consider the possibility that we might just be right. Dan Olmsted,  at  Age of Autism , likened the recent decision to an early move in a long chess game.  Although I don\u2019t think this is a game we\u2019re playing (and I also don\u2019t think that Dan is implying it is), the analogy fits.  We still have a long way to go. For the immediate concern of the three families that got screwed by the decision, and for the thousands of families that were relying on a favorable outcome to give them hope in their own claims, there is the hope of the appeals process.  I regret to say that I\u2019m not expecting any different outcome. But winning monetary awards was never what this struggle has been about.  The Court was just one venue of a much broader struggle.  That struggle is to get the world to understand what happened to our children, and to get our society to recognize its obligation to help.  That\u2019s the justice we need. There have been many steps on this journey.  In reflecting on what the rulings mean, I thought back to April, 2006, and the Mercury Generation Rally in Washington.  Like thousands of parents who wanted to be there, I was stuck at home working.  The whole day of the rally, however, I kept hearing an old refrain going through my head: We shall not, we shall not be moved. We shall not, we shall not be moved. We\u2019re fighting for our children, We shall not be moved. I went home, and I wrote  a post , which included the following: . . . Everything I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years tells me we\u2019re on the right track.  I recall visiting relatives living in tobacco country as a boy. I can still hear my father\u2019s cousin, who operated a wholesale business for tobacco products, railing about those litigation-seeking agitators who were trying to draw a connection between cigarettes and cancer.  He could cite lots of impressive studies that \u201cdisproved\u201d the connection, but we came to find out those studies were dictated more by interests than science.  In the autism controversies, both sides claim that it\u2019s the other guys using \u201ctobacco science.\u201d  It says a lot to me that only one side says the debate is over.  That side needs to be reminded that there are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon. Yes, there are a lot of us out here, we're everywhere, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon.  We\u2019ll be here until the truth is known.  Once the truth is known to a degree that nobody can argue against it, we\u2019ll have justice for ourselves, for our children, and for children yet to be born.  Let\u2019s not get lose faith just because that justice could not be found in the last place we should be looking.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.safeminds.org/pressroom/documents/SafeMindsOmnibusStatement_full.pdf", "http://www.nationalautismassociation.org/press021209.php", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/olmsted-on-autism-the-art-of-chess.html#more"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/02/last-place-to-look-for-justice.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE LAST PLACE TO LOOK FOR JUSTICE\n\t \n    "},

Well, it seems those parents just might not be crazy after all.  Of course, the powers that be are not yet willing to acknowledge that point. As the  Associated Press reported : The Health Department studied Minneapolis public school autism programs for the three years starting with the 2005 school year. Researchers found the percentage of Somali children in the programs was two to seven times higher than non-Somali children. \u201cWhat that doesn't prove is that more Somali children have autism,\u201d Health Commissioner Sanne Magnan said Tuesday.  \u201cThat is the question that is still on the table.\u201d . . .   . . . the report said that one of the big questions is whether children might be misclassified when evaluators aren\u2019t familiar with the child\u2019s language, culture and behaviors that might be routine among some racial or ethnic groups.

{"date": "Thursday, February 19, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      Last week, after the decision came down from the Court of Claims, we started seeing some amazing statements coming from prominent people within the mainstream medical establishment.  Doctors who ordinarily curse the legal system and swear that it\u2019s absolutely the wrong place to decide scientific and medical questions were immediately transformed into true believers.  Suddenly, a disputed scientific and medical question was deemed to be settled because a special master (in essence, an assistant judge) decreed it so. Dr. David Perlin, Director of the Public Health Research Institute at New Jersey Medical School, was one such doctor.  He wrote a  letter to the editor  of  The New York Times , which is discussed paragraph-by-paragraph below.   I empathize with the thousands of parents who struggle to raise children with autism and desperately seek answers to its cause.  But I am outraged as a scientist and infectious diseases specialist that a vocal group of media personalities and politicians, latching onto a badly flawed vaccine-link hypothesis, could have so wrongly influenced society. Speaking only as one parent, I would like to thank Dr. Perlin for his empathy, but I\u2019d like to suggest that what we\u2019d really like is for him to understand that this our hypothesis is not the product of media personalities and politicians.  First of all, if he would take the time to actually look at the issue fairly (if we are to give Dr. Perlin the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is expressing an honestly-held-albeit-sloppily-arrived-at opinion), he might understand that there is not a single hypothesis at issue here, but several hypotheses that are all subsets of a large and very broad hypothesis.   It is gross oversimplification to speak (or write) as though this was simply a question of blaming thimerosal, in and of itself, the MMR, in and of itself, or even a simple combination of thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR.  That oversimplification has been the weapon of distraction that many of the more disingenuous defenders of the status quo have used.  By resorting to that oversimplified thinking, Dr. Perlin is \u201clatching onto a badly flawed\u201d argument. Next, Dr. Perlin writes:  By casting doubt on vaccine safety and dismissing extensive scientific evidence to the contrary from a wide spectrum of experts, they instilled fear in parents and detrimentally disrupted vaccine practices worldwide.  The consequences of this action may have harmed many more children and adults than they had hoped to help. Puhleeze!  I\u2019ve seen no evidence that vaccination rates are appreciably lower than they ever were.   And just who are this \u201cwide spectrum of experts?\u201d  Is he talking about the assembled group at the Simpsonwood conference, who managed to take a study showing a positive connection and convert it to a neutral study (and for some reason, people like Dr. Perlin seem to interpret the word \u201cneutral\u201d as meaning absolute proof of there being no connection).   Or maybe he\u2019s talking about our friends in Denmark who realized that the best way to study the impact of thimerosal would be to change the criteria for inclusion in the two populations they supposedly  were trying to compare.  Dr. Perlin\u2019s right; there are soooo many scientific studies against the hypotheses we cling to.  If only any of them had an ounce of scientific integrity, we might actually be convinced. Next, we get another glimpse of the empathetic Dr. Perlin: Equally important, it diverted scarce resources away from getting at the true underlying causes of this devastating disorder, leaving the parents of autistic children without the answers they deserve. Okay, is it just me, or is anyone else thinking about OJ looking for the \u201creal killer\u201d on golf courses all over America?  Hey, maybe that\u2019s where they\u2019ll find it \u23af you know,  the  gene (the one that\u2019s solely responsible for all cases of autism without the slightest environmental influence). Finally, Dr. Perlin leaves with this little nugget: We need to learn that engaging in amateurish science makes for bad public policy. I couldn\u2019t agree more.  That\u2019s why I choose to be highly skeptical of all of the \u201cscience\u201d used to validate the safety of the vaccine schedule that\u2019s currently being shoved down the throats of the American public.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/bwzblf"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/02/read-our-collective-lips-it-aint-over.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t READ OUR COLLECTIVE LIPS:  IT AIN\u2019T OVER\n\t \n    "},

Although Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey were the main attractions, the real stars of the evening were Dr. Bernadine Healy and J.B. Handley.   The video includes a remarkable display of intellectual integrity from Dr. Healey, the former Director of the NIH.  Unfortunately, this edited version does not include any of Mr. Handley\u2019s remarks. I have always been thankful for Mr. Handley\u2019s contributions to keeping this debate in the forefront.

He was in control of the facts to a far greater extent than the medical \u201cexperts\u201d on the other side, and his manner was a fine balance of rationality and emotion.  Very nice job, indeed, JB. Those who saw the show were introduced to a young girl, with what appears to be relatively profound autism.  As every parent of an autistic child knows, however, ASD does not indicate a lack of intelligence or a lack of desire to communicate.  Carly Fleischmann has started  her own blog  to express her thoughts.  She was in communication with the show, and some of her comments were posted to the  Larry King Live  blog .  One of those comments was: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can cure autism but I wish we could.

{"date": "Thursday, April 02, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      It\u2019s  World Autism Awareness Day , as declared by the United Nations General Assembly.  How nice. And of course, this WAAD is simply a lead-in to \u201cAutism Awareness Month.\u201d  Over  at  Age of Autism , Kim Stagliano has suggested renaming it \u201cAutism Epidemic Action Month,\u201d because: We\u2019re doers \u23af not do-gooders.  There\u2019s a difference.  Awareness is no longer enough.  It never was. That\u2019s a fine suggestion, but for now we\u2019re stuck with the observances recognized by mass media. It all begs the question; why do we need to be more aware?  Is there really anyone out there that doesn\u2019t understand there\u2019s a lot of autism out there these days?   But I suppose there is a need for awareness.  The world needs to be aware that we are seeing a real epidemic, that it\u2019s not just a matter of better diagnosis.  The world needs to be aware that the question of \u201cwhy\u201d has not been answered, and that we need to get to the truth, or things are going to get worse.  The world needs to be aware that the so-called mountain of evidence supposedly leading away from particular causes has disproved nothing. The world needs to be aware that we take very seriously our responsibilities as parents.  Harold L. Doherty,  at  Facing Autism in New Brunswick  addressed that the other day.  He confronted those who attack parents for daring to suggest that there may be non-genetic components in causation, and there may be a hope for a better life through the process of cure.  In his well-written post, Harold states: It is parents who represent our children, protect them and advocate for their best interests. We are not advocating for an abstraction, we are not advocating on behalf of \u201cautistics\u201d, whatever is meant by that expression when used by people who claim to be autistic but claim that autistic disorder is not really a medical disorder.  Attacks on parents advocating for their children with autism disorders are attacks on autistic children by attacking those who protect and advance their children's interests. Reading that reminded me of something my friend,  Ginger, wrote a few years ago , in response to a comment questioning who we are to undertake the \u201cdrastic\u201d step of attempting to cure our children of autism: Who are we?  We are their parents. \u2028\u2028 Making choices that will impact who our children will become is the blessing and burden of parenthood.  We have to make HUGE choices for our children and we don\u2019t get to find out the final impact and totality of those choices until their lives and personalities completely unfold. \u2028\u2028 We are flying with blinders on, with the only view in the rear view mirror and out the side windows, and we can only make the best choices we can make with that information.  Every time we make a choice for our children, we unchoose every other possibility for them. Indeed.  Our everyday reality is to constantly weigh potential benefits against known risks, and to inform all of our decisions with love. On this World Autism Awareness Day, I\u2019m aware that the life of my family has been made infinitely more difficult because of ASD.  I\u2019m also aware, however, that ASD has provided the opportunity to be inspired in my life.  I am inspired by people like Ginger and Harold, and all of the others I would never have met but for the common struggle.  I am inspired by my older children who constantly demonstrate unconditional love and patience for their younger sibling.  I am inspired by my wife, who works with a small team of amazing professionals to make my son\u2019s life better.  And most of all, I am inspired by the Little Rankster.  He isn\u2019t ready to give up; why should I be discouraged. Be aware.  Be very, very aware.  Be aware that we are here for our children.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/cnu8un", "http://tinyurl.com/cvhcm3", "http://tinyurl.com/d4rhhj", "http://tinyurl.com/cgpqlt"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/04/world-autism-awareness-day.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY\n\t \n    "},

He posted his thoughts on the obvious truth that there is more politics than science behind this new organization.   (Read it  here .) What is most striking about ASF is that its statement that vaccines are not involved in autism takes up m ore space in its stated goals than stating just what it is they do intend to research.  At a time when more and more voices in medicine and science are agreeing that the vaccine-autism issue is not dead, ASF is insisting that there is no issue.  As Harold writes: Given the existence of legitimate questions concerning possible vaccine autism questions it seems odd for an organization founded to provide quality scientific research to make such a dogmatic statement conclusively ruling out those very questions. It also seems odd that the founders of this organization believe that public confidence in the vaccine program will be maintained by shutting the door on areas of research in which substantial numbers of the population believe are legitimate areas of inquiry - including members of the public like Dr. Bernadine Healy, Dr. Julie Gerberding, Dr. Duane Alexander and Dr. Jon Poling.

It marks the birth of the Center for Personal Rights, dedicated to the same principles as the rally itself.  Those principles have been reduced to a statement that has been dubbed \u201cThe Chicago Principles on Vaccination Choice:\u201d We, the people who affirm our belief in personal rights, in order to promote the general health and welfare for ourselves and our children and to establish justice, advocate the following principles:\u2028\u2028 1.    Vaccination choice based on complete and accurate information is a fundamental human right.  \u2028 \u20282.    The right to conscientious objection from vaccination mandates, namely the right to a philosophical exemption, is a fundamental human right.  \u2028\u2028 3.    Laws that make education, employment, daycare and public benefits contingent on vaccination status, except in the most extreme of public health emergencies, violate the fundamental human right to vaccination choice.\u2028 \u20284.    When vaccination is used as a preventive medical intervention for healthy individuals, the precautionary principle must apply.  If there is no public consensus about the need for or safety of certain vaccines, they should neither be recommended nor mandated for universal use. \u2028\u2028 5.    Individuals who are in a position to evaluate, recommend and mandate vaccines must be free of all actual and perceived conflicts of interest. CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION IN THE UNITED STATES\u2028\u2028 1. Congress should conduct oversight hearings on the national vaccine program, including mandates for the military and immigrants, examining vaccine safety, conflicts of interest, suppression of science, evidence of vaccine injury, and comparative empirical data from countries with differing vaccine schedules.\u2028\u2028 2. Congress should immediately initiate a study of vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations for long-term heath outcomes. Such a baseline study has never been done, suggesting that the vaccine schedule as a whole is an experiment on human subjects. This bill is called the \u201cComprehensive Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act\u201d and was originally co-sponsored by Rep. Maloney (D.- N.Y.) and Rep. Osborne (R. \u2013 Ne.).\u2028 \u20283. Congress should create an independent Agency for Vaccine Safety Research. This agency must be completely separate from the Centers for Disease Control, which promotes federal vaccination recommendations for state mandates. This bill is called the \u201cVaccine Safety and Public Confidence Assurance Act\u201d and was originally co-sponsored by Rep. Weldon (R.-Fl.) and Rep. Maloney (D.- N.Y.) \u2028\u2028 4. Congress should abolish the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program or make it optional. The Program has failed in its purpose to quickly, generously and administratively compensate families for vaccine injury and to improve vaccine safety. \u2028 5. Vaccine manufacturers should be subject to ordinary tort liability and civil trials for vaccines. All statutes that shield vaccine manufacturers from ordinary tort liability for vaccine products, such as the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Act (1986) and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (2005), violate the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury in civil cases.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      I seem to have gone back on blogging sabbatical.  That probably won\u2019t last much longer.  I\u2019ve got a few things on my mind, and some of them will likely lead to more frequent writing on my part. In the meantime, we finally got a response from the  Chicago Tribune  to our  open letter  stating our reasons for canceling our subscription.  Frankly, I\u2019m a little surprised we got a detailed response at all.  Curiously, although we received it just yesterday, it is essentially the same as a letter received approximately three weeks ago by acquaintances of ours who wrote their own letter referencing ours. As I put our letter out there for the world to see, it is only fair to acknowledge the response by the  Tribune\u2019s  Standards Editor in a similar manner.   So here it is: Monday, Feb 22 Dear Mr. and Mrs. Rankin: I\u2019m responding on behalf of Tony Hunter, who asked me to review your letter.   As you note, autism is indeed a very complex and often controversial subject.  At every step, the Tribune journalists have been mindful of how sensitive and difficult a topic this is, and how vital it is to address an important public health concern.  I\u2019m sorry that you are so disappointed in the articles and have chosen to cancel your subscription. The reporters and editors decided, early on, that the topic required more depth than a summary of one group says this while another group says that. The Tribune reporting team took months to analyze and seek mote evidence about some of these alternative therapies.  The question was not just why or how some treatments work but if they work.  Our reporters found, in just one example, that some of the widely touted research papers fail to meet standards of respected medical journals. There has been varied reaction.  Some, like you all  [sic] , have felt strongly that these articles have unfairly characterized the alternative therapies.  But we also hear from parents, scientists and physicians in the autism community who want to know more. But it\u2019s not a matter of how many people like, or dislike, coverage.  Rather, the Tribune is obligated to seek more answers and truth about such issues that affect so many people.  You suggest that the Tribune has failed to amplify the seriousness of the situation with these articles.  I would differ with you on that point.  If anything, the Tribune\u2019s articles will do exactly what you suggest is important: amplify the seriousness. There will be more stories, to be sure.  Treatments will continue to change, too, as researchers continue their work. Again, I\u2019m sorry that you are so disappointed with the coverage and hope that at some point you will reconsider. Sincerely, Margaret Holt Let me make it clear.  Our problem with the  Trib\u2019s  reporting was not that it was negative, or showed an editorial bias.  Rather, it was that they feigned balance and fairness in presenting a biased series of reports.  Our complaint is not that the  Trib  is ignoring the seriousness of the need for effective treatments; it is the fact that they focus on particular treatments without pointing a finger at the equally (and in my estimation, more dangerous) treatments utilized by mainstream providers.  And they do so without acknowledging there is a crisis caused by the unprecedented explosion in ASD diagnosis. The very first amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right of a free press.  The drafters of the Bill of Rights understood that a free society needs the healthy and unfettered exchange of ideas and principles.  The media therefore has the right to maintain its own editorial bias.  A corresponding right vests in the people to ignore a media outlet and call it to task if the editorial bias hinders, rather than aids that healthy and unfettered exchange. Writers and editors of newspapers, like the  Tribune , are not evil if they slant the news to match an honestly held belief.  But they have a responsibility to acknowledge (if only to themselves) their bias, and to avoid deception in presenting what they present as \u201caccurate.\u201d   Moreover, as citizens, if not as journalists, they also had a responsibility to acknowledge that there is a growing public-health crisis.  The  Tribune  failed in its responsibilities.   I\u2019m not sure what efforts the reporters went to when they \u201ctook months to analyze and seek more evidence.\u201d  The articles read much like the standard talking points we so often hear, mostly prepared by interested parties who have never raised or treated an autistic child.  Clearly, however, the reporters chose to ignore the thousands of \u201canecdotes\u201d showing improvement in our children.  Is it just a coincidence that the \u201cevidence\u201d the  Trib  chose to highlight serves the interest of an industry that delivers a substantial amount of advertising revenue? The one point on which Ms. Holt and I agree is that \u201c[t]reatments will continue to change . . . as researchers continue their work.\u201d  Unfortunately, improvements in treatments will not change fast enough for many of us, given the public persecution of scientist and practitioners who are seeking answers.  That persecution is fueled primarily by the mainstream press, which is more interested in sensationalism and revenue streams than it is in accuracy. Okay, Ms. Holt, we\u2019ve reconsidered.  The  Chicago Tribune , in my estimation, still lacks integrity and credibility.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 23, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n       I decided to break out of my current blogging sabbatical to briefly comment on the Christmas present Julie Gerberding just got.  For those who have not yet heard, the former head of the Centers for Disease Control \u00ac\u23af the federal agency responsible for formulating our government\u2019s vaccination policies \u23af has  just been named to be the new president of Merck Vaccine . She won\u2019t be able to officially take the job until January 25, 2010.  You see, there\u2019s this pesky law that prevents government officials from taking jobs that might otherwise appear to be a conflict of interest for a period of one year after leaving the government. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but it seems a little contradictory of at least the spirit, and perhaps the letter of the law that this deal was cut well within the one-year period.  That both Gerberding and Merck feel comfortable making this announcement less than a year after her leaving the government shows just how toothless the one-year requirement is.  The waiting period should be raised to at least five years \u23af and maybe more \u23af if it is to mean anything.  And discussions of a job should not commence until that period has completely elapsed. Of course, even a requirement that employment negotiations should await the end of the waiting period would have been much of a safeguard in this \u201cwink-wink/nudge-nudge\u201d world.  Rather than expound on that point, I simply refer you over to  Ginger\u2019s blog , where she lays out the coziness that has always existed between these parties.  When Gerberding first stepped down from the CDC last January, Ginger correctly predicted the outcome, with the only question being whether the final resting place would be Lily or Merck.  The predictability of this appointment does not make it any less shameful.  If those holding positions of public trust in our government felt any shame at all, there would be hearings into this appointment to determine all of the circumstances surrounding the negotiations for the position in light of Dr. Gerberding\u2019s actions (or lack thereof) at the CDC.  I won\u2019t hold my breath waiting for those hearings, though. If those holding positions of public trust in our government felt any shame at all, the crisis that is the ASD epidemic would not likely be nearly as bad as it is.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/SzKn_aisQHI/AAAAAAAAAGI/TxnPOHmYgPU/s1600-h/JGerberding_cdc_photo.jpg", "http://www.merck.com/newsroom/news-release-archive/corporate/2009_1221.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/12/julie-gerberding-named-head-of-merck.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/12/pharma-ho-ho-ho.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t PHARMA HO-HO-HO\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, May 21, 2010", "body": "\n\t \n      The President\u2019s Cancer Panel (pdf  here ) recently issued a report detailing specific recommendations about potential environmental factors contributing to skyrocketing cancer rates and what we can do to minimize those risks.   It\u2019s all sounds pretty familiar to those of us whose experience living in the autism epidemic has caused us to look at the role environmental insults play in the spread and exacerbation of autoimmune disorders, including ASD.  Gee, it turns out that organic produce, grass-fed beef and avoiding environmental toxins might actually be good for us.  Who\u2019d a thunk it? The report is a remarkable \u23af especially as it comes courtesy of the federal government \u23af 240-page document that\u2019s well worth a read.  And it\u2019s gotten praise from a couple of interesting sources. First, we heard from the  New York Times , in an excellent  op-ed piece .  It is beyond encouraging that the most mainstream of media outlets is willing to say that we just might need to rethink the way we live our lives, even if it means that corporate America might need to live with less profits. Then I came upon a very  surprising commentary on the report .  I was not so surprised that the mighty Orac would want to discuss a report about cancer; after all, that is supposedly how he makes a living (as an oncological surgeon and researcher).  But much of what he had to say brought a smile to my face. I have to confess that I\u2019ve always had a bit of an odd fondness for Orac.  Not long after the Little Rankster was diagnosed as being on the spectrum, my wife began to attack the problem from a medical standpoint.  She eventually became convinced of something that initially struck her as being counter-intuitive to everything she had learned \u23af that ASD might be triggered by damage from vaccines (or something in them), and that it can be treated biomedically to undo that damage.  My wife is one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever known, so when she became convinced, I knew I had to take a look at the hypothesis.  My research led me to the oh-so-dangerous internet, where I became fascinated by the scientific and political debate.  And that led me to Orac. I don\u2019t even recall what post it was at the  Huffington Post , but there was a real lively discussion going on in the comments.  The two most interesting people commenting, on opposite sides of the question, were both doctors:   Alan Clark  and Orac.  Dr. Clark inspired me with his intelligence, his passion, and his integrity.  (It is one of the great regrets of my life that did not get a chance to meet Alan before his untimely death, but I have been lucky enough to have a treasured friendship with his wife, Lujene.)  Orac inspired me in a somewhat different way.  After a little friendly sparring at HuffPo, I went to Orac\u2019s blog and checked it out.  My first thought was, \u201coh hell, I can do that.\u201d Despite sharp disagreement on the issues of autism causation and treatment (a dilemma Orac never had to face on a personal level), and the broader issue of vaccine safety, Orac and I stayed on fairly good terms for a couple of years, exchanging thoughts and greetings both on- and off-line.  That ended after I declined his suggestion to \u201cdisassociate\u201d myself from the instigator of a famous internet prank (in retrospect, it seems even funnier than it did at the time) which targeted Orac (see  here  and  here ). It was probably about time anyway that we dispensed with the trappings of cordiality.  By that time, Orac, despite the tongue-in-cheek tone of his blog, had started to take himself way too seriously.  His pronouncements of what is and is not science began to take on the clothing (albeit the same cloth used to tailor the emperor\u2019s new clothes) of purported infallibility.   But then again, he always had that white-coat arrogance wherein he refused to recognize any science that did not meet his expectations.  Once he had determined for himself what the science of vaccine safety and autism was, no additional data would make him change his mind.  And if those who thought differently might expand a hypothesis based on additional observation \u23af a very reasonable exercise of the scientific method \u23af such expansions would be laughed away as \u201cmoving the goal posts.\u201d Arrogance like that, though, borders on hubris, and often leads to amazing inconsistencies.  And that leads me to  Orac\u2019s recent review of the President\u2019s Cancer Panel report  (or as Arlo Guthrie once said:  \u201cI told you that story so I could tell you this one\u201d).   Orac has always been one to speak of the vaccine-autism controversy as a closed subject.  He believes that science has spoken and clearly rejected any connection based on the epidemiological studies that vaccine defenders point to time and again.  Like most such defenders, Orac ignores the  fundamental flaws in the methodology of those studies  as well as the obvious conflicts of interest that weigh against credibility.  That\u2019s why I found myself smiling to see the following passage in Orac\u2019s discussion of the President\u2019s Cancer Panel Report: As tough as biomedical research is in cancer, to my mind far tougher is research trying to tease out the relationship between environmental exposures and cancer risk.  If you want complicated, that\u2019s complicated.  For one thing, obtaining epidemiological data is incredibly labor- and cost-intensive, and rarely are the data clear cut.  There\u2019s always ambiguity, not to mention numerous confounding factors that conspire to exaggerate on the one hand or hide on the other hand correlations between environmental exposures and cancer.   As a result, studies are often conflicting, and making sense of the morass of often contradictory studies can tax even the most skillful scientists and epidemiologists. So let me get this straight.  When one is trying to determine the relationship between environmental insults (including vaccines) and the triggering of autism spectrum disorders, even badly designed epidemiological studies can prove conclusive, no matter how provocative findings in clinical and laboratory settings may be.  But in the case of cancer, it\u2019s \u201ccomplicated.\u201d That very same paragraph compounds the intellectual inconsistency: Communicating the science and epidemiology linking environment and cancer to the public is even harder.  What the lay person often sees is that one day a study is in the news telling him that X causes cancer and then a month later another study says that X doesn\u2019t cause cancer.  Is it any wonder that people are often confused over what is and is not dangerous?  Add to this a distinct inability on the part of most people, even highly educated people, to weigh small risks against one another (an inability that has led to phenomena such as the anti-vaccine movement), and the task of trying to decide what is dangerous, what is not, how policy is formulated based on this science, and how to communicate the science and the policy derived from it to the public is truly Herculean. Somehow you just knew, didn\u2019t you, that Orac would get in a dig at what he labels the \u201canti-vaccine movement.\u201d  We differ, of course, on the semantics.  I would call it the \u201csafe vaccine\u201d movement, but in Orac\u2019s mind, if you ain\u2019t 100% for the current schedule, you\u2019re an \u201canti.\u201d  Besides, labeling those who disagree with you as \u201canti-\u201d something makes for a nice, short-hand  ad hominem  (oh God, I don\u2019t believe I said  that ). Beyond the use of an inaccurate label, though, Orac displays arrogance of a truly Offittian magnitude.   In his mind, anyone who does not wear a white coat to work is utterly incapable of understanding the subtleties of the scientific method.  We are incapable of being able to exercise appropriate judgment in weighing \u201csmall risks.\u201d   Of course, he simply takes it on face value that the risk of adverse effects from vaccines is small, and any evidence to the contrary is discarded as unreliable. Orac\u2019s post is rich in irony.  One of the recommendations of the panel, seemingly finding favor in Orac\u2019s mind is the following: The adoption of a new \u201cprecautionary, prevention-oriented approach\u201d to replace our \u201ccurrent reactionary approaches in which human harm must be proven before action is taken to reduce or eliminate exposure.\u201d  As a part of this approach, it is recommended that the burden of proof of safety should be shifted to the manufacturer, rather than the current burden of proof being upon the government to prove harm. Really.  Would Orac agree that it might be a good idea to apply that same principle to studying the long-term impact of not just individual vaccines and components, but also of the synergistic effect of all of the vaccines on the current schedule?  Up to now, he seems to have felt that members of the public, rather than manufacturers or the government, should bear the burden of funding any such research. I almost shot my morning coffee through my nose when I read Orac\u2019s whole-hearted approval of the Panel\u2019s discussion of environmental factors in childhood cancers: The report emphasizes quite strongly that what we know about the environmental contribution to cancer has lagged far behind our knowledge of other aspects of cancer.  More importantly, one aspect of the environmental contribution to cancer that we often don\u2019t consider strongly enough is that children tend to be more susceptible to environmental insults of many kinds, particularly carcinogenic insults: An analysis by the National Academy of Sciences found that children are particularly vulnerable to environmental contaminants for several reasons.   Due to their smaller size, children\u2019s exposures to toxics are disproportionately large compared with adults.   Because their metabolic pathways are immature (particularly during fetal development and in the first months after birth), they are slower to metabolize, detoxify, and excrete many environmental chemicals.   As a result, toxins remain active in their bodies for a longer period of time than would be the case in adults.  In addition, children have lower levels of some chemical-binding proteins, allowing more of a toxic agent to reach various organs, and their blood-brain barrier is more porous than that of adults, allowing greater chemical exposures to the developing brain.   Children\u2019s bodies also are less able to repair damage due to toxic exposures, and the complex processes that take place during the rapid growth and development of children's nervous, respiratory, immune, reproductive, and other organ systems are easily disrupted. Replace the word \u201ccancer\u201d with your choice of \u201cautism,\u201d \u201cautism Spectrum disorders,\u201d or \u201cdevelopmental delays,\u201d and he sounds like one of us.  And wait until you see what Orac had to say about the dramatic rise in childhood cancers, even while the mortality rate dropped: The reason for this increase is not known, but genetics is an unlikely cause for such a rapid increase.  In addition, it is unlikely that better diagnosis due to the introduction of MRI and better CT scanning is likely to be the cause, because the increase is too steady.  That leaves environmental factors as one suspect for a major cause. Gee, Orac, are you sure that the rise in diagnoses was not just due to increased awareness?  Or maybe it\u2019s just a lot of parents that want all the services available to sick kids.   It seems that Orac is the perfect example of selective belief in the intractability of scientific \u201cfact.\u201d  Because the science suggesting a link between vaccines and ASD is still emerging, the hypotheses are constantly being refined.  Orac, and others of his ilk, scoff at that evolution and say that we are \u201cmoving the goal posts.\u201d  But when it comes to cancer science, his song has a different lyric: One recommendation of the report that intrigued me was its assessment of how science has generally focused on one compound at a time without considering how they may interact.  This reminds me of how in the past we concentrated on one gene at a time as a causative agent for cancer (such as oncogenes); yet over the past ten years it has become increasingly clear that cancer is often driven by many genes, each of which individually plays a relatively small role. It\u2019s easy to understand how Orac came to the arrogance that shines through his prose.  First, it\u2019s not an uncommon characteristic among his profession.  Beyond that, however, it cannot be denied that he has become famous through his blog.  He writes in a lively style, and his sophomoric humor plays well with jaded grad students.  He purportedly gets site visits in numbers that any blogger would envy.  That\u2019s enough to give anyone a swelled head. On a personal level, he\u2019s probably not a bad guy.  David Gorski is likely a faithful husband, I certainly doubt that he would kick his dog, and he might even take his turn at buying rounds when he\u2019s at the local tavern.  But as Orac, he\u2019s so arrogant as to be completely blind to the inconvenient truth that is hitting him in the face.  And he\u2019s not alone. Orac, and far too many of his ilk, look at things like the report of the President\u2019s Cancer Panel, and they fail to see \u23af or at least fail to acknowledge \u23af that what they\u2019re seeing is just one part of a multifaceted picture, showing what we\u2019re doing to the immune systems of the latest generations.  I pray that they start hoping their eyes and minds in time to start saving the generations to come.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/pcp08-09rpt/PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/opinion/06kristof.html?src=me&ref=general", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_presidents_cancer_panel_steps_into_i.php", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/11/orac-gets-punked.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_presidents_cancer_panel_steps_into_i.php", "http://www.14studies.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2010/05/he-probably-thinks-this-post-is-about.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t HE PROBABLY THINKS THIS POST IS ABOUT HIM\n\t \n    "},

Bush, September 6, 2000, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Here it is again, the Fourth of July.  As I tried to convey  last year at this time , I consider myself fairly patriotic.  And like many Americans (and I use that term with apologies to friends in the other nations of the Americas, but it\u2019s just too darned cumbersome to call us \u201cUnited Statesians\u201d), I feel proud of my nation even though we can be so incredibly wrong at times.  Maybe it\u2019s because we can also be so incredibly spot-on at other times. Through the worst of times for my country, I have always been buoyed by an abiding faith that the United States is so structurally sound \u23af indeed, so strong an ideal \u23af that it can survive damn near any fool we might happen to put into office.  At the risk of offending some of my friends, let me say that never before has that faith been tested than in the past few years.  I say that as one who is neither a Democrat nor a Republican; I have held my nose while discussing leaders of both parties.  It is nothing more than happenstance that the object of the greatest scorn I have ever held for a political leader is a Republican. Of course, every man has positives in him.  It cannot be denied that our President is a compassionate man who values freedom above all else.  Just ask Scooter Libby who now owes his freedom to the compassion of our Decider-in-Chief. And it can be truly said that the President is often good for a chuckle.  May I present a few of my favorite moments: THE DOMESTIC LEADER \u201cI am mindful of the difference between the executive branch and the legislative branch. I assured all four of these leaders that I know the difference.\u201d December 18, 2000, reported by  Slate  magazine. \u201cEven though we\u2019re at war, even though we\u2019re at recession, the State of our Union has never been stronger.\u201d January 30, 2002, in Winston-Salem, NC the day after his State of the Union address to Congress (as reported by CNN). THE WORLD LEADER \u201cUh, I support winning.\u201d April 7, 1999, on CNN's  Inside Politics , referring to America\u2019s involvement in Kosovo. \u201cI will have a foreign-handed foreign policy.\u201d September 27, 2000, at a campaign stop in Redwood, California. THE EDUCATION PRESIDENT \u201cEducation is not my top priority \u23af  education is my top priority.\u201d February 27, 2001, during a budget speech in Washington, D.C. \u201cYou teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.\u201d February 21, 2001, from a speech delivered in Townsend, Tennessee.  Reported by  The New Republic  (March 5, 2001 issue). \u201cReading is the basics for all learning.\u201d March 28, 2000, at a campaign stop in Reston, Virginia, announcing his \u201cReading First\u201d initiative. THE HEALTH-CARE PRESIDENT \u201cDiseases ... such as arthritis and osteoporosis can be less beea, beea-dilitating.\u201d March 21, 2001.  \u201cIf an insurance carrier can spread risk across a variety of people or a variety of firms, it makes it more likely his health care goes down.\u201d March 16, 2004, in Washington, D.C. \u201cDrug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.\u201d October 17, 2000, St. Louis, Missouri Presidential Debate. THE ECONOMIST AGRONOMIST \u201cI know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.\u201d January 27, 2000, during a campaign speech in Nashua, New Hampshire. THE MASTER POLITICIAN \u201cIt was amazing I won.  I was running against peace and prosperity and incumbency.\u201d June 14, 2001, in Gothenberg, Sweden. THE COMMANDER \u201cThe reason we start a war is to fight a war, win a war, thereby causing no more war.\u201d October 3, 2000, in Boston, Massachusetts, at the first Presidential Debate. \u201cWe\u2019re still being challenged in Iraq and the reason why is a free Iraq will be a major defeat in the cause of freedom.\u201d April 5, 2004, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Okay, those last two really aren\u2019t very funny. There is one thing on which the President and I agree.  It is a wondrous nation that is built upon the principles that any jackass can be elected, and any other jackass can jump on a soapbox \u23af or rant in a blog \u23af criticizing and mocking the one in power.  So from one jackass to another, Mr. President, have a great Independence Day. And may all of you who reside in this great nation also have a wonderful Independence Day.

{"date": "Monday, July 16, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n       Killian Hynes is a six-year old boy with autism.  I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting Killian, and he\u2019s like a lot of our kids.  There\u2019s a lot going on inside of him that he has trouble getting out.  For the most part, Killian is what some describe as \u201cnonverbal.\u201d  Killian was the victim of a recent extortion attempt.  The perpetrator was the school district that is supposed to serve his best interests. The story of Killian\u2019s educational progress \u23af including the battles between his parents and the school district \u23af mirrors the experience of many of us:  that odd twilight zone where good people are trapped trying to implement a crappy plan imposed from above. The school district in this case is District 203 in Naperville, Illinois.  Killian\u2019s school placement for the past year was at the Summit School Early Learning Center in Elgin.  The latest dispute in the ongoing war (the same war most of us know all too well) involved summer placement.  Summit was the right place at the right time, but Killian had progressed far enough that a change was in order lest Killian\u2019s progress stagnate.   Killian\u2019s parents, Kevin and Beth Hynes, found another program that would provide their son with what he needed.  Perhaps being a little tired of the constant battles over doing the right thing, Kevin and Beth made an offer they didn\u2019t have to; they offered to pay the difference between what the new program would cost and what the district would pay to send Killian to Summit pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Although members of the IEP team agreed with Kevin and Beth, the district did not.   Why did the district reject that proposal?  Did they not want to fill out a new set of paperwork?  Or was it just a matter of flexing its bureaucratic muscle?  Did it have anything to do with Kevin\u2019s efforts to educate other parents about their rights in dealing with school districts?  Whatever the reason may have been, District 203 refused the change in placement, provoking the Hynes\u2019 request for a Due Process hearing. Now, there\u2019s nothing particularly startling about such a disagreement leading to Due Process; that\u2019s an all-too-familiar part of life for families of kids on the spectrum.  What makes Killian\u2019s story remarkable is what the district did to try to get their way. Let\u2019s rewind the tape to this past school year.  An on-the-ball speech therapist privately used by the Hynes family realized that Killian might benefit from using a  \u201cTango\u201d communication device .  She loaned hers to the Hynes, and it helped.  Enough progress was shown that Killian\u2019s IEP team agreed that he should have one.  The district ordered a Tango for Killian to use as part of his summer program. But then the disagreement over the summer placement arose.  The District told Kevin and Beth that the Tango device \u23af which had already been purchased and which everyone agreed would be an appropriate part of Killian\u2019s summer program (whatever that program would be) \u23af would not be turned over unless their son attended the summer program at Summit. The district bet that, at worst, the parents would make the failure to turn over the Tango part of the Due Process proceedings.  But Kevin and Beth are both lawyers who spotted the flaw in the district\u2019s tactics, a flaw that other parents might have missed. Ordinarily, disputes between school districts and the special-education students they serve must be handled through the procedures set forth in IDEA and the federal regulations issued pursuant to the Act.  That means going through a Due Process hearing before going to federal court.  But in this case, the district promised to purchase a Tango device for Kilian\u2019s use, and the Hynes relied on that promise.  That promise may have arisen in the context of the district\u2019s obligation to provide Killian a Free and Appropriate Public Education, but once made, the promise existed separate and apart from that obligation.  That gave Kevin and Beth the right to file a contract suit on their son\u2019s behalf in state court. The legal response from the state was predictable.  Their attorney took the position that the dispute could only be handled through IDEA.  So the district\u2019s attorney filed pleadings to remove the case from state court to federal court, and to dismiss the case on grounds of prematurity because the parents had not gone through a Due Process hearing. The propriety of the district\u2019s removal tactic came before the Honorable Milton Shadur on June 27, 2007.  That the district\u2019s gambit failed and the case was remanded to state court is not at all surprising.  What Judge Shadur said from the bench, however, was remarkable.  Federal judges tend to exercise restraint; the most that could be expected was that the judge would note the correctness of the Hynes\u2019 position and send the case back to state court.  But this situation called for more.  Judge Shadur invoked words uttered by one of his own legal heroes, Joseph Welch: . . . And his two sentences, which he spoke . . . to the then seemingly all-powerful Joseph McCarthy were, \u201chave you no shame senator?  Have you know shame?\u201d Just so, I must say that the undisputed picture here is regrettably one of the defendants holding . . . a six-year old . . . autistic boy hostage, depriving him of what is without dispute really a promised Tango communication device, something that everyone agrees \u23af even the professionals agree \u23af is essential to his effective functioning.  And to hold that back as what has to be viewed, I regret to say, as blackmail for his parents, seeking to compel them to accept a program that the defendant\u2019s own professionals have found not to be in his best interests? And I regret that the delay, the nondelivery, appears to be as inflicting serious damage on the boy\u2019s progress in dealing with his extremely serious developmental difficulties.  My personal view, which is not going to affect my decision . . . is that\u2019s nothing short of appalling.   Let me tell you where I suspect this dispute might be more effectually resolved consistently with Justice Brandeis\u2019 famous aphorism that \u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant.\u201d  Instead of the anonymous judicial system, I believe that defendant\u2019s conduct ought to be aired in the court of public opinion, maybe by being made the subject of what I suspect would be a scathing article \u23af for example, in the Chicago Tribune. And so the matter was ordered back to state court.  But the district was not through.  The district did not agree with anything Judge Shadur said, including the observation that a little sunlight was needed.  The afternoon of the hearing, the district\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Kevin and Beth, communicating the district\u2019s offer to provide the Tango, but only on certain conditions, including: You must agree never to disclose, publicize, publish, indicate or in any other manner communicate the comments made today by Milton Shadur or reference in any way, today\u2019s court appearance, the litigation you initiated against the District in court . . .  And the letter went on to include a whole laundry list of things that could never be discussed.  Kevin and Beth chose not to agree to a gag order. The case proceeded to state court, where a different judge ordered the district to turn over the Tango immediately.  In so doing, the judge made it quite clear that Judge Shadur\u2019s was opinion was shared. Kevin, Beth and Killian could have been content to take their victory and go home, device in hand.  But they knew that if the district treated them that way, then other families without their legal acumen were at risk.  They didn\u2019t go to the press, but the press found them.  And when the press came calling, they carefully considered whether their family would be well-served by going public.  They concluded that this was bigger than their privacy.  Go  here to find their story in the  Naperville Sun .  The story was picked up by  the  Chicago Sun-Times .   But what of Judge Shadur\u2019s first choice, the  Tribune ?  They sent out a reporter and photographer to the Hynes house; they conducted a lengthy interview, but then decided that a story really wasn\u2019t necessary since the case was won.   The Tribune\u2019s decision is regrettable.  That the device has been delivered does not remove the stench of the district\u2019s actions.  Disinfectant is needed, and has been suggested, sunshine does quite well for that purpose.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/RpwLhX2pzyI/AAAAAAAAACY/MPTvsjCi_y8/s1600-h/thingme_w.jpg", "http://www.blink-twice.com/", "http://tinyurl.com/2p7ohf", "http://tinyurl.com/3a5zqs"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/07/question-to-district-203-have-you-no.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t QUESTION TO DISTRICT 203:  \u201cHAVE YOU NO SHAME?\u201d  (or Doin\u2019 the Courthouse Tango)\n\t \n    "},

I got busy with life for a while and . . . well, as my wife says, you never have to explain things like being late or forgetting  about something to other autism parents; they understand how it is. Before getting to what\u2019s on my mind, I do want to thank the friends who emailed or left comments to make sure all was well.  Yes, everything is well \u23af great even.  I got a little caught up in being there for a young man who is making incredible progress these days (and fighting the occasional fight for him), and I wanted to keep my focus there.  All that being said, there is also sad news.  Many of us in the autism world lost a good friend a few days ago.  The families who practice biomedical interventions with their autistic children are often confronted with charlatans who are out to make a buck at our expense, but then again we also come across truly good people who have joined us in this battle for all the right reasons.  Michael Lang was one of the really good guys.  Michael and his company,  Brainchild Nutritionals , offered high quality vitamin and mineral supplements in liquid form.  But his quality as a person rather than just the quality of his products will be his legacy.  My wife, Sym, knew him better than I did, my contact being just a brief introduction along the way.  But I knew what he did for folks like us.  Sym came to know him as a friend she could always call on. All I ever needed to know about the man was what happened a couple of years ago, when the Rankin family still lived in South Louisiana.  It was the chaotic days after Hurricane Katrina, when those of us who lived in the strike zone were slowly reestablishing contact with the outside world.  One of the earliest calls that came through on Sym\u2019s cell phone, even before we made it back from our evacuation, was Michael Lang.  He had two questions:  how were we, and what could he do to help?  Michael wound up sending supplements, free of charge, to families who had lost so much.

The reality of that struck home today because for the first time in my life, I had to go to work on Fat Tuesday. Leaving what was our home for a lifetime was easy in so many ways, and difficult in others.  We left behind an environmental mess and substandard services (a prime factor in our decision).  We left behind the ingrained laissez faire attitude of a people that manages to be both charming and maddening at the same time.

{"date": "Saturday, January 06, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      The title of this post comes from an old Buffalo Springfield song, written and sung by Stephen Stills: There\u2019s battle lines being drawn, Nobody\u2019s right if everybody\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s been a while since I last wrote directly about the neurodiversity movement.  For a period of time, we had a conversation going on here that involved responsible \u23af and some less than responsible \u23af voices from differing viewpoints.  But the conversation died out when it became clear that we were speaking different languages, with the line drawn over the definitions of three words:  autism, cure, and acceptance. We can\u2019t agree on the nature of autism.  While most of us in the biomed community see autism as a physical disorder with varied mental, behavioral, biological, and neurological sequellae, some  \u23af  but not all \u23af  vocal espousers of neurodiversity see it more as a different cognition that may involve certain challenges but needs no cure. Ah, cure:  now there\u2019s a word we can\u2019t agree on.  You can\u2019t even get the same definition among those of us who are curebies.  There is truly a spectrum running between a few who think no intervention at all is necessary, and a few who think the idea of intervention is necessary to create some mythical status of \u201cnormal\u201d (when the essence of human \u201ctypicality\u201d is diversity).  Most of us fall somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, and yet we tend to identify ourselves as either pro-cure or anti-cure. Those who are anti-cure argue that the pro-cure folks lack acceptance of their children.  Most of us who are pro-cure on the other hand, will gladly say that we accept our children; what we can\u2019t accept is something inside of them that goes well beyond what genetics intended for them \u23af something that prevents them from using all of the gifts that genetics have bestowed on them. What has divided the two camps, however, is more than just the definitions we give the words we use; the divide really results from philosophical differences that can\u2019t be resolved.  Although we have been able to politely listen to one another on questions about the nature of autism, the root causes of autism, and the matter of acceptance, there is one difference that seems to keep us from even being civil to one another.  That is the issue of \u201ccure.\u201d It is ironic that most of us agree that some intervention is necessary (even if we can\u2019t agree on the nature of the intervention), and yet we divide ourselves over the word we use to describe the process of intervention. Truly, battle lines are being drawn and the rhetoric is escalating.  Lately I have seen measured responses to attacks by members of the on-line neurodiversity movement.  My particular favorite, a  commentary in the Huffington Post by Lisa Stagliano , makes the point quite nicely, and with a fine sense of humor, that all of our children have unique challenges, and nobody \u23af but nobody \u23af can define the autism experience for our children and dictate the right road. I will never stop trying to help my girls recover from their autism. I can not tell you what recovery means.  It varies by kid and according to God\u2019s grace.  If recovery means only that Peanut understands she should sit on the toilet, not play in the toilet, I\u2019ll take it. Recovering your kids doesn\u2019t mean denying their value as people.  To the contrary, it means we are willing to devote our lives, our savings, our sanity to their improved health, development and well being. Most of what I have seen from the other side lately after Lisa\u2019s piece, or the  recent opinion piece by David Kirby , also in the Huffington Post, have either hit on the same, tired themes of how there is no epidemic and it\u2019s nothing to be cured, etc., or there have been howls of protest that some are using the word \u201cneurodiverse\u201d to describe the adherents of the neurodiversity philosophy. Okay, I get it.  Neurodiversity is not a condition but a philosophy.  But let\u2019s face it; \u201cthe neurodiverse\u201d is a lot easier to type out and reads more cleanly than \u201cthe adherents of the neurodiversity philosophy.\u201d  I suspect that\u2019s the prime reason the term came into use rather than any intention of using it in a derogatory manner.  Can the same be said for the constant labeling of all of us in the biomed community as \u201cmembers of the mercury militia?\u201d Although most of us believe quite firmly that mercury poisoning has played an active role \u23af and perhaps the key role \u23af in triggering our children\u2019s autism, and that some of the symptoms we see are consistent with heavy-metal poisoning, it is equally true that most of us now accept that we must look beyond the question of mercury to help our children.  Of course, the neurodiversity community knows that.  Their favorite target is Andy Wakefield, whose work (which has been replicated, something that tends to be ignored) has little to do with the question of mercury poisoning. Despite its inaccuracy, I haven\u2019t seen anyone complain about seeing the term \u201cmercury militia\u201d used with an obvious tone of derision.  Most of us realize that there are far better things to be worried about than what we are called.  So go ahead and call me a member of the mercury militia if you like; I\u2019ll wear it as a badge of honor.  I\u2019ll gladly be a little militant if it means helping recover my child and perhaps help prevent the need for recovery in children yet to be born. In the meantime, I will continue to keep reading what the adherents of the \u2026 oh, what the hell \u2026 the neurodiverse (some of whom I am lucky enough to consider friends) have to say in the hopes that I can learn more about autism from those who have something to say.  And I hope some day that a civil dialog may resume.

May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One! Charles Dickens,  A Christmas Carol I\u2019ve always loved Dickens\u2019 classic about Scrooge.  It speaks of what I yearn for most at Christmas:  transformation.  Maybe it\u2019s because Christmas comes so close to the date on which we change our calendars over, or maybe because the underlying story of Christmas is the transformation of mankind through something so simple and natural as the birth of a child.  Whatever the reason, I always look for a big transformation in my life at this time of the year.  Yes, I know transformation has to start within.  That\u2019s why we make New Year\u2019s resolutions.  But it\u2019s only natural to look for Christmas miracles. My expectations for transformation are so high, and are never realized \u23af at least not in ways I initially thought.  I\u2019ve come to realize that I need to not look just for a transformation yet to come, but also to notice the transformations that have occurred in my life without appreciation on my part. My son\u2019s autism has transformed my life . . . for better and worse.  Do I wish it never happened?  That\u2019s a fair statement.  Is it something I want to change?  Absolutely.  And yet it has led me to wonderful places. I\u2019ve  written before  of how having a child on the spectrum has made me a better parent to all my children.  And it has introduced me to wonderful people I have so little in common with except the fact that our children have ASD.   Transformation is a gradual process, and sometimes requires the ability to reflect.  For example, several months ago I spoke favorably of the short video \u201c Autism Every Day ,\u201d produced by Autism Speaks.  I was almost relieved to see a stark depiction of the problems some of us face, mainly because it came at a time when we were bombarded with media stories that seemed to imply that autism was basically a pretty cool thing to have in one\u2019s life.  (Hey kids, it\u2019s fun; you can play piano sonatas, shoot three-pointers, and you\u2019ll be ever so smart.) Although I initially agreed to an extent with many of the criticisms leveled at the video, I thought it was a worthwhile undertaking.  With the benefit of hindsight, I\u2019ve changed my opinion; the flaws in the video are big enough to keep it from being a positive contribution to \u201cautism awareness.\u201d  Specifically, the video lacks two important elements:  joy and hope.  No joy is expressed for the lives of our children, autism and all.  And there is no hope expressed that we can improve the lives of our children.  Without joy and hope, any \u201cawareness\u201d is empty. Joy and hope are essential to the lives of everyone, including \u201c curebies .\u201d  Hope and joy fuel transformation. My wish for you and your family is that you have a blessed Christmas and a transforming New Year.  I hope 2007 will be filled with enough joy to recognize the miracles around us, even as we hope for miracles yet to come.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 05, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Of all the \u201c fighting words \u201d in any discussion about ASD, none arouses such passion as \u201ccure.\u201d  The problem is, no two of us really share a common definition of the word.  So it\u2019s a word I don\u2019t often use, but it\u2019s a word I believe in. For me, the effort to \u201ccure\u201d my son means that I want to see every impediment removed that might otherwise prevent him from achieving full independence in a world that is often unfriendly to neurotypical and autistic alike.  I believe that many of his deficits (oops, there\u2019s another \u201cfighting word\u201d) result from physical conditions that can be ameliorated.  The point of this post is not to debate the validity of that belief, but rather to explore the politics of being a \u201ccurebie.\u201d \u201cCurebie\u201d is the word that some critics use to describe people like me.  I suspect it is meant as a term of derision, but I refuse to see it that way; I guess I am embracing my curiebiedom.   In any event, a blogger who refers to herself as the  Autistic Bitch from Hell (or abfh), has given us a definition of curebieism  that frankly confuses me.  I no longer know if I\u2019m a curebie or not. While I was reading blogs yesterday, I came across a post by a worried father who believed that autistic activists were opposed to any attempt to improve an autistic child's health.  The father wrote that he was not trying to cure his daughter\u2019s autism, but he was afraid that when she grew older, she might hate him for giving her vitamins and a healthy diet. . . . Then I started to wonder if his misconception about autistic activists came from reading rants against \u201ccurebies,\u201d which usually have no definition of the word.  I decided that it would be useful to clarify just what goes into the curebie mindset and why conscientious parents who care about their children's health and well-being are not curebies. The defining characteristic of a curebie is a fanatical desperation to destroy a child\u2019s autistic traits in their entirety.  Autism takes on a separate and distinct identity in the curebie mind; it is personified as a demonic foe that must be defeated at all costs.  The child ceases to be seen as a sentient person and instead is treated as if he were a battleground for a cosmic struggle between good and evil.  Jonathan Shestack, co-founder and president of Cure Autism Now, exemplified this mindset when he wrote that autism parents do not have a child but \u201ca shell, a ghost of all the dreams and hopes you ever had.\u201d Well, I happen to disagree with the quote attributed to Mr. Shestack.  My son is not some empty shell, and I have never particularly stopped to think about any particular dreams I had or have for him.  My only hope for him has always been to find his own place in the world.  His ASD seems to stand in the way of that, but it is not some inherently evil force.  It is a problem:  hopefully a solvable problem.  So have I been living a lie?  Am I not a curebie? Some of the comments to abfh\u2019s post add to my confusion.  In particular, David Andrews and  Joseph , both of whom I have long disagreed with on so many questions, each voiced disagreement with the seeming article of faith among some quarters that all curebies harbor a secret desire to kill our children.  After that refreshing acknowledgment that we are not all monsters, Mr. Andrews had this to say: . . .much as the more vocal ones from the \u2018curebie\u2019 groups have this dramatic way of looking at things, I\u2019m not sure that Wade Rankin is the same as these others, and I'd say that most probably aren\u2019t... just those more vociferous ones. I certainly appreciate the fact that Mr. Andrews believes me to be somewhat reasonable, but the key to understanding the situation lies in the phrase \u201cmost probably aren\u2019t,\u201d although my understanding may not truly be what Mr. Andrews intended.  He probably only meant to convey that all curebies don\u2019t fantasize about killing our children (which, in fairness to abfh, is apparently conceded as she edited her post to correct what she referred to as a \u201cgeneralization\u201d by noting that only \u201csome\u201d curebie parents feel that way.  I certainly don\u2019t want to open up the debate as to who may actually have such thoughts, as it puts me in the position of speaking for another.  (Personally, I cannot conceive of any justification for killing one's child.)  What I found noteworthy in Mr. Andrews\u2019 comment, whether he meant it this way, is the implicit acknowledgment that there is not one uniform set of values and opinions held by curebies.     Whether any of us like it or not, we all find ourselves divided into subcommunities of what I have been calling the \u201cgreater autism community.\u201d  That doesn\u2019t mean that all those we think of as being in the \u201cneurodiversity\u201d camp share the same exact opinions, nor does it mean that all \u201ccurebies\u201d take the same approach to every issue.  Each of us holds differing opinions as to the nature of autism and the correct response thereto, those opinions being formed primarily by the experiences of our individual families.  Yet we find ourselves grouped into general subcommunities because Kevin Leitch finds he has more in common with Kathleen Seidel than he does me, and I have more in common with Erik Nanstiel than I do Kev and Kathleen. That is not to say that I feel comfortable sharing a subcommunity with all curebies.  I have done my fair share of wincing in the last year or so, and I feel reasonably sure that some members of the neurodiversity subcommunity have felt likewise about comments from within their group.  But the fact that I have those occasional feelings, or that I sometimes avoid using the word \u201ccure,\u201d does not really make me less of a curebie.  I know because abfh has given me the ultimate answer: Here\u2019s a quick test for any parent who may still be unsure of what curebie-ism is. If you care whether your autistic child thinks you are a curebie\u2014you\u2019re not one. What is raised here is an ethical question that is impossible to answer with certainty.  As my friend,  Ginger, once said , in response to a question asking who we were to decide that our children needed curing: Who are we?  We are their parents. Making choices that will impact who our children will become is the blessing and burden of parenthood.  We have to make HUGE choices for our children and we don\u2019t get to find out the final impact and totality of those choices until their lives and personalities completely unfold. We are flying with blinders on, with the only view in the rear view mirror and out the side windows, and we can only make the best choices we can make with that information.  Every time we make a choice for our children, we unchoose every other possibility for them. Although I hope my son approves of our response to his ASD (and I believe he does and he will), that is not something I spend a lot of time worried about.  This is how  I\u2019ve answered that question before : One of the more aggravating criticisms often directed at us is that we desperately seek a cure not for our children\u2019s autism but really for our own shattered dreams. Nonsense! As the father of two older, neurotypical kids, I can confidently state that I gave up on having my children live out my dreams a long time ago. I simply want all of my children to live out their own dreams. But I still must confess that I have one dream about my young son. In my dream, he has reached the rebellious stage of adolescence. He angrily confronts me, and he demands to know how he could possibly be the offspring of someone so thoughtless as to deprive him of an integral part of his personality. Why, my son asks rhetorically, did I ever think it necessary to \u201ccure\u201d him; did I consider him \u201cdefective?\u201d Without waiting for a response, my son storms out of the house the house and walks outside to his waiting friends, to whom he complains about how I just don\u2019t understand him the way his friends do. If my son would only look to the front window of the house, he would see me peeking out from behind the curtain, listening to him interacting with his friends. And he would see me grinning from ear to ear.

{"date": "Friday, September 08, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I want to draw your attention to some good reading out there bearing on the question of the respective roles of genetics and environment in causing autism spectrum disorders. Dr. Julie Daniels, an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Maternal and Child Health at the University of North Carolina, wrote an  editorial  published in the July 2006 edition of Environmental Health Perspectives that is well worth reading.  (Thanks to Mar\u00eda Luj\u00e1n for bringing it to my attention.)  Dr. Daniels notes that: Speculation that the environment plays a role in the development of autism primarily comes from two observations: a) although concordance among monozygotic twins is high, it is not perfect, and a specific \u201cautism gene\u201d or set of genes has not yet been identified; and b) the prevalence of autism is higher than previously thought-if it is rising, the rise might be associated with a shift in the environment. Dr. Daniels displays far more logic than one is accustomed to hearing in our little debates, when she writes that the confounding of causal research is the likely result that what we call ASD may result from a variety of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.  Although conceding that the \u201cperception\u201d of increased prevalence may result from changing diagnostic criteria or increased availability of diagnostic tools and services, she also acknowledges the possibility that we may be seeing a true increase in prevalence.  There is little in the way of \u201csystematically collected data in the same population over time that can be used to evaluate true prevalence rate trends.\u201d After stating that environmental factors could explain true shifts in prevalence, and further noting the difficulty in assigning causal based on ecologic associations, Dr. Daniels writes the following, which I partly agree with: It is unlikely that one or even a few specific environmental agents are responsible for the majority of ASDs. It is more likely that some individuals have enhanced susceptibility to insults from the environment that may, in combination with their genetic predisposition, lead to autism. It is rarely possible to distinguish these complex relationships by simply evaluating trends in the general population. The much publicized concern over vaccines and autism has primarily been based on such ecologic trends. More rigorous studies evaluating vaccine-related hypotheses are needed to incorporate individual-level exposure data, account for alternate exposures to metals, and evaluate susceptible subgroups of the population. However, attention should also be given to other environmental hypotheses. Although I agree that environmental insults other than vaccines and thimerosal need to be considered, I think Dr. Daniels underestimates the probable connection of the single most pervasive exposure to a generation of children.  Nevertheless, I am delighted that a respectable epidemiologist recognizes the limitations of the epidemiological evidence and is displaying an open mind on the question. To state the obvious, I think the more we learn about the processes of autism, the more clear the causal connections will become.  If well-designed research shows I am wrong in my opinions, I can live with it.  What I can't stand, however, is the tendency of so many scientists to bury their heads in the sand.  Dr. Daniels' willingness to follow where the science may lead is refreshing. And that brings us to some exciting things going on in the study of neuroscience as it relates to autism.  One of the most interesting presentations I saw at the Autism One Conference this past May was by Dr. Manuel Casanova, who has been researching the differences in minicolumns between brains of autistic individuals and neurotypical persons.     Ian Parker , takes a detailed but very readable look at Dr. Casanova's work, and reaches conclusions that sound consistent with what was reported at Autism One: Reduced minicolumn width appears to be a prerequisite for autism. But, the reported minicolumn widths found within autistic brains are still within the normal distribution of minicolumnar width, albeit at the tail end (Casanova 2006). This suggests to me that the existence of narrow minicolumns is not enough by itself to result in an ASD diagnosis. The key instead appears to be a reduction in inhibition within minicolumns, rather than width alone. Reduced width increases the consequences of reduced inhibition, but does not automatically cause it. In effect, a brain with narrower minicolumns may be less robust, and therefore more vulnerable to the complications that could come with deviation from the narrow tolerances within which the brain functions. In a brain with wider minicolumns, a loss of inhibition would not have as significant an impact, as minicolumnar width (and therefore distance between minicolumn information processing cores) would still exist to reduce intercolumnal spill, and thalamic projections would result in fewer minicolumns per macrocolumn to be affected. Even with reduced minicolumn width, a \u201csecond hit\u201d is required for there to be a manifestation of dysfunctional autistic symptoms.  Ian's conclusion suggests that the notions of a cure and maintaining neurodiversity may not be mutually exclusive.  Read it  here .

{"date": "Tuesday, August 01, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Well, we finally got a response from one of our senators to  the letter my wife and I sent  urging them to support the proposed revision to the Combating Autism Act and to help ensure that the proposal put forth by 21 organizations would be the one to emerge from the HELP Committee.  Unfortunately, the bill that now before the Senate will not help us all move forward, and may actually be a step backward. In any event, Senator Mary Landrieu responded, or more likely had her staff send us a letter that doesn\u2019t make too clear if our letter was read or understood at all.  But that\u2019s still better than Senator David Vitter, who, to no surprise on my part, has ignored us completely. Here\u2019s Senator Landrieu\u2019s letter to us: Dear Friend: Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns about Autism.  I realize that this issue is one if personal concern and I will do all that I can to see that it is addressed.  As you, I believe that this is a very serious matter that affects a large number of our children. I cosponsored the Combating Autism Act of 2005 ( S.843 ), which is a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to defeat autism through research, screening, intervention and education.  If passed, the bill will provide enough funding to continue the research to strive to find the causes and cures for Autism, along with allocating those funds to the institutes, centers, and divisions of the National Institutes of Health.  On July 19, 2006, the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions agreed to report this bill favorably and I will work to make sure this bill passes when brought up on the Senate floor. While I cannot personally relate to the situation you are going through with you family, I am a strong supporter of continuing research to find out exactly what causes Autism and how it can be prevented. I am here to help in any way that I can, so please feel free to contact me in the future.  I would also love to hear about any progress that you child is making, and I will continue to work on this bill to maximize the research devoted to Autism. With kindest regards, I am  Sincerely,  Mary L. Landrieu And here\u2019s our somewhat lengthy response: Dear Senator Landrieu:  Thank you for taking the time to respond to our recent correspondence.  As we stated in our previous letter, we were aware of your co-sponsorship of the Combating Autism Act (\u201cCAA\u201d), and we appreciate your involvement in the issue.  Unfortunately, the version that emerged from the HELP Committee was not the proposal that we commended to you.    When the CAA was first drafted, it did not meet with universal approval from various autism advocacy groups, for good reason.  It was an expensive piece of feel-good legislation that seemed designed primarily to maintain the status quo.  It was seen as a positive sign that some in the Senate sought input from the autism community.  As a result, 21 separate organizations, with a wide variety of agenda and conflicting views on core issues such as causation and treatment, were able to agree on support for a consensus revision that would address several of the concerns these organizations had.    The consensus draft included specific language to ensure that the hypothesized role of vaccines and vaccine preservatives in causing autism would be researched to move us all closer to a resolution of that vital issue.  The present language, calling for research into environmental factors may arguably include research into the role of vaccines, but there is no guarantee that the NIH and the CDC \u23af both of whom have shown a bias against the scientific evidence that supports the hypothesis \u23af will aggressively explore the issue.      The consensus proposal also included the creation of an Autism Advisory Board that would have provided needed oversight and transparency to the setting of priorities for research.  The members of the HELP Committee apparently did not think transparency is a vital concern.  Let us assure you that it is vital if there is to be any credibility assigned to the government agencies charged with protecting the public. In a recent letter to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (\u201cNIEHS\u201d), urging the NIEHS to examine the issue of a possible link between thimerosal and autism, a bipartisan group (Senators Lieberman and Stabenow, together with Representatives Weldon, Burton, Maloney, Crowley, Smith, and Hinchey) expressed the lack of confidence that prevents the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) from having the required credibility to determine policy in this area: \u2026 Unfortunately, as the lOM pointed out in its April 2005 report on VSD access, a CDC-led study on thimerosal and autism could be viewed with much skepticism and may not he accepted by the growing number of parents with concerns about vaccine safety and the possible links between thimerosal and autism.  If the federal government is going to have a study whose results will he broadly accepted, such a study cannot be led by the CDC. It is for these reasons we believe that NIEHS is the most appropriate entity to lead such an investigation.    Unfortunately, the version of the bill that has been submitted by the HELP Committee grants near-dictatorial authority to the CDC, an agency that has demonstrated a complete aversion to fully exploring questions that may expose errors of judgment on its part.  Meaningful oversight is a necessity, and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee that the bill now calls for will not guarantee a truly independent body to provide transparency to the process.  The coalition of 21 advocacy groups that enthusiastically supported the consensus proposal has become somewhat fractured.  Some of the organizations fully support the bill, while others believe that no CAA at all is better than what is now before the Senate.  We are inclined to reluctantly agree that the issues confronting us as a nation stemming from the autism epidemic are too important not to get it right the first time.  As enthusiastically as we urged your support in our previous letter for seeing to it that the HELP Committee adopt the consensus proposal, we must now reluctantly urge you to reconsider your sponsorship of the bill.  We realize that compromise is a necessary part of the legislative process.  But compromise is difficult for those of us whose families may be impacted by the CAA\u2019s passage.  In your correspondence to us, you would \u201clove to hear about any progress that [our] child is making.\u201d  We will not make this letter even longer than it will otherwise be by relating our son\u2019s whole story herein.  (Should the opportunity present itself, we would welcome the chance to meet with you in person to help you understand a complicated issue.)  Suffice to say, our son continues to make progress, primarily using interventions that some in the mainstream medical establishment scoff at, primarily because they do not wish to acknowledge that something as beneficial as the vaccine program may present a genuine risk to a subset of susceptible children.    The version of the CAA that is now before the Senate has the potential to shed light on the issues of causation, and show that the treatment protocols that so many of us are using are appropriate.  It likewise has the potential, however, to enable those with vested interests to continue frustrating the efforts to seek the truth.  Again, we may well be worried about appearances of impropriety that do not reflect the true picture, but the credibility of the CDC and the NIH have been so damaged that trustworthiness must now be legislatively enforced.  We will respect any decision you make as to your future involvement with the CAA.  If you feel this bill should pass, however, we strongly urge you to take appropriate steps to ensure that the legislative history reflects the desire of Congress that the possible role of vaccines, other biological and pharmaceutical products, and their components (including preservatives), should be fully researched, without bias.  We further urge you to seek means of unbiased oversight of the research that will be funded through the CAA.  Ideally, restoring the Autism Advisory Board would provide the needed transparency.  Failing that, however, we urge you to cooperate with any independent organizations that may seek to fill that role.    One such effort that is now forming will be called, appropriately enough, \u201cCombating Autism Act Watch,\u201d sponsored by A-CHAMP (Advocates for Children\u2019s Health Affected by Mercury Poisoning).  It is unfortunate that a significant number of Americans feel that we can no longer trust the government, but you can help to restore that trust by facilitating the ability of citizen\u2019s groups to monitor how the CDC and NIH implement the CAA.  Finally, we would like to draw your attention to two bills that were recently introduced in the House of Representatives.    H.R. 5887, the Vaccine Safety and Public Confidence Assurance Act of 2006, was introduced by Congressman Dave Weldon and co-sponsored by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY).  This bipartisan initiative will create a separate agency to oversee vaccine safety.  Because that responsibility currently resides with the CDC, the same agency responsible for promoting high vaccination rates, the resulting conflict of interest has undermined the credibility of the government and the vaccine program itself.  H.R. 5940, the Comprehensive Comparative Study of Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Populations Act of 2006, was introduced by Representatives Maloney and Tom Osborne (again, a bipartisan effort).   The purpose of the bill is to mandate studies comparing health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children that can help develop a better understanding of any possible connection (or even lack thereof) between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders, as well as other conditions that have sharply risen in recent years.   It will, of course, be quite some time before these measures make it to the Senate, but we mention them to underline the fact that these issues will not simply disappear.  Answers must be found, and we ask that you be a part of that process. \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/08/please-congress-dont-help-us.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t PLEASE CONGRESS, DON\u2019T HELP US\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Monday, August 07, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I\u2019ll get back to more serious fare, including the Combating Autism Act soon.  But it\u2019s my blogiversery:  one year since my first post.  On special ocasions, I often take a few moments to reflect or maybe look at old family photographs.  I thought about looking back at some of my favorite posts, but instead decided to share a few gems that come courtesy of my Site Meter\u2122 reports.   As many of you know, Site Meter\u2122 not only keeps track of how many people visit a site, but can also provide detailed information on where people are logging in from, what ISP they are using, what computer and browser they are using, and whether there was a referring site. It\u2019s the referrals I find most interesting.  How did people wind up here.  I\u2019m gratified that many people come here purposefully without having been referred by another site.  I\u2019m also happy to see visitors arrive via links from other blogs that I like.  But it\u2019s the Google and Yahoo referrals I find most fascinating.  To my utter amazement, many people actively search for \u201cWade Rankin\u201d or \u201cInjecting Sense.\u201d  Although I can\u2019t help but be flattered by those searches, I have a lot more fun looking at some of the other search terms that lead folks here, and I\u2019d like to share some of my favorites that I\u2019ve collected. Many people are asking specific questions, which is kind of unfortunate as I have no answers.  Someone from Reigate in the U.K. wanted to know \u201cwhat does the name Rankin mean.\u201d  Sorry to say, although I know quite a bit about my family\u2019s background and roots in Scotland, I\u2019m really at a loss to explain the \u201cmeaning\u201d of the name.   Another visitor, obviously finding the wrong place, was interested in methods for \u201cgroundhog, removal, naturally.\u201d   One person in Ottawa was interested in the \u201ccost of living in Delaware vs. Ontario.\u201d  A question that has me as mystified as the visitor who posed his query to Google is \u201cdo oak trees have helicopters?\u201d Another example of a service I can\u2019t provide comes courtesy of someone in Mandeville, Louisiana, where I presently live, who wanted information on \u201cfootball coaching jobs available in St. Tammany Parish.\u201d   Of course, on ethical grounds, I must decline to provide answers to the person looking for information on \u201ctricks of successful poisoning.\u201d  Perhaps that person is looking for the same information needed by the visitor from Rochester, New York, who wanted to know \u201chow to give a hep b injection.\u201d  I\u2019m more in line with someone from Yanceyville, North Carolina, who doesn\u2019t seem to understand \u201cwhy vaccinate my child for hep b.\u201d  There may be a positive answer for that one, but I don\u2019t believe it involves injecting that vaccine within hours of birth. In an existential vein, someone wanted information on \u201chumanly authored religious texts [in] 2006.\u201d  Another visitor wants \u201ccountry music that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d  I have to defer on that one.  It\u2019s probably a sad commentary on my life that it all makes sense to me. One question I could answer, which came from Knoxville, Tennessee, is \u201cwhat does geaux tigers mean?\u201d  It\u2019s simply a South Louisiana way to express our support for the boys (and girls) in purple and gold. Another easy one is the question of how to \u201cprevent autistic boy from opening door knob.\u201d  I suggest engaging the lock. I\u2019m sometimes puzzled by the fact that people who should know more than I do about something are coming here for information I just can\u2019t provide.  One query from the International Atomic Energy Centre in Vienna, arrived here because of the following query:  \u201cmercury exposure of children, photo, simple explanation.\u201d Of course, not everyone is looking for information, which is good because I don\u2019t have much to give.  Somebody in Stockholm quite adamantly stated \u201cI do not need more information on voodoo, I am quite familiar with it.\u201d   Then there was the cry for help from New York:  \u201cI am under pressure!  Uncle.\u201d  And I\u2019m not quite sure what to make of the searcher from Oakland, who was interested in \u201cbig shots 1987 spanking.\u201d Someone from Ft. Worth, Texas got here by searching for \u201cJoey Buttofuco and O.J. golfing.\u201d  I\u2019m not so much perplexed about that search leading here so much as I am frightened that someone would be searching for that at all. Speaking of being a little frightened, I\u2019m a little worried about one recent search from Tampa, looking for \u201cCamille Rankin.\u201d  In all fairness, Ms. Clark may be even more bothered by that one than I am.   One search query read:  \u201cmy mother was a saint.\u201d  I understood why that one led someone here, because  my  mother  was  a saint . I\u2019m sorry to disagree with the assessment of a reader in New Zealand, who feels that \u201cMad Magazine is inappropriate.\u201d  Although I haven\u2019t picked up a copy in many years, that publication was a big part of my formative years (but I guess that shows). On the other hand, someone at a maternity hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia understands what is needed in everyday life:  a \u201csense of humor and common sense.\u201d An Ecuadorian visitor arrived here after typing \u201cWade Rankin California sensible.\u201d  I should point out that I haven\u2019t been in California but once in my life, and that was many years ago.  But I appreciate the implication that I would be sensible there.  Also encouraging was the person in Brooklyn, who wanted to \u201cwade on quite frankly.\u201d   I can\u2019t repeat all of the really great search terms I\u2019ve seen lest I open myself up to libel suits.  Suffice to say that I do not know of any sexual or criminal activities involving any physicians, so please stop coming here to look for that information.  One doctor whose name has led many here is, not surprisingly, Paul Offit.  Many of the searches simply use his name, and I am still getting a lot of traffic from people wanting to know about Dr. Offit\u2019s book,  The Cutter Incident .  One of my favorite all-time searches that brought someone here, though, was for \u201cthe top 10 beautiful ballerina Offit.\u201d  Talk about a hard image to get out of one\u2019s head. My love for music has this blog coming up on some fun searches.  You\u2019d be surprised how many people really want to know \u201cWho Shot the Lala.\u201d  As all good students of New Orleans R&B know, the only correct answer is \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  A lot of people come also wind up here whilst searching the net for lyrics to Irma Thomas songs.  While you won\u2019t find the words to \u201cYou Can Have My Husband, But Please Don\u2019t Mess With My Man\u201d here, you will find a kindred spirit. And all that leads me to my all time favorite search that led someone here:  \u201cB.B.

{"date": "Friday, March 10, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      The history of race relations in New Orleans is as unique as everything else about the city.  Perhaps it is because of the history of free persons of color even in the evil days of slavery, or perhaps it is because of the fluid boundaries between neighborhoods in the city, that saw predominantly black blocks next to predominantly white blocks, but New Orleans dealt with the civil rights struggle earlier than most cities in the South. Tensions didn\u2019t resolve completely and, like virtually everywhere in this country, we still have a long way to go.  Nevertheless, progress came earlier to New Orleans than many other places.  That\u2019s due to the courage and integrity of people of good will, both African-American and white. One of the pioneers of the struggle in New Orleans passed away the other day.  Jack Nelson was a white lawyer, a member of the privileged class who could have sat on the sidelines.  Instead, he incurred the wrath of his peers by joining a noble cause and lending his personal credibility to able African-American attorneys whose valid arguments otherwise might have been summarily dismissed by the white establishment of the time. Mr. Nelson defended activists who sat at white-only lunch counters and those who dared to stand up to the Klan.  He helped to bring pressure on Tulane University to speed up the desegregation of that institution. The  Times Picayune  published a moving  obituary  in this morning\u2019s paper, which I encourage you to read.  It includes some of Mr. Nelson\u2019s own words, including a story that helps to explain what prompted this man to risk so much for people he didn\u2019t know: I remember one day I was at the park with my two little daughters and they were pulling me to go on the carousel and I was resisting.  And finally we were approaching the carousel and I saw a black man standing there with his two daughters and we passed him and we got on the carousel.  And as we went around, I watched this fellow as he was standing there, holding his daughters\u2019 hands.  And I kept wondering what he was telling them. They were just standing up there like little statues.  They wanted to go on that carousel as much as my daughters did and yet they were just standing there.  I kept wondering what would I tell my daughters?  No, you can\u2019t go?  Well, why can\u2019t we go?  That was an important moment in my life:  It made me say, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong.  This isn\u2019t right.\u201d I am constantly amazed that the pivotal events of some men\u2019s lives would go completely without notice or thought by most of their contemporaries.  What sets the great ones apart is the vision to see what is important and the willingness to do something about it.  I practice a profession that includes the skills and position to change the world, and yet so few of us leave any real legacy.  People like Jack Nelson put me to shame and make me proud at the same time.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nola.com/obituaries/t-p/index.ssf?/base/obits-33/114197416074230.xml"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/03/courage-of-convictions.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE COURAGE OF CONVICTIONS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, March 09, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I apologize for being away for so long; it\u2019s been a little hectic at work.  In the time I\u2019ve been away from blogging, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about  a post ballastexistenz did  around the time we were having a somewhat strained conversation going on here a couple of weeks ago. I became a regular reader of  ballastexistenz  a couple of months back after I arrogantly pointed out that I included links on this page to blogs expressing various points of view in the autism world.  Anne Bevington very sagely pointed out that all of the blogs I linked to were by parents, with none by adult autistics.  So I went on a search to find some good ones, and I did.  The best of them is by ballastexistenz.  It\u2019s not always a feel-good read, and I sometimes see things that strike a little too close to home.  But she writes very well \u23af a compliment that would be the same if she was neurotypical by the way \u23af and I like a good challenge to my psyche and opinions every now and then. In any event, a couple of weeks ago, ballastexistenz posted a piece entitled  Pretty social illusions  that struck a nerve: There\u2019s a group of people out there, fairly amorphous to me because I do not keep track easily of who is who (so I hope I don't get asked who it is), who seem to believe something like this: \u201cIf we are nice to autistic people, and we make appropriate ritualized gestures of \u2018respect\u2019 towards autistic people, and we get along socially with autistic people, and we meet them halfway, then it does not matter what we do to our children in the name of helping them, because our children are all individuals, and we are meeting these autistic adults halfway by deigning to at least talk to them.\u201d Some autistic people have been okay with this, encouraged by it. I have been mostly mystified by it. There are some who have accused me from time to time of using politeness as a shield to hide behind as I spread a message of hate.  So my first thought, in light of what was going on over here at the time, was that this was directed at me.  Then I heard the voice of Carly Simon in my head, singing \u201cYou\u2019re so vain; I bet you think this song is about you . . .\u201d Regardless of who ballastexistenz was referring to, her words prompted me to examine my actions and motives.  The message I got from her post (and I would encourage anyone who is interested to read it as anybody\u2019s interpretation of another\u2019s words cannot perfectly capture the intent), is that some of us use the trappings of manners and respect to hide a dangerous mindset.  I hope that\u2019s not the impression I give anyone, although some comments to my pasts posts indicate that impression is out there. I\u2019m still relatively new to the world of autism, and I\u2019m trying to find some answers.  Part of my process for doing that is to talk with people \u23af including people who agree with me and those who don\u2019t.  But I cannot listen to what someone else is saying if I\u2019m shouting.  So I try to maintain an air of civility.  I have written before of the lessons of  respect  I learned from my father.  He also taught my brothers and me lessons in manners.  For him, and for us, politeness was never a veneer to hide ugliness.  Politeness was, and is a means of showing respect. As an attorney, I am guided by certain rules when making an argument.  For example, when I write an appellate brief, I must comply with the following: The language used in the brief shall be courteous, free from vile, obscene, obnoxious, or offensive expressions, and free from insulting, abusive, discourteous, or irrelevant matter or criticism of any person, class of persons or association of persons, or any court, or judge or other officer thereof, or of any institution.  Any violation of this Rule shall subject the author, or authors, of the brief to punishment for contempt of court, and to having such brief returned. Uniform Rule 2-12.4, Louisiana Courts of Appeal The reason for that rule is not just to keep things pleasant.  The idea is to keep everyone\u2019s focus on what really matters. Yes, I tend to be polite and respectful.  It\u2019s how I was raised; it\u2019s a part of who I am.  Respect, however, does not mean an agreement with everything someone else says.  Respect means understanding that someone else just might be correct about something.  So I try to listen.  Sometimes, I go back and reexamine an issue.  Lately, I\u2019ve been reexamining some of the things that were said a couple of weeks ago, and who knows where that will lead. Civility and respect are not silly veneers intended to mask anything deceitful.  They are important means of helping to build a better society in a pluralistic \u23af a diverse, if you will \u23af world.

According to Isaac Pessah, the toxicologist who led the study:  \u201cWhat we found was rather unexpected.\u201d Using mice (unlike Dr. Mady Hornig\u2019s study, this group used a non-susceptible strain), the group found that thimerosal, proportionate to the amounts a child might receive in vaccinations, had an impact on dendritic cells, which are key elements of the immune system.  As Dr. Pessah explains: \u201cThey take up those foreign substances [identified in the article as bacteria, viruses or other antigens such as vaccine ingredients] and process them,\u201d he said.  \u201cOnce they do that, they migrate to the lymph nodes to present their information to the other immune cells, which can activate a global immune response.\u201d What the study found was that dendritic cells are \u201cextremely sensitive\u201d to thimerosal exposure: Specifically, the thimerosal disrupted the normal biological signals that take place in cells, Pessah said.  At lower concentrations, the signal disruption caused an inflammatory response; at higher concentrations it caused cell death. \u201cOne could imagine that as concentrations of thimerosal vary in the organisms, you could get a plethora of unwanted or uncontrolled effects,\u201d Pessah said. And those effects could vary depending on the organism\u2019s genetic background, he said. The significance of all this should be apparent to anyone who has followed the ongoing controversy surrounding the possible (some of us would say \u201cprobable\u201d) link between thimerosal and the diagnosis of autism.  Many autistic children have immunological problems including allergies and gut problems.  Many of those problems appear to relate to the yeast issues that may or may not be linked to some autistic behaviors. Moreover, the theorized damage thimerosal does to the immune system may help explain how live-virus vaccines, such as the MMR, may do further damage that helps trigger diagnosable autism.   The research group has been careful to avoid calling their findings a smoking gun.  And they are right; the study does not, in itself, prove a connection between thimerosal and autism.  Dr. Pessah calls it a \u201cframework\u201d for further study.  I call it another step in a long journey.  But I believe that when the day comes that we say the connection has been proven, we will look back on this study as one of the most significant steps on the path. For those of you who might be interested, the study\u2019s abstract, with a link to a free pdf file of the complete report, which will be published in  Environmental Health Perspectives , may be found at this  link .\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=111000GLKKQL", "http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/index.html", "http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/8881/abstract.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/03/another-step.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ANOTHER STEP\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, July 21, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      To:   Radio Shack Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch, Inc.) Home Depot AFLAC   It is my understanding that your company advertises, on either a national or local basis, on the radio show hosted by Michael Savage.  As you have probably heard by now, Mr. Savage recently commented on the growing epidemic of autism in terms that go beyond ignorance and offensiveness.  The transcript of his diatribe reveals that he maintains that \u201c[i]n 99% of the cases, it\u2019s a brat who hasn\u2019t been told to cut the act out.\u201d  According to Mr. Savage, we can solve this worldwide health crisis by simply telling our children to quit acting like \u201cmorons,\u201d \u201cputzes,\u201d or idiots. As the father of a child who has been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, I can assure you that the problems my family and hundreds of thousand other families face are very real.  Rhetoric like Mr. Savage\u2019s makes our lives that much more difficult by spreading irresponsible notions about the challenges we face every day. Mr. Savage\u2019s recent explanation that he was merely trying \u201cto boldly awaken parents and children to the medical community\u2019s attempt to label too many children or adults as \u2018autistic\u2019 \u201d does nothing to remove the sting from his words.  His explanation is nothing short of inane.  Moreover, his stated intention to open his show up to those who disagree with him is a hollow gesture.   As was  reported in the  New York Times , Mr. Savage prefers to stand by his remarks and has no intention of apologizing. Indeed, an apology from Michael Savage would be empty, as it would undoubtedly result from pressure brought to bear by his sponsors or affiliate stations.  I am not suggesting that you bring that kind of pressure.  Instead, I am suggesting that you do the right thing and follow the example of Home Depot and AFLAC, both of whom have indicated they will pull all advertising from Michael Savage\u2019s show. I understand that some have indicated that they do not advertise on the show, but I also understand that Radio Shack, Budweiser, Home Depot, and AFLAC all carried ads on his show today, at least in some markets.  Without doubt, pulling advertising may take more than one day.  But be aware that you will be judged by more than promises.  It is not enough to stop advertising on a national basis, and close your eyes to what goes on at individual affiliate stations.  Ignoring the problem is exactly what leads to things like Savage\u2019s contemptuous actions.  To act in good faith in this matter, you should communicate to all of your advertising agencies that you will not tolerate advertising on that show. Every consumer has a choice on where to buy hammers and nails, where to get electronic devices, or what beer to drink.  Most of us like to feel good about the products and services we spend our money on, and feeling good about the providers of those products and services is a large part of that.   Too many consumers now know the reality of autism that Michael Savage would deny.  (As some of us say, we are everywhere, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon.)  Many of us have been your customers; many of us have felt good about being your customers.  We ask that you keep us in mind as you make your corporate decision on whether you really wan to have your name associated with that of Michael Savage.  Wade Rankin http://injectingsense.blogspot.com UPDATE:  POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM RADIO SHACK I received the following response from Radio Shack.  Although it was also left in part as a comment, I thought it important to put it here as an update in its entirety.  It is a thoughtful response, showing that Radio Shack wishes to be a good corporate citizen. Thank you for your email to RadioShack\u2019s Media Relations Department. We appreciate and share your concerns. We would like to emphatically state RadioShack was not and is not a sponsor of the Michael Savage radio show. In fact, our agreement with the radio network airing his show specifically excludes his program (along with several others) as one on which our commercials may appear. The fact that one or more of our ads did run on the July 16 broadcast of this show was in direct violation of our advertising contract with the network. The network has admitted their mistake to us and apologized for the confusion they have created. Likewise, we are investigating whether any other radio stations who air the syndicated version of the program may have violated our advertising contracts and instructions. If so, we will demand a proper remedy. Unfortunately, the network\u2019s mistake was heard by many individuals such as you who have since spread the word that RadioShack sponsors this program. Likewise, Web sites that were quick to post our name as a sponsor without investigating the actual facts have been very slow to correct the record online. Until that happens, we would greatly appreciate your help in spreading the facts through your own personal network. Once again, thank you for writing and allowing us the opportunity to set the record straight. Sincerely, Charles Hodges Director Media Relations UPDATE 2:  HOME DEPOT And here's a generic response from The Home Depot (not that Radio Shack's reply wasn't a form as well).  The support by Bernie Marcus the release mentions is a lot of money given to Autism Speaks, a group that I'm not all that fond of.  I have to observe that Mr. Marcus and Home Depot had a far more positive and forceful response to the Savage attack than did AS. Thank you for contacting us in this matter. The Home Depot does not currently advertise on The Michael Savage Show, nor do we have any kind of sponsorship in place with the program. We strive to ensure that the programs we support through advertising reflect our core values. Feedback from customers like you plays a large role in helping us to maintain these standards and I really appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention. Again, we do not advertise with this program and any suggestion of such support is false.  In fact, one of our company's founders, Bernie Marcus, is very active in the effort to build awareness and raise funding for autism research. We join him in this effort and have supported several of his campaigns. Learn more about his programs for autism at www.marcus.org. The Home Depot UPDATE 3:  SHORT AND SWEET FROM THE BEER GUYS Dear Wade,   Thank you for your recent e-mail to Anheuser-Busch.    Please understand that Anheuser-Busch is not a sponsor or supporter of the Michael Savage Show.    Again, Wade, thank you for taking the time to contact Anheuser-Busch and allowing us to explain our position.   Your Friends at Anheuser-Busch \n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/6xrtwc"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/07/open-letter-to-advertisers-on-savage.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t AN OPEN LETTER TO ADVERTISERS ON \u201cSAVAGE NATION\u201d\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      This week saw the launch of two sites that are worth drawing your attention to:  a new blog and a new resource page.  Both are from familiar voices of reason who are more interested in finding right than being right. IAN\u2019S NEW BLOG The bloggosphere has become the great marketplace of ideas.  A blogger throws out his/her thoughts and opinions, and a discussion starts among readers who leave comments.  Sometimes the ensuing discussions are thought-provoking; other times they are just provoking. I have been very lucky to receive the comments I get on this blog.  For the most part, they have been intelligent and civil.  Among the comments that have impressed me the most \u23af on this blog and on others as well \u23af are the thoughts of Canada\u2019s Ian Parker.  Indeed, I once devoted a  post  to one of his comments.  We do not agree on everything (I am certainly more liberal, maybe more aggressive, on the issue of appropriate interventions), but Ian is one of the most level-headed and open-minded individuals I have come across in the on-line discussions. I am delighted to report that Ian now has his own blog,  A Shade of Grey .  His decision to do so stems from his frustration at the sorry state of the debate: . . . I also see a discussion that is increasingly polarizing, in which accepting that others have different views is giving way to an advocacy that rejects other viewpoints as unenlightened, wrong, or not yet at their level of \u201cawakening\u201d.  This used to be a hallmark of the more activist element within the anti-vaccine crowd, but is also becoming increasingly apparent in the \u201cautism is natural variation\u201d crowd too.  It is one thing to oppose some of the more contentious attempts to cure autism, e.g. chelation, or lupron (which IMHO is just nuts), or to reject the concept of treatment for oneself.  But as this challenge to the more contentious bio-med practices is morphing into a more direct challenge against even mainstream accepted methods of investigating and potentially treating autism, I think it is time for more moderates to join the debate. Ian\u2019s first post, \u201cAutism \u23af It\u2019s Not Always A Natural Variation,\u201d is an easily understood lesson in genetics and epigenetics, focusing on the incidence of autism in identical twins.  He readily admits that his analysis does not support a specific environmental factor that may act in concert with genetics, but his conclusion is that there may often be an external factor at work.  That being the case, Ian\u2019s opinion is that \u201cinvestigating and potentially treating autism in those cases in which it is \u2018caused\u2019 rather than inherited is not a priori an ethical violation of one\u2019s natural genetic expression or right to \u2018be\u2019 autistic.\u201d  I recommend the entire post to one and all. Just as there is a wide spectrum in the manifestations of autism, there is a wide spectrum of opinions regarding the causes and proper interventions.  I do not think of myself as being \u201canti-vaccine,\u201d but I am probably closer to that \u201ccrowd\u201d than Ian is.  Ian seems to be exactly what he pronounces himself to be, a moderate who is tired of the mindless and counterproductive rancor.  Honestly held opinions must be subject to challenge if they are worth holding.  I, for one, am delighted that Ian is here to keep us all honest.     BRETT\u2019S NEW PAGE Brett, from  29 Marbles  has consistently been one of the most balanced autism bloggers around, often pushing his own views to the side to ask the questions to which there are no easy or pat answers.   Being one of the few people who seems to fit in with all of the different sub-communities in the autism world, Brett is probably the ideal person to create a resource page, and that\u2019s what he has done.  It's too soon to say what will set his new page,  Autism for Parents , apart from other resources for parents.   This what Brett says about his purpose: My purpose in creating this site is to hopefully help parents navigate the challenges of raising an autistic child.  Parenthood is challenging enough when you think you know what to expect from your kids, but when you really don\u2019t have a clue it can feel like you\u2019re breaking new ground that no one has been on before.  I\u2019m here to tell you that there are many others who have trod this ground.  My hope is that those experiences of other parents (myself included) will help finding your way a bit easier. In the past, Brett has written of his hopes for what some of us call \u201ccure,\u201d \u201chealing,\u201d \u201calleviation of dysfunction,\u201d and/or \u201c[insert favorite euphemism for \u2018cure\u2019 here].\u201d  At the same time, he understands that there are social, cultural, political, and economic issues that transcend the scientific possibilities.  Sometimes the question is not can we cure autism but should we cure autism.  For my family, the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d but I have to acknowledge the same may not hold true for everyone. My hope is that Brett stays true to form, and that he provides solid information and links concerning the interventions many of us are using, as well as a balanced guide to the debate on whether such interventions are the right thing to do.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://a-shade-of-grey.blogspot.com/", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/", "http://autismforparents.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/03/familiar-friends-with-new-projects.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t FAMILIAR FRIENDS WITH NEW PROJECTS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, March 31, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      April is upon us:  The one month of truly pleasant weather in South Louisiana; the month where our thoughts turn to  JazzFest !  And it\u2019s Autism Awareness Month. If you\u2019ve managed to find your way to this blog, chances are pretty good that you\u2019re already aware of autism.  In our house, we\u2019re more aware of autism than we really want to be.  But one is supposed to observe these events, so I thought I would list a few things about autism of which I am aware. \u2022   I am aware that \u23af despite what anyone may say to the contrary \u23af we are in the midst of an epidemic of diagnosed autism.   Does that mean that the actual number of autistics has risen sharply?  There is no way to answer that question.  A convincing argument may be made for that to be true.  On the other hand, it may well be that, from a quantitative standpoint, the number of autistics has remained stable.  If that is the case, though, then it seems apparent that the severity of the clinical manifestations by which autism is diagnosed is greater in more individuals than before.  In either case, there has to be a reason. \u2022   I am aware that, at least for my family, autism is not a \u201cliving hell.\u201d  Neither is it a bed of roses.   I try not to blog too much about my son, and what we do for him.  I can tell you this.  We love our little boy for who he is, and we accept him unconditionally.  We do not, however, accept what has been done to him.   Yes, there are many things we can\u2019t do as a family because of l\u2019il Rank\u2019s autism.  But we still manage to find joy in one another.  I often say that a child\u2019s autism bestows a special gift upon the parents; we get to celebrate little milestones and victories each day that other parents take for granted \u23af that  I  took for granted with my other children.  Being the father of an autistic child has made me a better parent to all my children. That being said, autism presents challenges to development and to life itself.  There is nothing easy about it, and the strain of dealing with it places a strain on family life.  The irony of becoming a better parent to all my children is that there is less opportunity to be that better parent except with regard to the autistic child.   We are painfully aware that not all autistic children develop to become independent adults.  Therefore, we fell it incumbent upon us to do whatever we can to see to it that our little boy will be just fine after we\u2019re gone. \u2022  I am aware that there is an unresolved controversy about the role of vaccines as a causal factor in the development of autism. Some see the vaccine question as being two separate controversies:  the role of thimerosal, and the role of live-virus vaccines (primarily the MMR).  In all likelihood \u23af and this seems to be  the direction in which the research is heading  given the likely involvement of the immune system \u23af either or both can play a role.  Anecdotally, problems with both metal toxicity and immune function are apparent in many autistic children, and treating those problems often results in alleviation of the clinical manifestations of autism. All that being said, most of us who believe that vaccines played a role in our children\u2019s autism also believe that neither thimerosal nor any live viruses would have caused the damage but for some genetic predisposition. Are vaccines the only toxic exposure that can cause autism in a genetically predisposed individual?  There is no reason to assume that the damage to the immune system caused by vaccines could not also be caused by other environmental insults.  Exposure to lead, for example, could possibly be involved.  Eating mercury-laden fish is often cited as a source of danger.  If damage to the immune system is the key, then it stands to reason that there may be any number of possible insults that could cause problems.  But the temporal connection between the rise in diagnoses of autism and additions to the vaccine schedule in the United States cannot be ignored, and thimerosal stands as a very likely culprit. \u2022   I am aware that, for many autistic children, autism is treatable.  Of course, the protocols that might be successful with one child will not necessarily work with another.  The clinical picture is different for every autistic individual.  Moreover, choosing an appropriate intervention implies not just looking at the causal factors in a particular case, but also weighing the known risks against potential benefits. Okay, I said autism is \u201ctreatable.\u201d  Does that mean autism is \u201ccurable?\u201d  That depends on how we define \u201cautism\u201d and how we define \u201ccure.\u201d   If one defines \u201cautism\u201d as a genetic state of being, separate and apart from the clinical manifestations, then it cannot be denied that all of the protocols that could ever be devised are ineffective.  On the other hand, if one defines \u201cautism\u201d based on a clinical picture consisting of various behaviors and/or dysfunctions, then  anecdotal evidence  suggests that successful treatment is possible. \u201cCuring\u201d is a different question.  Again, no known intervention can \u201ccure\u201d a person of his/her genetic predisposition for autism.  Functionality, from both educational and social standpoints, is simply too fluid a concept to draw bright-line distinctions.  As parents of autistic children, we struggle to find better words:  alleviation, easing, healing, etc.  Some of that struggle is tied up in the moral debate about the ethics of \u201ccuring\u201d autism.  Perhaps a better semantic construct could be found, but there is something so convenient about the word \u201ccure\u201d that I still tend to use it, but always keeping in mind the limitations of how far any intervention may take us and also how easily the word can be misunderstood. The goal for my son is simply put.  I want him to be able to function independently in a world he understands and in a world that understands him.  I want him to appreciate all of the nuances of interpersonal interaction and of an idiomatic culture.  I want every door of opportunity to be open to him. Some of that requires making society more aware of autism and everything it entails.  And some of that requires being aware of what my wife and I can do to help our son handle the challenges of autism.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nojazzfest.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/03/april.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t APRIL\n\t \n    "},

After talking forever about creating a \u201cmarketplace of ideas,\u201d the world finally did so.  Now anyone who thinks their opinion has any value, can throw a few thoughts out into cyberspace and see if anyone agrees.  It occurred to me that it might be cool to be a part of all that, but I quickly discovered that I had as much to say about the sorry manner in which the debate on autism was being conducted as I did on the substantive issues.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had much of an impact on either the debate or the way it is conducted, but somebody out there reads and either agrees or disagrees with what I write.  I installed Site Meter\u2122 a week or so after getting the blog on-line about eight months ago, so it accounts for nearly all of the visitors I have had (those who came before the meter\u2019s installation were part of what commerce usually calls a \u201csoft opening\u201d).  Sunday night, around 10:22 p.m. CST, I passed a milestone:  my 10,000th official visitor.

It occurs to me that I could get better numbers if I posted more frequently like some people do.  But unfortunately I keep pretty busy between my job and doing my share of the child-care thing.

Although I won\u2019t shy away from a fight, I really don\u2019t need to go looking for one.  So I guess I have to be content with my relatively low number of visitors.

After doing so, I can report that it is a site well worth adding to your bookmarks. The tone is set by Dan Olmstead\u2019s Letter from the Editor (the following being a mere excerpt): Welcome to Age of Autism, the nation\u2019s first daily Web newspaper for the environmental-biomedical community \u23af those who believe the autism epidemic is a health crisis that requires urgent action; that autism is an environmentally induced illness, that it is treatable, and that children can recover. For the most part, the major media in the United States aren\u2019t interested in that point of view, they won\u2019t investigate the causes and possible biomedical treatments of autism independently, and they don\u2019t listen to the most important voices \u23af those of the parents. We will do all those things, and more. . . . The Age of Autism will be wide-open and transparent in its reporting and commentary on causes and treatments; I am beholden to no individual, organization or fixed point of view.  My commitment is to in-depth reporting.  I am not a social worker or an autism parent, I\u2019m a journalist drawn to what I called, in my last UPI column, \u201cthe story of a lifetime.\u201d  Based on my own work, I do believe mercury \u23af including the horrendously neurotoxic ethyl mercury in vaccines \u23af is clearly implicated in the rise of autism, and that its continued use in flu shots for children and pregnant women is catastrophic.  So is the expanding use of thimerosal in vaccines shipped to developing countries where (no surprise) autism rates are soaring. . . Also part of the initial offering is  a lesson in semantics  in which Mr. Olmsted rolls his eyes (just as we all have) at the constant use of the word \u201cemotional\u201d to describe the vaccine/environmental issue and those who question the status quo.  Another piece I particularly enjoyed was  Mark Blaxil\u2019s account  of serving on the recent CDC panel.  When one reads Mr. Blaxil\u2019s article together with  Barbara Loe Fisher\u2019s post , one gets the flavor of the political landscape and just how stacked the deck is that\u2019s being dealt.

{"date": "Sunday, November 04, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      There was a time when I was engaged in what I thought was a meaningful on-line dialog with proponents of the \u201cneurodiversity\u201d movement.  Although I still have friends on \"the other side,\" the dialog didn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere because we could not agree on the most basic concepts:  the nature of ASDs and the morality of the process of cure.  Still, there was \u23af and is \u23af enough common ground that I will often check in on their on-line world to see if there is anything to be learned. One thing I have learned is that it is rare to find anything written about those basic and irreconcilable issues that can be called balanced.  I was pleased to see an exception in the Globe and Mail from Canada.  In a recent article entitled  \u2018Autistics\u2019: We don\u2019t want a cure , Erin Anderssen does a fine job of reporting on (if you\u2019ll pardon the expression) the spectrum of opinions. She writes of parents like Andrea-Bradford Lambert, who \u201cwant their children to be seen as different, rather than disabled,\u201d and who \u201chave been joined by an increasingly vocal group of adult autistics (as they prefer to be called) who say they do not want to be cured.\u201d  As Ms. Anderssen explains, those advocates believe that \u201cautism should be seen as part of the \u2018neurodiversity\u2019 needed to evolve smarter human beings, just as biodiversity helps life flourish on Earth.\u201d On the other hand, there is another parent, Harold Doherty, whose son, Conor, has what is described as severe, low-functioning autism. . . . He communicates verbally through sporadic shrieks and requires constant care; at school, he receives behavioural therapy in a separate room. One afternoon, while his father was momentarily distracted on the phone, he wandered out the door and across a busy intersection.  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand the risks of cars,\u201d says Mr. Doherty, who worries that some day his son might be abused and unable to tell anyone.  Conor often bites his mother and has pulled his father\u2019s arm away from the steering wheel while driving. \u201cBut they don't like us to talk about that,\u201d Mr. Doherty says.  He believes that people who make the case for neurodiversity often trivialize autism and deny the difficulties faced by families with disabled children.  People with Asperger\u2019s don\u2019t have any business telling him what kind of treatment his son needs, he says. \u201cSome of them are gifted.  Great.  But my son isn\u2019t. And many autistics aren\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I could cure my son with a wave of my hand, I would do it in a heartbeat.\u201d Then there\u2019s Tanya Stephenson, a mother who tries to balance the concerns of eliminating what is disabling while preserving whatever it is that makes her son unique.  The interventions she uses are primarily behavioral therapies. Each time they undo a behaviour that identifies Tyler as autistic, they wrestle with the choice.  When he scores in a video game, for example, they have taught him to squeeze his hands together instead of flapping his arms wildly. \u201cAnd we debate this,\u201d Ms. Stephenson says, \u201cbecause if you\u2019re at a football game, you see some pretty wacky stuff happening when people are so excited because someone scores a touchdown.  They look more odd than my son does.  So why don\u2019t we try to squash that behaviour?\u201d In the end, while Ms. Stephenson knows that some autistics and families would criticize her for it, she wants Tyler to have a relationship with his parents, to enjoy the magic of his world while still participating in theirs. \u201cI am not trying to change that really unique part of him,\u201d she says. \u201cI am saying this is who he is, this is the way he is and if you understand him, you will find he can bring a pretty neat perspective.\u201d But how does that perspective get communicated, she asks, if he doesn\u2019t have the social skills to share it? Ms. Anderssen\u2019s article, although more balanced than most, does lean more to the neurodiversity side with its emphasis on \u201cacceptance.\u201d  I\u2019ve always thought that the hang up over that word creates a divide that may not be as wide as it appears.  Most \u201c curebies \u201d (a category I place myself in) I know truly accept their children.  The only thing they do not accept is the inevitability of the disability that comes with the autism package. Although Ms. Anderssen\u2019s article seems to lean to the neurodiversity side, much of what one hears from the ND camp is, not surprisingly, critical.  In particular, Michelle Dawson, the ex-postal worker turned research assistant and commentator \u23af who is discussed and quoted at length in the piece in a relatively flattering manner \u23af has expressed her displeasure.  I have read  Ms. Dawson\u2019s critique , and her chief complaint seems to be that the Globe and Mail article does not mirror her own unique view of autism.  Well, Ms. Dawson, it\u2019s not exactly the piece I would have written either.  It doesn\u2019t reflect what I believe about autism.  What it expresses, however, is that there just may be more than one way of looking at an issue that is too complex for any simple responses.  Considering what we usually see in the press, I can live with that.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/3d3lbm", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/11/erin-anderssen-does-not-take-autism.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/11/question-of-balance.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A QUESTION OF BALANCE\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Sunday, April 02, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I was staring to formulate a new post on autism controversies, etc., but it\u2019s been just too pretty a day, and I\u2019m still having those  Jazzfest  thoughts.  Then a friend of ours emailed asking for musical suggestions for a party with a New Orleans theme.  It got me thinking about what songs I would burn onto a mix if I was throwing the party.  Here, in alphabetical order, is a pretty good, but certainly non-exhaustive, sampling of New Orleans classics.  All These Things  \u23af Art Neville Art is the eldest of the famous brothers (and the father of television journalist Arthel Neville).  His career spans close to fifty years, and would have been considered complete if he had never cut another record after \u201cAll These Things.\u201d  It\u2019s a great slow-dance love song. Big Chief  \u23af  Professor Longhair Henry Roeland Byrd a/k/a Professor Longhair was called \u201cthe Bach of Rock,\u201d partly because of the intricacy of his piano playing, and partly because of the influence he had on what developed into rock-n-roll.  He pioneered a rhumba-flavored blues style of piano playing that came to shape the New Orleans style.  \u201cBig Chief\u201d is one of many songs that echoes the chants of the Mardi Gras Indians, groups of African Americans who take to the streets on Fat Tuesday morning in elaborate costumes.  Greta versions of this song were also released by Dr. John and the subdudes. Burgundy Street Blues  \u23af George Lewis I\u2019m not including very much traditional jazz on this list, mainly because it would lengthen it by at least a hundred tunes to include just the essentials.  But this little-known gem is just too good to omit.   George Lewis was, in my humble opinion, the greatest clarinet player New Orleans ever produced.  \u201cBurgundy Street Blues\u201d was one of the few tunes he actually wrote.  It has a bittersweet feel to it; you just can\u2019t help but close your eyes and smile wistfully while listening to it. Cissy Strut  \u23af The Meters The original Meters consisted of Art Neville on keyboards, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, the incomparable George Porter, Jr. on bass, and the irrepressible Zigaboo Modeliste on drums.  They served as the house band at legendary Sea-Saint Studios, where they backed up the likes of Dr. John, Robert Palmer, and Paul McCartney.  They also cut some amazing albums of their own.  Most of the early records were instrumentals, including this classic that redefined the meaning of \u201cfunk.\u201d  After years of legal disputes and petty squabbling that kept them apart, the original four Meters regrouped for last year\u2019s Jazzfest.  They had so much fun, they did some more dates, and they are back on the jazzfest schedule for the end of this month. Fiyo on th\u2019 Byo (Fire on the Bayou)  \u23af The Neville Brothers This tune was originally recorded by the Meters, during a period when Cyrill Neville was part of the group.  When Art and Cyrill left the Meters, they formed the now-legendary act with their brothers Charles and Aaron.  This is one of the Meters\u2019 tunes that made it into the new group\u2019s catalog, and the Nevillized version is nothing short of amazing. Gonzo  \u23af James Booker Before the weird blue Muppet, and even before anyone decided to give the name to Hunter S. Thompson, James Carroll Booker, III was Gonzo.  He took Professor Longhair\u2019s syncopated rhythms and took music to places no musician had gone before or has gone since.  Among the odder chapters of his life story was that this genius who was known to disobey a few laws in his life, took the young son of the local district attorney under his wing, and showed him a thing or two on piano.  A few cynics thought Booker was using the kid as his get-out-jail-free card, but it turns out the kid had a few chops and Booker seemed to genuinely like him.  The kid was a 12-year old Harry Connick, Jr., who seems to have found some measure of success.  It is ironic that Booker, who was known as \u201cthe piano prince of New Orleans,\u201d recorded his best known song, \u201cGonzo,\u201d on organ.   Hey Pocky Way  \u23af The Meters This classic vocal track from the Meters is adapted from a Mardi Gras Indian chant.  The Neville Brothers also perform this song, but the Meters\u2019 version is definitive Fat Tuesday funk. Iko Iko  \u23af Dr. John This is another one that started out as an Indian chant.  It is the mark of pride in new Orleanians that we actually understand the lyrics to this one.  A better known version was released by the Dixie Cups, but the doctor\u2019s recording can\u2019t be beat. I\u2019m Walkin\u2019  \u23af Fats Domino When Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans, one of the stubborn folks who refused to leave was Antoine \u201cFats\u201d Domino.  His rescue from his Ninth Ward house made headlines, and resulted in a collective sigh of relief around the world.  He\u2019s not only playing at this year\u2019s Jazzfest, he\u2019s on  the poster .  A lot of his songs could have made this list, but I chose my favorite. It\u2019s Raining  \u23af  Irma Thomas Irma Thomas is rightfully called the \u201csoul queen of New Orleans.\u201d  She makes any song sound good.  This is a classic tune of having the blues in the rain. Lipstick Traces  \u23af Benny Spellman This was the only nationally known hit by Spellman, affine New Orleans singer.  The song\u2019s imagry shows why Allen Toussaint is so revered among songwriters: Lipstick Traces On a cigarette Every memory of you Lingers yet Mardi Gras in New Orleans  \u23af Professor Longhair This is a rollicking good time of a song with incredible piano work and the world\u2019s funkiest whistling.   Mother in Law  \u23af Ernie K-Doe Ernest Kador was a unique character who was born to entertain.  It\u2019s hard to say he had a great voice, but every song he sang was infused with personality.  His best known song was another Allen Toussaint gem, with references to the stereotypical mother-in-law having been \u201csent from down below.\u201d  For anyone who has had a mother-in-law who \u201cthinks her advice is a contribution, but if she would leave would be a solution,\u201d this song is an anthem.  In his last marriage, ol\u2019 Ernie finally found a mother-in-law he loved, but he never talked about the ones who came before.  I can relate. St. James Infirmary  \u23af Louis Armstrong It seems odd to only have one song by Satchmo on the list, but it\u2019s another case of keeping it manageable.  \u201cSt. James Infirmary,\u201d also known as \u201cThe Gambler\u2019s Blues\u201d was a New Orleans variant in \u201cThe Unfortunate Rake\u201d cycle of folk songs (okay, that\u2019s a bit more information than you really wanted).  Armstrong recorded it at the peak of his career, and he\u2019s at his best on both trumpet and vocals. Such a Night  \u23af Dr. John Mac Rebennack\u2019s most commercially successful album was \u2018Right Place, Wrong Time,\u201d on which he was backed up by the Meters.  Of all the great songs on the album, \u201cSuch a Night\u201d is standing the test of time quite well.  It\u2019s hard not to crack a little smile at the rationalization of the refrain:  \u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, y\u2019know somebody else will.\u201d \u2018Taint it the Truth  \u23af Ernie K-Doe Another great performance from K-Doe, in one of those \u201cshe\u2019s left me\u201d songs. Time Is On My Side  \u23af Irma Thomas Most people are familiar with this song as being one of the early hits of the Rolling Stones.  Ms. Thomas recorded the original, and her vocal puts Mick to shame. Tipitina  \u23af Professor Longhair Never has random nonsense sounded so good.  Dancing to this is as much fun as is humanly possible.  The famous New Orleans nightclub, Tipitina\u2019s, is named after this song, and a statue of the professor stands in the neutral ground (\u201cmedian\u201d for you yankees) of adjacent Napoleon Avenue.  Tell It Like It Is  \u23af Aaron Neville Is there anyone out there that really hasn\u2019t heard this one? Who Shot the Lala  \u23af Oliver Morgan Before Sym and I got married, one of our more memorable dates was to see the legendary Tommy Ridgley (who we eventually hired to play our wedding) perform at a suburban club.  Sitting in for a set was none other than the great Oliver Morgan.  As it turned out, we were one of only two couples in the place, but Tommy and Oliver didn\u2019t seem to care.  They put on a great show.  I will never forget seeing Oliver Morgan look down from the stage to the dance floor where I was twirling my Sym around, and he asked \u201cYou love that woman, boy?\u201d  I surely do Mr. Morgan.  \u201cWho Shot the Lala\u201d is Oliver Morgan\u2019s best-known song, and is, without doubt, the world\u2019s most fun song about a killing. Workin\u2019 in a Coal Mine  \u23af Lee Dorsey This was reworked in the \u201880s by Devo, but it just wasn\u2019t the same.  It\u2019s yet another Allen Toussaint song, and has the absolute greatest bass line of all time. You Can Have My Husband (But Please Don\u2019t Mess With My Man)  \u23af Irma Thomas When you get right down to it, the name pretty much says it all. There it is, a short list of songs that can turn any party into a N\u2019Awlins second line.  But there\u2019s a lot more where those came from.  Anyone with internet access can get a free lesson in New Orleans every day by listening in on  the world\u2019s greatest radio station .  So c\u2019mon, everybody get funky! *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * Addendum: After posting this, I realized I left off three of the great ones. Barefootin\u2019  \u23af Robert Parker This has to be one of the greatest dance songs of all time. Ooh Poo Pah Doo  \u23af Jessie Hill Another bit of irresistible nonsense.   You Talk Too Much  \u23af Joe Jones And really, haven\u2019t we all wanted to say that to someone sometime.  Some people say something similar in the comments to this blog on a regular basis. So now we have a full 25 songs on our New Orleans list.  NOW GET FUNKY!\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nojazzfest.com/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/NOJF_06_fd.jpg", "http://www.nojazzfest.com/posters/index04.html", "http://www.wwoz.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/04/22-make-that-25-good-reasons-to-love.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t 22 (MAKE THAT 25) GOOD REASONS TO LOVE NEW ORLEANS MUSIC\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 05, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       There has been much action on the scientific, political and media fronts in the ongoing debate over the connection between vaccines and the autism epidemic (and, yes, I will continue to use that word).  First, was all the news out of the  M.I.N.D. Institute , including the announcement of the  Autism Phenome Project , and the  release of a study  showing damage to the immune system from thimerosal exposure. Then, we had the  letter by eight members of Congress , led by Senator Joe Lieberman, calling upon the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to take a new look at the hypothetical link.  Last week, at a  press briefing  that included Dan Olmstead and David Kirby, Representative Carolyn Maloney announced her legislative efforts to mandate further studies.  And this week will see the Generation Mercury March and a DAN! Conference in Washington. That much activity just naturally has to make for a collective case of the jitters among those who have a vested interest in denying any link between vaccines and autism.  Their reaction was predictable. A  letter  was addressed to the individual members of Congress by 22 organizations, pleading that there be no legislative restrictions on the use of thimerosal in vaccines.  The groups\u2019 rationale was open fear.  Some people might interpret a ban on mercury in vaccines as being an admission that there is a problem, or that \u201cvaccine safety oversight is inadequate.\u201d  Well, duh! The 22 organizations declared that they \u201cstand behind the enormous amount of scientific evidence that shows no link exists between thimerosal in vaccines and the development of autism.\u201d  Perhaps if they said they believe the research does not support a link, I could call their position a legitimate disagreement with the growing body of evidence of a link.  But to say there is an \u201cenormous amount\u201d of evidence against a link is laughable.  The 2004 IOM report cited the Verstraeten study, which even in its post-Simpsonwood version was labeled \u201cneutral\u201d by its author.  The other evidence relied upon by the IOM committee consisted of foreign studies in which the level of exposure was less than the United States, and at least one Danish study changed the criteria for its pre-thimerosal-removal and post-thimerosal-removal cadres.  Have I missed some startling revelation of the last year or so? The other sign that the powers that be are worried is the resort to their favorite tactic.  They trot out Dr. Paul Offit to let everyone know that no attention should be paid to the man behind the curtain.   Just like  Punxsutawney Phil , Dr. O emerges from his safe area, sees the shadow of bad news on the horizon, and then speaks reassuringly to those who don\u2019t live with the issue every day.  Just like Phil\u2019s weather forecast, however, any similarity between Dr. Offit\u2019s pronouncements and reality is purely coincidental.  And just like the movie,  Groundhog Day , in which Bill Murray lives the same day again and again, what we\u2019re hearing from Dr. Offit is pretty much the same thing we\u2019ve heard him say before. \u201cEvery Child by Two,\u201d an organization dedicated to promoting childhood immunization (this was one of the 22 organizations sending the letter to Congress), hosted a  teleconference with Dr. Offit  for the media.   In her introduction, Amy Pisani, the Executive Director of Every Child By Two, noted that the purpose of the conference was \u201cto discuss vaccine safety and legislation that\u2019s being introduced in many states to ban the use of thimerosal in vaccines.\u201d  Of Dr. Offit, Ms. Pisani remarked that \u201che has the uncanny ability to make sense of the abundant research that\u2019s been conducted around the world to disprove allegations that the preservative thimerosal that is in some vaccines ever caused autism in children.\u201d  That was an interesting introduction inasmuch as the  bulk of actual autism research was barely mentioned. The closest thing to a surprise in the teleconference was Dr. Offit\u2019s admission that environmental insults may trigger autism in genetically predisposed children.  In particular, he mentioned studies based on mothers taking thalidomide or being exposed to rubella, both insults having to occur early in pregnancy.  To refute the connection between mercury and autism, however, Dr. Offit cited a study reportedly indicating that Rhogam use in pregnancy does not increase the odds of developing autism.  According to Dr. Offit, that study was presented in March 2005 in Chicago at the American College of Genetics annual meeting.  I must admit that I am unfamiliar with such a study, and if it was ever published, it is not readily accessible through a pubmed search.  There is certainly evidence to suggest the contrary conclusion. But the main rationale cited by Dr. Offit was, as usual, the same epidemiological studies on which the IOM report was based.  He calls the results \u201cclear and consistent and reproducible.\u201d  Apparently, Dr. Offit still labors under the misconception that the European studies, based on different levels of exposure than the United States experience, somehow reproduce and validate the \u201cneutral\u201d results of the Verstraeten study. In the teleconference, Dr. Offit points to levels of mercury in the environment apart from vaccinations, and implies that an infant is more in danger of mercury poisoning from breastfeeding than from receiving a flu shot.  He bases that argument not only on the volume of mercury involved (ignoring the fact that injection is a far more efficient means of introducing mercury than digestion), but also on thimerosal containing ethylmercury \u201ca form of mercury which will be excreted much more quickly.\u201d  When a reporter later asked about the Burbacher studies, which demonstrate that ethylmercury is as dangerous \u23af if not more so \u23af than methylmercury, Dr. Offit moved the subject back to script with the aplomb of a presidential candidate at a debate:  \u201cagain, I think \u23af I mean, I think that \u23af you know, there\u2019s nothing as strong, frankly, as the epidemiologic studies.\u201d  As usual, Dr. Offit did not wander far from his comfort zone.  There was no real discussion of any studies that might point to conclusions he won\u2019t like.    Paul Offit is now taking the show on the road.  On April 11th, he will be the featured speaker at a seminar in Jacksonville, Florida, entitled  Vaccines and Autism:  The Provider\u2019s Role in Communicating Vaccine Safety .  Soon we will have lots of Offit clones all telling us that there is nothing to worry about, and we should trust people who must be lots smarter than the rest of us.  Interestingly, there is no fee for attending the seminar, but that can be explained by the acknowledged \u201ccommercial support\u201d for the program from GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., Inc., Sanofi Pasteur, and Wyeth Vaccines.  At least those sponsors were up front about their interest in presenting the program; Dr. Offit reports that he has \u201cno relevant commercial relationships to disclose.\u201d  Punxsutawney Phil seems to be a genial fellow who can entertain a crowd.  But I wouldn\u2019t want to place my faith in his forecasting skills.  Is it any wonder that Punxsutawney Phil and Paul Offit both come to us from the great state of Pennsylvania?

{"date": "Saturday, April 15, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Many writers have \u201cmuses,\u201d people who inspire us to write even when we think we have run out of things to say.  In a rather demented way, my muse is Paul Offit, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.  I would really like to ignore him, but any time he opens his mouth, he says something that cries out for comment. Friday morning, C-Span 2 aired a live panel discussion at the conservative American Enterprise Institute featuring Dr. Offit.  (The video of the forum may be viewed  here .)  The subject of the forum was Dr. Offit\u2019s book,  The Cutter Incident .  Although I admit to not having actually read the book lest I do anything to further enrich Dr. O (perhaps if I see it at a rummage sale . . .), I previously have discussed  the deficiencies of his thesis , which one does not need to read the book to understand given the author\u2019s proclivity for self-promotion.   In short, Paul Offit believes that a health-care crisis arose out of an incident in the 1950s after an early polio vaccine, manufactured by Cutter Laboratories, not only failed to prevent polio in certain patients, but actually caused the patients to contract the disease.  As is known to happen in America, even the America of the fifties, lawsuits resulted, and at least one case uniquely resulted in the imposition of liability without a showing of negligence on Cutter\u2019s part.  In the paranoid view of Dr. Offit, that verdict against Cutter resulted in a scare among pharmaceutical companies who jumped out of the vaccine business in fear of the legal profession.  In a  previous post , I took a stab at explaining how the legal developments occurring after the Cutter verdict do not support an exodus from vaccine manufacturing.  If there are less manufacturers in the vaccine business, it is far more likely to be the result of other market forces, particularly the consolidation of the industry.  But Dr. Offit has never been one to let logic get in the way of selling his bill of goods. And what is Dr. O selling?  He wants to effect a wholesale change in public policy concerning vaccine injuries.  In short, he is not satisfied with the present state of affairs in which the federal vaccine court acts as a speed bump on the way to seeking compensation for vaccine-related injuries.  He doesn\u2019t even want vaccine-court decisions to come from the special masters that now judge the cases.  Dr. Offit wants a whole new decision-making process in which the question of liability is made solely by scientific and medical specialists (i.e., industry insiders).  There would be no recourse to the ordinary court system.  After all, in Paul Offit\u2019s opinion, most of us are just too simple-minded to understand science. There was nothing new about what Dr. O was selling this time, but he did pull a couple of new sales tools out of his sample case.  His theme has always been fear, and primarily fear of the legal profession in particular.  In his presentation before the American Enterprise Institute, Offit used two visual aids that say much about his pandering.   First, Dr. O wanted to make sure we all understood how evil the Cutter suits were to begin with, and the best means of illustrating that was to demonize the architect of the legal strategy.  The plainitffs\u2019 legal team had been led by the self-proclaimed \u201cKing of Torts,\u201d Melvin Belli.  As a self-respecting defense lawyer, I was not a big fan of Mr. Belli, but Offit\u2019s ham-handed attempt to damn the message by damning the messenger was too much for even me.  He decided to show a photograph of Mr. Belli.  He could have chosen from hundreds of pictures of one of the most-photographed lawyers of all time, and many of the images from his later life would have depicted Belli\u2019s flamboyant nature.  But those would have made the lawyer appear clownish rather than evil, and evil was what Dr. O wanted to convey.  So he showed a picture of Belli taken during one of his relatively rare forays into criminal law:  his representation of Jack Ruby.  The implicit message was that great harm was done to a noble cause by the defender of murderers. The other visual aid Dr. O used was the recent full-page ad placed in  USA Today , on behalf of  Put Children First .  Never mind that the ad criticized the CDC\u2019s apparent stonewalling of the truth about a connection between thimerosal and the autism epidemic, rather than directly attacked the vaccine manufacturers.  In Dr. Offit\u2019s opinion, the ad could only have one purpose:  poisoning the minds of any potential jurors in suits against vaccine manufacturers.  (That opinion ignores the fact that the voir dire process in a jury trial would help to eliminate anyone who formed an opinion by reading an ad.)  What was the basis for Offit\u2019s opinion?  Well it was obvious to Dr. O:  the ad was placed by the same advertising agency that once worked with plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in breast-implant litigation.  Puhleeze!!!  Any good advertising agency is going to have a wide variety of clients.  And some agencies are going to specialize in public-interest ads.  That does not mean that every client they have will be allied.  What one must look at is the identity of who is paying for the ad.  In this case, it was J.B. Handley, who has not filed suit in either a district court or the vaccine court.  He has no stake at all in any litigation. In selling his goods, Dr. Offit relies on irrational fear rather than the inconvenient (for him) truth.  But the fear he\u2019s using is not the fear he really has.  I suspect Dr. O is not so much afraid that the legal system won\u2019t do the right thing as he is afraid that justice will actually be done. I\u2019m afraid too.  I\u2019m afraid that some people actually seem to be buying Paul Offit\u2019s bill of goods.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/ha2s3", "http://www.putchildrenfirst.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/04/paul-offit-disingenuous-salesman.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t PAUL OFFIT:  THE DISINGENUOUS SALESMAN\n\t \n    "},

The estimates I\u2019ve seen for the number of participants ranged from a couple of hundred to a thousand.  I\u2019m not too concerned over the numbers.  It is enough to know that for every person there at the capitol, there were many, many others who could not be there for one reason or another.  There are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon. We\u2019re speaking through a lot of different groups and a lot of different media (including blogs).  To be sure, we don\u2019t speak for all autistics or parents of all autistic children.  Some feel we\u2019re creating a diversion from what they see as the real issues of autism.  Some feel we\u2019re advocating a waste of national resources.  Some feel that by talking in terms of \u201ccure,\u201d we create an image of autistics as being unworthy of respect or love.  I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the intent or the result, but obviously some feel that to be the case.  Those who disagree with us are entitled to their opinions and feelings, and I will not fault them for airing their opinions and feelings in any appropriate way they see fit.  But know this; there are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon. That is not to say that we \u23af that is, those of us who either marched in Washington or wished we had \u23af all have the exact same opinions and goals.  We certainly don\u2019t agree on the efficacy of any one intervention, although most of our favorite interventions fall under the umbrella of biomedical protocols.  Some of us think mercury is the only problem.  Some of us think mercury is a large component of a complex problem.  Some of us want to preserve legal rights.  Some of us care less about who can sue whom, and just want someone to tell us the truth.  As for me, I think the question of how we, as a society, should apportion the cost of our mistakes can wait.  The important first step is to find a definitive answer.  As we look for that answer, keep in mind that there are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon. What if that answer shows we\u2019re wrong?  Then we look for new solutions in the answer that emerges.  I don\u2019t think, however, that we\u2019re wrong.  Everything I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years tells me we\u2019re on the right track.  I recall visiting relatives living in tobacco country as a boy.  I can still hear my father\u2019s cousin, who operated a wholesale business for tobacco products, railing about those litigation-seeking agitators who were trying to draw a connection between cigarettes and cancer.  He could cite lots of impressive studies that \u201cdisproved\u201d the connection, but we came to find out those studies were dictated more by interests than science.  In the autism controversies, both sides claim that it\u2019s the other guys using \u201ctobacco science.\u201d  It says a lot to me that only one side says the debate is over.  That side needs to be reminded that there are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon. I didn\u2019t think it could happen, but the rhetoric is getting harsher than ever these days.  People on both sides \u23af better to say all sides \u23af of the debate are getting frustrated.  And there are certainly vocal persons on both sides who seem to delight in provoking controversy.  I may wince when some things are said, but I can only control what I say.  As a whole, we are people of good will.  Nevertheless, we cannot and will not forget what has happened to our children.  Yes, there are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon.    We shall not, we shall not be moved. We shall not, we shall not be move. Just like a tree that\u2019s standing by the water, We shall not be moved. We shall not, we shall not be moved. We shall not, we shall not be moved.

{"date": "Monday, August 21, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      We hear far too many news stories of autistic children who die.  And those deaths are often accompanied by expressions of anger.  We heard the anger when a child died as the result of what appears to have been gross medical malpractice during what should have been an unremarkable chelation procedure.  We\u2019ve heard the anger more recently when an autistic child was killed by her own mother.  Sometimes the anger is justified; sometimes it isn\u2019t.  It\u2019s not my intention to raise those arguments again.  Rather, I want to say something about a phrase I\u2019ve heard whenever we hear the anger:  \u201cthis child died because he/she was autistic.\u201d Sometimes the connection between the autism is easily seen; other times it is more indirect.  But it seems to me that drawing a connection between autism and a child\u2019s death should not be dependent upon intervention by a doctor or parent. A  story appeared in the Macon Telegraph last week , relating the sad news that Jabriel Eason, an autistic six year-old, drowned.  His mother needed an afternoon nap, and she took precautions she thought would keep her son out of danger.  She locked the door, using a bolt that was installed above where Jabriel could reach it, and pushed a sofa against the door.  Those precautions didn\u2019t stop Jabriel, and he was not seen again until the next morning when his body was found in a nearby lake. Jabriel Eason died because he was autistic. The discussions in Macon, Georgia following the drowning have centered on whether property owners should be compelled to erect fences around open bodies of water.  That response is way too simplistic.  To be sure, many autistic children are \u201crunners,\u201d but not all.  And many autistic children seem to have a fascination for water, but not all do. There is an obligation on society\u2019s part to understand autism, and to make necessary accommodations for autistic individuals.  That is, society as a whole must do what it can to make the world safe for autistics. Parents of autistic children, however, have a corresponding obligation.  We must fiind ways to communicate to our children the dangers that surround them, and we must try to remove any barriers that stand in the way of their understanding and recognizing those dangers.  That is, we must do what we can to make our children safe for the world. The dangers and obstacles that face our children are different for each individual child, just as the nature of autism itself is different for each child.  Every week, we seem to hear another story of autistic individuals \u23af children and adults \u23af who become victims of the world around them.  Sometimes those stories have happy endings, but often they do not.  Each time I read one of the stories that ended badly, it haunts me for days thereafter.  I don\u2019t want my child to be a victim. I cannot judge Jabriel\u2019s family; I have no doubt they loved the child and did the best they could to safeguard him.  That they did not succeed is a lesson for us all.

{"date": "Thursday, August 31, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I didn\u2019t think I was going to write about this one, but it has been weighing on my mind.  Another autistic child is dead.  The  Cincinnati Enquirer reported  that three-year old Marcus Fiesel was left alone in a locked closet, without food and water, while his foster parents, Liz and David Carroll went to two-day family reunion.  When they returned, Marcus was dead.  Some reunion. The Carrolls spent the next two weeks telling authorities, the media, and anyone else that would listen that Marcus wandered off from a park after Liz Carroll fainted.  In fact, according to the police, David Carroll took Marcus\u2019 body to the ruins of an old house in the next county, burned the body in the brick chimney of the ruins, and then dumped the remains into the Ohio River. Predictably, some bloggers are trying to relate this crime to the issues of acceptance of autism and autistics (please note that I used the plural of \u201cissues\u201d as I think accepting autistics is not the same as accepting autism, but that\u2019s  another topic ).  And I agree with that assessment to an extent.  Obviously, the Carrolls did not accept Marcus as a valuable human being, but it was the Carrolls, themselves, who were less than human.  Their obscene lack of humanity led to this crime. What I can\u2019t agree with is that their lack of acceptance necessarily had anything to do with videos by Autism Speaks, actions by pro-cure groups, or anything that has been said in the many debates that occur on a regular basis within the greater autism community.  There is no indication that the Carrolls paid any attention to any of that.  There is no indication that the Carrolls have any interest in autism at all.  It is quite likely that the only thing Liz and David Carroll were interested in was the $1,000 monthly stipend they got from the state to \u201ccare\u201d for Marcus.  One can only speculate that the \u201ccare\u201d was none too good.  Frankly, I am not too concerned what motivated these two wastes of DNA.  All I care about is their taking the life of an innocent and defenseless child.  No motive in the world can justify their acts. The Carrolls have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abuse of a corpse, pending the outcome of grand jury proceedings.  Given the lack of evidence concerning what the law call \u201cspecific intent,\u201d those charges seem technically correct, and yet it isn\u2019t enough.  Prison terms of 23 years are not enough.  I\u2019ll leave the punishment due the Carrolls to wiser souls, but I think it\u2019s appropriate calling this crime what it was:  not manslaughter, but murder.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/z5wkx"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/08/murder-and-acceptance.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t MURDER AND ACCEPTANCE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Thursday, June 08, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      An  article in the  Delaware Coast Press  highlights a growing concern about providing services for adult autistics.  It seems that not all autistics grow up to the rosiest of lives. The mother of a 24 year-old autistic man, who is currently living at home, echoed the same worry so many of us have, \u201cI\u2019m not going to live always.\u201d   Another parent spent a considerable time searching for an appropriate group home for his two autistic sons, but found the living conditions in available facilities to be deplorable.  He wound up renting an apartment for his sons within walking distance of their jobs at a local supermarket. The lack of appropriate services for children and adults alike is all part of what many call the  Epidemic of Denial .  Officials at the federal, state, and local levels are doing their best to avoid facing the fact that they have a real problem on their hands.  And it\u2019s only going to get worse.  Here\u2019s the part of the story that really caught my attention: Warren Ellis, director of the division\u2019s adult special populations program that serves 114 people with behavior problems, mostly autistic people, expects the need for services to rise as a larger population of autistic students grows up.  But for now, more group homes for autistic people aren\u2019t warranted. \u201cNot that many people over the years have been requesting residential services,\u201d Ellis said. That may change. \u201cThere are clearly more people with autism who are needing services,\u201d Ellis said, noting a statewide increase.  \u201cMost of those people are still in school.\u201d It should be noted that another official attributed the rise in the population of autistic adults to a variety of factors: The population of adults with disabilities across Delaware has been growing, as those living here age and as retirees relocate to the region from other states and bring disabled children with them, according to Roy Lafontaine, deputy director of the Division of Developmental Disabilities Services, part of Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. I was unaware that Delaware has become a haven for retirees, although I would certainly agree that the DelMarVa area is an inviting destination.  Nevertheless, an influx of families from elsewhere cannot completely explain the increased burden on services.  Indeed, Mr. Lafontaine mentioned the factor of autistic individuals already in the area aging.   It all begs the question of why there was less of a need for services for autistic adults in the past.  It\u2019s a question that many in other states are also asking. In any event, parents in Delaware are starting to worry about housing, transportation, and personal services for their autistic sons and daughters.  To the state\u2019s credit, Delaware has been tracking numbers through its Department of Education, and is at least thinking about the future.  But there\u2019s no plan, and good intentions are not going to help families in need now. With limited resources, the division must prioritize, focusing first on disabled people who most need homes, who are poor, who lack caregivers or have been orphaned.  While federal laws mandate education for disabled children, no such provisions ensure specific care for disabled adults. \u201cMany parents feel that it should be an entitlement,\u201d Ellis said of housing and services for autistic men and women.  \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not.\u201d We have all heard some pretty scary estimates of the lifetime cost for caring for an autistic individual.  Undoubtedly, some individuals will require less in the way of services, and some will require more.  The unfortunate truth, however, is that not all autistic children grow up with the ability to live a fully independent life.   For some families, physical recovery from autism is possible.  For other families, though, that may not be an option.  And some families do not even consider recovery or cure an option.  The common thread for all families of autistic persons is that we face a heavy financial burden.  When families are unable to bear that burden, our governments step in.  It is time for society as a whole to take stock of this situation and decide just what is to be done.  As the numbers increase, time is running out.

{"date": "Thursday, March 16, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Congress has asked the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (\u201cNIEHS\u201d) to take a fresh look at the possible link between thimerosal and the development of autism.  A  letter sent to the NIEHS by eight members of Congress  (Senators Joseph Liberman and Debbie Stabenow; and Representatives Dave Weldon, Dan Burton, Carolyn Maloney, Joseph Crowley, Chris Smith, and Maurice Hinchey) explains the reasoning.  It reads in part: We hope that NIEHS can bring its expertise to the issue of thimerosal. Many of us in Congress are concerned about the possibility of an association between autism and thimerosal in vaccines. While we understand that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has determined that the evidence thus far does not support an association, we know that for too many the issue is still not resolved.  The exposure of American children from 1990to 2001 to thimerosal was unique it was 75 percent greater than their European counterparts who are the focus of the majority of the epidemiological research on this issue upon which the IOM relied.  This period coincided with an autism epidemic now affecting I out of every 166 children.  Additionally, thimerosal is by weight 50 percent ethylmercury, which is a potent neurotoxin. The level of thimerosal in these vaccines exceeded the EPA oral daily dose limit for methytmercury by over 120 times at the 2, 4, and 6 month pediatric visit.  Therefore, we believe that there is room for a closer look on any potential association between thirnerosal exposure and the risk of autism, both to learn new information and to solidify the public\u2019s trust in vaccines. The Congressional letter notes the IOM\u2019s reliance on the Vaccine Safety Datalink (\u201cVSD\u201d), maintained by the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d).  Indeed, the big complaint with a recently published study by the Geiers is that they used a less-reliable source of data.  The clear intent of Congress is that we compare apples to apples in determining whether the reduction of thimerosal use in vaccinations has had an impact: Thus far, with regard to thimerosal and autism, the CDC has studied and reported on this database only once.  That study was based on data collected prior to the removal of thimerosal and failed to explicitly compare the outcomes of children who received thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) with those who did not.  The VSD now includes live years of additional data.  We are aware that the CDC is presently preparing to conduct further analysis of the VSD to investigate the post-thimerosal data.  Unfortunately, as the lOM pointed out in its April 2005 report on VSD access, a CDC-led study on thimerosal and autism could be viewed with much skepticism and may not he accepted by the growing number of parents with concerns about vaccine safety and the possible links between thimerosal and autism.  If the federal government is going to have a study whose results will he broadly accepted, such a study cannot be led by the CDC. It is for these reasons we believe that NIEHS is the most appropriate entity to lead such an investigation. Specifically, Congress has asked the NIEHS to convene a workshop with representatives of \u201cthe CDC, the autism community, members of the public concerned about vaccine safety research, and external academic researchers\u201d so that everyone can try to agree on how to use the VSD information to answer the big question:  has thimerosal contributed to the increased incidence of autism?  This will be an important inquiry, to be sure.  It\u2019s hard, though, to get too excited about the prospects.  First, the Congressional letter was not completely accurate when it referred to the removal of thimerosal from vaccines.  As is well-known, thimerosal is still widely used as a preservative in most flu vaccines.  Moreover, the commonly held belief that most \u201cpreservative-free\u201d vaccines are \u201cthimerosal-free\u201d has been challenged.  Although thimerosal is not used as a preservative is most vaccines, it is still used as part of the manufacturing process of some vaccines.  Filtering the thimerosal out may be an imperfect exercise, and there is an ongoing debate as to the exact quantity of the \u201ctrace amounts\u201d that are being found.   Still, it cannot be denied that the thimerosal exposure in today\u2019s vaccines is negligible compared to what it was.  And so the numbers should be going down if thimerosal is a causative factor.  That does not necessarily mean there are five years of post-thimerosal data available.  Considering the shelf life of the vaccines manufactured prior to the phase out, along with the delay in diagnosis for autism, there may only be a year or two of solid numbers, which may not be enough to show a real trend. Another thing that needs to be addressed is the combined impact thimerosal may have with other factors, including live-virus vaccines.  If the input from the \u201cautism community\u201d is limited to concerns over whether \u201cautism is a misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning,\u201d the study may well miss the possibility that thimerosal exposure is but one in a series of insults to the immune system that may eventually lead to a diagnosis of autism. I remain skeptical that even a well-designed epidemiological study can prove or disprove biological causation.  Nevertheless, to the extent that epidemiology can provide important clues, I am happy that we may have a truly independent study.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.a-champ.org/Congressionalletter2-22-06.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/03/fresh-look.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t A FRESH LOOK\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, June 24, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Sources of funding add too much fuel to the fires in the debates over vaccines or thimerosal as possible triggers of autism.  The vested interests of vaccine manufacturers and government regulators deprive any study they may fund of credibility among those of us who believe there may be a link.  On the other hand, those that are inclined to discount any connection between vaccines and autism will automatically disbelieve any study funded by SafeMinds, Generation Rescue or any of the other advocacy groups.  What we all need are studies funded by entities that aren't tied to a specific agenda on the issue. Autism Speaks  could be such an entity, but it has yet to earn the trust that will be needed to give its work credibility on both sides of these issues. When Autism Speaks first came on the scene, its arrival was met with skepticism because its co-founder, Bob Wright served as the chief executive for a business (NBC) that derived advertising revenue from the pharmaceutical industry.  Eyes were set rolling even more when Autism Speaks merged with and took over the National Alliance for Autism Research (\u201cNAAR\u201d) in a  deal  that had the new organization \u201cadopting\u201d NAAR's scientific advisory board and scientific advisory committee.  Because NAAR had long earned the reputation of not wanting to look beyond simple genetics in studying autism, there was little room for optimism that Mr. Wright's initiative would do anything to help resolve the controversy. But while it was still discussing the merger with NAAR, Autism Speaks issued a  policy statement  noting the still-unproven hypothesis of a connection to thimerosal, and it noted the need to further explore all environmental exposures: The thimerosal question has highlighted a number of points whose further consideration should significantly advance autism research. First, although genes are believed to play a major role in autism, more attention needs to be paid to mechanisms where genes exert their influence by altering susceptibility to environmental exposures and mechanisms by which environmental exposures may alter gene expression. Second, there is a great need, when studying environmental exposures, to find ways of identifying highly susceptible individuals. And, third, because autism is a complex condition possibly having multiple causes, researchers need to find reliable ways to distinguish autism subgroups with distinct etiologies. . . . Autism Speaks plans to strongly support a multidisciplinary research agenda on environmental exposures and autism. We believe that projects acknowledging the role of gene-environment interaction and incorporating markers of exposure susceptibility and etiologic heterogeneity will be the most productive in the long-term. Given present knowledge, there is a fairly broad array of neurotoxic environmental exposures worthy of further study but, moving forward, the type and timing of exposures under investigation should continue to comport with emerging developments in autism neurobiology. Thus, many of us hoped that Autism Speaks would step up and fund independent and credible research to help all of us move forward.  And some day Autism Speaks may do just that, but not this year. Autism Speaks issued a  list of its Pilot Grants , in which it will dole out $5,600,000 to fund 50 projects over the next two years.  Not one of the 50 projects directly addresses the question of thimerosal or vaccines, and none seek to examine the efficacy of the biomedical approaches so many of us use.   That is not to say that the studies receiving funding have no value.  Most of the studies will add to the body of knowledge we need in areas like autistic cognition, visual processing, adaptive skills, the etiology of language deficits, sensory integration.   Other funded studies seem to be wasteful.  Do we really need a two-year study, funded at $118,880, to detect and try to artificially eliminate body rocking and hand flapping?  That seems to me to be the least of our worries.  And while I'm sure that studying the impact of bilingual language exposure will yield interesting results, it seems to me that the $42,800 earmarked for that one-year study could have been spent better. I count at least four studies on the role neuroligens play in autism.  It's an important question, to be sure, but those studies, which are duplicative to a large extent, are being funded at the expense of other important questions.  The same can be said for the over $223,000 to be spent over the next two years for two separate studies that will use functional MRI technology to measure cognitive changes during facial expression processing and social perceptions.  Yet another two-year study will use fMRI technology to study visual motion processing impairments in autistic adults.  (Indeed, fMRI must be the new toy of the moment as there are other studies using it as well.  The other pervasive theme is the proliferation of studies trying to create an animal model for autism.) One of the neuroligen studies is being conducted by Dr. Craig Powell at the University of Texas, who is also the recipient of another two-year grant trying to create an animal model for autism by studying a mutation of the PTEN gene.  I'm sure Dr. Powell's credentials are outstanding, but so are those so many other fine researchers who might want to look into the questions Autism Speaks said they wanted answered. The studies that may add something of substance to the issues of vaccine and mercury exposures, or environmental insults in general, are few.  Dr. Ivana Kawikova of Yale has been awarded $120,000 for a two-year study looking at the role that inadequate immune systems may play in the pathogenesis of autism.  Dr. James Briscoe received $59,948 for a one-year study of the impact of prenatal exposure to chemical tetrogens, including anti-seizure medications.    Another two-year study will look at neuroinflammation and the kynurenine pathway.  How did this one get funded?  I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact it is being conducted by Dr. Michael Vogel, who just last year served on  the panel that reviewed grant applications to NAAR . I'm glad that someone besides Boyd Haley and the Geiers will be looking at the role of testosterone in autism.  But the two-year study by Dr. John Gilmore at UNC (funded at a relatively modest $85,979) will look more at general influences testosterone levels may have on early brain development rather than the hypothesized synergy testosterone may have with particular environmental insults ( i.e. , mercury). Two separate studies will look at abnormalities in glutamate reception and transmission, but neither will look at the interplay with environmental insults.  Like so many of the researchers who are receiving the Autism Speaks grants, the focus will be solely on genetics. Autism Speaks is a noble idea on the part of Bob and Suzanne Wright.  I believe their intentions are good, and that they can do much good.  Unfortunately, their vision has been hijacked by those who would rather stick their heads in the sand than acknowledge that other models for autism exist. Debating the hypotheses of environmental triggers detracts from addressing the issues of what we can do to address the problem.  The greatest progress will come after we have found out \u23af with a reasonable degree of certainty \u23af whether we are right or wrong in believing that vaccines and heavy metals played a role in triggering autism in so many of our children.  Autism Speaks may yet surprise us all and be the organization that helps us determine the truth.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 25, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I often say that neither science nor law (my field) should be inscrutable.  But for scientific writing (or legal writing for that matter) to be understandable to lay people, it must make sense.   Dr. Martha Herbert , a pediatric neurologist, makes sense when she speaks or writes.  She is never one to overstate the case; indeed, she was one of the researchers who  asked to have her name removed  from a  Generation Rescue  advertisement lest her work be touted as definitive proof of a mercury-autism connection. Dr. Hebert\u2019s article,  Autism:  A Brain Disorder, or a Disorder That Affects the Brain? ( link to pdf here ), does not break any new ground, but it does clarify where we are and, more importantly, where we should be going.  In the piece, Dr. Herbert convincingly suggests that the scientific evidence now supports a departure from a \u201cstrongly genetic, brain-based\u201d model of autism in favor of a \u201cgenetically influenced, systemic\u201d model.  Her model seeks exploration of the interplay between brain connectivity issues and biological factors.  Somatic symptoms that some call \u201ccomorbidities\u201d are hypothesized to \u201cbe integrally related to what have been considered \u2018core\u2019 or defining symptoms, and both are likely to derive from the same or related underlying pathophysiology.\u201d      It is important to note that Dr. Herbert does not specifically identify mercury as  the  biological factor triggering the genetic predisposition.  Rather, her article references \u201cheterogeneous\u201d biological underpinnings.  That certainly matches my own opinion that autism is not dependent on thimerosal exposure, but thimerosal exposure may be a trigger or contribute to the development of autism.  Autism, again in my opinion, predated the introduction of thimerosal into vaccines, but the expansion of the vaccine schedule and the use of thimerosal are the primary factors in the skyrocketing numbers of diagnosed autism.  In other words, the fact that the development of autism in an individual does not mean it is not primarily responsible for the current epidemic (oh dear, there I go using the \u201cE\u201d word again). For a while now, those of us who believe that vaccines played a role in our children\u2019s autism have been split into three basic camps.  (This is a gross overgeneralization given the various permutations on the hypotheses, but I am culling it to three to keep this post manageable.) First is the group that believes thimerosal exposure to be the cause of autism, a view which is sometimes oversimplified into an equation of autism = mercury poisoning.  Those who doubt the vaccine connection ( i.e. , those that proclaim autism is totally genetic and that the unprecedented increase in diagnosed cases is due wholly to broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness) tend to lump anyone who disagrees with them into either this category or into some vague classification of \u201canti-vaxers.\u201d  Although admittedly controversial and not universally accepted, laboratory testing often indicates that mercury may not be properly excreted by some autistic children. The second group focuses more on the effects of MMR vaccinations and the development of enterocolitis.  The connection is easy enough to make given the gastro-intestinal problems many autistic children have.  Like the thimerosal hypothesis, there are laboratory findings \u23af again controversial and not universally accepted \u23af to suggest that live viruses are causing problems in these children. The third group, which I would place myself in, sees validity in both the thimerosal and MMR hypotheses, but don\u2019t believe either can give a full answer in isolation.  The key to understanding is to classify autism \u23af at least the form of autism we see in our children \u23af as an autoimmune disorder.  Although there is a genetic predisposition underlying everything, the actual autoimmune process in most children might start with mercury poisoning from thimerosal-laden shots (see the  recent study from the M.I.N.D. Institute ).  With the immune system damaged by the mercury, it becomes understandable how attenuated live viruses, particularly those given in combination and simultaneously with thimerosal-containing vaccines ( e.g. , my son received the MMR, polio, and DTP shots all in one visit to the pediatrician) can not only fail to create an immunity, but might also cause the kind of biological damage of which Dr. Herbert writes. As we learn more and more, this third hypothesis is getting more attention beyond the scientific community.  Witness the new articles in Dan Olmsted\u2019s excellent and thought-provoking \u201cAge of Autism\u201d series for UPI.  Like all of his articles, Mr. Olmsted is very careful to avoid representing his writing as scientific, but the questions he raises cannot be ignored.  His recent series entitled \u201cPox\u201d (see  here  and  here ) examines some of the results of a Merck-sponsored trial of the \u201cProQuad\u201d vaccine.  The ProQuad combines the MMR with a vaccine for chicken pox.  Some of the children on whom the vaccine has been tested, have developed autism.  The common thread among the children, other than they all reside in the area of Olympia, Washington, where the trials occurred, is that they all have a family history in which relatives had problems with chicken pox ( e.g. , multiple cases of the disease or the subsequent development of shingles) that might suggest a susceptible immune system. It may yet turn out that mercury is the only problem, or that the MMR is the only problem, or that vaccines are not involved at all and it is all genetics.  It would be far easier to believe any of those scenarios than to look at a multiplicity of possible environmental triggers acting on genetic predisposition.  Most of us, however, would rather reach the right answer.  Dr. Herbert\u2019s model provides a framework for finding the right answer.  And an answer that points to autoimune processes makes sense.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://neuro-oas.mgh.harvard.edu/childneurology/bios/herbert.html", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2005/11/general-confusion-and-nyt.html", "http://www.generationrescue.org/", "http://www.ifsh.org/EnvironmentalIllness/Autism-ABrainDisorderOrADisorderThatAffectsTheBrain.pdf", "http://tinyurl.com/m2ftu", "http://tinyurl.com/r47hb"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/04/moving-beyond-simplicty-toward-right.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t MOVING BEYOND SIMPLICTY TOWARD THE RIGHT ANSWERS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, June 05, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Last night (June 4th),  NBC\u2019s  Dateline  aired a short segment on chelation as a potential treatment for thimerosal-induced autism.  Although far from perfect, the piece was noteworthy for its overall balance.   Balance is something we\u2019re not always used to seeing from a national media that is overly dependent on advertising revenue from the pharmaceutical industry.  Along with the talking heads from the CDC and AAP telling us that we\u2019re so wrong to believe we\u2019re doing any good, however, NBC showed brief snippets of video evidence that recovery may be more than just a pipe dream (including a wonderful shot of Scott Shoemaker and his son who has come so far in so short a time).   Fifteen minutes (actually, a bit less) is too short a time to give a complete picture, but  Dateline  deserves a lot of credit for telling this story at all.  Below is the text of an email my wife and I sent to NBC. As the parents of an autistic child, we would like to thank NBC for presenting a fair and objective report concerning Dr. Jim Adams\u2019 study of chelation.  We are, quite frankly, not used to seeing such balance from the national media, and the staff of Dateline is to be commended for this report. The possible connection between vaccines and autism is far too complex an issue to be presented in such a limited amount of time, and your failure to mention several key points is therefore understandable.  That being said, the following should be noted. First, although parent-driven advocacy groups are at the spearhead of the political debate, the scientific debate includes physicians and researchers on both sides.  That is, the hypothesis of a connection between mercury and/or vaccines and autism has support within the scientific community. Second, it oversimplifies the issue somewhat to focus on thimerosal as a direct cause.  The fact is that ethylmercury not only causes direct neurological damage, but it can also harm immune systems in children to the point that there is an increased susceptibility to other environmental insults, including other heavy metals (such as lead) and even the attenuated live viruses found in vaccines that do not include thimerosal.  It could be said that the immune system in these children is overwhelmed.   Third, chelation should not be viewed as a cure-all in itself, but rather as one part of a complete biomedical approach to autism.  The decision to chelate can only be made after appropriate testing to ensure that metal toxicity is indeed a problem.  Moreover, chelating heavy metals in a child whose immune system is unable to excrete the chelated metal from the body may not do the job.  A complete approach takes into account the need for diet, supplementation of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and probiotics, and the introduction of glutathione.  Additional therapies may also be needed to attempt undoing any permanent damage imposed by the mercury or other heavy metals.   Fourth, our understanding is that Dr. Adams\u2019 study uses only DMSA as a chelator.  In fact, there are at least three different chelators (DMSA, DMPS, and EDTA) that are used with various delivery means.  Also, many physicians are employing natural chelators in children.  What is appropriate for one child may not be appropriate in another, which points to the need for further studies beyond the work Dr. Adams is doing.   As Dr. Adams implied in your report, it is perplexing why nobody has yet conducted the clinical trials so many parents want to see done.  A related question is why those who dispute the connection refuse to perform any clinical or biological studies that might shed light on the possible causal connection.  Instead, the Centers for Disease Control, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Pediatrics all rely on a handful of flawed epidemiological reports.  The primary study on which they rest their case, and the only one they cite that actually looked at populations and exposures in the United States, was termed by its lead author as a \u201cneutral\u201d study, indicating that no conclusions could be drawn and more study was required.  Somehow, our medical and scientific leaders have decided that \u201cneutral\u201d really means \u201cnegative.\u201d Finally, your report included a reference to chelation opponents bringing up the death of an autistic child as an argument against the procedure.  What was not mentioned was that the tragedy in Pennsylvania occurred not because a child was being chelated, but rather because the wrong chelating agent was used.  Instead of injecting the child with Calcium EDTA to chelate heavy metals, the treating physician, for reasons unknown, used Disodium EDTA, an agent designed specifically to chelate calcium.  The result was hypocalcemia, which resulted in the loss of a young life.  Although there are certainly many lessons to be taken from that incident, those lessons do not include an inherent danger of chelation performed according to appropriate protocols. Again, we would like to extend our thanks to NBC, the staff of Dateline, and Dr. Jim Adams.

I haven\u2019t had time to post anything meaningful lately because of other commitments, including fighting the good fight with the local school district (a fight that is sadly necessary even if the district we\u2019re fighting does, in general, a \u201cbetter\u201d job than the district we left last fall). I\u2019ve been working on a rather long series about Autism Speaks, and hope to have it posted soon.

If you haven\u2019t already done so, go  check out what she\u2019s been saying  about the controversial \u201cumbrella\u201d wannabe. In the meantime, I wanted to share some pictures a friend recently sent me that were taken at the \u201cTruth Is Coming To Light\u201d event, sponsored by the United Methodist Women\u2019s Division, at the Simpsonwood Retreat Center, and the \u201cSimpsonwood Remembered\u201d Rally, sponsored primarily by Moms Against Mercury, which took place outside the gates of the CDC. Both events commemorated the seventh anniversary of the Simpsonwood meetings, in which the infamous Verstraeten epidemiological study was magically  transmogrified from something that indicated a correlation between thimerosal-containing vaccines into a \u201cneutral\u201d study that has been incorrectly cited as proof that there is no connection. It has been stated that the transcripts from the meeting are not a \u201csmoking gun\u201d of a cover up, and that\u2019s true enough.  I would be surprised if any of the participants \u23af primarily representatives of the CDC, the vaccine industry, and other \u201cinsiders\u201d \u23af would have made a statement for the record that the truth needs to be buried.  I\u2019ll even go so far as to say that some of the participants may not have been motivated by evil intent.  But when one reads the transcript, one gets the sense that a combination of greed, incompetence, indifference, vanity, and arrogance led to the final report.  There were vested interests of various kinds, including financial and professional; the only interest not represented were those who felt their lives had been intruded upon by the vaccines.  At its most benign, the Simpsonwood meeting of seven years ago, and the resulting report, gives proof to the old adage that a camel is a horse that was designed by a committee.  Thanks to the friend who sent the pictures.  Although these were taken at a public gathering, if anyone depicted in these images does not want to be posted on this blog for any reason (even if you just don't want to be associated with me), email me through the link on the main page, and I will comply with your wishes. After a rally in Washington, a little over a year ago, I was prompted to write about  the representation of us all  by those who are able to make it to these events.  As I look at the pictures from the recent Simpsonwood events, I recall what I wrote then: I\u2019m not too concerned over the numbers. It is enough to know that for every person there . . ., there were many, many others who could not be there for one reason or another. There are a lot of us out here, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 28, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I got a lot of emails in the last couple of days telling me that I was being taken to task by a friend.  I use the word \u201cfriend\u201d without any touch of irony, as that is what I have considered  Kevin Leitch  since I started blogging.  Despite rather marked differences of opinions on some of the core issues I write about, and even words by either of us that the other would consider lapses of judgment, we have been able to maintain an air of cordiality between us.   In the last few months, Kev and I have not really communicated.  That is probably a sign of the decline in the level of discourse in the on-line world of autism that we have both moved away from the center.  I make no apologies for expressing my opinions honestly, and I certainly don\u2019t expect Kev to apologize for doing likewise.  Nevertheless, I think Kev crossed a line with a recent post, entitled  Indefensible And Unprotested . The point of Kev\u2019s post is that some of us, including organizations and individuals, have not spoken out enough on the killing of Katie McCarron and the use of extreme aversives at the Judge Rotenberg Center. I certainly understand the anger over the senseless and apparently criminal killing of an innocent child.  In  the only post I felt it necessary to write about the McCarron tragedy , I tried to make it clear that in the absence of evidence that Karen McCarron was unable to understand the moral consequences of her act \u23af not just that she thought that killing her daughter might be in some way justifiable, but that she had a complete lack of understanding that killing is wrong \u23af I would consider this to be murder.  And I expressed concern that there would be a use of this unspeakable act to further agendas: A child is dead because she was unable to defend herself from the one person she should have been able to trust more than anyone. She cannot defend herself from being used by any of us to further our various causes. Those words were sparked by the announcement that the Autism Hub bloggers were going to devote a day of posts to Katie McCarron\u2019s memory, but they were also intended to be a plea to those on  all  sides of any of the issues that divide us.  I have to say that many of the Hub posts were quite respectful and moving; others veered into agendas.  Those that used the death to make a point were not alone, though, as many in the press and in various corners of the web tried to connect this senseless act to a \u201clack of services.\u201d  That, as Katie\u2019s grandfather, Mike McCarron, has pointed out in several places, is rubbish.  Equally wrong, though, are efforts to use this death to make any other unrelated point.  In his post, Kev states: . . . To besmirch the memory of Katie McCarron by trying to empathise with her murdering mother and to try and absolve her and by implication blame the mainstream medical community is appalling. In fact, the reverse is almost certainly true \u23af the utter hopelessness that groups such as Autism Speaks like to foment are much more likely to have led to any depression Katie\u2019s murderer might\u2019ve had. And if she felt that vaccines caused her daughters autism then she long ago crossed the line into quackery.  In this case, fatal quackery.  There is still absolutely zero evidence that vaccines cause autism. Anyone \u23af and I mean anyone who has had a hand in perpetuating that myth bears some responsibility for the murder of Katie McCarron. . . . I want to clue these killer parents and those parents and groups who \u2018understand\u2019 killer parents into something: Your child is not your property. You have no rights over them.  You have an obligation to parent them, love them, feed them, clothe them, teach them and let them be who they are.  When you have a child, you put yourself last.  If your career suffers \u23af that\u2019s not their fault.  If you can\u2019t go out as much as you used to \u23af that\u2019s not their fault.  If money is a problem \u23af that\u2019s not their fault.  Stop transferring your unhappiness about the way your life has changed into excuses for killing, or understanding the killers of, children. As Kev well knows, and anyone else who has bothered to actually read what I write should know, I happen to believe that vaccines played a causative role in my son\u2019s autism, and I believe very strongly that I am doing the right thing in trying to reverse the effects of toxins that have triggered that condition.  But I agree that my child is not property.  I have no right over him, although I do have the right and obligation to make decisions on his behalf.  I carry out my obligation to parent him, to love him, to feed and clothe him, and to teach him.  He is who he is, and any recovery we may achieve from autism will not change that.  And he will remain who he is \u23af a loved and nurtured son \u23af in the unlikely event his recovery ceases tomorrow.  I put my son\u2019s needs ahead of mine.  My career has suffered; I don\u2019t go out very much; money is a problem; and I have  never  blamed my son for a moment.  That\u2019s not what this is about, and it\u2019s wrong to imply that it is. Mr. McCarron left a comment on Kev\u2019s blog that reads in part: . . . Katie was murdered.  Her situation is not about bio-meds vs. ABA, she was not given the opportunity to have any of those work or not work.  People can talk all they wish about the stress of being a care giver.  Katie\u2019s care givers were my son and my wife along with a number of other people in North Carolina, they cherish every moment they had with her. No little child should be murdered!  That can\u2019t be rationalized, excused or glossed over in any way.  People speak of the \u201ctoll of autism\u201d; I speak of the \u201ctoll of murder\u201d.  There will be a trial; the court will hear the truth. In his grief and out of the purest of love, Katie\u2019s grandfather is speaking the absolute truth.  I cannot conceive of any possible justification for this beautiful child being killed.  And to imply that everyone who thinks vaccines helped trigger their child\u2019s autism is to blame for an evil act is just plain wrong. I\u2019m still unsure if Kev is mad because I didn\u2019t single out for criticism the people who wrongfully use a child\u2019s death to further some vague agenda about lack of services unrelated to an unspeakable act, or if he is really mad that I preemptively asked that no agendas be furthered.   With regard to the Rotenberg Center affair, Kev said this: The NAA who regularly (and falsely) denounce good science and promote bad released a damp squib of an online petition and then fell totally silent on the issue. Safe Minds? Nothing. ACHAMP? Nothing. These, don\u2019t forget, are the people who call themselves the autism community. Seems to me like they care about one issue and one issue only. And how about the anti-mercury bloggers?  The grass-roots \u2018autism community\u2019. Adventures in Autism? Nothing. Injecting Sense? Nothing. Okay, let\u2019s start with the National Autism Association.   Although I can\u2019t say for sure who spoke out first, I read the NAA press release before I saw Kev write anything about the situation.  Here\u2019s what the \u201cdamp squib\u201d said: \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d says Wendy Fournier, President of the National Autism Association.  \u201cThere has to be a better way of addressing behaviors associated with severe autism and related disorders.\u201d The national group says regulations need to be in place to prevent aversive therapies.  \u201cWe\u2019re interested in talking to facilities such as the Rotenberg Center, and are willing to help in any way we can to replace these cruel therapies with something less aversive,\u201d says NAA Executive Director Rita Shreffler.  \u201cThese children simply cannot be subjected to these methods, and finding a better way should be the priority of these types of treatment centers.\u201d Maybe Kev doesn\u2019t think the NAA used strong enough language, but I think they made it quite clear that there is no place for cruel aversives to be used in any autism facility. As for SafeMinds and A-CHAMP, those organizations have a narrower purpose and are right to focus on their mission as organizations.  That is not to say that individuals affiliated with those organizations do not hold the same views as were expressed by the NAA or by Kev.   I might add that most of the commentary I have seen on the EoH list has been quite adamant that the methods used at Rotenberg were unacceptable.  I know Kev monitors the list, as he is never shy about mining comments he finds offensive to post for the world to see.  Yet he now is creating the impression that all anti-mercury/biomedical parents must think aversives are just fine and dandy. (I don\u2019t know that this is his intention, but it is surely what the tome conveys.) As for me, I must first point out that the fact I did not find it necessary to state support for an obvious conclusion (i.e., torture is bad) does not indicate I hold a contrary opinion.  But since it apparently must be said for me to maintain any kind of status as a blogger, yes, I am disgusted by the reports of what passes for \u201ctreatment\u201d at the Rotenberg Center.  I likewise think the Nazi movement was (and is) evil, that Idi Amin was not so nice a person, and that things are somewhat hairy in the Middle East these days.  I didn\u2019t think I needed to say any of those things, but apparently there are litmus tests to worry about.  As Ian Parker pointed out in his comments to Kev\u2019s blog, this attack is odd in that it isn\u2019t based on what anyone has said, but based on what isn\u2019t being said. For some reason, Kev \u23af whose site gets more visitors in an hour than a get in a day \u23af thinks I hold myself out as representing \u201cthe autism community.\u201d  I\u2019m part of an autism community, but I have never held out my opinions as being anything but my own evolving views.  Why would Kev think otherwise?  The answer is nothing short of mind boggling.  When a fellow blogger tried to point out that nobody was trying to represent themselves as being a community spokesperson, here was Kev\u2019s response as it related to me: I recently read a blog posts of Wade\u2019s where he described how \u2018Injecting Sense\u2019 stickers were being handed out at Autism One.  I don\u2019t know how much more one could do to promote onesself as a community venture than hand out what are to all intents and purposes \u2018membership badges\u2019. I\u2019m not sure how well the phrase will translate to the Queen\u2019s English where Kev lives, but down in my neck of the woods, the appropriate response to such absurdity is \u201cSay What?!?!?\u201d  For those who may have missed  the explanation , a friend showed up at Autism One with a handful of cute little stickers with a blog logo on them.  A few friends wore them in good humor, but we didn\u2019t go around handing them out to one and all; we didn\u2019t even have that many (although I still have a couple if you want me to send you one Kev).  It was not intended to promote the blog as a \u201ccommunity venture.\u201d  Hell, if we had tried to hand them out en masse, I fear what we would have heard a lot of would have been, \u201cBadges?  We don\u2019t need no stinking badges!\u201d That being said, a comment at Kev\u2019s blog by \u201cDad of Cameron\u201d correctly points out that I have used the first-person plural in a context in which I speak of commonly-held beliefs in the anti-mercury and biomedical sub-communities.  I think that\u2019s a fair comment in that I occasionally refer to broad opinions that define us as a sub-community (and please note that I am intentionally using the \u201csub\u201d prefix; no group can claim it is  the  autism community).  That does not mean I speak for all who fall into those sub-communities or that everyone agrees on all particulars.  And it certainly does not obligate me to comment on every single issue.  No, I have never had ambitions of being the arbiter of community standards or setting a community agenda.  But it strikes me that someone who is taking others to task for not expressing the \u201ccorrect\u201d views  is  trying to set the agenda and the standards for opinions.  That is not the Kev I thought I knew, the Kev who relished a good debate and who was able to acknowledge he did not have all the answers.  But that is the Kev who wrote that most recent post.   And Kev is not alone.  I, and others as well, have found ourselves to be increasingly under attack in various quarters.  After I left a comment (and to be sure, it was a very pointed comment) on another blog, someone noted that it was a very aggressive comment for someone who tried to project an air of balance.  My immediate response was that balance is highly overrated.  By my nature, my upbringing, and especially my training, I am inclined to see both sides of an argument, but that does not mean my opinions are neutral.   My inclinations have led me in the past to seek a dialog in the hope of focusing on what we all have in common.  If we can define those commonalities, we are far more likely to listen to each other on the issues on which we disagree.  Kev, among many, was active in that dialog, and for a while the discussion was productive.  For some reason, however, some feel that my willingness to explore the possible commonalities we have was an effort on my part to hide the fact that I am anti-mercury, that I am pro-biomedical, that I am a \u201ccurebie.\u201d  Those people seem to feel that it has only been recently that my \u201ctrue feelings\u201d on these subjects have emerged.  Whoever thinks that needs to go back and read some of my earliest posts.  I have never hidden my views, which have evolved but have never been neutral.   That I recognize autism to be a broader problem than mere mercury poisoning does not mean that I have not always believed thimerosal to be the single greatest contributor to the autism epidemic.  That I generally avoid most discussions of specific methods of treatments does not mean that I do not believe many such treatments have a place in the biomedical world.  But discussions of specifics do little to advance the policy discussions to which I am most drawn.  Autism is a unique condition to every autistic individual.  There are no one-size-fits-all responses. That dialog has fallen apart, in large part to the deaths of innocent children:  first  Abubakar Tariq Nadama  and now  Katie McCarron .  The other factor leading to the widening rift was the Autism Speaks video (about which like so many other issues, you will find a great diversity of opinion within the anti-mercury/biomedical sub-community).  If there is a central theme to the growing discord, however, it may be summed up in perceptions about one word:  acceptance. Although I would not ascribe this opinion to all who embrace the ideals of the neurodiversity or autistic pride movements, many seem to feel that parents turn to biomedical interventions because they can\u2019t accept their children.  That view was recently expressed in an  NPR report on the autistic pride movement , in which Jim Sinclair stated: \u201cWhat the rest of the world needs to know about autism is that it\u2019s not something that can be separated out from the person, it\u2019s part of the person.  And so you cannot meaningfully say I love my child but I hate the autism. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying I love my child, but I hate that she\u2019s a girl and I\u2019d like her to be a boy instead.  So when you\u2019re saying all of these things about how terrible it is that you\u2019ve lost a child and how much your child is a disappointment to you, and how much that you wish you had a different kind of child, we\u2019re hearing that.  And what we're hearing is that you don\u2019t want us and you want someone else instead.\u201d Again my response is \u201cSay What?!?!?\u201d  (Truth be told, I had another two-word phrase in mind, but prudence dictates a milder response.)  Nobody \u23af and I mean nobody \u23af has either the right or the ability to define my relationship with my children.   I accept my son and love him for who he is, and I would accept and love him if I had no belief that his autism could be cured/healed/mediated/reversed, etc.  I have never been embarrassed to be seen with him or be identified as his father.  I learned long ago that children \u23af autistic and neurotypical alike \u23af will follow their own path in life, so it is best not to have your own plans for their future.   I accept another truth though.   Autism can be (not always is, but can be) a disability.  It can stand in the way of an individual using all of the gifts with which he or she has been endowed.  If that is the case, it is no crime to attempt eliminating the disabling aspects of autism. I don\u2019t buy into any crap about the hopelessness of autism.   As the NAA puts it :  \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure, autism is not a hopeless diagnosis.\u201d I hope that in the near future a meaningful and respectful dialog can resume.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=389", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5488463", "http://www.nationalautismassociation.org/psa.php"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/06/absurdity-of-being-taken-to-task-for.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t THE ABSURDITY OF BEING TAKEN TO TASK FOR WHAT ONE DOESN\u2019T SAY\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, June 26, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      A  column in  The Times-Picayune , the local daily newspaper, caught my eye.  The writer, Lolis Eric Elie, wrote about two members of the Marsalis family of New Orleans.  Even the most casual music fan knows of the musical genius of Wynton and Branford Marsalis, and you might also know that their father, Ellis Marsalis is a renowned Jazz musician and educator.  This is a family that has always demonstrated hearts as big as their musical talent, but Mr. Elie\u2019s column wasn\u2019t about Wynto, Branford, or Ellis (at least not directly).   Instead, he wrote of another Marsalis brother, Delfeayo. Delfeayo Marsalis has had an outstanding career as a musician, and is certainly well known in his hometown and among jazz fans throughout the world.  If he is less famous than his brothers, it is probably due to Delfeayo\u2019s decision to live in New Orleans rather than go to New York, Los Angeles, or some other center of the music business.   All of the Marsalis family are known for \u201cgiving back\u201d to whatever community they are a part of, and Delfeayo is no exception.  Mr. Elie shines a light on the annual summer arts camp Delfeayo Marsalis runs for kids in New Orleans, something the city needs this summer more than ever.  And Mr. Elie also shines a light on part of Delfeayo\u2019s inspiration for wanting to help others:  his brother, Mboya. The fifth of Ellis and Delores\u2019 six boys, Mboya has autism.  While his other brothers played music and basketball, Mboya mostly stayed home, his development limited by the disease. \u201cA lot of what I find missing in our society is a lack of compassion.  Living with someone that you love and care about who has a handicap inspires that type of compassion and understanding,\u201d Marsalis said. \u201cI started working with kids at Children\u2019s Hospital when I was in high school.  I\u2019m sure that had something to do with Mboya.  I figured I could help out some kid in need,\u201d he said. I know exactly what Mr. Marsalis is saying about the lack of compassion.  Before learning about the world of ASD, I probably would have attempted compassion and understanding, but I don\u2019t think I would have actively sought to understand it.  That\u2019s to my shame.  But having an autistic child certainly brings understanding.  And I have not been shy about educating family and friends.   Loving someone with autism inspires a lot of feelings and a lot of responses.  Lately, the level of discourse among the greater autism community has grown quite nasty.  Some things have been said that I will probably have to write about in the next few days when I get a chance (blogging remains a distant priority after my family and my career).  Today, though, I will take comfort in the response of Delfeayo Marsalis to his brother\u2019s autism. ************************** UPDATE: The Marsalis family addressed a letter to the editor of  The Times-Picayune , in response to the column I discuss above.  I thought it appropriate to include their letter as a post script: Lolis Eric Elie\u2019s column on Delfeayo Marsalis, our fourth son, and his Uptown Musical Theater was very enlightening and inspiring.  However, his reference to our fifth son, Mboya, as having a \u201cdisease\u201d is a misnomer. Autism is not a disease.  At present, autism is considered a neurological disorder and, until further research, will remain somewhat of a mystery. With much courage, love, patience and dedication, we have seen our son slowly improve without the use of medication.  We have been on a \u201clong and winding road,\u201d to which we are sure all parents of autistic children can relate.

{"date": "Thursday, June 14, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n         Illustration courtesy of Lenny Schafer. There are names that elicit a visceral reaction at their mere mention.   Autism Speaks  has now claimed that distinction. It has come close to its goal of uniting the autism world; it is equally despised in both the neurodiversity community and the biomedical communities. I used to refer to AS as the \u201cPac Man\u201d of autism organizations, wandering around chewing and devouring all that strayed into their path.  A more apt characterization has come from Lenny Schafer (see illustration), who has likened AS to the fictional Borg.  For those who are not  Star Trek  fans, the Borg are a race that falls somewhere between carbon-based life forms and machines.  They roam the universe as a collective, \u201cassimilating\u201d everything and everyone they come upon.  If anyone dares to object to assimilation, the Borg arrogantly inform the objector that \u201cresistance is futile.\u201d And that has been the story of AS, assimilating NAAR and CAN, and telling the rest of us that \u201cresistance is futile.\u201d  We should simply get with the program and toe the AS line. Bob and Suzanne Wright started AS after their grandchild, Christian Hildebrand, was diagnosed as being autistic.  To give them credit, it was a positive step when one considers that people of power \u23af as the Wrights certainly are \u23af often go to great lengths to hide away autistic family members rather than publicly acknowledge their loved one. Recently, though, the Wrights seem more inclined to put a little distance between themselves loved ones:  specifically their daughter, Katie Wright (the mother of, and the one who lives with and cares for Christian every day).  Although she is always careful to make it clear that she is not a spokesperson for AS, Katie and Christian are in many ways the faces of the organization.  This is what Bob and Suzanne Wright had to say in that regard lately: Katie Wright is not a spokesperson for Autism Speaks. She is our daughter and we love her very much.  Many of Katie\u2019s personal views differ from ours and do not represent or reflect the ongoing mission of Autism Speaks.  Her appearance with David Kirby was done without the knowledge or consent of Autism Speaks. Autism Speaks is committed to finding the causes of and a cure for autism. We are proud of our scientifically based research programs, including those established by NAAR and CAN, and will continue to pursue them.  The members of our scientific advisory teams have impeccable credentials and we fully support them.  There is no question that genetics plays the leading role in autism and that environmental triggers are key issues for many children.  These areas, as well as biomedical treatments, need huge research support. Autism Speaks merged with NAAR because it believes in and supports its scientific mission, methods, and advisory board.  We are proud of the accomplishments of NAAR and grateful to the families and volunteers who created it.  They are a tremendously valued part of Autism Speaks.  We welcome input from volunteers and parents/guardians of children with autism of all ages, including adults with autism.  We apologize to our valued volunteers who were led to believe otherwise by our daughter\u2019s statement. Interestingly enough, the sentence about loving their daughter was not part of the statement when it was first posted to the AS site, but was added later. What prompted the statement was a two-hour interview Katie gave to David Kirby, which was videotaped and released by  F.A.I.R. Autism Media  (a 30-minute version is available for viewing  here ).  In the interview, Katie referred to both of her parents as \u201ccourageous,\u201d and she expressed unabashed pride in them.  There\u2019s absolutely no reason to believe that there is any lack of love between Katie and her parents, so the terse disavowal emanating through AS is rooted elsewhere. Just as she has done in other appearances, including her recent Oprah appearance, Katie made clear her belief that Christian\u2019s regression into autism \u23af and her vivid description makes clear that Christian regressed into and was not born with his autism \u23af  was triggered by vaccinations.  And she goes further by describing the progress Christian has made after biomedical interventions, and also by praising controversial figures like Dr. Andrew Wakefield.  That\u2019s going just a little too far for some in the AS camp even when it is made clear that those opinions are not expressed on behalf of the organization. In her interview, Katie hinted that the  shameful emphasis on genetic research to the near exclusion of environmental research by AS  thus far is solely due to the ongoing influence of the NAAR board, resulting from the merger between those organizations (i.e., the assimilation of NAAR by AS).  But is she perhaps being a little na\u00efve about her parent\u2019s views. Recently, Bob Wright gave an  interview  to  TV Week , commemorating his recent retirement as the head of NBC, and at the end of the session, he was joined by Suzanne so that the two could discuss their involvement with AS: TVWeek:  Is it a problem where throwing enough money at it will help us find out why this is happening so much, as well as helping these kids to live a life that\u2019s more independent? Bob Wright:  Well there\u2019s no question that money plays a good role here. Suzanne Wright:  Oh sure, look what it did for breast cancer and AIDS. Bob Wright:  You have to throw a lot of money at this.  There is money that\u2019s been invested here in genetic work, and I think most people who follow autism scientifically would suggest that genes have a great deal to do with both the cause and the cure.  The theory is if you can identify the genes then you\u2019re closer to being able to do something about them. ... But that\u2019s also a very, very expensive process.  And it takes a long time. And so it doesn\u2019t create the kind of hope for parents who currently have [autistic] children.  And our [job is to] balance that \u23af we have to try to help parents with children right now, but we have to help the community by zeroing in on the cause, and that\u2019s where genetic work becomes critical. Suzanne Wright:  I believe there\u2019s a cause, there's a genetic predisposition, but I believe there's an environmental factor going on here that\u2019s putting these kids over the top. Bob Wright:  While we believe the genes play a role in this, there\u2019s clearly all sorts of difference in these children.  So it\u2019s not like one set of genes, one set of kids.  The kids develop this in different periods and have different impacts, which clearly identifies there\u2019s some environmental experience that takes place that sets off some subset in these children.  And there has been almost no money spent.  And this is very tough scientific work to do.  It\u2019s epidemiology and everything.  There just hasn't been the motivation on the part of the [National Institutes of Health] or the part of the CDC to be able to do this, much less the funds.  And lastly, there is this issue of looking for biomedical markers, which is another way of saying let\u2019s move away from the gene search, let\u2019s look at conditions that we see and let\u2019s look at the children who have these particular conditions, how they differ from other children. ... Suzanne Wright:  Something happened to Christian.  Something happened to him. Bob Wright:  We\u2019re on a hunt.  We\u2019re going to be on a hunt for biomedical markers, which is not the same as a gene search. ... I think we\u2019re three or four years away from accomplishing quite a lot.  That\u2019s what I believe. Suzanne Wright:  And we got a lot accomplished already.  We got the Combating Autism Bill passed.  It was signed into law.  [And on March 20 Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., introduced the Expanding the Promise for Individuals With Autism Act of 2007.] ... We\u2019ve now merged with every major autism group in the country.  So we are the largest.  And I was just invited to Qatar by the princess and the amir because she is having a symposium over there for special needs children ... and over there it\u2019s taboo talking about this.  And so she\u2019s invited me to come over with the Ad Council because ... her people were most impressed with how broad the Ad Council campaign was over the last year and how much it spread across the country.  So ... I'm going over there with the Ad Council and we\u2019re going to give an hour of Power Point presentation.  She\u2019s going to let me show my movie.  Only three movies are going to be shown and mine\u2019s one of them. ... It's going to be very global, because it\u2019s a global problem. Mr. Wright clearly implies that environmental research can wait until we\u2019ve found a way to identify what children are specifically at risk.  In other words \u23af and his use of the term \u201cbiomedical markers\u201d cannot change this fact \u23af the focus of AS funding is genetic. So what\u2019s the problem there?  Why can\u2019t the groups who have not yet been assimilated just raise their own funds for environmental and biomedical research?  Unfortunately, sources of contributions are not endless, and AS has set itself up as the \u201conly game in town.\u201d   The message is clear; assimilate or be irrelevant.  It\u2019s one thing to be an \u201cumbrella.\u201d  It\u2019s another to turn off the pumps and let drown those you claim to serve. Next time, we\u2019ll look at the ruthlessness with which AS attempts to silence any dissenting views.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/RnHz_wTyR6I/AAAAAAAAACQ/7Y2LEhtX1Y8/s1600-h/borgspks.jpg", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://www.autismmedia.org/", "http://www.autismmedia.org/media15.html", "http://www.tvweek.com/special-reports/print-edition/?articleId=31726"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/06/arrogance-and-assimilation-part-1.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ARROGANCE AND ASSIMILATION, PART 1\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      Truly, one can tell a lot about someone by the company he/she keeps.  The same can be said for organizations.  The assimilation of NAAR by  Autism Speaks  was a little surprising to some who thought Bob Wright shared the family vision of an environmental trigger for his grandson\u2019s ASD.  Instead, AS not only took on the NAAR organization, but it handed over control over its research efforts to the absorbed NAAR.  Clearly, that was an assimilation of the like-minded. The subsequent assimilation of the inaptly named \u201cCure Autism Now\u201d organization (CAN) was far less of a surprise.  First, CAN seemingly shared the same mindset that we are far away from effective treatments.  But more to the point, the run-roughshod-over friend-and-foe-alike political style of the two organizations was too close for them to stay apart. A glaring example of that mindset occurred when the birds hatched from the Combating Autism Act came home to roost.  Congress decided to hold hearings to begin talking about how to appropriate the money that\u2019s authorized by the CAA, but at first it seemed that nobody was really interested in a wide range of opinions. On Tuesday, April 17th, a Senate hearing entitled \u201cCombating Autism: Undertaking a Coordinated Response\u201d was held.  Two separate panels of witnesses were scheduled.  The first (surprise, surprise) included Dr. Julie Gerberding, Director of the CDC, and Dr. Thomas Insel, Director of NIMH.  The second panel included a doctor involved with video-based behavioral treatments (oh yeah, that\u2019ll work) whose business is partly funded by NIMH, along with two representatives of Autsm Speaks:  its founder, Bob Wright, and celebrity spokesperson, Bradley Whitford.  Later, a representative from (the non-assimilated as of yet) Autism Society of America (ASA) was invited.  In other words, they rounded up the usual suspects. A couple of days before the hearing, something happened that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.  Word got out that there was going to be a hearing.  One of the people who help with  CAA Watch , the watchdog effort started by  A-CHAMP , heard about it and got the word to the right people.  Congressional offices were flooded, and A-CHAMP was given the opportunity to present written testimony.   I have not seen any transcripts yet, nor did I have a chance to watch any of the C-Span coverage, but I understand that Bob Wright may have actually mentioned the \u201cV\u201d word in his testimony and discussed the need to study biomedical interventions, including chelation.  Maybe he felt that it would behoove him to look open-minded in front of the relatively open-minded Chairman of the Committee, Senator Harkin.  Or maybe he just decided to appear a little more open, knowing that written testimony about non-genetic causes was going to come in ( go here for a pdf  of Robert Krakow\u2019s written presentation).  All we really know is that the official notice of the hearing was released at the very last minute.  That\u2019s par for the course.  But more disturbing was the fact that Autism Speaks did not see fit to make sure that other organizations \u23af including those that might view the vaccine controversy a little differently than it does \u23af got the word.   Autism Speaks has set itself up as the voice of the greater autistic community \u23af the big tent.  Taking on that role carries with it certain responsibilities, including the obligation to ensure that every voice is heard. Unfortunately, politics of that nature is nothing new to Autism Speaks or to CAN.   Passing the CAA  was not without a degree of backstabbing.  As you may recall, there was a consensus among several organizations regarding the need to pass the bill, and what it should say.  When it became clear that some of the Congressional sponsors were not going to tolerate the consensus language, battle lines were drawn.  Some of the organizations \u23af most notably  No Mercury  and  A-CHAMP  \u23af took a principled stand that no bill would be acceptable that failed to acknowledge that there is an open question as to the role that the nation\u2019s vaccine program may have played in the ongoing epidemic.   And what did the exercise of principle get those who stood tall for our children; the phrase that was tossed around by all quarters was that they \u201cwalked away\u201d from the table.  That was an odd phrasing inasmuch as I don\u2019t believe it is possible to walk away from a table to which you were not welcome. When it became clear that the Senate HELP Committee was not going to report the consensus bill, Robert Krakow, President of A-CHAMP, circulated an email to representatives of the other groups forming the autism consensus: The best way to address the vaccine issue is to leave it right in the bill, as we agreed. If the committee can justify a statement in the legislative record including vaccines as \u201cenvironmental,\u201d I do not understand the objection to leaving it in the bill  as we discussed .   [Emphasis added.]  One of the recipients of that email was Craig Snyder, a Board member of CAN, who apparently did not fully comprehend the difference between the buttons on his email browser marked \u201creply,\u201d \u201creply all\u201d and \u201cforward.\u201d  In any event, Mr. Snyder\u2019s response, which had apparently been intended for Elizabeth Emken of Autism Speaks but wound up going to others as well, was quite telling about where he came down on the question of maintaining unity among the consensus members: you\u2019ve got to sit on this guy...i think you should start by saying that his questions were discussed in the call he missed and he should inform himself before launching broadsides, then as i said before, i think we need another call How did all this come about?  A few months back, I asked Mr. Krakow (who I consider to be a friend) about it, and a series of emails resulted.  With his permission, I have weaved together some of those emails to tell the complete story of Mr. Krakow\u2019s role in the CAA soap opera. A-CHAMP and other groups were approached by CAN in the late summer of 2005. This was after CAN (Cure Autism Now), AS (Autism Speaks), and ASA (Autism Society of America) had a press conference in April \u201805 announcing the bill.  They never consulted us about their bill.  They said they had gotten feedback from Congress, that Congress was getting conflicting messages on the bill, and they wanted our support. I participated in several conference calls \u23af there were AS representatives and ASA reps too.  Most of us expressed our displeasure with the CAA.  After several meetings, they came back and started discussions to come up with a bill we could support \u23af a so-called \u201cconsensus\u201d bill.  We were surprised by this So around November \u201805, a consensus bill was produced that looked pretty good.  I immediately asked questions as to when it would be introduced and what was the process; and the pattern of getting no answers began in November and December \u201805.  I remember calling [Elizabeth Emken] and being given reassurances that the bill would be introduced.  But if the bill was not introduced, how real was it?  Or was it just a way to organize support for the real bill? I kept making inquiries throughout November to January about the bill and continued to receive reassurances.  On occasion I called the CAN representative and our A-CHAMP Congressional liaison did the same.  Then we observed lobbying activities by CAN, AS and ASA.  They publicized visits to Congress advocating for the \u201cCAA,\u201d yet the \u201cCAA\u201d in Congress was the original bill, not the consensus proposal.  This was obviously disconcerting to me.  Precisely what were we advocating? A series of emails occurred in February 2006.  I wanted to be persuaded that the revised consensus bill would be our \u201chighest priority,\u201d and I also wanted to know the status of the bill.     I eventually was persuaded that the bill was worth supporting.  A-CHAMP then was the first organization to send out action alerts. In March and April, we generated thousands of emails and faxes in support of the revised bill \u23af all based on continued representations by CAN that the revised bill was being considered in committee and would be introduced \u201csoon\u201d \u23af first March, then April.  I personally convinced many skeptical parents to support the revised bill.  I put my neck on the line by reporting the assurances that this was the bill that would be introduced in the Senate. Meanwhile we saw more reports of lobbying efforts.  We were not included, invited, informed, and in my opinion we were not wanted at those lobbying efforts.  I complained to my colleagues about the \u201cprocess.\u201d  We were excluded from the process and had no control.  All of our information was second- or third-hand. In March, David Kirby published a piece on Huffington Post titled \u201c Doctors Against Research ,\u201d in which he reported that the American Academy of Pediatrics (\u201cthe AAP\u201d) opposed the bill and was lobbying against it.  Yet it wasn\u2019t until a couple of months later, when I saw her at Autism One that Elizabeth Emken let me know that she was at the meeting at which the AAP lobbyists revealed their position on the CAA. In the keynote address at Autism One, I noted the historic nature of the CAA.  The autism community came together to support it and reached an historic consensus. What was important was the consensus and the unity, and not the bill itself.  For if we were truly unified we could get the bill we really wanted. So if for some reason the consensus bill was altered it was more important that we stay together as a community and come back the next time and get a better bill \u23af the one we want. At Elizabeth Emken\u2019s presentation at Autism One, I asked her what happened to the consensus bill.  She stated point blank that she knew of no reason why the consensus bill would not be introduced. In June, we got emails from Elizabeth Emken and others suggesting we should trust Senator Santorum and that the HELP Committee would make a floor statement clarifying that the call for environmental studies included an investigation into the role of thimerosal.  It was then that I questioned why the vaccine language couldn\u2019t be left in. It was a question that got no answer other than a strong rebuke. And the rest is history.  We got a flawed bill, and Autism Speaks cemented its place as the most visible \u23af and in its own view, the most important \u23af organization in the autism world. Let me make it clear that the CAA, itself is not the issue.  Nor can an organization be faulted for continuing its support of the CAA.  Many of the organizations ( e.g. ,  NAA ,  SafeMinds ,  TACA ,  Generation Rescue , and others) that continued to support the bill are great groups with the best intentions and fine records of cooperation.  They are worthy of support; Autism Speaks is not.   The point is that there must be room for disagreement among such organizations.  There must be a continuing dialog.  Autism Speaks, however, does not believe in dialog.  They wish to speak, and not listen. Next time, we'll look at where we are, where we're going, and why this matters even if you don't believe in the vaccine hypothesis.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://caawatch.org/", "http://www.a-champ.org/", "http://www.a-champ.org/HarkinSenateHearing41707/A-CHAMP-Harkin(Krakow)4-17-07.pdf", "http://www.nomercury.org/", "http://www.a-champ.org/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/doctors-against-research_b_17726.html", "http://www.nationalautismassociation.org/", "http://www.safeminds.org/", "http://www.tacanow.com/", "http://www.generationrescue.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/06/arrogance-and-assimilation-part-2.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ARROGANCE AND ASSIMILATION, PART 2\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, November 18, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      There was an old comedy routine called \u201cThat\u2019s good/that\u2019s bad,\u201d in which a comic says something that sounds like bad news.  When the straight man say\u2019s \u201cthat\u2019s bad,\u201d and the comic then explains why it\u2019s really good news.   But then when the straight man thinks it\u2019s good news, the comic takes a turn and it\u2019s bad again.  I\u2019ve been think about that routine lately while thinking about the continuing saga of the Combating Autism Act (\u201cthe CAA\u201d).  The twists and turns just won\u2019t stop in this story.  And politics has turned something that should be uniting the greater autism community into a wedge. Let\u2019s review how we got here. In the late night hours of August 3, 2006, when only the hardiest political junkies were watching C-Span, the United States Senate approved S. 843, the \u201cCombating Autism Act.\u201d  The approval was unanimous; after all, what Senator wants to be on record as opposing efforts to \u201ccombat\u201d a disability affecting so many American families?  Some corners of the autism community joined with the Senate in calling for celebration and praise.  One can well imagine similar glee being expressed by the citizens of ancient Troy as they accepted a large wooden horse left behind by Greek invaders.  And a closer look at what went on reveals the bill to be a Trojan Horse. In the \u201ccolloquy\u201d (a prepared script performed by legislators prior to voting, designed to illuminate their intentions), Senator Michael Enzi, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (or \u201cHELP\u201d) Committee, thanked various senators and staff members who had worked on the bill, and then turned his attention to others: I also want to thank the various groups and individuals who work on behalf of individuals and families affected by autism spectrum disorder.  I appreciate the way in which this community of advocates has come together to work with me and my colleagues on this.  If they had not worked together so well \u23af with each other and with us as our Committee worked on this bill \u23af I doubt we would be here today. Indeed, various research and advocacy groups had worked hard to encourage legislation that would address a growing crisis.  After it became clear that the bill, as originally introduced, would not represent a change for the better, 21 organizations, with varying agendas, came together to help craft a revised bill to address a broad spectrum of needs for research and services.  The consensus revision was not perfect, but it represented such a positive step forward that the 21 groups agreed to come together as one and endorse the proposal.  All indications from the Senate led to a belief that the bill would emerge from the HELP Committee in substantially the same form as the consensus revision, and the 21 organizations worked hard to garner support for the bill.   Shortly before the bill emerged from the HELP Committee, it became clear that the language the Senate would vote on did not include some of the most important parts of the consensus revision.  Three of the endorsing organizations \u23af A-CHAMP (Advocates for Children\u2019s Health Affected by Mercury Poisoning), Moms Against Mercury, and No Mercury \u23af decided that principle allowed them to support only the consensus bill rather than what emerged from the Committee. The CAA directs the Director of the National Institute of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d), acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to \u201cdevelop and implement a strategic plan for the conduct and support of research related to autism spectrum disorder.\u201d   Of course, the NIH is not known to have an open mind on the principle issue in the autism community:  do vaccines and/or any component part such as thimerosal, play any role in the triggering of autism spectrum disorders.  The Institute of Medicine (\u201cIOM\u201d), which is part of the NIH, examined the issue, at the behest of the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d).  The IOM Committee working on the question, rushed to a conclusion, before much of the biological evidence was ready for consideration, and it ignored other biological evidence.  Instead, the IOM relied on flawed epidemiological studies, and concluded that there was no proof of a causal link, and that research efforts should be directed to other issues. Therefore, assigning the job of investigating the hypothesized link between vaccine components and autism spectrum disorders to the unbridled discretion of the NIH makes little sense.  And the NIH\u2019s discretion in directing research under the Combating Autism Act will indeed be broad. The CAA would authorize federal spending, \u201csubject to the availability of appropriations,\u201d for the NIH Director to support \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d for research, environmental research, and epidemiology.  With regard to the second category, the Act, if passed, will authorize spending, again \u201csubject to the availability of appropriations,\u201d for centers of excellence to \u201cconduct basic and clinical research of a broad array of environmental factors that may have a possible role in autism spectrum disorder.\u201d  Note the narrow language, as opposed to the consensus bill, endorsed by the 21 organizations, which defined the scope of that research as being \u201cpossible environmental causes of and risk factors for autism and the mechanisms by which they may lead to autism, and the developmental effects of environmental agents that may be associated with autism, including but not limited to vaccines, other biological and pharmaceutical products, and their components (including preservatives).\u201d It may sound like the idea behind such research is to look into environmental factors such as vaccine components to determine whether a link exists, but it seems that all environmental factors are not created equal.  Because the statutory language does not specifically include vaccine components as being an environmental factor, we must look to the Report by the HELP Committee and the Floor Colloquy to determine the legislative intent.  The Report sheds no light whatsoever; it contains 8,953 words, none of which are \u201cvaccine,\u201d \u201cpreservative,\u201d \u201cmercury,\u201d or \u201cthimerosal.\u201d The Floor Colloquy, on the other hand, manages to shed light in all directions.  Senator Enzi, speaking for the HELP Committee, was asked to directly address the vaccine connection, but he was anything but direct.  He finished by saying that \u201cno research avenue should be eliminated, including biomedical research examining potential links between vaccines, vaccine components, and autism spectrum disorder,\u201d and that \u201c[n]o stone should remain unturned in trying to learn more about this baffling disorder.\u201d  But before saying that, he noted that: \u2026 In 2004 the Institute of Medicine\u2019s Immunization Safety Review Committee concluded that the body of epidemiological evidence \u201cfavors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder\u201d and also \u201cfavors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder.\u201d  The IOM committee also found that \u201cpotential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism spectrum disorder that have been generated to date are theoretical only.\u201d \u2026 I agree with the IOM committee\u2019s recommendation that \u201cavailable funding for autism spectrum disorder research be channeled to the most promising areas.\u201d  The HELP Committee reported this bill without making the determination for the autism spectrum disorder research community of what are the \u201cmost promising areas\u201d for investigation.  Instead, the bill reported by the HELP Committee contemplates key research activities, including environmental research, that focus on a broad range of potential contributing factors, with meaningful public involvement and advice in setting the research agenda.   Even as he advocated leaving no biomedical stones unturned, Senator Enzi stated that \u201cthere is currently no expectation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should further pursue additional epidemiological research regarding the link between autism spectrum disorder and vaccines or vaccine components, unless new biomedical research provides additional information about specific at-risk subpopulations.\u201d While Senator Enzi may not want to leave any stones unturned, and he \u201chopes\u201d that the NIH will direct research into the role of vaccines and thimerosal, those wishes may not translate into specific action, given the recorded wishes of the Senate that funding should go to the most promising areas.  In other words, the NIH is free to consider biological research in this area a low priority because epidemiological studies do not demonstrate a clear link, and no further epidemiological studies, regardless of how well-designed they may be, will be funded until further biological evidence is presented.   One way to ensure that the NIH Director acts in the public interest rather than a separate agenda would be to add transparency to the process.  One of the provisions jettisoned from the consensus proposal would have mandated the NIH Director to \u201cprovide for a means through which the public can obtain information on the existing and planned programs and activities of the National Institutes of Health with respect to autism and through which the Director can receive comments from the public regarding such programs and activities.\u201d  Right now, the only means of any public input or oversight will come through the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (\u201cIACC\u201d), and that does not bode well for any meaningful participation. The IACC, created by the Act to coordinate the Director\u2019s duties, will include some public participation, but only one member is required to be an autistic individual; only one member must be a parent; and only one member is required to be a representative of a \u201cleading research, advocacy, and service\u201d organization.  Discarded from the consensus proposal was a provision for an additional Autism Advisory Board, which would have consisted of twelve professionals and eight \u201cindividuals representing organizations from the autism community.\u201d  That body would have provided more diversity of opinions, and would have come closer to assuring an effective watchdog over the setting of a research agenda.  Without the Autism Advisory Board, there will be far less transparency. The CAA further mandates that the Secretary (again acting through the NIH) \u201cpromote research, through grants or contracts, to determine the evidence-based practices for interventions for individuals with autism spectrum disorder or other developmental disabilities, develop guidelines  for  those  interventions,  and disseminate  information  related  to  such  research  and guidelines.\u201d  In other words, the government will determine what physicians and therapists can and cannot do, and what health insurers will pay for. So the CAA, as passed by the Senate was no great bargain.  And the various subcommunities of the greater autism community that once united behind it splintered.  Those who opposed it still opposed it.  But those who had supported it were split into three groups:  those who still think it is the greatest piece of legislation in the history of the republic; those who feel that even a flawed bill was better than no bill; and those who believe that the dangers of the bill outweigh the benefits.  I happen to fall into the last group \u23af the group that prefers to call the statute by the name Dr. Bernard Rimland coined:  \u201cThe Pretending to Combat Autism Act.\u201d With that background, the CAA moved to the House of Representatives.  Enter Congressman Joe Barton.  Barton, as most of you know, was the Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which drew the assignment of considering the CAA.  The only thing was that there would be no consideration at all.   Joe Barton pulled a power play and decided there would be no hearings scheduled unless the Senate passed a pet bill of his called \u201cThe National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006.\u201d There are two ironies to Mr. Barton\u2019s stance.  One irony is that the bill he wants to push through is not a reform measure at all.  In the name of efficiency and transparency, the NIH would be freed from any legislative oversight.  It smacks of what I like to call \u201cOffitism,\u201d which can be defined as a philosophy holding that scientific matters of public interest are best determined without public input because most of the public (i.e., us) are just too damned stupid to understand that sacrifices need to be made. The second irony is that \u23af in the view of some of us \u23af Rep. Barton did us a favor by delaying the steamroller that the CAA had become.  It\u2019s not that he wanted to help anybody in the autism community; Barton\u2019s antipathy toward at least some parents of autistic children has already been documented elsewhere.  And yet he did us a favor by giving us another chance to look within the big wooden horse. Of course, the recent elections have changed everything in Congress.  The latest word is that Rep. John Dingell will take Barton\u2019s place as the Chair of the Committee.  Does that necessarily mean anything?  Well, maybe and maybe not.  Mr. Dingell has a good reputation for being open-minded on issues such as this.  On the other hand, Democrats in general have a blind fondness for the vaccination program.  Much will depend on whether the new \u201cins\u201d become convinced that a lot of people care about finding the truth. And don\u2019t count Joe Barton out of the picture just yet.  He is still the committee chairman during this lame-duck period, and he doesn\u2019t want to come off as being quite so lame.  He has been involved in negotiations to get the bill passed on his watch, perhaps in an attempt to defuse criticism that might damage his bid for the minority leadership of the House.  Considering what already happened to the bill in the Senate, I shudder to think what might result from further negotiations. I also shudder that some voices in the autism community are so anxious to get any autism bill NOW, that they are willing to settle for just that:  ANY autism bill.  We\u2019ve waited years to get to the point where politicians are willing to make autism their issue.  Can\u2019t we wait a little longer to make sure we get something that will help prove \u23af or disprove \u23af the hypothesis that vaccines may contribute to triggering autism, instead of settling for a mechanism designed to bury the issue?  Most members of Congress will not examine the issue enough to truly understand the potential for good or ill unless they are given more time.  But many activists and politicians are determined to throw more coal into the boiler of a runaway locomotive.  They\u2019re all anxious to stand behind the president as the CAA is signed into law so they can get into the picture.  Some in our community seem to think that supporting this \u201ccompromise\u201d will help them get a \u201cseat at the table.\u201d  I hope that works, and I hope they\u2019re not relegated to the children\u2019s table off in the corner of the room.  I hope they get a real seat because we\u2019re going to need all the eyes and ears we can get. If the CAA passes in its present form (or, heaven forbid, an even more watered down version), the only hope we\u2019ll have of seeing a push for an honest look at the issue will be constantly reminding the politicians and bureaucrats that we\u2019re out here keeping an eye on them \u23af that we\u2019re everywhere, and we\u2019re not going away any time soon.  One of the staunchest supporters of the CAA, Diedre Imus, served such a notice on Senator Santorum, who appeared on Don Imus\u2019 show to pat himself on the back after the CAA passed the Senate.  Despite her continued support for the bill, Ms. Imus made it quite clear to Senator Santorum that people actually paid attention to what was said and done, and that many of us are not happy about the hypocrisy that was shown. It will take a lot of watching to add any semblance of transparency to the processes that will arise from the CAA.  There is no congressional mandate to take an honest look at the vaccine issues, and the opportunity for real public input and oversight was written out of the bill.  That input and oversight must come up from the people.  After the CAA passed the Senate, A-CHAMP announced the formation of \u201cCAA Watch,\u201d which will attempt to do just that:  keep a watch on the government-sponsored activities spawned by the CAA.  That gives us a little hope, but wouldn\u2019t it be better not to have to rely on that hope?  Wouldn\u2019t it be better to just get the bill right in the first place?  There\u2019s still a window of opportunity.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/11/whats-in-horse-or-politics-as-usual.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WHAT\u2019S IN THE HORSE, or POLITICS AS USUAL\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, April 06, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      A few days before leaving office in January 1961, outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower (who had more than a little experience with military affairs) warned his country of the dangers posed by a new world.  Crises there will continue to be.  In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties.  A huge increase in newer elements of our defense; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research \u23af these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel. But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration:  the need to maintain balance in and among national programs \u23af balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and hoped for advantage \u23af balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration. . . . This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence \u23af economic, political, even spiritual \u23af is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government.  We recognize the imperative need for this development.  Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.  Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.  We should take nothing for granted.  Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. President Eisenhower went on to broaden that warning to the coming technological revolution that had been born of the war efforts of the 1940s.  Specifically, Ike said: The prospect of domination of the nation\u2019s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.  Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite. It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system \u23af ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society. Alas, statesmanship ain\u2019t what it used to be.  Time and again we see that any time large and powerful industries become too closely associated with government policy making, the lines between entities becomes obscured and it becomes difficult to tell who is actually formulating public policy. A  recent  60 Minutes  story  on CBS, gave us a little glimpse at how the pharmaceutical industry pushed through the Medicare prescription drug bill a few years back, which effectively prohibits the federal government from trying to use the clout of the Medicare system to get lower prices for drugs.  That little provision, which costs the American taxpayers billions of dollars, was pushed through by concealing actuarial figures and deft legislative maneuvering.  And the government point people who aided the industry were rewarded.  Tom Scully, the administration\u2019s Medicare chief who negotiated the bill, soon left the government for a lucrative position with a Washington law firm where he is a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies.  As for one of the Congressional point persons, Representative Billy Tauzin from Louisiana soon left Congress to accept a job as president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).  Of course, Billy says he did it out of gratitude for the drugs that helped him beat cancer, but I\u2019d bet the $2,000,000 annual salary that went with the job might have helped convince him. As was noted in the CBS story, there is currently legislation pending to require the federal government to negotiate lower rates for drugs covered by Medicare, just as they do for other health-care services.  What are the chances that provision will become law?  Well, even if it gets through Congress, President Bush has promised to veto it.  As Representative Dan Burton said of the pharmaceutical lobby:  I mean, they \u2014 they have unlimited resources.  Unlimited, and when they push real hard to get something accomplished in the Congress of the United States, they can get it done. The only surprise about the  60 Minutes  story was that it made it on the air at all.  One rarely sees such objective reporting about an industry that spends millions of advertising dollars.  To be fair, regulators occasionally show concern about the blurry lines in health-care policy between government on the one side and the Big Pharma/Big Health crowd on the other.  The  Washington Post  recently reported  on inquiries into the conduct of 103 scientists with links to pharmaceutical companies while they were employed at the National Institutes of Health.  Of course, it\u2019s a little premature to say that anything will come of it, as the \u201cinspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, said his office is looking into the cases \u2018to determine whether investigation is warranted.\u2019\u201d  It\u2019s worth noting that even those preliminary steps of inquiry are only happening because members of Congress \u23af who may be a little more sensitive to appearances of impropriety than is a lame duck administration \u23af have insisted that something needs to be done.  Apparently, there is a suspicion that the NIH is neither adept nor aggressive in policing itself. Of course, the undue influence of private entities upon public policy is not restricted to Big Pharma/Big Health Care crowd.  Recently,  Leonard Pitts, the great columnist for the  Miami Herald , addressed the rampant conflicts of interest  that plague health and science policy making in the Bush Administration. After 2002, when a National Cancer Institute statement reporting no link between abortion and breast cancer was changed by the Bush administration to say evidence of a link was inconclusive, after the administration cut language on global warming from a 2003 report by the Environmental Protection Agency, after a government scientist was forbidden in 2001 and 2002 from discussing health hazards posed by airborne bacteria emanating from animal waste at large factory farms, after 60 scientists \u23af 20 of them Nobel laureates \u23af signed a statement in 2004 accusing the White House of manipulating and distorting science for political aims, after all that, Team Bush has once again been caught censoring science it dislikes. I refer you to this week's testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The committee produced paperwork documenting many dozens of instances in which the former chief of staff of the White House Council on Environmental Quality edited scientific reports on global warming. He cut definitive statements and replaced them with doubtful ones in order to portray climate change as something less than the settled science most experts consider it to be. And what connections with industry tainted the Administration\u2019s actions in the case of that global warming report?  The official responsible for the \u201cediting\u201d came to the White House from a position with the American Petroleum Institute, the industry\u2019s lobbiest.  Then, not long after his \u201cediting\u201d on the report, the official left government to go work for the most major of major oil companies. The incidents highlighted by Mr. Pitts are all-too-common, and yet nothing ever seems to be done.  The prevailing attitude among the offenders is that they know what is best for us by virtue of their expertise derived by being an insider.  That leads to an insufferable arrogance.  As Mr. Pitts wrote, the danger of too close a tie between the regulators is bad policy, but another result is an erosion of public trust in the very institutions that should protect us: I could give you many reasons this makes me angry. I could speak about the people\u2019s right not to be propagandized by their own government. I would point out that this facts-optional approach shreds the government's credibility. But here\u2019s what really burns my toast: These people think I\u2019m stupid. And they think you\u2019re stupid, too. What else can we conclude of a government that treats us with such brazen disdain? They think we\u2019re a bunch of doofuses, dimwits and dolts who will never notice that they\u2019ve placed the interests of their cronies above our own. For the record, I am not stupid and I resent being treated as if I am. It can\u2019t be stated better than that.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/ytolh8", "http://tinyurl.com/2of9rn", "http://www.miamiherald.com/285/story/50043.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/04/were-from-government-and-were-here-to.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WE\u2019RE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WE\u2019RE HERE TO HELP YOU (or Is It Still Paranoia If They\u2019re Really Out To Get You?)\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Monday, April 09, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      There are some people in this world who don\u2019t need to use both names to be identified.  Oprah is one of those people.  She has so woven herself into our culture that the \u201cWinfrey\u201d part of her name has become superfluous.  She\u2019s that big a deal.  That\u2019s why there was so much anticipation last week leading up to Oprah\u2019s first-ever show on autism.  When the guest line up for the show was announced, it became clear that the episode was not going to focus on cause or controversial treatments, but rather on the challenges of raising autistic children; in other words, it was to be yet another attempt at raising \u201cawareness.\u201d  But one of the guests was to be Katie Wright-Hildebrand, which fueled speculation that something just might get uttered that is usually missing from mainstream media:  the \u201cv\u201d word. As most of us are aware, Katie (who has just about become a one-namer in autism circles) is the daughter of former NBC head, Bob Wright.  After Katie\u2019s son, Christian, was diagnosed with autism Bob and Suzanne Wright founded  Autism Speaks , which has rapidly become the Pac Man of autism organizations, swallowing up other organizations in its path.  Although it would be nice to have a single organization that would have a broad-enough outlook to be a clearinghouse, many of us feel that AS does not speak for us.  Indeed, mistrust of AS seems to be one of the only views held in common by members of the neurodiversity and biomedical communities. In any event, it has been the most open of secrets that Katie and her husband, Andreas Hildebrand, believe that vaccinations may have helped trigger their son\u2019s autism, and that they were utilizing biomedical treatments to treat him.  Those views do not seem to fit in neatly with the official AS party line, and Katie did not say much about the issue when making any appearances.  Lately, however, there were a few rumblings that came close to being public pronouncements.  Then came word that Katie was joining the boards of both the  National Autism Association  and  SafeMinds , two organizations that generally share Katie\u2019s opinions on vaccine damage and effective treatments.  Those developments fueled anticipation of Katie\u2019s appearance on Oprah, and one question hovered all over the net:  would she say it. I got the call at work.  My wife happened to be home and was able to watch the show.  My wife was nearly in tears with excitement as her words came over the phone:  \u201cShe said it!\u201d It almost didn\u2019t get said.  And as we later learned, it would not have been said if the producers had their way.  But in the front of the audience, being used as a resource, was Dr. Anshu Batra, and Oprak asked her about causation.  While the doctor (reluctantly it appeared) agreed that \u201cenvironmental\u201d causes may play a role in causation, she flat-out stated that science \u201chas refuted\u201d any connection with vaccines.  Dr. Batra didn\u2019t say that \u201cofficial\u201d reports (fatally flawed reports at that) failed to find a connection, which would have been more accurate but les dramatic; she said it in away to create the impression the connection had been disproved. And the rest, as they say, is history.  Katie asked, and Oprah let her \u201copen the can.\u201d  See for yourself the video showing how it all happened  here .

Sadly, not everyone in the world gets it, and maybe a little awareness training is still needed out there. A  recent post at Mommy Guilt  shows that sometimes the ones who should be \u23af and need to be \u23af most aware are the most in need of a little education.  It seems that something set off a six-year old autistic child in Hawaii, and he attacked a special-ed teacher. (At least that's the school's story, and I'm sure they're sticking to it.) What could have set off the child?  Who knows, but the school was obviously not particularly adept at working with autistic youngsters: Ho\u2019okena School, as well as the teacher and the District Superintendent are well aware of this child's violent outbursts. In the past, he was moved out of a summer school class because he attacked other students. Prior to jumping on his teacher, he was removed from his current classroom because the staff was worried he would hurt himself or others, and kept him in time-out from 10:55 a.m. until his mother picked him up at 2:00 p.m. The school has been asked repeatedly to at the very least provide a one-on-one aide that is trained in the art of dealing with autistic children, or move him to a school for autistic children. But all is okay (not).  The school \u201ccontends they can handle him.\u201d  And how was the most recent incident handled?  The police read the child his Miranda rights and he was arrested on Assault charges.  Now what do you suppose was going through a six-year old autistic\u2019s mind as that bizarre scene unfolded before him? As for the teacher, she has obtained a Temporary Restraining Order against the mother and the child.  Oh yes, that order will certainly stop a repeat incident. Legal action will not do anything; this child needs assistance \u23af from someone who understands the particular challenges facing an autistic child \u23af to be able to get something of value from the educational system.  In this case, the only one who understands this is the child\u2019s mother: I am at a loss as to what to do. I feel my son needs help, not punishment, and he needs it now, as the window of opportunity to help him is running out. And the school \u201ccontends they can handle him.\u201d  The child doesn\u2019t need handling; the problems the child has need handling.  But they can\u2019t handle what they don\u2019t understand.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_v1n1u-3piIc/RetCTQnYh4I/AAAAAAAAAAU/X8aV2h5zxCk/s1600-h/ribbon.jpg", "http://mommyguilt.blogspot.com/2007/03/can-they-do-this.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/03/awareness-needed.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t AWARENESS NEEDED\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Sunday, March 18, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      Like many people, I have been following with interest the continuing story about the introduction of the Garadasil vaccine.  Gardasil is a vaccine designed to prevent some strains of the humanpapilloma virus (\u201cHPV\u201d), which some scientists say may contribute to the development of cervical cancer.  Although I have been aghast at the marketing of the vaccine as a cancer preventative (I guess it\u2019s much easier to sell to the public than calling it a vaccine for viruses that are most commonly spread through unprotected sex), I have not weighed in on the debate until now.  First, the debate doesn\u2019t directly address the issue of autism causation, although any part of the vaccine program is related to some extent.  Primarily, though, I was a little timid about being labeled an \u201canti-vaxer\u201d (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that) simply because I would like to see a little sanity \u23af some sense, if you will \u23af \u201cinjected\u201d into the way we vaccinate our children. Now it seems that my concerns are shared not just by a bunch of crazy parents, but also by a staunch proponent of the vaccine program \u23af someone who helped in the development of Gardasil and who believes it to be a \u201cgood\u201d vaccine that \u201cwill save a huge number of lives around the world.\u201d The  story comes courtesy of Kim Stagliano\u2019s blog .  Kim posted the complete article, which appeared in an Indiana paper because she correctly assumed that the media would, by and large, ignore the issue.  Indeed, only a handful of local outlets are showing any interest at all. Dr. Diane M. Harper, the director of the Gynecologic Cancer Prevention Research Group at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth Medical School, calls it \u201csilly to mandate vaccination of 11- to 12-year-old girls.  There also is not enough evidence gathered on side effects to know that safety is not an issue.\u201d  Instead, Dr. Harper believes that \u201cthe ideal way of administering the new vaccine is to offer it to women ages 18 and up.\u201d This is a scientist who has devoted her life to studying the more than 100 strains of HPV.  Much of her recent work for vaccine study has been funded through Dartmouth in part by both Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline.  Merck, of course, is the manufacturer of Garadasil, which reportedly protects against four strains of HPV, two of which are considered to be cancer-causing viruses.  Glaxo\u2019s vaccine, Cervarix, which targets the two cancer-causing strains, is expected to be on the market by 2008. As the director of an international clinical trial for these vaccines, and as author of lead articles about the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness, Harper has been quoted widely as saying this vaccine could have enormous potential to eradicate the great majority of cervical cancers. Picking up on this, but before the trials were even completed, major news media and women's advocacy groups began trumpeting the vaccine as an answer to cancer of the cervix.  Once it was approved by the FDA and ACIP, Women In Government (WIG), a non-profit organization comprised of female state and federal legislators, began championing Merck\u2019s vaccine in their home states, with many of the ladies introducing legislation that would mandate the vaccine for 11- and 12-year-olds. Dr. Harper\u2019s criticism is based on solid ethical and pragmatic principles that even the most ardent supporters of vaccines would have difficulty refuting: \u201cThis vaccine should not be mandated for 11-year-old girls,\u201d she reiterated.  \u201cIt\u2019s not been tested in little girls for efficacy.  At 11, these girls don\u2019t get cervical cancer \u23af they won\u2019t know for 25 years if they will get cervical cancer. \u201cAlso, the public needs to know that with vaccinated women and women who still get Pap smears (which test for abnormal cells that can lead to cancer), some of them will still get cervical cancer.\u201d The reason, she said, is because the vaccine does not protect against all HPV viruses that cause cancer \u23af it\u2019s only effective against two that cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers.  For months, Harper said, she\u2019s been trying to convince major television and print media to listen to her and tell the facts about the usefulness and effectiveness of this vaccine. \u201cBut no one will print it,\u201d she said. It\u2019s easy to speculate as to the reasons the media seems disinclined to trumpet this tale.  First, the news organizations were so quick to jump on the \u201cmedical miracle\u201d bandwagon after Garadsil\u2019s release was announced that they may be a bit reluctant to admit that they so easily fall victim to aggressive marketing.  Moreover, it\u2019s no secret that Merck and Glaxo are major sources of revenue for various media outlets.  One only has to open a newspaper or magazine, or turn on the television news, to confirm that. And make no mistake about it.  The push by many states to mandate adding Gardasil to official vaccine schedules bears the company\u2019s fingerprints: . . . \u201cTo mandate now is simply to Merck\u2019s benefit, and only to Merck\u2019s benefit,\u201d she said.  Merck was required to put together a database on the efficacy in children before Gardasil was approved, Harper said.  But instead, the company put together four study sites that \u201care not necessarily representative, and may not even have enough numbers to determine what they need to know.\u201d Since she doesn\u2019t personally have access to the money Merck and GlaxoSmithKline pay for her HPV vaccine research, Harper doesn\u2019t know exactly how much either has paid Dartmouth for her work.  The trials are expensive, between $4,000 and $5,000 for each patient, she said.  With over 100 patients in her study, some big bucks could be in the balance, should Merck or Glaxo become upset with her for making these comments.  Why, then, would she risk speaking out like this \u23af at a time when her words very well could influence legislation across the country, and prompt legislators to drop the mandates?  Isn\u2019t she afraid of losing her funding? \u201cI want to be able to sleep with myself when I go to bed at night,\u201d Harper said.  \u201cMy concern is still, let\u2019s get women\u2019s health better.  It is still a good vaccine.  But let\u2019s be honest.  Don\u2019t over-promise.\u201d I hope Dr. Haper has tenure.

Apparently, a lot of people would rather spread that one because they can\u2019t \u23af or won\u2019t \u23af offer any more logical explanation. Anne McElroy Dachel has written a new op-ed piece on  The Really Big Lie About Autism .   Now it seems that the CDC is on a par with the medical community with the news about this new autism rate. Not only are doctors better at diagnosing, but also CDC officials are better at counting. Incredibly, the CDC still cannot say with any certainty that autism is actually affecting more children despite all the autistic kids everywhere. The CDC has been studying autism numbers for more than ten years, yet they don't know if it's more prevalent. Dr. Gerberding explained it this way, \u201cWe can't yet tell if there is a true increase in ASDs or if the changes are the result of our better studies.\u201d The CDC still can\u2019t tell?

I wondered how he would have reacted to the events of earlier this week.  As a Hokie, he would have been horrified.  As an educator who considered all campuses sacred, he would have been frightened.  As a parent, he would have cried (as I did).  One thing I didn\u2019t worry about too much was how the Little Rankster would react.  By and large, he just doesn\u2019t pay too much attention to the news of the day.  Then I read a post by my friend, Christina (a/k/a Good Rockin\u2019  Mommy Guilt ) on her new blog at  Chicago Parent .  (I have to say that the new blog really showcases what an exceptional writer she is.)  Christina posed the question of how one explains the horror of a day like the Blacksburg massacre to a child on the spectrum. And I had to think about it.  Right now, my son is just too innocent to understand the concept of evil, but some day another tragedy will occur when he\u2019s older \u23af at a time when I hope he\u2019ll have developed a true sense of empathy and realizes the horror of what has occurred.  How can I possibly help him put it all in perspective. After considering the dilemma, I realized I would tell the Little Rankster about the day he was born.  I\u2019d tell him of the joy that day brought to his mother and me.  I\u2019d tell him how the joy has remained undiminished \u23af and has even grown with every day \u23af despite the challenges his regression into autism brought.  I\u2019d tell him how proud of him I was on the day of his birth, and how proud I am of him every day of his life.  I\u2019d spend hours telling him how full my heart is because of him.  And then, I\u2019d tell him how around the time of his birth (give or take a couple of hours), a couple of very sick young boys in a place called Columbine, Colorado, decided to insert themselves into the history of evil.  I\u2019d tell him of the heartbreak for the parents of those children whose lives were cut short by an unspeakable act.  For those parents of Columbine, and now those parents of Blacksburg, the heartbreak is hopefully mediated somewhat by the joy their children brought them in life. I thank God I haven\u2019t had to face what the parents of the Virginia Tech tragedy are now going through.

{"date": "Sunday, March 11, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      I\u2019ve been meaning to get this post up for a couple of days now, but I\u2019ve been a little under the weather.  So this one kind of simmered around inside of me, and the more it simmered, the madder I got that stupidity still seems alive and well when it comes to autism.  Fortunately, at least in this case, stupidity did not reign supreme. The story on the front page of the  Chicago Tribune  the other day leapt out at me:  Shock therapy called cruel; kin disagree .  In a one-of-a-kind case in Illinois, a Cook County circuit judge has ruled that it is illegal to use electric shocks from a cattle prod to control the violent outbursts of a severely autistic man. Bradley Bernstein, 48, who can speak only about 12 words, had received the shocks for two decades under a court-approved settlement reached in 1987. But this fall, officials at his Chicago group home halted the practice, saying that it is inhumane and that a new state law forbids it. The judge\u2019s ruling on Friday was a victory for Trinity Services Inc., which runs the group home, and a defeat for Bradley\u2019s parents, Fran and Robert Bernstein of Lincolnshire.  The Bernsteins said Wednesday they may appeal the ruling. The Bernsteins have argued successfully for years that the threat of the electric prod, which delivers a jolt like a bee sting, is the only way to stop their son from banging his head against hard objects or punching himself in the face until he\u2019s bruised and bloody. The only way?!?   In general, I believe that parental decisions about the care for their autistic children should be entitled to respect, provided there is a rational basis, and the parents have weighed risks against potential benefits.  But what potential benefit is there in using a cattle prod \u23af and I\u2019m not even sure a cattle prod is appropriate for use on cattle \u23af on a human being. To be sure, self-injurious behavior is one of the most frustrating aspects of dealing with autism.  Nevertheless, whether one views it as the result of a neurological or cognitive difference or as the result of inflammatory processes with a biological cause, treating it as a bad habit that one can be trained out of through the use of pain is . . .  well, stupid.  And obviously it was not the answer for the Bernsteins as their son continued the behavior continued despite years of prodding. The use of shock as an aversive had, in the case of Bradley Bernstein, been given a legal blessing in 1986, when the family won a round with the Illinois Department of Human Services based on it being a viable alternative to psychiatric medications to which he was allergic.  Using the prod apparently did not sit well with Trinity Services, who administered the group home where Bradley lived.  A new settlement was reached in April, allowing Trinity to gradually wean Bradley off of the prod.  But by that time, Trinity\u2019s executive director had caught the ear of the right people.  After two years of effort by disability-rights advocates, the Illinois Legislature passed a law providing that treatment plans for people with developmental disabilities must not include electric shock or other aversive punishments, such as withholding essential food and drink or causing pain or humiliation. The legal battle will go on; the Bernsteins argue that the law should not apply to a settlement reached before the statute\u2019s passage.  For now, at least, Bradley is safe. The question I have that the press hasn\u2019t answered, is whether Bradley\u2019s wishes were heard by the court.  Was there even an effort to discern those wishes?  It is clear that Bradley is profoundly autistic, and he is of an age at which the use of alternative communication methods are not necessarily common.  But there is no indication that he lacks sufficient mental competence to have a say in his treatment. I will do all in my power to make sure my son, as an adult, never lacks the ability to make his wishes known, and that he will be taken seriously when he does so.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/2meakk"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/03/illinois-recognizes-that-people-are-not.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ILLINOIS RECOGNIZES THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT CATTLE\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, June 23, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      In the last couple of posts, I have discussed the arrogance with which  Autism Speaks  is conducting itself.  After its Borg-like assimilation of a relatively small number of like-minded organizations, AS now holds itself out to the world as  the  voice of autism.  Well, mainstream media, and to some extent the political establishment, seems to have gotten the memo; the rest of us now have that much more difficult a time making our voices heard.   There is a danger that anyone who does not toe the Autism Speaks line \u23af whether that person be a biomedical \u201ccurebie\u201d or an anti-cure follower of the neurodiversity philosophy \u23af will become marginalized and irrelevant. If we\u2019re going to keep moving forward to whatever the truth may be, we all must be heard. There was a session at  Autism One  last month, which featured David Humphrey of the  Autism Society of America  (ASA) and Dr. Martha Herbert, whose call for  a new paradigm in autism research  has made her one of the best-known and best-respected scientists now working in the field.   For its part, ASA finally seems to be getting the message that something is going on that cannot be explained by genetics alone.  Mr. Humphrey cited a number of 10,000,000 autistics worldwide, with a particularly strong rise in Southeast Asia.  I can\u2019t vouch for the accuracy of that number, but the stories I see in the international media tells me that the epidemic is not limited to the United States. Mr. Humphrey touted the memoranda of understanding that ASA entered into with the  Autism Research Institute  (ARI) and, more recently, with  Easter Seals .  The latter may be fairly significant given Easter Seals\u2019 record as a provider of services.  Under the memorandum of understanding, according to Mr. Humphrey, Easter Seals will make autism its number-one priority.  I doubt that we\u2019ll see much in the way of biomedical treatments being offered through this agreement, but it could have a tremendous impact on the delivery of more traditional therapies (speech, occupational, physical, behavioral, etc.).  Even for most of us who utilize biomedical treatments for our kids on the spectrum, that will be welcome news. The alliance between ASA and ARI is more intriguing.  Both organizations were the \u201cchildren\u201d of the late Bernie Rimland.  Yet one, ASA, has not traditionally been known as a particular friend of the environmental cause/biomedical treatment communities, while the other, ARI, led the way in pioneering many biomedical protocols through its DAN! programs. Further evidence of the shift in ASA\u2019s focus comes through its apparent hitching its wagon to Dr. Herbert\u2019s star.  She has made it her mission to bring better discipline to the environmental/biomedical communities, which will hopefully lead to better documentation of positive results. The new efforts of ASA are being viewed in some quarters with a degree of skepticism.  After all, the organization has not been known as a great friend of the community.  The fear exists that it may merely be setting itself up as an alternate Autism Speaks, with the goal being political control rather than doing the right thing.  In particular, there is a fear that the ultimate goal might be the same as what some perceive to be the aim of AS:  hijacking the environmental agenda to eliminate any serious consideration of vaccine triggers. To be sure, as much as Dr. Herbert champions the cause of researching environmental relationships to ASD, I have never heard her use the \u201cv\u201d word.  I have no problem with studying the broader processes by which environmental factors may trigger ASD in susceptible individuals.  I think that such research will ultimately show the means by which a variety of environmental insults \u23af including vaccines in many cases \u23af have injured our children.  But ignoring a vaccine connection in the name of political expediency is short-sighted.  It would be like studying environmental triggers for lung cancer, but ignoring the impact of cigarettes.  There likely are other triggers, but ignoring the single-most pervasive environmental insult will not help us discover the truth. That being said, I welcome the ASA initiatives, provided they don\u2019t attempt to hold themselves out as speaking for the interests of my child and my family.  Inasmuch as it has not yet discarded its slogan proclaiming itself as \u201cThe Voice of Autism,\u201d I\u2019d have to say that the jury is still out on the one.  But ASA seems to be going about building alliances rather than a single monolithic entity, which I believe to be a more honest approach than that used by Autism Speaks.   Another effort at alliance on the horizon is  Autism United , a new alliance of organizations mostly from the New York area.  It hopes to find the common concerns of families living with autism, and provide new avenues for research and treatment.  Although its immediate focus is regional, some of the organizations are national, and the hope is to replicate the model in other areas.  Again, the purpose is to come together to find common ground and provide real help, and not to become the sole voice of autism. Other than Autism Speaks, none of the \u201calliances\u201d seek to completely \u201cassimilate\u201d other organizations.  None appear to have the arrogance and audacity to presume to talk for all interests in the greater autism community, and to attempt silencing anyone who dares to take a position other than that of the collective.   And so the groups that have not yet been assimilated are doing whatever it takes to maintain their identities and the integrity of their own corporate vision.  That holds true for organizations regardless of their specific viewpoints or missions. I want to emphasize that my problem with Autism Speaks is not just because it doesn\u2019t mirror my own opinions about causation and treatment.  Rather, it is their relentless drive to present itself as a \u201cbig tent\u201d organization that speaks for us all, even as it runs over anyone who either has an independent viewpoint or might steal the spotlight.  Recently, John Gilmore related what happened when  A-CHAMP  worked on an issue of interest to all parents, an issue that was unrelated to the vaccine issue. Last year A-CHAMP worked liked demons to put together a coalition of every autism advocacy and membership group in New York to get our autism health insurance reform bill passed here. We repeatedly asked for permission to collect signatures for a petition to get the bill passed at the Autism Speaks walks, which at the time were the largest gatherings of the autism community in New York, and are held in public parks (so permission isn't even necessary anyway except as a courtesy to Autism Speaks).  We couldn\u2019t even get a phone call back.  We have seen the same behavior in New Jersey and Westchester County.  Collecting signatures at walks had never been a problem with NAAR. After the bill was passed, Autism Speaks issued a press release quoting the director of the Long Island walk, the same guy who refused to answer multiple phone calls and emails, about what a wonderful victory it was.  And then they lauded Bob and Susan Wright at the next walk for the great work they did on the insurance bill. That\u2019s Autism Speaks. Indeed it is.  In the world of Autism Speaks, nothing positive in the world of autism can occur without its involvement, even if it did nothing.   That\u2019s arrogance.  That\u2019s Autism Speaks.  What we really need is an organization named \u201cWe Listen.\u201d  Perhaps with one of these new alliances, we'll get that.  Maybe, just maybe, we'll get a tent we can feel comfortable having over us.  It doesn't have to be as big as Autism Speaks; it just needs to be big enough for us to feel welcome. AFTERWORD: After posting this, I realized that I should have made it very clear that any beef I have with the leadership and direction of Autism Speaks and the organizations it swallowed up ends with the leadership.  There are many, many fine people who volunteer their time and talents to those groups with more than just good intentions.  They believe that they are doing the right thing, and it is not my intention to call them wrong or to denigrate their efforts.  They are parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, and uncles.  They are my friends.  They too love someone with autism, and they have my respect. MORE AFTERWORD: Ginger has been nice enough to mentoin my recent posts, and  here  she presents a little more information about the recent moves by ASA.  Although it all sounds very good, our experience with Autism Speaks should give us all cause to remain a little skeptical.  Mr. Humphrey, I shall follow ASA's progress with interest, and a little hope.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/", "http://www.autismone.org/homepage.cfm", "http://www.autism-society.org/", "http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/index.htm", "http://www.easterseals.com/", "http://www.autismunited.org/index.html", "http://www.a-champ.org/", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/injecting-sense-into-autism-speaks-part.html"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/06/arrogance-and-assimilation-part-3.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ARROGANCE AND ASSIMILATION, PART 3\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, June 17, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       Hugh F. Rankin, Ph.D. 1913 \u2013 1989 (Photograph by Matt Anderson) I\u2019ve written before about my father and the lessons of  respect  I learned from him.  He was an amazing man who I continue to miss and think of every day of my life. It\u2019s ironic that I have always been so much in awe of one of the most approachable men to have ever walked the earth, but then again, irony was the story of his life.  He was an intellectual who never left behind his semi-rural roots.  He was a prolific author of scholarly works whose favorite author was Louis L\u2019Amour.  His gruff words could never conceal the tenderness of his spirit. Dad was raised in Reidsville, North Carolina, a small tobacco town just north of Greensboro.  Playing Center (at a time that meant both offense and defense), he was the first All-State football player to emerge from Reidsville High.  After spending a few years at Virginia Tech (or V.P.I. as Dad always called it) on an athletic scholarship, my father left school to work heavy construction and played some semi-pro football on the side.  There was talk of playing professional ball, and there were plans of staring his own construction company, but those plans and dreams were not to be. When World War II broke out, Dad tried to enlist, but was repeatedly rejected because he was in a \u201cvital industry.\u201d  He eventually talked his boss into firing him so he could join the fight, but irony, as ever, interceded.  He was assigned to the Corps of Engineers working in stateside construction projects (primarily building airfields).  Nevertheless, he worked his way up to the rank of Second Lieutenant, and found something to make him glad he was not sent overseas; he met and married  my mother . After much lobbying, my father was eventually assigned to a unit that was to be sent overseas to work in the European Theatre of Operation.  While training with the platoon he was to bring over, Dad sustained a serious back injury, and he spent the rest of the war in military hospitals.   The back injury changed my father\u2019s life for better and worse.  He defied a prediction that he would be unable to walk within the following ten years, but he was not without constant pain for the remainder of his life.  Although he often mentioned the pain, it was always in a matter-of-fact way.  I never heard Dad complain about it or wallow in self-pity.  He did what he could to make it more bearable, and lived with what he could not change. After his injury, my father could not return to the construction work he was so good at.  He lived with his wife and young son in Reidsville where he tried his hand at carpentry and furniture making, but he really wasn\u2019t very good at it. Dad was offered a position as a football coach at his old high school, but first he had to complete his degree so he could teach an academic subject as well.  So he enrolled in Elon College to study education and history.  By that time, there was a second son.  At the urging of a professor, Dad made the decision to go on to graduate school in history at the University of North Carolina, where he was named as one of the original Morehead scholars (although it is now an undergraduate program, the original scholars included graduate students). While Dad was still completing his doctorate, he accepted a research position with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.  It was in Williamsburg that a third son (yours truly) was born to the Rankin family.  It was also there that Dad co-wrote what became one of the most highly regarded books about the American Revolution:  Rebels and Redcoats. We moved to New Orleans after my father was offered a faculty position at Tulane University.  Over the course of 26 years, he established himself as an outstanding scholar and writer (he was designated as the W.R. Irby Professor of History), a beloved teacher (who was nicknamed \u201cBig Daddy\u201d by his graduate students), and a voice of reason who represented the academic faculty with the athletic department and vice versa.   He published prolifically (unfortunately at a time before historians like Stephen Ambrose made it financially profitable).  The impact he had on his students and his peers was remarkable.  The impact he had on his sons was profound. Dad was physically unable to do so many of the little things that come with being a father:  no carrying his son on his shoulders, no playing football on the lawn, no bike rides.  But there are a thousand other memories I have:  sitting on the Ferris wheel at Pontchartrain Beach Amusement Park with my father\u2019s arm around me, the visits to his office, walking hand-in-hand to kindergarten, exploring historic sites in Virginia with the greatest of guides, watching football games on television, and a lot of fishing trips.  Dad took joy in sharing his interests with me, and equal joy in sharing my interests.  And sometimes we just shared a presence with each other, sitting silently on the porch of a beach house, watching the ocean waves. I have come to the conclusion that one learns good parenting in two ways:  having great parents, and having great children.  It is my blessing to have had both great parents and great children, and the most important lessons from all of them have been much the same.  Hopes and dreams \u23af those you hold for yourself as well as those you hold for your children \u23af are easily broken, so don\u2019t stake too much on them.  The good news is that hopes and dreams are replaceable.  Together, parents and children can make lives better by moving forward together with open hearts and open minds.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 14, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      When I first started this site, one of the first people to welcome me to the bloggosphere was Kevin Leitch, offering advice on how to keep my template from being such a \u201cbloody mess.\u201d  I didn\u2019t understand a thing he tried to tell me about the world of html and such (I\u2019m still pretty incompetent about the whole thing), but he seemed a decent soul. For several months, we had some very pleasant exchanges despite our  very  different ideas about autism and the appropriate response to it.  We occasionally took each other to task, but never with any malevolence on either side.  Somewhere along the way, we simply went our separate ways; and lately we have, for the most part, ignored each other. Of course, that hasn\u2019t stopped me from occasionally lurking at Kev\u2019s blog.  Despite rolling my eyes in private from time to time, I usually kept my silence out of respect for someone for whom I still harbor friendly thoughts.  But it\u2019s hard to hold one\u2019s tongue when faced with posts that are . . . well, bizarre. Lately, Kev has put forth a conspiracy theory worthy of Oliver Stone.  In short, he seems to feel that the notion that we may be able to biomedically treat our autistic children with methods that are frankly alternative is part of a plan by the Church of Scientology.  To be sure, in a reply to one comment, Kev protests that he isn\u2019t suggesting a conspiracy, but merely that a dangerous cult like Scientology shouldn\u2019t be trusted with our kids.  But one can\u2019t use phrases like \u201cthis reeks of \u2018set up\u2019 to me\u201d and not expect to conjure up images of conspiracies.  I have always believed that if something has feathers, waddles, and quacks, it is probably a duck.  Well Kev, your posts are quacking. In  one of his Scientology posts , Kev tries to prove his point by implying that Julia Berle, who he describes as \u201c[o]ne of the darlings of the autism/vaccine movement,\u201d is, at the least, a tool or dupe of those scheming Scientologists and possibly a willing co-conspirator.  Because Ms. Berle is associated with  Generation Rescue , that means that organization is obviously part of the plot as well.  And what does he base this on.  Well it seems that Ms. Berle\u2019s son attends a school that has the same name as a school that is a \u201cfeeder\u201d to yet another school that Kev alleges has some kind of vague link to Scientologists.  And somehow, that school attendance got translated into a little boy being \u201cdiagnosed\u201d by Scientologists. But that\u2019s not all.  According to Kev, doctors Ms. Berle chose to take her son to for treatment have connections to the Church of Scientology.  Uh-huh.  I really don\u2019t know if the doctors he mentioned have any real connections to the Church or not, but you really can\u2019t tell from Kev\u2019s ramblings. I don\u2019t really have any known connections to Scientology other than having one relative who couldn\u2019t get his name off of their mailing list after making the mistake of talking to one.  Likewise, although I certainly know who Julia Berle is, I\u2019ve never met her and I don\u2019t have any real stake in defending her.  But neither Ms. Berle, her son\u2019s school, nor her son\u2019s doctors need defending.  While not needing a defense, Ms. Berle nevertheless would like to clarify things.  Tired of seeing her comments to Kev\u2019s post play peek-a-boo (now you see it; now you don\u2019t), she posted one of them to the EoH Group.  I decided to give her comments a more secure home here. Kevin,  How brilliant that you referred to me as a \u201cdarling.\u201d  That\u2019s pretty much all you got right in your blog about myself and my son.  First off the two doctors you referred to in your post treated Baxter AFTER he was diagnosed from 5 other sources (3 developmental pediatricians, 1 regional Center and 1 school district\u2026.I know nada of their religious affiliations.  For any of them).  The doctors you mentioned were not involved at all in his diagnosis at all.  I merely went to them for treatment. When my son's diarrhea was bright yellow and running down his leg 35x/day and he was screaming 21 hrs/day and rolling car wheels the other 3 hrs I did not ask, nor care (still don\u2019t) about their religious ties.  They wanted to help my son\u2019s health and they both facilitated in his healing. With regards to his school I can only assume you googled the name and came up with this other feeder school. ??? ???  Because you are completely incorrect.  The Renaissance Academy or something? I have never heard of it and we are in no way associated with it.  It astounds me that you get on this world wide platform and expound \u201ctruths\u201d of which you have no knowledge. I am confused by your statement this is a \u201cset up.\u201d  Set up for what?  I can only guess you are further functioning under your afore mentioned misinformation. I respect that others don't believe their ASD children to be toxic nor need chelation or any other biomedical intervention.  I do understand that autism has many different definitions in our community and how one reacts to it is obviously individual.  Healthcare is also a very private choice and in my case was made with a great deal of in-depth analysis, information and thought with my spouse.  You may not agree with what we came up with...but it worked and really\u2026honestly Scientology had nothing to do with it (It\u2019s very hard not to chuckle as I write that sentence!!). I felt very sad and very alone at the time that Baxter was diagnosed and was very sick.  I so wanted someone to reach out and offer a shoulder to cry on because I WAS crying.  I was sad.  I was alone.  And I was not crying because my kid was autistic\u2026my kid was not different or quirky or unique.  He was desperately, desperately ill.  That is why I was crying.  If I had sat back and done nothing given his state it would have been within reason to call CPS on me. So, I offer support and Baxter\u2019s story in case anyone could glean some hope or possibly something to help their child as well.  Come meet him.  He\u2019s a cool kid.  He has no supports/therapy of any kind, is working waaaay above grade level (2 yrs), has tons of friends and just won the game ball (baseball) this past weekend.  His first game.  I wish you the best in your future with autism\u2026with your daughter\u2026wherever you want to put you energy.  I respect it.  I don\u2019t even ask that you respect mine.  But it would be nice.   \u2014Julia  Baxter\u2019s mom Recovered in 2005 www.childrenscornerschool.com/video/bax3.wmv It\u2019s just my opinion, but I think Kevin Leitch added two plus two, and arrived at a sum of 3,479.

{"date": "Sunday, October 28, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      In the little-over-two years I\u2019ve been blogging, I have avoided labeling individuals with whom I disagree as \u201cPharma shills.\u201d  It\u2019s a label that is too often thrown around without any substantial support, and it only distracts from the discussion.  The only person, thus far, to earn that title from me has been Dr. Paul Offit.  And let\u2019s face it, that shoe fits him like the glass slipper fit Cinderella. That being said, an op-ed piece appeared recently that has made me wonder if there might be someone else in the debate who might be a \u201cPharma shill.\u201d  To keep you from any suspense, the answer is:  I don\u2019t know yet, but I can\u2019t rule it out. Published in differfent locations under the titles,  \u2018Suffer the Little Children\u2019 No More  and  Another Blow Against Vaccine Hysteria \u23af Or Is It , a fellow by the name of Michael Fumento engages in hyperbole after hyperbole to argue his opinion that vaccination is perfectly safe and has, without any room for question, been cleared of any suspected role in the triggering of the current epidemic of developmental disorders (including autism spectrum disorders). It\u2019s not just that Mr. Fumento ignores that the gradual evolution of the environmental/vaccine hypothesis has moved it beyond looking solely at thimerosal.  We\u2019ve come to expect that the defenders of the vaccine industry want to keep the discussion on mercury because it becomes that much easier to quote half-baked epidemiological studies focusing only on that aspect and not upon the processes themselves by which mercury and other toxins trigger disease in our children.  No, it\u2019s the snarkiness of his commentary and the over-the-top manner in which he argues his point that set Mr. Fumento apart.  Here\u2019s how he starts out: The vaccine preservative thimerosal has jumped the safety hurdle.  Again.  So indicates a recent large epidemiological study in the New England Journal of Medicine.  \u201cAgain\u201d is the problem, though.  One huge study after another has cleared thimersorosal as a cause of child developmental disorders, and specifically autism, but there is a powerful lobby that couldn\u2019t care less. By \u201cone huge study after another,\u201d I suppose he means the Verstraeten study, which after the \u201chelpful feedback\u201d received at Simpsonwood managed to remove the unmistakable connection between thimerosal and autism.  What was left \u23af in the principle author\u2019s words \u23af was a \u201cneutral study,\u201d i.e., one that proved nothing.  Or maybe Mr. Fumento is referring to the Danish study which changed the study criteria halfway through, leaving the absurd impression that a mercury-based preservative actually protected children from autism. But it was Mr. Fumento\u2019s paranoid reference to \u201ca powerful lobby\u201d that made me do a double-take.  That is absolutely Offitian in tone.  What organization or group do we have on our side that could possibly have the clout to affect public policy that  PhRMA  has? So who is this Michael Fumento?  His canned bio tells us he is \u201can author, journalist, and attorney specializing in science and health issues,\u201d and \u201che is a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC.\u201d  So that tells us he\u2019s a smart guy who is generally friendly toward big business.  But what can one find by looking beyond the official bio? Michael Fumento has been a busy guy through the years.  In arguing that the pesticide Alar was perfectly safe on apples, Fumento  once wrote  that the public questioning of safety claims was \u201cone of the slickest hype campaigns in recent American history.\u201d  He has repeatedly complained about the attention and resources devoted to combating the  AIDS epidemic , referring to it as a \u201cpolitically correct disease.\u201d  He refers to  Gulf War Syndrome  as a mere myth. The deference he shows studies issued by official agencies is apparently not absolute.  He sharply criticized the surgeon general's findings regarding the dangers of  second-hand smoke ; Mr. Fumento seems to think there's no real health hazard in having cigarette smoke blown into one's face.   In looking at what Mr. Fumento has written about  pharmaceutical issues , I discovered that he had addressed the vaccine-autism connection on previous occasions, some of it during his stint with the Scripps-Howard News Service. It is the demise of his relationship with Scripps Howard that gives us a glimpse into Mr. Fumento\u2019s character.  This  what  Business Week  reported  in January 2006: Scripps Howard News Service announced Jan. 13 that it\u2019s severing its business relationship with columnist Michael Fumento, who\u2019s also a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute.  The move comes after inquiries from BusinessWeek Online about payments Fumento received from agribusiness giant Monsanto \u23af a frequent subject of praise in Fumento\u2019s opinion columns and a book. In a statement released on Jan. 13, Scripps Howard News Service Editor and General Manager Peter Copeland said Fumento \u201cdid not tell SHNS editors, and therefore we did not tell our readers, that in 1999 Hudson recieved a $60,000 grant from Monsanto.\u201d  Copeland added:  \u201cOur policy is that he should have disclosed that information.  We apologize to our readers.\u201d  In the Jan. 5 column, Fumento wrote that St. Louis-based Monsanto has about 30 products in the pipeline that will aid farmers, \u201cbut also help us all by keeping prices down and allowing more crops to be grown on less land.\u201d The basics are that Monsanto made gave $60,000 in 1999 to the Hudson Institute to support a book on agri-business written by Mr. Fumento.  For his part, Mr. Fumento down-played the payments, explaining that \u201cI\u2019m just extremely pro-biotech.\u201d  With regard to the Scripps Howard piece, Mr. Fumento stated that \u201che sees no conflict of interest . . . because the grant came several years ago,\u201d and he thought \u201cthere\u2019s a statute of limitations on that.\u201d  Monsanto, on the other hand, declared that its financial relationship with the Hudson Institute was \u201congoing,\u201d although it denied any wrongdoing with the Scripps Howard article. In the absence of information regarding financial relationships between vaccine manufacturers and either the Hudson Institute or Mr. Fumento, it\u2019s impossible to state whether this guy is a shill or just a very obnoxious idealogue.  On such questions, I often resort to the \u201cduck test,\u201d which looks to the apparent nature of something.  If it quacks like a duck, has feathers like a duck, and waddles like a duck, you are more probably than not looking at a duck.  So far, Mr. Fumento is quacking rather loudly.  Time will tell if he has feathers and waddles.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=102307A", "http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/380", "http://www.phrma.org/", "http://www.fumento.com/alar1.html", "http://www.fumento.com/suaids.html", "http://www.fumento.com/military/nro-gulf-war-syndrome.html", "http://www.fumento.com/disease/smokingdebate.html", "http://www.fumento.com/supharma.html", "http://tinyurl.com/cntpq"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/10/does-big-pharma-have-new-shill.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t DOES BIG PHARMA HAVE A NEW SHILL?\n\t \n    "},

In fact, the post names the \u201c All Pharma Cheering Squad ,\u201d and adds that there are undoubtedly quite a few more cheerleaders who double as legal drug pushers.

{"date": "Sunday, October 21, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      Over the last few months when I have been, for the most part absent from the bloggosphere, I probably could have predicted that Paul Offit would be involved in the timing of my return. There\u2019s been a lot said recently about the claiming of religious exemptions to avoid vaccination of children.  Perhaps it\u2019s due to an upsurge of interest in the vaccine issue in the wake of Jenny McCarthy\u2019s recent media appearances.  In any event, the Associated Press recently distributed an article entitled \u201c Parents Use Religion to Avoid Vaccines ,\u201d which sparked quite a discussion on the web.  As I join in the discussion, let me emphasize that what I have to say is not a scientific discourse, but rather examines the legal/ethical/moral/religious issues. The AP writer, a fellow named Steve LeBlanc, tells us that: Twenty-eight states, including Florida, Massachusetts and New York, allow parents to opt out for medical or religious reasons only. Twenty other states, among them California, Pennsylvania, Texas and Ohio, also allow parents to cite personal or philosophical reasons. Mississippi and West Virginia allow exemptions for medical reasons only. The article examines a recent increase in the claiming of religious exemptions \u23af the numbers actually doubling or tripling in some states.  Instead of asking why religious people might actually have objections, Mr. LeBlanc apparently spoke to only one parent, a woman who acknowledged that she is not particularly religious and characterized her claim of a religious exemption as \u201cmisleading.\u201d  So the writer apparently extrapolated that all or most parents who claim an exemption must likewise be misleading the states. Some of these parents say they are being forced to lie because of the way the vaccination laws are written in their states. And of course, whenever the media talks about vaccination policy, they always go to the same source for a quote:  our old buddy, Dr. Paul Offit, who holds at least one vaccine patent. \u201cDo I think that religious exemptions have become the default?  Absolutely,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, head of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and one of the harshest critics of the anti-vaccine movement.  He said the resistance to vaccines is \u201can irrational, fear-based decision.\u201d Based on the constant bragging of the CDCC as to increasing vaccination rates, I think labeling the choice of a religious exemption as the \u201cdefault\u201d is a shining example of Doc Offit\u2019s customary resort to hyperbole.  And the reference to an \u201canti-vaccination movement\u201d tells me that Mr. LeBlanc buys into Offit\u2019s paranoid \u201cus versus them\u201d worldview (see my discussion of his book,  The Cutter Incident ). Paul Offit is not the only Doctor O to weigh in on the issue.  The medical blogger, Orac, has also had his say.  Orac and I first started sparring a few years back, and we managed to develop what I would classify as a civil and cordial relationship.  I can even say that I agree with him on many issues.  Vaccination policy and the possible role of vaccination in the triggering of the current autism epidemic, however, are issues on which our views are sharply different. In  a recent post , Orac leads into the AP article by writing: I\u2019ve written before how this misplaced deference has resulted in a spate of laws that allow parents easily to declare a religious exemption and refuse to have their children vaccinated\u23afall legally.  In the last couple of months, news has come out that indicates that the problem of parents taking advantage of \u201creligious exemptions to avoid vaccinating their children has grown worse than previously thought. . .  Orac, who does not seem to be very religious himself (apart from a near-religious devotion to what he deems to be good science), makes clear that he believes most claims of religious exemptions are nothing more than sham: While some parents \u23af Christian Scientists and certain fundamentalists, for example \u23af have genuine religious objections to medicine, it is clear that others are simply distrustful of shots. . . . In other words, the fear-mongering over vaccines of antivaccinationists, coupled with religious exemption laws in many states, are making it possible for more and more parents simply to lie in order to claim a religious exemption to which they are not (morally, at least) entitled . . . . . . Although I\u2019m dismayed at such behavior and the undue deference to religious ideas that allow such laws to make it easy for parents to lie, I can sort of understand why some parents, mislead by antivaccination misinformation, might decide that they have no choice but to lie to \u201csave their children.\u201d  Sort of understand, but not condone. The AP article quotes Doc Offit attempting to sound reasonable: Offit said he knows of no state that enforces any penalty for parents who falsely claim a religious exemption. \u201cI think that wouldn\u2019t be worth it because that\u2019s just such an emotional issue for people. Our country was founded on the notion of religious freedom,\u201d he said. Perhaps Offit has not heard the same stories I\u2019ve heard out of New York, regarding parents who cannot back up their claim of religious exemption with some sort of official documentation from a recognized church.  I\u2019m not familiar with the rules in New York, and I invite any corrections on this point, but parents in that state tell me that their children are not allowed in school without that documentation.  Sounds like a penalty to me. Steve LeBlanc, Paul Offit, Orac, and apparently the State of New York all assume that a deeply held religious belief requires some sort of specific church decree to validate the conviction.  Pardon my less-than-religious language, but there is only one word that adequately describes that viewpoint:  bullshit!!!! Again, let me emphasize for the sake of clarity that I am not discussing the scientific merits of any particular viewpoint.  As I have written on numerous occasions, I consider the science on these questions to be far from conclusive.  The question here is not scientific validity; it is individual conscience. With the exception of a few sects that have an institutional distrust of modern medicine, most denominations do not take a formal theological stand one way or the other on whether vaccination is good or evil  per se .  To be sure, groups who are part of particular denominations may make generalized statements about the subject as a commentary on public policy.  Recent statements issued by the Women\u2019s Division of the United Methodist Church decrying the use of thimerosal in vaccines stand as one example.  I\u2019m sure those who disagree with me can cite examples of church-related organizations calling for increased efforts to vaccinate particular populations. Again, these are more in the nature of public policy commentaries, perhaps guided by broad theological principles.  As far as I know, no major mainstream denomination has declared that either vaccinating or not vaccinating a child qualifies as a sin. As a believing member of a mainstream christian denomination, I am guided by broad principles of what is right and what is wrong.  Those principles tell me that I should avoid doing harm to innocent children.  If I am personally convinced that the health benefit of a vaccine outweighs the potential risk, I must have my child vaccinated as a moral imperative.  On the other hand, if I am personally convinced that the risk to my child is high, an equally strong moral imperative commands that I refrain from vaccination. The problem with enforcement of mandates is not so much that it is an \u201cemotional issue,\u201d but rather that it is impossible to actually see within the heart of any individual. Not surprisingly, Orac believes that mainstream scientific opinion trumps religious freedom: Undue respect for religious beliefs that clash with the scientifically demonstrated ability of vaccines to prevent disease safely enables parents who are either antivaccinationist or who have been mislead by antivaccinationist fearmongering a relatively easy method to bypass vaccination laws and an easy avenue for physicians peddling non-evidence-based attacks on vaccination to help them do so. In an addendum to his post, though, Orac starts to make sense, although his rationale is probably far different from mine: Either non-medical exemptions should be allowed for any reason, religious, pseudoscientific, or whatever, or they should not be permitted at all.  Why should religious objections to vaccination be privileged above any other objection, such as philosophical or plain \u201cI just don't want to\u201d?  There\u2019s no rational reason why they should. There\u2019s a broader issue here than just religious freedom.  The real debate should be whether a government has to right to dictate a specific medical procedure or health-related practice.  There are certainly \u201cantivaccinationists\u201d who believe that vaccines, by their nature, are doing more harm than good to the human immune system.  But there are also undoubtedly many parents who may accept the need for vaccination in principle, but who question whether the enormous number of shots on the current schedule present an unacceptable risk.  For example, the parent of a young girl may accept the need to vaccinate for measles, but not for HPV.  If a parent chooses to wait until a child has reached an age where the risk of contracting Hepatitus B becomes more palpable, should that child be denied school enrollment prior to that immunization? There are no easy answers in this debate.  Assuming solely for the sake of argument that there is validity to the \u201cherd immunity\u201d theory (which is taken in some quarters as, if you\u2019ll pardon the expression, an article of faith), then a parent is not only making the choice for his/her own child, but for other children as well.  It is a delicate balancing process lies at the heart of every societal debate we have about the limits of freedom and self-determination. Unfortunately, we do not have all the information we need to make an informed decision as a society.  We have no idea what cumulative impact the huge number of scheduled vaccines are having on the immune system of  any given child.  And we\u2019re only starting to figure out that some children may be particularly susceptible to damage from particular vaccines or components. Until we know more, there is very little we can settle by debating the real question.  In the meantime, we must err on the side of freedom from governmental interference, and leave the everyday choices to individual conscience.  And we can pray that the choices we make for our children \u23af whether those choices are to vaccinate or to not vaccinate \u23af are wise.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/2n9438", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/using_religion_to_avoid_vaccination_revi.php#more"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/10/religious-freedom-and-claiming-of.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE CLAIMING OF VACCINATION EXEMPTIONS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Sunday, June 04, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       An early surprise at  Autism One  last week came courtesy of our Virginia friend, Mary.  She has apparently decided this blog needs a good publicist, and Mary came to the conference armed with stickers and postcards bearing a new Injecting Sense logo (see above).  There\u2019s no reason to worry about such efforts going to my head.  The one person who would not wear one of the stickers was my lovely wife.   It would take too long to give a lot of detail about what I heard from various speakers, and it would be impossible to relate everything that went on because there were five separate tracks being conducted simultaneously.  I encourage anyone who has an interest in what was said to order individual presentations; some are available on  DVD  (the videos from the 2006 conference should be available soon) with all of the sessions being available on  audio CD or MP3 . What I can do is give you some impressions I came away with.  Keep in mind that the following is not intended to be a transcript.  Again, the presentations are available.  Also, there are a lot of fine presentations I saw that won\u2019t get mentioned because the details would get lost in any retelling.  What really interested me is the move toward common ground. Mark Blaxil called science a \u201csubversive process,\u201d because the whole point is to take what went before and prove it wrong.  Or, in the words of the ancient Greek, Thales, as quoted by Mr. Blaxil, \u201cto bring surety is to bring ruin.\u201d  Rigor and scrutiny need to be applied to all science, but one must realize that our understanding of an issue can never be complete. In her presentation devoted to explaining her proposed model for understanding autism,  Dr. Martha Herbert  echoed the resistance to change many scientists have.  She asked the rhetorical question of should we believe what we see, or do we see what we believe?  Those who cling to outmoded models will not see or believe the very real discoveries that are being made. We are in the midst of a dynamic scientific process, in which we are learning more every day.  And with each new discovery, we get closer to the truth. Indeed, as Dr. Elizabeth Mumper stated, we\u2019re now seeing an \u201cintegration of hypotheses.\u201d  More and more speakers were talking about the combined impact of various environmental insults, including mercury as a primary but not the only culrit, as causative factors for autism.  There seems to be no question \u23af at least among the physicians and researchers who spoke at Autism One \u23af that most autism results from a combination of genes and environment.  Dr. Manuel Casanova, a neuropathologist, debunked the notion that the different brain structure we see in autistics (i.e., increased number of Purkinje cells and narrower minicolumns) appears to result from environmentally influenced genetics.  As Dr. Anju Usman stated, genes cannot be altered, but the manner in which they are expressed is subject to change.   Dr. Usman spoke of having to take a complete look at the clinical picture of each child.  Specifically, many children have not just mercury toxicity, but lead toxicity as well, and the synergy between mercury and lead gives rise to an exponential increase in the hazard.  Even so, for children with impaired immune systems, heavy metals are just \u201cthe tip of the inceberg.\u201d Also looking beyond a simple indictment of thimerosal was  Dan Olmsted , who gave a presentation together with  David Kirby .  Mr. Olmsted, the UPI editor who has given us the outstanding \u201cAge of Autism\u201d series, doesn\u2019t attempt to answer any questions about causation.  Instead, he does exactly what a good journalist always does; he asks intriguing questions.  By looking at common environmental exposures in the earliest reported cases of autism, and recent diagnoses of autism among children involved in vaccine trials, Mr. Olmsted presents questions that may help lead us to the right answers. Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the most controversial of all the key players in the autism world, gave a very interesting talk partially about studies that seem to replicate his controversial paper of several years ago linking the MMR vaccination and autism.  He went beyond that issue, however, and speculated aloud about whether, though our vaccine programs, may have altered for the worse the means by which measles is transmitted.  Again, this was not presented so much as a scientific study as it was what I would call preliminary speculation, but it is an idea worthy of exploration.  For anyone who wants to criticize this notion without bothering to know what they\u2019re criticizing, I would urge such a person to order the DVD or audio CD of this lecture.  (Actually, Lisa Ackerman\u2019s introduction of Dr. Wakefield, by itself, is probably worth the price of the DVD.) On a policy note, Rick Rollens addressed the California numbers and, more importantly, the California response to those numbers.  The California DSS numbers are undeniably controversial and subject to various interpretations.  But a sensible look at them indicates that something is indeed going on, and Californians should be grateful that people like Mr. Rollens are there to see that society doesn\u2019t simply bury its collective head in the sand. It is an unfortunate fact of our life that the scientific and health-policy issues that concern us most are intertwined with politics.  The keynote presentation, given by  Robert Krakow , Jim Moody, and John Gilmore, entitled \u201cA New Revolution \u23af Empowering Parents,\u201d focused on political action.  And there is certainly much going on in that area.  More and more parents are coming to the conclusion that good science and good heath policy will be buried unless we unite as a political force.  Many states have either passed, or are considering legislation to ban thimerosal from vaccines or to expand health insurance benefits for autism.  The Combating Autism Act is now working its way through Congress.  To be sure, it is an imperfect piece of legislation.  Nearly everyone can find problems with it, but the process by which it has come together is indeed encouraging.  The various educational and advocacy groups have come together to compromise in order to move forward.   On both the scientific and political fronts, we are moving toward common ground.  Listening to the presentations at Autism One, I thought about the image (undoubtedly the result of watching too many cartoons as a child) of a snowball rolling downhill.  At first, there is just a tiny bit of snow rolling at a slow rate of speed, but more and more snow is added as the ball rolls downhill.  As it picks up more speed and momentum, the ball continues to grow at a quicker pace with each roll. One reason the snowballs are picking up speed and snow is that there are so many good people giving them a little push on the journey.  I got to spend some great moments with many of them.  Getting to know Scott and Angela Shoemaker better was a genuine treat.  Speaking of treats, I will never forget seeing the glee in the Little Rankster\u2019s face as  the Nanstiels  serenaded him with the \u201cSpongebob Squarepants\u201d theme.  I had the pleasure of meeting countless people \u23af too many to name here \u23af I\u2019ve gotten to know either through this blog or the EoH list.  I had the chance to chat with  Dan Olmsted  and  Craig Westover , two fine writers who have nothing to gain by taking a serious look at what we\u2019re saying, and yet they\u2019re interested in seeking the truth.  A continuing resolve to seek the truth was expressed to me by  Lujene Clark , who has no intention of backing away from the important work she began with her late husband,  Alan .   I experienced a moment of great (almost sinful) pride upon hearing Bob Krakow echo  my thoughts  about the political struggle involved in finding the truth:  that there\u2019s a lot of us out here, we\u2019re everywhere, and \u201cwe\u2019re not going away any time soon!\u201d   We\u2019re not going away until we find the truth that shall free our children of the obstacles caused by autism.  We\u2019re not going away until we find out why our leaders decided it was a good idea to inject poison into our children.  There is much that still divides us, but we\u2019re not going away until we reach a consensus.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/injecting.jpg", "http://www.autismone.org/", "http://www.zenworksproductions.com/", "http://www.fltwood.com/onsite/autism/2006/", "http://www.theageofautism.com/", "http://www.evidenceofharm.com/", "http://www.a-champ.org/", "http://www.autismmedia.org/", "http://www.theageofautism.com/", "http://craigwestover.blogspot.com/", "http://www.nomercury.org/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/06/rolling-snowballs-with-friends.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ROLLING SNOWBALLS WITH FRIENDS\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 29, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       One year ago today, my family sat in a Texas hotel room, watching CNN and the Weather Channel as  Hurricane Katrina changed our lives forever .   For years our local meteorological legend, Nash Roberts, warned us of what could happen if the right storm hit the city and the Lake at just the right angle.  We called it \u201cNash\u2019s doomsday scenario,\u201d and the predictions of Katrina\u2019s strength and path looked a little too close to what we had feared for so long.  So the Rankins loaded up the car and got out of town. We took little comfort after the storm took an easterly turn before hitting shore, for we knew this one was leaving behind a pretty wide swath of damage.  What we didn\u2019t count on, though, was the failure of the levees in our beloved New Orleans.  We watched in horror from afar, witnessing scenes we never thought we\u2019d see in America. In the months that followed, the message got out, that New Orleans and the Gulf States would come back.  And recovery will probably be achieved some day.  After one year, however, it seems far away. Even though  the Northshore, where we live, did not get hit as hard as the city , we still feel the effects, and just turning on the news or opening the paper brings another reminder that we are living in the aftermath of a disaster. Disasters can bring out the best in people, and it can also accentuate the worst.  We\u2019ve seen both. People are determined that their homes and their city will be rebuilt.  We\u2019ve seen signs of life in the customs and celebrations we hold so dear.  On the other hand, our politics \u23af legendary for its ineptitude and dishonesty before the storm \u23af is just as bad as ever, street crime has resumed and even gotten worse (spreading to areas that were once peaceful), and everywhere one looks there are reminders of just how large the job of recovery will be.  The little things that made life in this area special \u23af special enough to make one forgive the drawbacks to life here \u23af are still buried. To be sure, the  joie de vive  that infused life around these parts had a dark side to it, even in what we now call the \u201cpre-K era.\u201d  The unofficial motto of South Louisiana is  laissez les bon temps rouler , or \u201clet the good times roll.\u201d  Problems and tragedies can\u2019t be avoided, but our universal remedy has always been a good wake and a jazz funeral.  It\u2019s a wonderful outlook on life, and serves most bad situations well.  But it falls short when confronting long-term problems like a destroyed city . . . or the challenges of raising an autistic child.  Even as awareness of ASD grows, too many families of autistic children treat the condition as a deep, dark secret. Chris Rose, who has gone from his past role as light-hearted lifestyle columnist to now being the spokesperson for an angst-ridden city,  wrote this in Sunday\u2019s  Times-Picayune : Waiting to feel better.  Waiting to get worse.  Waiting for a Better Break or Another Chance.  Does that day ever come? Yeah, you right.  And waiting for the next hurricane. Therein lies the rub.  Even more than suffering from anniversary anxiety \u23af the cauldron of agony and memory that we are boiling in \u23af it seems like much of our communal psyche is caught up in the strange and fruitless wait for the next big storm to come our way to see how we handle it, physically, civically, emotionally. The worst part for my wife and me has been trying to get services for our son.  It was near impossible before the storm to get the local school system to provide that which it is legally obligated; in the last year they have a new excuse.  Resources were stretched too thin for the state to hold any workshops for teachers to learn about dealing with ASD. Through a lot of parental kicking and screaming, and thanks to the efforts of some wonderful people at the Little Rankster\u2019s school, we saw progress.  But not what should have been seen. So we\u2019re out of here.  We\u2019ve had enough. The Rankins are off to a place where the discussion around the lunchroom doesn\u2019t always involve getting over the last hurricane season and preparing for the next.  We\u2019re off to a place where the schools understand they have certain duties under IDEA.  We\u2019re off to a place where people don\u2019t look at an autistic child as some freak of nature. Are we looking for utopia?  Yes.  Will we find it?  Maybe not.  But we have to do something.  Staying in South Louisiana is not the answer for our family. People develop an emotional attachment to New Orleans that is difficult to explain.  I feel like a traitor abandoning my home in its time of need.

National Autism Association Renews Call for CDC to Declare Autism a National Emergency CDC Study Finds One in 150 Children Now Diagnosed with Autism NIXA, Mo., Feb. 9 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ \u23af The National Autism Association (NAA) today is asking again for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to treat the epidemic of autism among children as a national emergency following the release of the agency\u2019s latest study claiming a new diagnosis rate of one in 150.      \u201cWhile it's nice that the CDC has shared these findings with the public, they must move forward with a plan to treat the children suffering with autism now,\u201d said NAA board chair Claire Bothwell.  \u201cThis agency has yet to answer the question, \u2018Why are so many children sick?\u2019  If this were an epidemic of practically any other disease among the children of this country, they would have long since investigated how it could have happened and made earnest attempts to find treatments.\u201d Citing the impossibility of an epidemic occurring as a result of genetics alone, the organization is repeating earlier requests for federally-funded research into relevant environmental triggers, including vaccines and the mercury-containing vaccine preservative thimerosal.   \u201cAfter this latest study, the CDC cannot continue to sweep unpopular factors in this epidemic under the rug, including vaccines and thimerosal.  The future of a sizeable portion of an entire generation of children is at risk. Without effective treatments, taxpayers will soon bear the burden of care, estimated at over $3 million per individual,\u201d commented Ms. Bothwell.      NAA has been critical of the CDC\u2019s research emphasis on counting affected children, rather than addressing causation.  With the passage of the Combating Autism Act in December of last year, Congress has called for research into environmental factors including vaccines and their components. \u201cThis latest study underscores the need for this type of research to take top priority. Perhaps this time, the CDC\u2019s own numbers will finally drive the point home that this is an emergency and should be treated as such,\u201d commented Ann Brasher, NAA vice president. \u201cThe one in 150 children they counted need research that can help them recover and reach their full potential in life.

He is finally acknowledging that the debate is broader than just the MMR or just thimerosal.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 06, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      A friend emailed me this evening to ask what I thought about Joe Barton\u2019s floor colloquy in support of the Combating Autism Act.  For those who missed it, Rep. Barton, reportedly having stripped the bill of any real mandate for environmental research, paid the necessary lip service to the vaccine issue: Examining the published studies, the non-partisan Institute of Medicine has concluded that the weight of the available evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between vaccines and autism.   However, I recognize that there is much that we do not know about the biological pathways and origins of this disorder, and that further investigation into all possible causes of autism is needed. Mr. Barton then went on at great length about his pet project of removing oversight for the NIH.  My take on it all is this.  Like its Senate counterpart by Sen. Enzi, Barton\u2019s colloquy was carefully crafted to give cover to those who were willing to support  any  bill.  While some may argue that he said vaccines can be examined, the bill says virtually nothing about any environmental causes. And placed in the context of Barton\u2019s strong language favoring NIH independence, what he\u2019s really saying is the NIH can study the vaccine connection  if they want to  . . .  and we all know just how much they want to. Apparently Mr. Barton and the House leadership learned one lesson from the Senate.  As you may recall, Sen. Dodd was allowed to make a mild counterpoint to the Sen. Enzi\u2019s colloquy, which some hoped would keep the vaccine/thimerosal issue alive politically.  The House wanted none of that.  My understanding from some web reports is that Rep. Dan Burton was not allowed to speak in favor of the bill.  That\u2019s right; I said a supporter of the bill was not allowed to speak even though there was time left for further comment.   But the statement he prepared to give has been posted  here .  After praising the bill as a step forward, Rep. Burton had this to say: Even so, while a needed step forward, this is not a perfect bill, because I believe we are missing a crucial opportunity to use this bill to help unravel the mystery of autism.  Specifically, while the bill before us does include language on the need to research the environmental factors which may contribute to autism, it does not include a specific mandate that environmental research topics must include vaccines, other biologics, and their preservatives. Now I am not against vaccinations, but I do believe, as do many of my colleagues that there is a strong link between the mercury contained in a product called thimerosal commonly used as a vaccine preservative and children developing neurological disorders such as autism. In fact, my own grandson became autistic after receiving 9 shots in one day, 7 of which contained thimerosal. Because of what happened to my grandson I took it upon myself to learn about autism and what I discovered during my research was deeply disturbing.  During my tenure as Chairman of Government Reform Committee (1997-2002), and as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights & Wellness (2003-2005), a number of very credible national and international scientists testified at a series of hearings that the mercury in vaccines is a contributing factor to developing neurological disorders, including, but not limited to, modest declines in intelligence quotient (IQ), autism, and Alzheimer's Disease.  And the body of evidence to support that conclusion gets larger every day. Yet we continue to hear repeatedly in Congressional hearings, in media communications, and through government and scientific reports that \u201cthere is no evidence that proves a connection between vaccines and autism.\u201d  This conclusion is not too surprising when you consider that our health agencies seem to routinely dismiss out of hand any scientific study that does conclude thimerosal is a danger. Experience tells us that, as with any other epidemic, while there may be underlying genetic susceptibilities, there usually is some type of environmental trigger as well, such as a virus, fungus, heavy metals, pollutants, or whatever.  There has never, to the best of my knowledge, been a purely genetic epidemic.  So, genetics alone cannot explain how we went from 1 in 10,000 children with autism spectrum disorders twenty years ago to 1 in 166 today.  Considering that mercury is a base element and the most toxic substance known to science outside of radioactive materials, it is biologically plausible that mercury is an environmental trigger of autism. Recent studies indicate that more than half of pediatricians said that in the previous year they had encountered at least one family that refused all vaccines, while 85 percent said they\u2019d had a parent turn down at least one shot. Whether it's because of fear that mercury used as a preservative in childhood vaccines causes autism, or that the dangers of immunizations far outweigh their benefits, or that there is a conspiracy by drug companies, doctors and vaccine makers to conceal the harm, the facts are clear, more and more American families are fighting immunization. It is imperative that we do all we can to restore the public's trust in vaccinations.  And the only way we are going to resolve the conflict of opinion over thimerosal is through more research.  Unfortunately, if the Department of Health and Human Services never funds or conducts the right studies, and given their current track record on the subject that is very likely what will happen, this question will forever remain unanswered.  That will be a national tragedy because often once an environmental cause is discovered, immediate steps can be taken to prevent new cases and abate the epidemic.  In addition, knowledge of the environmental cause or triggers often leads directly to more effective treatments. For example, this bill promotes the use of evidence-based interventions for those at higher risk for autism. However, so long as we ignore the potential danger of mercury many biomedical interventions, such as restricted diet, applied kinesiology and/or chelation therapy \u23af which many families have found to be the best treatments for their children with autism \u23af will be excluded from the list of evidence-based treatments. I stand here today not just as a concerned grandfather of an autistic child but as the voice for the hundreds of parents and families who continue to contact my office looking for help for their children. They are our constituents, we represent them in the People's House, and I hope we are all listening to them. The debate about mercury in vaccines must be addressed, investigated and resolved. Parents have a right to know what happened to their children regardless of where the truth lies. And we have a responsibility to those children and families already suffering.

{"date": "Sunday, May 18, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      A recent  article in the Star Tribune , in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, speaks to a problem that is far too common:  a problem of interest to all families of autistic individuals. The Race family in St. Cloud, Minnesota attends church services, Mass at the local Catholic parish in their case, as a family.  Their family includes 13-year old Adam.  Adam is autistic. In 2005, the Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Cloud presented Carol Race, Adam\u2019s mother, with an award, recognizing: . . .  her efforts to encourage families with disabled children to attend mass, she said. The award cited her \u201cuntiring efforts ... to educate and advocate for others who have children with disruptive disabilities such as autism and seek to participate as a total family at Sunday mass.\u201d What a difference a couple of years makes. Last summer, their parish priest, the Rev. Daniel Walz, appeared at the Race\u2019s doorstep with a temporary restraining order, intended to keep Adam away from services at the church. It is beyond ironic that the Church, which adamantly would resist the jurisdiction of civil courts on issues of internal governance, seems to have no problem turning to those same civil courts when trying to add a little oomph to its internal decrees. Carol Race was, to say the least, perturbed at the lack of understanding on the part of Father Walz: \u201cHe said that we did not discipline our son.  He said that our son was physically out of control and a danger to everyone at church,\u201d she said.  \u201cI can\u2019t discipline him out of his autism, and I think that\u2019s what our priest is expecting.\u201d The Race family defied the order, and they are likewise defying a permanent restraining order that was issued.  They continue to attend Mass as a family, doing their best to keep Adam\u2019s occasional meltdowns under control.  They have asked the Diocese to rescind the order, but the only response was a release described in the Star Tribune article: A statement released by the Diocese of St. Cloud said the church filed the petition \u201cas a last resort out of a growing concern for the safety of parishioners and other community members due to disruptive and violent behavior on the part of that child.\u201d \u201cThat child,\u201d as the Diocese calls Adam, is as much a child of God as anyone who joins others to worship.   In the article, Rev. Walz describes the nature of the problems Adam\u2019s behavior raises.  It also provides the Race\u2019s explanation of those behaviors.  The family\u2019s explanation has the ring of truth for anyone who has spent time around an autistic youngster, or who has taken the time to try and understand. Could Adam\u2019s parents have handled some of the \u201cdisturbances\u201d in a better way?  Maybe, but I\u2019m not ready to make that call when I don\u2019t know the complete background.  One thing is sure, however; taking the Race family to court will not bring anyone \u23af not the Race family, not the other parishioners, and certainly not Father Walz \u23af any closer to the Kingdom of Heaven.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.startribune.com/local/19033344.html?page=1&c=y"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/05/what-you-do-unto-least-of-these.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t WHAT YOU DO UNTO THE LEAST OF THESE . . .\n\t \n    "},

I have always been a fan of comics in all forms:  comic books, editorial cartoons, and the \u201cfunny pages.\u201d  My new favorite, though, is a free strip on the internet called  The Chelation Kid .

What there is of scientific and medical discussion is somewhat oversimplified, but I\u2019m not going there for education in those areas.  It\u2019s a comic strip. Undeniably, there is a bit of anger directed at the government and Big Pharma, particularly in a fantasy sequence in episodes 12 through 15.  I understand that the creators are not advocating violence of the sort implied in those panels.  It\u2019s a comic strip. Comics often take on serious subjects.  It helps us to place things in perspective, provided it stays within the bounds of propriety.   The Chelation Kid  does that well. Although the story is told from a father\u2019s viewpoint, it is not a pity party.  The hero is young Jack, and the story is about his transformation from Autism Lad into the Chelation Kid.

{"date": "Monday, March 13, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      As I have made clear on a number of occasions, I most assuredly am not a scientist.  Like most people with a decent and well-rounded education, however, I am capable of understanding how science works.   I have been worried about how long it would be before we can gain a complete understanding of autism spectrum disorders because of the differences in clinical indications among autistic individuals.  Finally, it seems that someone in the scientific community gets it.  The  M.I.N.D. Institute  (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) at the University of California, Davis announced a new project last week.  The  press release  read, in part: Called the Autism Phenome Project, the large-scale, longitudinal study will enroll 1,800 children \u23af 900 with autism, 450 with developmental delay and 450 who are typically developing \u23af who will undergo a thorough medical evaluation in addition to systematic analyses of their immune systems, brain structures and functions, genetics, environmental exposures and blood proteins.  Children will be 2 to 4 years old when they begin participating in the study, and their development will continue to be evaluated over the course of several years.  The first phase of the research is funded by the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute and philanthropic donations. \u201cChildren with autism clearly are not all the same,\u201d said David G. Amaral, research director of the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute and co-director of the project. \u201cThe tremendous variation leads us to believe that autism is a group of disorders rather than a single disorder \u23af several autisms versus one autism.  We are determined to provide the specific biomedical and behavioral criteria that accurately define distinct subtypes.\u201d I am not as familiar as I would like to be with the Institute.  My general impression is, though , that regardless of the leanings of any individual faculty members, the M.I.N.D. Institute as a whole has shown a very balanced approach to the various controversies surrounding what many of us believe to be an epidemic.  The divergent viewpoints of cognitive behaviorists and biomedical scientists have all been entertained with an apparent aim to find the truth.   Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to the truth.  Findings after several years will, frankly, come too late for many of us to make practical use of them with our children.  Even so, this project, in the words of Dr. Amaral, hopes to \u201cshorten by decades the road to discovering the causes and treatments of autism.\u201d  Until the Phenome Project has published its findings, and perhaps afterward, the bitter arguments over causes and treatments will continue.  We can only hope that the individual members of the team can lay their egos aside to keep their eyes on the prize, that their eventual findings will actually provide a true insight into ASD, and that those of us who have a stake in the answers can all lay our individual egos aside to accept the truth if the truth is indeed laid before us.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/index.html", "http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/518634/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/03/seeking-truth.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t SEEKING THE TRUTH\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Saturday, March 24, 2007", "body": "\n\t \n      A couple of weeks ago, the April issue of  Discover  published an article, now available on-line, called \u201c Autism: It\u2019s Not Just in the Head .\u201d  In it, Jill Neimark examines the relatively recent emphasis on researching the link between genetics and environment, and the implications for new treatment modalities. In one way, the field seems like a free-for-all, staggeringly disordered because it is littered with so many possibilities. But one can distill a few revolutionary insights. First, autism may not be rigidly determined but instead may be related to common gene variants, called polymorphisms, that may be derailed by environmental triggers. Second, affected genes may disturb fundamental pathways in the body and lead to chronic inflammation across the brain, immune system, and digestive system. Third, inflammation is treatable. Ms. Neimark does not mention the \u201cv\u201d word in her article, with environmental factors being discussed more generally.  That\u2019s probably how it should be, for we won\u2019t begin to understand the causative impact of particular environmental insults until we understand the processes by which those insults trigger adverse effects.  It seems self-evident, however, that injecting toxins and metals directly into the body is just as dangerous, if not more so, than airborne exposure.  That is, it would seem self-evident as long as you\u2019re not one of those people who believe that ethylmercury is \u201cthe good kind of mercury.\u201d In any event, the  Discover  article is not deep science, and doesn\u2019t blaze any new trails.  It is, however, very readable and understandable.  Although it give an idea as to the direction new biomedical treatments are heading, no preferences or recommendations are made.  There is an implicit recognition that each autistic child presents a unique clinical picture.  And for those of us who sometimes get giddy with excitement over new possibilities, there is a dose of realism: Not surprisingly, there has been criticism of the biomedical approach, especially when doctors promise too much or parents hope too desperately for recovery. As [Dr. Jill] James notes, one mother killed herself after seeking every possible treatment for her autistic daughter to no avail, causing a furor among parents with autistic children. Some children just do not get better, no matter what the intervention. Elizabeth Mumper is CEO of a group called Advocates for Children and former director of pediatric education at the Lynchburg Family Practice Program affiliated with the University of Virginia. Of the 2,000 children in her practice, about 400 have autism spectrum disorders. She describes one boy whom \u201cI have not helped despite my best efforts. He is 17 and still nonverbal and has horrible, erosive esophagitis in spite of the fact that he works very closely with a gastroenterologist. He has to sleep standing up and leaning over his dresser because of the pain, and he has very idiosyncratic reactions to medications. And even though he is nonverbal, he can type anything to me. He\u2019s alpha-smart. The horror is that he\u2019s trapped in a body that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cI hate the term \u2018full recovery,\u2019\u201d James adds, \u201cbecause of this false hope. Some children do lose the diagnosis, but that\u2019s rare. I don\u2019t think that should be out there as a goal. We need to accept [the kids] and love them for who they are\u2014because they are lovable. They\u2019re quirky.\u201d Yes, my quirky son is lovable, and my acceptance and love for him is unconditional.  That being said, I wouldn\u2019t call my hope \u201cfalse;\u201d it is quite real.  I am realistic.  \u201cCure\u201d is not a result; it is a process.  Speaking of \u201ccure\u201d as a result rather than a process is a sure way to start arguments.  Every time a video hits the net showing a recovered kid, there\u2019s always a flood of comments as to how that child isn\u2019t recovered because he or she does this or doesn\u2019t do that.  It gets to the point of the absurd (\u201comigod, that kid\u2019s playing with Star Wars toys\u201d).  Oddly enough, the ones who go to such lengths to debunk stories of recovery are those who accuse us of wanting our child to be \u201cnormal,\u201d meaning just like every other child. Well, just maybe there are parents who understand the relative nature of recovery and who understand that quirkiness \u23af unlike full-blown autism \u23af is not disabling. I\u2019m not sure where the process will lead us.  But I am convinced that my son\u2019s life is better \u23af and will be better \u23af because we have engaged in the process of cure.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://discovermagazine.com/2007/apr/autism-it2019s-not-just-in-the-head"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2007/03/understanding-brain-gut-connection.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN-GUT CONNECTION\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 19, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       As Patrick Sullivan, Jr.  recently reported at the Pat Sullivan Blog , the FDA, after years of stonewalling, agreed to conduct hearings on the neurotoxicity from mercury-containing dental amalgams.  When I read that, my first reaction was that their decision was probably already made, but I wondered if maybe I was just becoming a bit too jaded by the duck-and-cover tactics used by government regulators.  Could this be a genuine attempt to determine the truth, one way or the other?  Now it appears that my initial skepticism may have been well-placed. This week, the  Associated Press reported  that two separate studies were released that indicate amalgams are safe.  Perhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence, but what are the odds that the FDA would reverse their position on holding hearings shortly before two \u23af not one, but two \u23af reports are released that would tend to vindicate the agency\u2019s long-standing position? It\u2019s worth noting that both studies were funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, which is part of the National Institutes of Health (the same people that brought us the Institute of Medicine). Of course, the timing of the studies and the hearings do not necessarily show a problem.  What if the studies are correct, and amalgams really pose no danger?  The answer to that obviously depends on the methodology used in the studies.  For example, do the researchers take into account any differences between patients with intact fillings and those whose amalgams may have cracked (and yes, that does happen)?   I have not yet read the reports themselves, but the AP story gives a few clues as to the value of these studies.  The leader of one of the studies, Dr. Sonja McKinlay of the New England Research Institutes, noted that \u201cwhile the study revealed children with the mercury fillings had higher mercury levels in their urine, there was no evidence they had a higher incidence of kidney damage.\u201d  Was kidney damage the only problem they looked at?   We know that the other study, focusing on children in Portugal, supposedly looked for neurological problems, but how rigorous were the criteria? The most telling indication lies in the following excerpt from the AP article: Neither study examined autism.  Dr. David Bellinger, an author of the New England study, said that autism so rare that it wouldn\u2019t be expected to be found among the number of children studied.  Also, any children with autism would have been eliminated from the study, as would other children with prior neurological disorders. So let\u2019s get this straight.  In order to determine the risk of neurotoxicty, a study is going to ignore the prime suspect in the constellation of possible adverse reactions.  That\u2019s like conducting a study to determine of there are adverse autoimmune problems that might result from cigarette use, but excluding lung cancer and emphysema.   Even if the researchers excluded only pre-existing cases of autism from their work, they have missed the opportunity to determine whether exposure to mercury from amalgams might exacerbate autistic dysfunction.  But maybe that was the point. I plan to read these studies in the not-too-distant future, and I will amend this in the comments or in a new post if I am doing the researchers any great injustice.  I have seen, however, a commentary by Dr. Herbert Needleman, apparently printed in JAMA, which points out a few of the problems with the studies, including the fact that there is no provision for measuring the impact on children with a genetic predisposition to mercury toxicity.  Sound familiar?

{"date": "Tuesday, July 11, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      It has been often said that getting different groups of people within the greater autism community to agree on anything is like herding cats.  Some of the best cat herding to date occurred in the last couple of months in 2005, when  several advocacy groups , including some with vastly different agendas, got together to see if they could come together to help Congress revise the pending Combating Autism Act.  Those groups helped turn what had been a mere opportunity for Congressional showboating into a piece of proposed legislation that could actually accomplish something.  The language that the groups all agreed to support was far from perfect, but it was a dramatic step in the right direction. Although it was not the focus of the Act, a small section of the bill encouraged \u23af but did not necessarily mandate \u23af research into the possible role of environmental insults, including vaccines and their components, in triggering ASD.  The inclusion of that language reflected a view that the debate must be settled once and for all, in a manner that could be deemed trustworthy.  Herding cats is one thing.  Herding senators is something else altogether.  Most Washington insiders predicted that the bill would never pass if it included the vaccine language, but still hopes ran high. The latest word from the Capitol is that the final draft will not include the vaccine language.  It seems that some senators are more concerned with avoiding questions than with looking for answers.  The following is the text of a letter my wife and I faxed to our senators, Mary Landrieu and David Vitter. Dear Senators Landrieu and Vitter: As constituents and as the parents of a child on the autism spectrum, we are grateful that you have both co-sponsored the Combating Autism Act (\u201cCAA\u201d).  As you are probably aware, it is estimated that one out of every 166 children born will eventually be diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder, and in many cases those diagnoses may be preventable. To say that the possible role of various environmental factors \u23af particularly vaccines (both thimerosal-containing and live-virus) \u23af is a controversial subject would be a gross understatement.  The participation of the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) and National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) (through the Institute of Medicine) in the debate have served only to foster feelings of suspicion and distrust toward the government-supported institutions that should lead the way to the truth of the matter.  The purpose of this letter is not to convince you that those causal connections have been proven, but rather to highlight the ongoing nature of the controversy, and how actions being taken in the Senate may hinder the resolution of the controversy. The original introduction of the CAA was a noble idea that left much to be desired.  Several autism advocacy groups identified deficiencies in the original bill, and worked with members of Congress to fashion a compromise bill that can move the nation toward answers and solutions.  The bill provided for doubling NIH spending on autism research, empowering the Director of the NIH to act as an \u201cautism czar,\u201d creating a screening program in all 50 states for the early identification of children with autism, funding the efforts of the Autism Treatment Network to identify the best medical practices in the treatment of autistic kids, continuing funding of the epidemiological and public education programs on autism at the CDC, establishing \u201ccenters of excellence,\u201d and authorizing nearly $1,000,000,000 of federal spending on autism over the next five years on programs ranging from public awareness and early diagnosis to basic biomedical research.   The compromise bill includes two important provisions that would go far in restoring confidence in Congress and the scientific institutions it funds.   A monitoring process will provide much needed transparency to the manner in which the Director of the NIH fulfills the duties placed upon that office.  The second important provision indicates that the research conducted by the centers of excellence \u201cshould include \u2026 research on a broad array of environmental factors that have a possible role in autism, including but not limited to vaccines, other biological and pharmaceutical products, and their components (including preservatives).\u201d The compromise bill is significant in that 21 separate organizations, many of which do not concern themselves with the issues of a possible causal connection between vaccine components and autism, were able to agree on the best way to move this country past the stage of debating about autism, and instead concentrate on dealing with this serious problem.  No one organization can act as the \u201cvoice\u201d of the autism community, nor can it be said that the 21 organizations who support the compromise bill speak for all families of autism.  But the agreement was as close to a consensus as can be reasonably expected. Unfortunately, it appears that some Senators do not fully appreciate this historic opportunity to help their nation move past the debate.  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (\u201cHELP\u201d) Committee is scheduled to release its official draft of the CAA on July 12, 2006, with final revisions to be considered at a committee session on July 19, 2006.  Reports from the Capitol indicate that the committee will drop the language directing research into the role of environmental factors, including vaccines and their components, from the final draft.   If that is the proposed language is removed from the bill, the United States Senate will have sent a terrible message to the American people.  That message will be that political expediency trumps the need to discover the truth.   In the past ten months, you have both been forceful advocates for the rebuilding of our state.  We now ask that you become advocates for our son, and for the countless families who want answers for as to why their children are autistic, and what can be done.  We ask that you use whatever influence you may have to convince the HELP Committee leave the compromise language in place.  Failing that, we ask that you take action on the floor of the United States Senate to restore the compromise language. Thank you for your consideration. I\u2019ll let you know what kind of a response we get. UPDATE: As might be expected, we have heard nothing from our senators.  In general, the news from Washington has been sparse and not very encouraging.  On the morning of July 12th, Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut stated on Imus in the Morning that he was not aware that the vaccine language was being taken out of the CAA, and that he would \u201cfight tooth and nail\u201d to keep it in.  Apparently, if he fought, it was not enough.  Although it is near impossible to get any definitive word on what exact changes were made to the language of the bill, the word has been that the vaccine language is out. Of course, there is one man who can probably manage to restore the directive to research the possible connection:  Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.  He was one of the original sponsors of the CAA, and has been posturing as a friend to the various advocacy groups since then.   It would be an understatement to say that Senator Santorum\u2019s stated interest in exploring the controversy has been met with some degree of skepticism.  This would be the perfect opportunity for him to prove his detractors wrong.  To that end, it is probably a good time to remind one and all what Senator Santorum had to say back on June 16, 2006: . . . We need to invest more science in determining the potential causes or triggers of autism, and see where that science leads us.  That means taking a more intensive look at things like environmental causes, neuroscience, specific treatments, and the role of genetics. We can\u2019t look at some environmental factors and possible causes, while ignoring others.  How about it, Senator?  Why don\u2019t we \u201csee where that science leads us?\u201d\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.combatautism.org/site/c.adJCKONvFoG/b.1315763/k.4F9/Consensus_Statement.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/07/updated-of-cats-and-congress-open.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t (Updated) OF CATS AND CONGRESS:  AN OPEN LETTER ON THE COMBATING AUTISM ACT\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Friday, June 09, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      The latest article by Dan Olmsted, entitled  The Age of Autism: Gardasil vs. Hep B , highlights how our nation\u2019s health-care policy sometimes is the product more of politics and economics than good sense.  This time, Mr. Olmsted writes of last week\u2019s approval of the Gardasil vaccine, designed to prevent the spread of human papillomavirus (\u201cHPV\u201d), a sexually transmitted disease that is believed to cause cervical cancer.   The Food and Drug Administration approved the new vaccine for use in girls who have reached nine years of age, and therein lies the point of the story.  As Mr. Olmsted writes, \u201cthe decision to wait till the cusp of adolescence to give the shot seems sensible \u23af and drives home the contrary approach that the CDC has taken with the hepatitis B vaccination mandated for every newborn child.\u201d Once again, Mr. Olmsted hits the bull\u2019s eye. If one accepts the need for a vaccine against HPV, there certainly seems to be no pressing reason to use it on children at an age they will not be involved in sexual activity.  Likewise, Hep-B is spread primarily through unprotected sex and intravenous drug use.  Yet the powers that be seem to believe it\u2019s a good idea to inoculate every single child on day one, regardless of whether their parents have tested positive for the Hep-B virus.  Many observers and researchers believe a rapid increase in the prevalence of autism is noticeable around the time the Hep-B vaccine was introduced onto the schedule.  Had we known then what I know now, my wife and I would not have allowed our infant son to receive the thimerosal-containing Hep-B vaccine in his first few hours of life.  We would have gladly agreed to keep him away from unprotected sex and IV-drug use for a few years. Even now when the Hep-B vaccine contains only \u201ctrace\u201d amounts of thimerosal, is it really a good idea to inject any vaccine into a child whose immune system is not yet developed?  Moreover, if we assume for the sake of discussion that thimerosal and vaccines have nothing whatsoever to do with autism, is there any good reason to risk a possible adverse reaction from a vaccine that isn\u2019t necessary so early in life?  Why do we need to immediately vaccinate against a risk a child will not encounter for a decade or more?  Is it good sense, or is it politics and economics?\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.washingtontimes.com/upi/20060605-053515-2973r.htm"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/06/inconsistent-vaccine-policy.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t AN INCONSISTENT VACCINE POLICY\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Monday, January 14, 2008", "body": "\n\t \n      The other day, I came across a  story from  The Shreveport Times , discussing the biomedical interventions of one parent making progress utilizing biomedical interventions with her autistic daughter.  Although supplements and chelation therapy were mentioned, the focus was on the gluten-free/casein-free (GFCF) diet.  It was a relatively balanced report, which noted that even GFCF would necessarily help every child.  What interested me were quotes from experts outside of the DAN! world. One occupational therapist, Suzanne McMillan, had this observation about kids on the GFCF diet: McMillian has noticed marked changes in some children on the diet and others not so dramatic. \u201cBut one thing that is noticeable is if they\u2019ve been on the diet for a consistent amount time and then eat something off the diet, you can tell,\u201d she said.  \u201cI do recommend they talk to their (regular pediatrician); that\u2019s the responsible thing to do.\u201d Those comments, no doubt, struck a familiar chord with every parent who has noticed positive results from the diet.  Gluten infractions can ruin a day.  Although Ms. McMillan is correct that any part of an overall biomedical plan, including implementing a GFCF diet, should be subject to medical guidance, I have to question whether most pediatricians are really going to consider doing anything but roll their eyes and sigh.  Still, the Shreveport reporter managed to find one, Dr. Margaret Crittell, who seems to have an open mind: But when Kelly\u2019s then 2-year-old daughter came in for a visit after about a week on the diet, Crittell wasn't expecting what she saw. \u201cI called her name and she looked at me and started interacting with me,\u201d Crittell said. \u201cBefore she\u2019d always looked past me and there was no interaction.  It was interesting to me and hopefully more research will be done.\u201d While anecdotes are not definitive, overnight improvement is observed often enough that serious attention must be paid.  Unfortunately, not every physician is as willing as Dr. Crittell to challenge the conventional thinking that pervades \u201cmainstream\u201d medicine.  The article quotes an academic gastroenterologist as saying he \u201c believes any positive changes that parents are seeing may be answered by the placebo effect .\u201d Huh?!?  Does he really think a child between the ages of two and four has enough understanding of the reason Mommy and Daddy are feeding him/her different foods that the child will think he/she should be feeling an easing of autistic symptoms?  Can the sudden onset of speech and social engagement \u23af which has been noticed at various ages upon starting the diet \u23af be just a trick of the mind? I grew up in an academic family.  I\u2019ve known enough people with advanced degrees to know that the educational process is not necessarily a vaccination against ignorance.  Still, I shudder when I see such ignorance and closed-mindedness running rampant.  A little skepticism is not a bad thing when determining a scientific question.  But to assume something is not genuine because properly designed controlled studies have not yet been performed is the height of ignorance.  The self-proclaimed skeptics love to say that some of our minds are so open that our brains must be falling out.  It\u2019s a cute little joke.  Still, one has to wonder how anyone can see when they are keeping their eyes shut because there haven\u2019t been five replicated studies to prove that a little light helps a person see. As I often say, there are none so double-blind than those who will not see.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/yu9yus"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2008/01/are-you-going-to-believe-your-own-eyes.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE YOUR OWN EYES OR ONLY WHAT YOU\u2019RE TOLD?\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Monday, May 01, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       My brother,  John Rankin , is a relatively well-known guitarist in New Orleans.  One of my favorite\u2019s of his original tunes is an instrumental entitled, \u201cLast of April, First of May.\u201d  For those \u201cin the know,\u201d the title needs no explanation, especially once you feel the rhythms of the song, which manage to be laid-back and exciting at the same time.  It\u2019s a groove we feel around these parts every year during the last weekend of April through the first weekend of May.  It\u2019s JazzFest. The  New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival , better known as JazzFest, began in 1970 with a series of night concerts and a two-day \u201cheritage fair,\u201d a celebration of music, food, and crafts, in what was then known as Beauregard Square (it has since reverted to its original name of Congo Square), which can lay claim to being the true birthplace of jazz.   It was in Congo Square that, in antebellum days, slaves were allowed to gather in the evening to dance and play the music of their native Africa.  They kept the rhythm alive, and it eventually morphed with other musical styles into what we now know as jazz, the single greatest contribution New Orleans made to the world \u23af and perhaps the greatest cultural contribution any city has ever made. Well-know JazzFest lore holds that there were more performers than spectators in the first year.  But by 1972, the fair grew to the point at which a larger location was necessary, and a move was made to the Fair Grounds, one of the oldest thoroughbred horse racing tracks in the country.  The place suited the festival well.   My mother , who was a volunteer with the festival for the first several years and who loved it dearly for the rest of her days, often spoke of her feelings about crossing the track onto the infield and feeling like she was stepping into another country.  She always felt her description lacked something.  Big Mama was not one to use phrases like \u201cparallel universe,\u201d but I think that was the point she was trying to make.  The Fair Grounds became a place where magic occurs. I began attending JazzFest in 1973 at the tender age of 16 (oops, now you know how ancient I am).  I had grown up on traditional jazz but had developed a real taste fro the blues, and my mother assured me there would be something to my liking out there.  It was a lesson in the real thing; I was introduced to players like Snooks Eaglin and Gatemouth Brown.  Everywhere I wandered around the multiple stages, a new sound enticed me over.  Then something happened that changed the way I thought of the \u201clast of April\u201d from then on. Because I was in the right place at the right time to hear the right rumor, I stayed close to a particular stage that was supposed to be empty.  What we were treated to was an unannounced jam session, led by B.B. King, featuring Professor Longhair, Roosevelt Sykes, and Bukka White, and ably backed by George Porter and Zigaboo Modeliste (the bassist and drummer for the Meters).  To borrow an apt phrase from the liturgy of baptism, I was sealed as JazzFest\u2019s own forever.  I learned that the essence of JazzFest was not the music; it was the moment. Over the years, JazzFest continued to grow to take two weekends.  The nighttime concerts were eventually jettisoned altogether.  The stages got larger and more numerous, and the people \u23af meaning both big-name performers and crowds \u23af came in ever-growing quantities.  But throughout it all, it was the moments that defined my JazzFest experiences.   Eight months ago, of course, everything changed in New Orleans.  To make JazzFest happen this year, the once unthinkable occurred and a \u201cpresenting sponsor\u201d came in to help underwrite the festival (leading to the ubiquitous but relatively tasteful appearance of logos by an oil company).  That really wasn\u2019t too difficult a pill to swallow considering the sale of naming rights for the various stages in recent years (you can tell the old-timers who still refer to the \u201cAccura stage\u201d as \u201cStage Four\u201d).  The real changes were to eliminate Thursday from the second week, and the cutting and/or consolidation of some of the stages. Still, I had faith that I would find at least one good \u201cJazzFest moment\u201d this year.  I just didn\u2019t know I would find so many in the first weekend. There were moments that connected me to Jazzfests past.  Clarence \u201cFrogman\u201d Henry has reached the point in life where he now needs a walker to go out onto the stage, but once there he can still \u201csing like a frog\u201d or \u201csing like a girl\u201d to the utter delight of an appreciative crowd. I\u2019m not sure how old Snooks Eaglin  actually is, but he is still one of the most inventive masters of the blues guitar anywhere, just as he was at my very first JazzFest.  He is certainly the only one I\u2019ve ever heard play flamenco-inspired arpeggios in the middle of a funky R&B song. Once again, I was able to dance with my wife to the sounds of Rosie Ledet, the Zydeco sweetheart.  Rosie may not be that old a performer, but she quickly became a fixture at JazzFest in the mid-nineties.  Her recordings have never captured the irresistible charm of her live performances, and she did not disappoint this year. Then there were the moments that let me know the traditions would outlive any of the performers I saw this year.  The Mahogany Jazz Band served notice that the venerable traditions of the New Orleans streets were in good hands.  And somewhere up in Zydeco heaven, Clifton Chenier, who was part of a great JazzFest moment in an amazing performance shortly before he died, must have been grinning ear-to-ear as his son, C.J. led the current incarnation of the Red Hot Louisiana Band through a hot set. Some of the moments were a bit mixed.  One of my particular favorites,  the subdudes , who provided many great JazzFest moments over the last several years, played an awesome set to a somewhat rude audience of teenagers waiting for Dave Matthews.  Scattered around were pockets of true fans who did what we could to make sure the guys knew their efforts were appreciated. Sometimes the JazzFest moments are just that:  mere moments.  I recall seeing Babe Stovall back in 1974.  Babe was a bluesman who sang on the streets and in the clubs of the French Quarter.  He ordinarily played a steel-bodied National resonator guitar, but it was stolen and Babe was playing a cheap pawn-shop special in his JazzFest performance.  Halfway through the set, someone passed up a brand new National to Babe.  That was a moment that etched itself in my heart as well as my mind:  the type of moment one does not expect to experience at every JazzFest.  This year there were two. On Saturday, my brother,  John , played his 23rd JazzFest.  It was a typically fine performance that produced a moment about halfway through when he sang \u201cLouisiana 1927,\u201d Randy Newman\u2019s song about the suffering of Louisianians as the result of floodwaters pouring through a long-ago break in the levees.  The location names are a little different, but it is a song that has been especially poignant for us in what we call \u201cthe Post-K era.\u201d  I\u2019ve heard John sing the song many times before, but never better.  In the midst of a badly damaged neighborhood, the audience knew what it was hearing.  There was a collective sharp intake of breath upon the opening verse, respectful silence through the song, and a heartfelt round of applause at the end. The other moment came the next day at an amazing set by  Bruce Springsteen and the Seeger Sessions Band .  Just going to that set was quite a decision given that the original  Meters  were playing at another stage.  But in the words I saw on a t-shirt this year, \u201cJudge not your JazzFest by the greatness of what you have seen, but by the greatness of what you have missed to see it.\u201d  (Indeed, on Saturday, I passed up seeing the great Hugh Masekela, who I saw performing brilliantly just two years ago at the Fest, to see other acts.)  My plan was to start out at the Springsteen set and then high-tail it to catch the end of the Meters\u2019 performance, but I knew I was witnessing something important halfway through the Boss\u2019 performance. To begin with, I am a big fan of both Bruce Springsteen and Pete Seeger.  When I heard that Springsteen was recording an album of traditional folk songs as a tribute to Mr. Seeger, I was naturally intrigued.  Booking this act seemed a natural considering the charismatic performances delivered by Mr. Seeger in past JazzFests (talk about your moments).  The performance this year by what can only be called a folk orchestra (folkchestra?) exceeded all my expectations.   The Seeger Sessions Band, in addition to Mr. Springsteen, consists of guitars, violins/fiddles, banjo, dobro and steel guitar, keyboards and accordian, upright bass, drums, and a full horn section.  The sound was a mixture of bluegrass, zydeco, country, the blues, anglo-american folk music, and traditional jazz.  In local parlance, it was a gumbo.  In fact, it was all the music that makes for a good JazzFest being played simultaneously in a way that it sounded like one music.  Then, we had the rarest of all JazzFest experiences:  a moment within a moment. Throughout the set. Mr. Springsteen made spoken and musical references, some of them overtly political, about our recent experience.  It was a nice way of letting us know we weren\u2019t forgotten, but that\u2019s been true of any number of musicians and celebrities.  At the beginning of the encore, however, came a song somewhat newer than many that had already been played:  Springsteen\u2019s \u201cCity of Ruins.\u201d  The song, chronicling the urban decay of Asbury Park, New Jersey, became an anthem of sorts for post 9-11 New York.  It could just as easily be speaking of post-K New Orleans: There is a blood red circle On the cold dark ground And the rain is falling down The church door\u2019s thrown open I can hear the organ\u2019s song But the congregation\u2019s gone My city of ruins My city of ruins Now the sweet bells of mercy Drift through the evening trees Young men on the corner Like scattered leaves, The boarded up windows, The empty streets While my brother\u2019s down on his knees My city of ruins My city of ruins Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! By the time we were told to \u201crise up,\u201d more than a few people had tears streaming down their faces.  The real moment came on the following lines: Now with these hands, With these hands, With these hands, I pray Lord With no prompting, nearly every person in the crowd at that stage, numbering at least 30,000, lifted their hands in prayer for a beloved city. Looking back at what I just wrote, I realize it sounds hokey or over-the-top.  I can\u2019t help that.  I was there to see the tears and to feel a shared emotion that was so real as to be palpable.  A couple of songs later, Bruce left us with an unusually mellow version of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In.\u201d  Quint Davis, who produces JazzFest, took the mike to repeat what has become the motto and mantra of this year\u2019s festival:  \u201cWitness the Healing Power of Music!\u201d  Sometimes, a lot of healing can occur in just a moment.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-1.1.jpg", "http://www.johnrankin.net/", "http://www.nojazzfest.com/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-2.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-3.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-4.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-5.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-6.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-7.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-7a.jpg", "http://www.subdudes.com/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-8.jpg", "http://www.johnrankin.net/", "http://www.brucespringsteen.net/news/index.html", "http://www.themetersonline.com/", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA-9.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/664/1400/1600/LOA--10.jpg"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/05/last-of-april.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t LAST OF APRIL\n\t \n    "},

{"date": "Thursday, May 18, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      The video entitled  Autism Every Day , if nothing else, has sparked a lively discussion within the autism community.  Some are understandably hesitant to praise something produced by  Autism Speaks , an organization that has yet to earn the trust of many who have been disappointed by too many institutions.   The criticism seems to take in two points:  that the controversy surrounding the role of thimerosal and vaccines should have been dealt with forthrightly, and that the video could be seen as a solicitation for pity.  One of the mothers who appeared on the video, Michele Iallonardi, posted a reply to some of that criticism on the Evidence of Harm board, and, with Michele\u2019s kind permission, I am quoting her in part below.  I am the mother of three children who have autism.  One has been vaccinated, two have been partly vaccinated.  I am very interested and involved in biomedical interventions.  They have been extremely helpful (we have been doing them for over two years) but my son, as you saw in the video, is far from recovered.  My other two children, who are recovering, have been through no biomedical interventions other than changing their diets.   My point is this \u23af when it comes to autism, there is no  one  answer for anything.  Recovery is not  only  about biomedical intervention \u23af maybe for some children, but not for everyone.  Autism does have a genetic component (how do you explain three brothers with autism?).  I do believe that thimerosal is a  huge  part of the problem (but not the only part) \u23af my son with the most vaccinations is the most affected.  But, no, I don\u2019t think that  all  children can recover biomedically.  And yes, some children do recover without any biomedical interventions at all.   My life is by no means \u201cpitiful.\u201d  I wrote an article in TAP (the autism perspective) magazine last year entitled \u201cI Have Three\u201d talking about just how wonderful my life is with my children.  Funny, I actually got flack about that article from some people (who have one child with autism, and were struggling to deal with that) saying that I was too positive (or delusional or crazy).  I have written several articles since then about all of the wonderful things parenting children with autism has brought into my life.  That being said, the reality is that life for my boys is difficult.  Most people that I know don\u2019t realize that.  Happiness is a choice, yes, and we are happy.  But being happy doesn\u2019t mean that it is easy for my son to sit through glutathione shots, eat special food, or live in a world where he can\u2019t effectively communicate.  I\u2019m happy, but I\u2019m not happy about that.  He is suffering \u23af and I can never sit by and just be completely happy when all that is going on.  I\u2019ll never settle and accept it either.  To quote another mom from the film: \u201cI'm never going to say I quit.  It\u2019s just not in my vocabulary.\u201d   To insinuate that I view my life as pitiful is just a hurtful statement that has no point.  What I view as pitiful is the time and energy spent (or wasted) in our community criticizing each other.  My own life is an example of both genetic and biomedical causes to autism.  My own life is an example of how happiness is a choice \u23af because we have certainly had four years from hell, with many medical problems, with three children diagnosed with autism in less than one year, but we are happier than most people I know.  We are broke, we hate watching our children suffer, and we go through things that most people \u23af even some on this list \u23af could never imagine.  That is the reality, and that is what the film wanted the public to understand.   Let\u2019s be honest; life would be easier if our kids didn\u2019t have autism, don\u2019t you think? One of my wife\u2019s great phrases is that she\u2019s not interested in a pity party; she wants to help our son get better.  I think that\u2019s similar to what Michele is trying to say. Like many, I remain somewhat wary of  Autism Speaks .  But they seem to be saying the right things about wanting to find the truth about the causes and cures for autism.  Could this video dealt more with the question of possible causes?  Of course.  But the point was to show one part of the spectrum.  Frankly, I\u2019m not too worried about the motive in making the film, because I just want people to know what life is like for some families with autism.

And now comes word of a new show that confirms my opinion of the genre.  The saving grace is it is apparently a one-time-only event. Some creative genius decided that America just hasn\u2019t had enough of O.J. Simpson, and created the show,  Juiced .  The hour-long program, which will be on pay-per-view (because there are some things even Fox TV won\u2019t touch), features the former A-list football player turned C-list \u201cactor\u201d turned murder suspect in a series of pranks.  Those who wish to pay for such \u201centertainment\u201d will see O.J. as an Elvis impersonator, O.J. disguised as an elderly man running a bingo game, and other such frivolity. One segment of the show, however, will sink television to a new low in taste.  Simpson will stand in a used-car lot trying to sell a very familiar looking white Bronco.  He tells one prospective buyer, \u201cIt was good for me \u23af it helped me get away.\u201d Gloria Allred, the attorney who represented the family of Nicole Brown Simpson in their civil suit against Simpson, has been quoted as hoping that some of O.J.\u2019s earnings from the show can go toward satisfying the large judgment in the Brown\u2019s favor, most of which is still unpaid.  But Ms. Allred should not hold out any hope.  The show\u2019s executive producer claims that Simpson was not paid for his appearance, and that he did it because \u201che wanted to have fun with it.\u201d Some may be skeptical of the claim that O.J. Simpson will not be paid for his efforts, but I can believe it.

{"date": "Monday, May 22, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      Up to now, I have refrained from posting anything about  the tragic death of Katherine McCarron .  My reticence stems partly from a feeling of respect for a family\u2019s grieving, but more from a complete lack of understanding about what could compel someone, who by all accounts was a devoted mother, to take the life of a beloved child. There have been many comments made in various places about the mental state of the mother, but that does not begin to provide an answer about her moral culpability, or lack thereof.  As a very general statement, I think the  McNaughton  rule, recognized by most American jurisdictions in determining sanity as an exculpatory defense, stands as one of the rare instances in which law and morality actually match up.  The test is whether an alleged perpetrator could appreciate the distinction between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d at the time of an otherwise criminal event.  That test is not satisfied if the defendant was unaware of a specific law, or if the defendant felt a mere moral justification.  Rather, the rule tests whether the specific individual was intellectually, mentally, and emotionally capable of understanding that the ethics and mores of society hold the act to be wrong.  My personal feeling has always been that any person who is capable of that understanding is under a moral obligation to seek help if he/she feels that he/she may have difficulty controlling an immoral or illegal impulse. As I write this post, the only information we have concerning the mother\u2019s mental state comes from press reports and internet hearsay.  That is not enough for me to state any kind of opinion about culpability, although I have to admit that my initial reaction to this event would make me a poor candidate to be a juror, at least from the defense standpoint.  Even knowing that a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict would not be equivalent to forgiving, I would simply have too hard a time not wanting to see some punishment for the death of a defenseless child.  That is my bias. Recognizing bias when discussing something this horrifying is important.  The reason I\u2019m writing about this now is  an announcement from the moderator of the Autism Hub , concerning a group effort concerning the tragedy.  For those who may unfamiliar with  the Autism Hub , it is a group of bloggers who wish to uphold the dignity of autistic individuals (hard to argue with that), but who generally do not believe in seeking a cure for autism (which, of course, leaves me out).  Despite some differences on the issue of appropriate interventions, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for many of the bloggers on the Hub, and I consider some of them to be good friends.  But I do have concerns about this undertaking.  This is how  Kev Leitch  announced the upcoming event:   Katherine McCarron was murdered by her mother on May 13th this year.  Katherine was three years old.  She was also autistic. On Wed this week, some Autism Hub members will be posting about this murder and about Katherine. On Thursday this week, Autism Hub will be \u2018shut\u2019 for 24 hours as a mark of respect for Katherine.  No posts will be collected and no feeds will work. Using the word \u201cmurder\u201d displays an inclination to prejudge the mother\u2019s guilt, which I can understand to some extent given my admitted tendency to do the same.  But I am more concerned that the understandable anger in some of the tributes may be misdirected toward extraneous and irrelevant agendas.  To clarify, that possibility for misdirection exists both for any given blogger and for any reader who chooses to leave a comment to one of the posts.  I can only hope that the focus will remain on the senselessness of this tragedy, which we can all agree on, without using this child to make a point having nothing to do with her life or death. I have no right to dictate the actions of anybody, so simply consider this a plea for restraint from a friend.  A child is dead because she was unable to defend herself from the one person she should have been able to trust more than anyone.  She cannot defend herself from being used by any of us to further our various causes.  Let the blogging be respectful and sensitive, particularly to a man who has certainly lost his precious daughter, and who also may have lost his wife as well. Rather than invite preemptive nastiness by anybody, I will take the unusual (for me at least) step of closing the comments to this post.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 04, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n       I have a lot of things on my mind these days, but they must take a back seat today.  It\u2019s the Fourth of July, Independence Day in the good ol\u2019 U.S. of A.  It is therefore more than appropriate to take a break from all the other stuff, and take a few moments to reflect on being an American (my apologies to my friends in the other \u201cAmericas;\u201d it\u2019s just too awkward to call ourselves United Statesians).   I remember learning to sing all of the patriotic songs in grammar school:  \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d \u201cMy Country \u2018Tis of Thee,\u201d \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d \u201cGrand Old Flag,\u201d etc.  Being the son of a historian, I was raised on tales of the patriots (or  whatever the 18th Century term for \u201cterrorists\u201d was, as they were probably known as in England) who founded our country on the principles of individual liberty.   As I grew older, however, the Vietnam conflict made patriotism a problematic concept.  It became difficult to separate our feelings about our nation from the way we felt about an undeclared war that left so many of our countrymen dead for an end we really couldn\u2019t understand.  Our feelings about the nation and its course were reflected in slogans:  \u201cMake Love, Not War\u201d versus \u201cAmerica:  Love It or Leave It.\u201d   The slogan that stayed with me through the years, at least in the sense that it provoked thought on my part, was \u201cMy Country, Right or Wrong.\u201d  It acknowledges that the governance of the United States is a human enterprise, subject to human error and human vices.  Issues will divide us, and sometimes our government may lose sight of the core principles on which the nation was founded, but we remain Americans. We learned a lot from one another in the disagreements over the Vietnam war.  Those who supported the policies that had us fighting in Southeast Asia learned that protesting was not necessarily \u201cun-American.\u201d  Those who thought the war to be a tragic mistake learned that they could not place the blame on the men and women whose job it was to carry out the country\u2019s stated policy.  Those lessons didn\u2019t come easy, and it took years before we could look back and understand those to be truths, but we did learn through a lot of reflection. To be sure there is still demagoguery among our politicians about the current military operations in Iraq, but the spirit of the people rises to the level where, no matter how we feel about the policies that have our men and women in harm\u2019s way, we honor those who honor the entire country by their service and sacrifice. I thought about the question of honor a few days ago while reading an essay in the July 3rd edition of  Time .  The  essay by retired Maj. General Robert Scales , argues that it is wrong to debate a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning at a time that so many flag-draped coffins are coming home.  General Scales does not address the wisdom \u23af or lack thereof \u23af of the Iraq operations.  As a career military man, he is more concerned with how the policy is carried out and our military supported, and he wants to ensure that the men and women who serve are honored by our elected officials.  The flag is not the property of our politicians, nor is it intended for those politicians to wrap themselves in.  It belongs to the people, and particularly to those who sacrificed for the people. That\u2019s a tall order.  Asking politicians of any party to keep their eyes on what really matters is often a forlorn enterprise.  If our elected officials were able to look at the big picture, our foreign policy would probably not have our military involved in all of the operations they must carry out today.  But we did not last 230 years, surviving all manner of fools in the White House and the halls of Congress, because of the wisdom of our leaders.  No, we have not lasted through the wisdom of our leaders but rather through the wisdom of the people.  Now that\u2019s worth celebrating.

I had heard of  Team Hoyt  before, and saw at least one television report about them.  When Rick Hoyt was born, the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, depriving him of oxygen.  His parents didn\u2019t accept that their son would be a \u201cvegatable\u201d or better off in an institution.  Through their persistence, Rick progressed, and learned to communicate through mechanical means.   While in high school, Rick told his father, Dick, that he wanted to participate in a five-mile run to benefit a local athlete who had been paralyzed in an accident.  Dick ran the race, pushing his son in a wheelchair, and Team Hoyt was born. Eventually, Dick and Rick began to run marathons, and later turned to the grueling triathlon.  Doing so required that Dick learn to swim.  They compete using a special wheelchair that Dick can push for the running leg, an inflatable boat that Dick pulls for the swim, and a modified bike with a seat for Rick in front of the handle bars.

{"date": "Monday, May 08, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      In the  last post , I wrote about the dangers autistics may have of being taken advantage of by those who may be ethically challenged.  Then I saw a  story out of Toronto  that illustrates the physical peril autistic children may find themselves in without appreciating the danger.   The caretaker of a 12 year-old autistic boy only left him alone for a few minutes.  That was enough time for the boy to fall to his death from the apartment building they were in.   What was the young man doing by the window?  Did he have any idea that there was any danger?  That we have no way of getting the answers makes the questions all the more frightening.  And now a family must deal with an inconceivable loss.  I can\u2019t begin to imagine their pain. As parents, we struggle with what is the right thing to do for our children.  My wife and I can \u201cchild proof\u201d the house we live in to some extent, but can we \u201cchild proof\u201d the world?  And what happens when we\u2019re not there to watch over our son? Looking at the words I just typed, I have to admit that it all sounds terribly melodramatic.  I can\u2019t help thinking, however, that the melodrama has become quite real for the family of a 12 year-old boy in Canada.  And I am so fearful because we seem to see these news items too often. Thinking about all of this, I went back to re-read a couple of posts I wrote last October, trying to explain  why  some of us go to lengths others see as extreme.  This is part of what I wrote back then: Yes, I\u2019m desperate.  I\u2019m desperate to help my son achieve a measure of independence.  I\u2019m desperate to prevent my son growing up to be nothing more than a victim.  I\u2019m desperate to see my son grow up with no barriers to hold him back.  In other words, I\u2019m a normal parent. Of course, I meant \u201cnormal\u201d in the sense of \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201ctypical,\u201d and not as a synonym for \u201cneurotypical.\u201d  I think the basic yearning to keep one\u2019s children safe is common to most parents, including parents who are, themselves, \u201con the spectrum.\u201d  If I was to write that same post today, I might drop the word \u201cnormal,\u201d but I would otherwise say the same thing. Zilari  left an interesting comment to my last post, respectfully pointing out that danger avoidance can be taught without the need of a \u201ccure.\u201d  In general, I can\u2019t disagree.  That kind of education is necessary for all children, particularly autistic children.  The effectiveness of that training, however, is sure to vary from child to child, just as similar efforts with neurotypical children vary in result.   Moreover, I\u2019m certainly not suggesting that danger avoidance is the only reason to seek a cure/remediation/abatement of symptoms/whatever term may seem appropriate.  Intervention is a decision that can only be made for individual children by weighing a variety of considerations, including all known risks. I pray that I\u2019m not doing anything to change the person my son really is.  That being said, I will gladly join in any effort to change the world to be a friendlier and safer place for all of its inhabitants.  Considering, though, that mankind has tried to recreate Eden or create a utopia from the beginning, I don\u2019t think it imprudent to do whatever I can to help my son reach a point at which the world is not a confusing and scary place \u23af a point at which he recognizes the good and the bad, the beautiful and the dangerous, and all the nuances in the world around him.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://torontosun.com/News/TorontoAndGTA/2006/05/06/1567051-sun.html", "http://partprocessing.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/05/recognition-of-danger.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t RECOGNITION OF DANGER\n\t \n    "},

Jared spent most of his school life in special-ed classes, but managed to spend his senior year in high school in \u201cregular\u201d classes with the help of extensive tutoring and other accommodations.  This was a choice by his family so Jared because they did not want him to have a modified diploma.  Now it seems that Uncle Sam doesn\u2019t see much of a distinction between Jared and any other 18 year-old. Army recruiters, apparently under pressure to get their numbers up, have signed Jared up for a four-year hitch in one of the service\u2019s most dangerous positions, cavalry scout.  He was offered a $4,000 signing bonus, a college fund, \u201cand more buddies than he could count.\u201d  But Jared didn\u2019t understand he wouldn\u2019t get the bonus until after basic training, that he was signing up for a four-year period, or just how dangerous this Army thing was going to be.  His parents had to explain to him there was a war going on. When Jared\u2019s mother called the recruiter to explain the situation, she was told \u201cJared\u2019s an 18 year-old man.  He doesn\u2019t need his mommy to make his decisions for him.\u201d The Army is now investigating the matter.  Hopefully, that investigation will reach the obvious conclusion before Jared has to report on August 16. The story in  The Oregonian  is more about the lengths to which recruiters go to remain ignorant of disqualifying factors than it is about autism.  Indeed, the article relates the usual \u201cno known cause or cure\u201d line without mention of any of the controversies that remain the focus for so many of us.    What the story does for me is to underline three needs. First is the need to educate the public in general, and people in positions like army recruiters in particular, to recognize and understand the disabilities involved with autism.  One recruiter told Jared\u2019s mother that he (the recruiter) had dyslexia and it was no big deal.  He didn\u2019t particularly want to listen to a lecture on the differences between dyslexia and autism. Second, we, as a country, need to develop alternative means of service for autistic adults so that they may contribute to worthwhile enterprises like national security in a meaningful and appropriate way. Third, this story underlines for me, as a parent, the need to do everything I can do to get my child to a point where he can recognize the danger or inappropriateness of a choice, and he can advocate for himself.  Does that mean I want to cure my son?  Yeah, I guess it does.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/m3nec "], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/05/does-uncle-sam-really-want-jared.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t DOES UNCLE SAM REALLY WANT JARED?\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Monday, May 15, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      I have never felt that autism is a \u201cliving hell;\u201d rather, I think of it as a system of challenges, deficits, and threats to independent living that must be overcome.  And overcoming them is imperative. I must emphasize, though, that I can only speak to the experiences of my family in saying that.  Just as the clinical picture for autism encompasses a spectrum that each child falls on differently, so does the impact of autism on individual families run across a spectrum.  I am aware of some people that do not perceive autism as a threat at all.  On the other hand, the challenges of autism can be overwhelming in more severe cases. It\u2019s not just the child who gets autism; it\u2019s the whole family.  And the family is autistic all day, every day. Divorce rates among the autism community are high; financial problems are rampant (even in states where health insurance is  legally required to cover autism , getting the insurer to pay for even mainstream therapies other than Ritalin is near impossible); and the worry about an autistic child\u2019s future never goes away.   As I said before, autism is not viewed as a \u201cliving hell\u201d in the Rankin household, but neither is it a cause for celebration.  It dominates our lives.  It keeps us up at night.  It redirects resources.  What partly gets us through each and every day is our sense of purpose, and the willingness my wife and I have to share responsibilities.  But the other thing that keeps us going is the progress we see our son make, we believe as a result of the hard work we put in, always keeping him as our top priority.  It gives us hope for his future. Not every family is as lucky as we have been.  Considering as bad as things seem for us sometimes, that thought frightens me.  Sometimes autism is so profound that hope becomes a scarce and precious commodity.   Autism Speaks  recently produced a 13-minute video showing the impact autism has had on four families.  It is disturbing, mainly because it is real.  It\u2019s called  Autism Every Day , and it should be seen by every adult who does not have an autistic child.  The next time someone asks you how many three-pointers your autistic son sank, whether your autistic daughter can play Bach fugues by memory, or just what \u201cspecial gifts\u201d your autistic child has, point them to this video.

{"date": "Thursday, July 06, 2006", "body": "\n\t \n      There was a healthy debate in the comments to  a post I did last week , with the conversation focused on the question of whether a parent can consistently \u201caccept\u201d their autistic child and yet seek a \u201ccure.\u201d  I use the word \u201ccure\u201d here in a very broad sense to mean seeking a means of eliminating many, if not all, of the clinical aspects of autism that are generally, if not universally, considered to be disabling.  Of course, even the concept of \u201cdisability\u201d is subject to debate. Joseph , with whom I have long disagreed over the issues of whether environmental insults may play a causative role in triggering autism and whether there really has been an increase in the incidence and severity of autism, wrote the following: [An] aspect of autism that separates it from other disabilities is the fact that it\u2019s a brain difference.  So it has a profound impact on the personality and way of being of an individual.  Because of this, the question of cure becomes an ethical dilemma.  To cure someone implies a personality alteration.  Imagine that there was a technological way to alter the personality of a child to match our wishes and dreams.  Would that technology be ethical?  (In a more detailed message I could even argue that the difference between \u2018altering personality\u2019 and \u2018curing autism\u2019 is nothing but a subjective construction).  And the way you can usually tell if something like this is really an ethical problem is to ask the potentially affected individuals.  Autistics have said that being cured would be akin to having an alien force power our bodies. Ethically, there\u2019s no justification for ignoring what autistics have said on this matter. Joseph is correct that there is an ethical obligation to carefully consider what it is that we are trying to accomplish by any given intervention, but he misses the mark, at least in my opinion, when he assumes that everyone seeking a cure wants to alter a child\u2019s personality to match the parents\u2019 wishes and dreams.  I have indeed listened to what autistics have to say on the question, but listening, considering, and reaching an opposite conclusion is different from \u201cignoring.\u201d  Calling something a \u201cbrain difference\u201d does not really help to define what the difference is or what causes the difference.   Joseph\u2019s representation that autistics equate being cured to having an alien force power their bodies begs an important question.  Do any autistics who have had their autism biomedically remediated share that fear?  Indeed, I have been told time and again by some adult autistics that nothing I do can possibly cure my child of autism.  If that is so, how can any autistic individual know what the impact of a cure would be?  How does anyone know that the essence of an individual\u2019s personality would be altered by a hypothetical cure?   One autistic adult whose writing I read on a regular basis is Amanda Baggs, who blogs under the name  ballastexistenz .  Again, listening is not the same thing as agreement.  Yet any beliefs about the nature of autism would have no validity at all if I was not willing to let them be challenged \u23af and perhaps altered to at least some extent \u23af by her writing.  Ms. Baggs was interviewed as part of the NPR report I mentioned in my last post, and she had this response to my taking exception to a comment of Jim Sinclair\u2019s: With regard to loving a child and hating autism, one thing I said in an interview for the same radio show (but that didn\u2019t make it onto the air) was that there\u2019s no such thing as autism, and that this is probably what has a lot of people confused. What there is, is a kind of person that is autistic, and this goes deeper than personality or culture.  Just as there is a kind of person that is male or female, instead of an abstract concept of \u201cmaleness\u201d or \u201cfemaleness\u201d that each person \u201chas\u201d.  \u201cAutism\u201d is an abstraction, not a thing. However, that abstraction allows people to believe that it\u2019s a thing, that can be separated from the person, rather than a word used to describe a certain aspect of the person. And so, yes, if you hate the autism, you\u2019re hating a fundamental aspect of a person (this goes for if you\u2019re a parent, if you\u2019re autistic, whatever).  That doesn\u2019t change based on whether or not it\u2019s considered polite or even downright shocking by your standards to \u201cdefine people\u2019s relationship to one another for them\u201d. I wish I could share the view that autism is a mere abstraction, but that would ignore the multiple disabilities challenging my son on a daily basis.   [Update:  For clarification by both Ms. Baggs and me on this point, please see the comments to this post.]   The points made by Joseph and Ms. Baggs were addressed quite well by comments from my friend (who someday I hope to meet face-to-face, and who I trust will forgive me for some editing), Mar\u00eda Lujan: \u2026 a human being is much more than a label.  Because the diagnosis is given based on behaviors and absence of certain skills (language for example) I wonder how do we know if the behaviors are not resulting from the intrinsic \u2026 person but resulting (some of them? how many and how?) from the interaction of \u2026 genetics with the environment and the resulting medical problem? Why [do] many of the behaviors associated [with] ASD disappear under certain treatments (not behavioral) with parallel improvements in certain biochemical parameters? If they were intrinsic to the person, there [would be] no way to change, [just] as there are no ways to change the DNA today. Mar\u00eda\u2019s moral sense of the matter is as strong as her scientific sense: My son\u2019s soul has not been stolen by vaccines or thimerosal.  The autism he has does not make my son less human.  The autistic he is deserves all my consideration and acceptance and love and also the best medical care, a medical care I have not found in the [mainstream] medicine available. . . .  Like you, I want answers based on high tech science, [not] epidemiology or statistics.  I want science based on clinical studies of high quality, not politics.  I want to know about the truth and I refuse to be involved in a \u201cgame\u201d where it seems more important to win or to be right \u23af at any cost \u23af than the truth.  And like you I consider that autistic[s] deserve and must be respected and considered and [heard].  However, this does not exclude me from my rights and my duties to give my son the best opportunities for the best life quality he can get under my personal research and responsibility, using all the tools available to me with appropriate information. . . . I do not consider AUTISM a gift, but my AUTISTIC CHILD [is] a gift.  I do not \u2026 celebrate AUTISM but I celebrate his existence, or in other words the CHILD he is, autistic or not.  I enjoy life with my autistic son, even when I cannot find [joy] in autism, because for me they are different things \u2026 Like everyone else in this ongoing discussion, I have a tendency to overgeneralize opinions by other people, and to place people in \u201cgroups\u201d that, in reality, may not exist.  As Ms. Baggs writes:  \u201cWhen someone is on \u2018your side,\u2019 it is very easy to not see how it can look from another \u2018side\u2019.\u201d  I have to say, however, that I have never personally spoken to anyone who I believe has adopted biomedical interventions out of a lack of love, respect, or acceptance of their child.  Such a parent may exist, but I have not yet met one.   Indeed, the act of intervention requires some level of acceptance.  One must accept the fact that a child is autistic.  That may not be the type of acceptance that is defining the debate; it is an acceptance of \u201cautism\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis acceptance of \u201cthe autistic.\u201d  But it is just as meaningful in a very important way.   Tamar Bihari  is not a proponent of biomedical interventions, nor is she a vociferous critic of them.  She is a mother who also happens to be a fine writer.  Tamar wrote  an essay for the Autism Speaks site , that is well-worth reading.  She speaks eloquently of the difficulty many of us had in accepting the reality of autism, and makes an important point: The turning point is not the diagnosis itself, I think.  It\u2019s the willingness to see.  To understand that your child has this condition, that the way he or she is acting is not willful, is not unique, and is not something he or she will grow past, not without help. The issue isn\u2019t one of acceptance and love; it\u2019s of response.  In his comments, Joseph acknowledged that some in the \u201cautism rights movement\u201d acknowledge that autism is a disability, and then adds:  \u201cThe question is what to do about it and how it should be constructed.\u201d If  the construct of autism is defined by a constellation of dysfunctions, an appropriate response includes interventions to counteract the problems.   If , on the other hand, autism is a mere cognitive difference that resulting solely from genetics unrelated to any environmental insult, then no amount of intervention will make a difference anyway.  From the practical side, the real issue becomes safety of protocols.  The ethical dilemma, however, is unresolvable.   For her part, Ms. Baggs feels it remains unethical to not \u201caccept\u201d the autistic child \u201cas is,\u201d regardless of whether the cause is genetic or environmental.  I don\u2019t think the question is that easily answered.  I believe the answer lies in the heart of each parent of an individual autistic child.  I speak only for myself when I say my conscience is clear.

In the meantime, let me tell you about something that happened toward the end of our trip. We stayed an extra day in the Chicago area, and were able to get some fairly good seats at Wrigley Field (not that there are any bad seats there) to see the Cubs host the Reds.  I consider a pilgrimage to the friendly confines to be an essential part of any springtime visit to the Windy City.  A fine time was had by all, including the Little Rankster, and the Cubs defeated the boys from Cincy by a score of seven to three. A couple of innings into the game, my wife started smiling and pointed to a man seated a little to the side and one row in front of us.  \u201cIsn\u2019t that Paul Offit?\u201d she asked.  The spectator she pointed to indeed bore a resemblance to everyone\u2019s favorite shill, but I didn\u2019t think it was him.  The odds of him being in Chicago were slim.  This man had a much thinner face than the dark one (not that Dr. O is fat anywhere except the wallet, but the man near us was very lean).  And if Paul Offit was at the game, he could probably find a luxury box to which he could get himself invited.   Still, I enjoyed the potential irony of being in such proximity to the man I call \u201cthe blogger\u2019s buddy\u201d (so called because he manages to provide so many opportunities to write a post pointing out the absurdities of his many public statements).  When our neighbor got up to leave, he picked up a tote bag, bearing the brand name Imitrex.  It was one of those promotional goodies the pharmaceutical companies shower upon doctors.   Of course, Imitrex is a product of GlaxoSmithKline; had it been Merck, I would have admitted to my wife that she had spotted the real deal.  On the other hand, could it have been him?  That would be worth a \u201cHoly Cow!\u201d\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/05/take-me-out-to-ball-game.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME . . .\n\t \n    "},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 21, 2009", "body": "\n\t \n      Oh my,  Wired   magazine has entered the fray with  Amy Wallace\u2019s unabashed love letter to Paul Offit .  Whenever I see Doc O\u2019s name pop up, I have an almost Pavolovian need to respond.  In this case, though, nothing new was said.  Besides,  J.B Handley has already done a fine job, over at   Age of Autism , of discussing this puff piece. Although I see no need to directly address Ms. Wallace\u2019s screed, I\u2019d like to discuss the recurring theme we keep seeing from those who deny the very possibility that we are in the midst of an epidemic, and the related possibility that a program intended to protect our children might have played a major causative role in the creation of the epidemic. Ms. Wallace writes that, \u201c[w]hen a child is ill, parents will do anything to make it right.\u201d  She makes that sound like a bad thing:  that parents would want to go to whatever lengths are necessary to heal a sick or injured child.  Ms. Wallace apparently attended the Autism One Conference last May, but it\u2019s difficult to know if she actually listened to much that was said.  It\u2019s not just that she seems to think \u23af quite incorrectly \u23af that the whole conference was about blaming vaccines, but she belittles the various advances in biomedical treatments that were discussed there. Again saying it as if it was something bad, Ms. Wallace recounts her Autism One experience:  \u201cTo a one, the speakers told parents not to despair.\u201d  Are we supposed to go through life without hope that our children can get better?  Apparently that would be preferable to living with the hope that we are getting.  Ms. Wallace makes sure that her new best friend\u2019s views are stated:  \u201cOffit calls this stuff, much of which is unproven, ineffectual, or downright dangerous, \u201ca cottage industry of false hope.\u201d I can only speak for my family, but we have chosen to live a life of hope, and that hope \u23af and a lot of hard work \u23af has brought rewards.   I generally avoid writing a lot about our son on this blog.  It\u2019s mostly a matter of his privacy, and my belief that some day he will make his own choice as to what he wants to say.  But I need to bend that self-imposed rule a little to talk about hope, and how sometimes hope and reality are not that far apart. About five years ago, a self-styled \u201cdevelopmental pediatrician\u201d told us that the Little Rankster was definitely autistic, and we needed to do three things: 1) get him on Ritalin; 2) put him in a special school; and 3) start looking into a residential placement he would probably need in a few years.  He explained that the best we could expect from pharmaceuticals and special schools was a delay in the inevitable.   None of those recommendations were followed.  We chose, instead, to use \u201cunproven\u201d biomedical treatments, which we mixed in with speech therapy and a little bit (but only a little bit) of traditional behavioral therapies.    We made those choices, even when a multi-disciplinary team, at the end of a very expensive evaluation, gave us advice that was similar to the pediatrician\u2019s, albeit a little less gloomy.  It didn\u2019t seem to bother any of these professionals that the one thing they all advised us to try, Ritalin, was \u201cunproven\u201d as to either efficacy or safety for children of our son\u2019s age. We chose hope for our son.  It has not been easy.  There are no magic bullets.  Because the medical community serving our kids is still learning about how underlying conditions result in the clinical manifestations of autism, there have been a lot of changes in what we\u2019ve done. Not everything we\u2019ve tried has worked, but there have been a lot of successes.  The process has required constant research and re-examination, mostly by my wife.  Before trying anything, we look at what testing and clinical signs are pointing to, and whether there is a rational basis for what we intend to try.  Most important, we weigh the potential risk against the potential benefits, and err on the side of safety. Skeptics will say that \u201call children make progress,\u201d and we can\u2019t prove that any progress our son has made can be tied to the interventions we have used.  Frankly, I don\u2019t care about proving anything.  The timing and the nature of the improvements we have seen tell us when we are seeing results. Through the years, we have seen those results.  Our son remained in public school in \u201cregular\u201d classrooms, first in Louisiana and then here in the midwest after we moved up here a few years ago.  At first, he needed a lot of help \u23af the kind that the schools are required to provide.  But as his physical condition improved through the biomedical interventions we used, so did his school performance improve.  He\u2019s still under an IEP, but he hasn\u2019t needed an aide for the last year-and-a-half.   The Little Rankster has steadily showed more interest in the world around him.  This year, he\u2019s in the school chorus.  Let me restate that a different way.  The boy who could not speak until a couple of years ago, is now singing, loudly, clearly, and happily.  And then last week, something happened that we would not have believed possible not so long ago.  Our son\u2019s classmates elected him to the school\u2019s Student Council.  He showed an interest in running (a miracle in itself); his teacher felt he was worthy of nomination, he gave a short speech, and the other students voted for him.   The Church speaks of \u201coutward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace.\u201d  I don\u2019t intend to compare what we do to religion or faith; it is science.  But what the Rankin family and our friends see on a constant basis can be called outward and visible signs of an inward healing.  We aren\u2019t ready to declare victory and proclaim that our son is completely \u201crecovered\u201d . . . not yet.  But we\u2019re getting closer to that every day.  And throughout our family\u2019s journey, the outward and visible signs have fueled hope. Our hope is real.  And hope is a good thing.\n     \n     ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html "], "link": "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2009/10/hope.html", "title": "\n\t \n\t HOPE\n\t \n    "},
