In\r\nless than a month, he\u2019ll be eight. \r\n\r\n Meanwhile, I haven\u2019t aged a day. \r\n\r\n What have I learned? \r\n\r\n \r\n  Start\r\n  a Son-Rise program and recruit volunteers. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Hire\r\n  someone for pay when no one wants to work for free. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Do RDI\r\n  faithfully. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  \u00a0 Except when you\u2019re not. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Feed my son a GFCF diet. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Drop\r\n  the diet after 9 months after  many  out-of-body baking experiences. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Feed my son digestive enzymes like breath mints. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Give\r\n  them up. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Do OT. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Quit. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Take\r\n  it up again, this time with a sensory specialist. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Fire\r\n  her ass and get someone with a working heart. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Begin\r\n  a HANDLE program. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  \u00a0 Stop doing the exercises. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  And\r\n  then work closely with a homeopath. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Until\r\n  you stop going. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Homeschool\r\n  using Enki. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Drop\r\n  Enki. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Pick\r\n  Enki back up but this time, only a few threads at a time. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Flounder. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Soar. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Flounder\r\n  again. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Find\r\n  The Nurtured Heart Approach. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  Rejoice! \r\n \r\n\r\n \u00a0 The best piece of advice I can offer after all\r\nthis time is this: \r\n\r\n Never add the recommended amount of milk when making mac\r\n& cheese from a box. It will be soupy and your child will reject it.\r\nFrankly, anyone would. \r\n\r\n Remember when I reported that I read and cuddled with Fluffy\r\nat night and then kissed him goodnight and left him alone to peacefully fall\r\nasleep on his own? Many many months ago? And how well it was working? \r\n\r\n Then things changed: we moved and then moved again and\r\nbefore you knew it, we were back to lying in bed in the dark for hours until he\r\nfell asleep, only this time, Dave and I were taking turns which meant we never spent\r\nan evening together. \r\n\r\n We felt like Oprah, once sleek and 165, then zrooomph, back up to 200\r\npounds. How did it happen? \r\n\r\n We\u2019re back at it, Nurtured Hearting it this time. So far, he\u2019s\r\ndone it two nights in a row. Sure, it was after 10:30 by the time he was asleep\r\nbut he did it and there was no drama, just countless walks  back  to his room and a stream of positive observations and much pride. I'm not sure I'm a resolution gal anymore but here is my parenting/teaching plan for 2009: \r\n\r\n I\u2019m not giving energy to negativity. \r\n\r\n I\u2019m giving tons of energy to success.\u00a0 Who knows?

{"date": "January 05, 2009 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I think I\u2019m beginning to see why  Glasser  refers to the\r\n Nurtured Heart Approach \u00a0(NH) as transformative.  \r\n\r\n Although Dave and I began investigating NH about a month\r\nago, it\u2019s only been since the new year began that we\u2019ve made a methodical\r\nattempt to follow the program 100%. We\u2019ve signed up for a parent training that\r\nis meant to start mid-month. In the meantime, I read his first book\r\n( Transforming the Difficult Child ), watched the dvd presentation and have been\r\nreading his new book ( All Children Flourishing)  and am watching for every\r\nmoment I feel pulled to give  any  energy\r\nto negative behavior (hoping to STOP myself) and for every moment I can\r\nrecognize and celebrate Fluffy\u2019s greatness with specificity (hoping to lay it\r\non!). \r\n\r\n This is the key. \r\n\r\n Every other discipline approach has it backwards\u2014not doing\r\nanything when desirable behavior is exhibited and really laying it on when\r\nundesirable behavior is exhibited. In other words, we\u2019re giving our kids a big\r\npayoff at the exact wrong times. \r\n\r\n Glasser says those methods work with the typical kid but not\r\nthe intense kid. He says, essentially, the following are methods that not only\r\ndon\u2019t work for the intense (or challenging or difficult) kids, they actually\r\nmake things worse: \r\n\r\n Any typical discipline approach that most people use with\r\nmost kids \r\n\r\n Natural consequences \r\n\r\n Logical consequeneces \r\n\r\n 1,2,3 Magic \r\n\r\n These methods all give our kids a big energetic response for\r\nnegative behavior. Unfortunately, lots of times our difficult kids aren\u2019t\r\ngetting much of any from us when they  are \r\nbehaving (we\u2019re all, Oh good! He\u2019s happily playing on his own, I\u2019ll straighten\r\nup or make those calls or wash those dishes!) so we\u2019re giving the good behavior\r\nnot much of any energetic response and the bad behavior anywhere from slightly\r\nenergized to highly energized responses depending on our mood or how many times\r\nthat day our child has done/said things that push our buttons. \r\n\r\n Now, we might say well-meaning praises like  Good job!  Or  I\r\nreally like the way you\u2019re acting!  or  Thanks for being a help!  We might stay nice and calm to explain why the particular\r\nbehavior wasn\u2019t okay,  That hurt so and so\u2019s feelings,   It makes me feel sad when\r\nyou do such and such, It isn\u2019t okay to do such and such and if you do that\r\nagain, we\u2019re going to have to leave.  But even this is usually done with  far  more energy and  far  more detail and usually dispensed at a  much  closer physical range than what we do/say when\r\nour child behaves.\u00a0We also tend to punctuate these session with mini-lectures or threats to take a toy away or leave the premises or send a child to his room for a break, etc. etc., Kids get this. They have super duper antennas when it\r\ncomes to energy.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Again, all this works fine with most kids. But if you\u2019re\r\nlike me and you have a kid that doesn\u2019t respond to this and you\u2019ve tried (and\r\ntried and tried) all kinds of approaches and even the\r\n he\u2019s-not-developmentally-ready  or  his sensory system is overloaded\r\n or  I just need to say it exactly right and stay ultra detached and calm , well,\r\nyou might just find NH is just the ticket. \r\n\r\n The NH approach goes in stages. We\u2019re in what I\u2019d call the first\r\nstage that\u2019s all about creating a JUICY TIME IN which is what every moment is\r\ngoing to be that  isn\u2019t  a Time Out. Now, Glasser recommends a very specific Time Out for when a rule is broken but it won\u2019t work unless you\u2019ve already established\r\nTime In. We haven't gotten to the Time Outs yet but they are, essentially, a clean, short, withdrawal of energy and won\u2019t\r\nwork until Time In gets integrated into the household and parents and child and\r\nthe child\u2019s own self-image begins to shift. \r\n\r\n Time In is all about being seen and valued, about being\r\ngiven lots of positive feedback and energy for all the times the child is\r\nbehaving in ways that we celebrate. \r\n\r\n How do you do that? By being specific. \r\n\r\n Glasser gives this wonderful example of a teacher who\u2019s in\r\nthe room with a group of students who all had been working away at a table\r\ntogether quietly for about 15 minutes. She says to them, You all are doing a\r\ngreat job! Keep up the good work. Now, what are the kids to think? Is it\r\npossible they each might stop and interpret this very individually and\r\nspecifically? Might one say,  Oh, yes! I\u2019m being respectful of others, sitting\r\nquietly and not pulling at any else\u2019s paper.  Another,  Yes! I\u2019m respecting the\r\nmaterials and making sure to put the caps back on the pens.  Another still,  I\u2019m\r\nshowing determination and focus even though this is hard because I\u2019m not giving\r\nup. \r\n\r\n Not likely. Not unless we tell them. \r\n\r\n It\u2019s up to us to tell our kids what they\u2019re doing that we\r\nappreciate, admire, value and recognize and what they\u2019re  not  doing that we\r\nappreciate, admire, value and recognize. And what we like! \u00a0  Especially when they\u2019re having a hard time. \r\n\r\n We need to tell our kids the truth so they can  hear  it so it can sink in.  And the truth is, even with very challenging kids (toddlers, elementary age, teens), there are countless example every day of their success right in that moment.\r\nNot what they are on their way towards, but what they are displaying  right now . There are countless moments whem they are showing self-control, determination, focus, wisdom, consideration, creativity, humor, problem solving, curiosity, peserverance, respect, innovation, etc.. Even the ability to  feel  strong feelings in the first\r\nplace is a success! Let's not forget to acknowledge them for that, for letting themselves feel the anger or frustration or excitement or disappointment! \r\n\r\n The NH approach says to start by giving what's called Active\r\nRecognition. When you see your child doing anything (except breaking a rule),\r\nstop and tell them what you see and name a quality of something that matters to\r\nyou that you see them exhibiting. For example,  I notice your following the\r\ndirections in that lego sheet to build your structure. You are using great\r\nfocus and determination and I admire that!  Or,  I can see what you're doing is taking a lot of effort and even though you're getting frustrated, you are choosing not to yell or use bad language. That shows me your perserverance and self control and I really value those qualities! Now, it might feel a little unusual at fist. But if you think it's odd to make such long statements with such detail, think of what you say when you're  not  happy with the behavior. Think of the amount of energy and time and words you spend on those 'teaching moments'.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Yesterday, Fluffy had a big meltdown before dinner. Dave and\r\nI aren\u2019t to the point in the program where you do the Time Out; we\u2019re still\r\nheavily building juicy Time Ins but we knew enough to NOT give energy to the\r\nnegativity. But that didn\u2019t mean that we did nothing until he was over it. We kept\r\nlooking for moments to jump in and accuse him of success. \r\n\r\n At one point, Fluffy paused in his screaming and yelling most likely, just to catch his breath. But I jumped in,  Wow, Fluffy! I so appreciate\r\nthat you stopped yelling in this moment! Thank you. I know that\u2019s very\r\ndifficult to do when you're upset. That shows a lot of inner strength!  Later in the meltdown when there\r\nwas another pause I said,  I notice that you are having really big feelings and\r\nI really admire that you are feeling them without hurting yourself or us. \r\n(Glasser says, mention what\u2019s NOT happening as much as what IS and use detail!).  You\u2019re\r\nnot biting yourself or hitting me or dad with your hands or any objects. You\u2019re not pushing over the chairs. You are\r\nbeing very powerful in choosing to respect the house, your body and our bodies and using fantastic self\r\ncontrol. \r\n\r\n We kept it up, looking for those moments to reflect his success. He calmed down. And came to the table on his own. There was\r\nmuch celebration,  specific celebration,  of his success. And no mention of the\r\nmeltdown AT ALL since going over something difficult later, when the child is\r\ncalm, DOESN\u2019T WORK with these kids. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n So here's the part that is beginning to reveal the transformation that has begun: Last night at bedtime, Fluffy's facial gazing was through the roof--sustained, relaxed, present. At\r\none point, I wondered if he was thinking of something like counting in his\r\nhead, such was the extent of his connection to my face and I asked,  Are you\r\ncounting?\u00a0 And he said,  No, I\u2019m just hanging out.  And then he gazed at my face some\r\nmore and said,  You look really beautiful, mom.\u00a0 And I said,  Wow! Thank you, that is so considerate and loving of you to say. So\r\ndo you! I love looking at your eyes.\u00a0 And he said,  I love looking at yours. They\u2019re very beautiful!\u00a0 And I said,  The eyes really are like windows into the\r\nsoul and I can see how wise and wonderful your soul is. And he said,  Aw, Mom. I'm so glad!  and\u00a0pulled me to him\r\nfor a long, long embrace. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n Nurtured Heart. It\u2019s the foundation of our homeschool\r\ncurriculum.

{"date": "December 08, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy, beside his first ever Lego Mindstorm robotic project; November, 2008. Thanks to a combination of an e-friend\u2019s email that I got this morning (thank you, Laura!) and a\r\ntivo\u2019d glimpse of  Arianna Huffington  on  The Daily Show  promoting the new book\r\non everything you need to know about  blogging \u00a0 (did anyone else see her? And does\r\nanyone else think she sounds exactly like  Ava Gabor  from Green Acres? Even\r\nthough she\u2019s (Huffington) Greek and Ava was, what? Hungarian or something?) I\r\nam back. \r\n\r\n Here. To this blog.  \r\n\r\n Hello! Is there anybody still\r\nout there? \r\n\r\n I\u2019m not sure we need a book on\r\nblogging. Did you know that over 50,000 new blogs are started each day in the\r\nUS? Over 80,000 each day in the UK? \r\n\r\n What is everyone talking\u2014er, I\r\nmean, blogging about? \r\n\r\n Arianna says, blog your\r\npassions, in her case, politics and cheese. Be conversational, like you would\r\nin an email to a friend. The freshness is in the first draft. Don\u2019t over think,\r\nover write, over edit. Just let it hang out there, dangling like so much\r\nunderarm skin. \r\n\r\n So, here I am, dangling, the\r\nunderarm skin and all. \r\n\r\n My passions? All things Fluffy, all things me: the on-going quest for balance in all areas, humorous and healthy aging,\r\nmaking peace with a past that included enormous periods of embarrassingly\r\nineffectual running in circles, writing, making a meaningful contribution to\r\nthis world. \r\n\r\n First, as I dangle, I must also happily report, there is less of\r\nthe underarm skin. I\u2019ve been  Isagenixing  and it is doing the trick. I used to\r\ngripe about that last ten pounds but over the last couple of years those ten\r\nhave doubled and brought with them the puckering and pouty sagging and jeering\r\nfrom the conflated thigh/ass region that has collapse its borders and is now\r\nreferred to as my  thass , and the\r\nterrible burden of getting dressed which feels as complicated and exhausting as\r\nadapting the Iraqi war surge strategy for the mountainous landscape of the\r\nAfghanistan/Pakistan border. \r\n\r\n But no more! The weight, she is\r\ncoming off. The standing in the kitchen shoveling starch and sugar substances\r\ninto my mouth as if I am being timed is a thing of the past. I\u2019m feeling, dare\r\nI say, SANE around food! \r\n\r\n Things relational: the marriage\r\nneeds work. Let me just toss that right out there. Years of neglect wear down\r\nthe trust. I fear we have moved out of having  no  life outside the home to\r\nhaving only  separate  lives outside the home. We\u2019re either with the Fluffster or\r\nin our offices doing work or out independently. We are now launching Operating\r\nDate Night Out, training one of the two new (and fantastic!) sitters to take on\r\na nighttime shift so Dave and I can get reacquainted. That and a top notch\r\ntherapist ought to do the trick. Cross fingers. \r\n\r\n Things homeschool: I continue\r\nto revamp our whole approach and have found that even though I can\u2019t  entirely \r\nstop the worry from sneaking into the room, I am getting better and better at\r\nnoticing when she\u2019s skulking about. It\u2019s much like Beegu creaking open the door\r\nwith her snout and sidling over to the table to vacuum up food scraps. She\u2019s\r\nalways going to do that. Always. It\u2019s just her way. All I need to do is gently\r\nshoo her away. Again and again and again. \r\n\r\n Things Fluffy: he has a new\r\nfriend! For their third playdate, they met at the mall on Saturday (with adult\r\nescorts, of course!) and played their first ever game of laser tag followed by\r\nsnacks and then roller skating. \r\n\r\n Things health: After five\r\nweeks (FIVE WEEKS!) of sickness, I am finally climbing free from my snotty\r\nmountain of Kleenex just as Fluffy succumbs once again and Dave shuffles about\r\nin his slippers, muttering a long list of ailments. \r\n\r\n A couple who were all set to\r\nbuy the house in RI (yes, we are trying to sell in this market) withdrew their\r\noffer after the radon gas report came back with an appallingly high number: 21\r\nwhen the acceptable limit is 4. And you know the acceptable limit is more\r\nlikely 1 or even zero.\u00a0 What\u2019s the risk of radon gas exposure, you may ask? Lung cancer. \r\n\r\n Are we all radon gas poisoned?\r\nAny reassurances out there? \r\n\r\n So, here you have it, my\r\npassions spouted as if in an email to a friend, which is what you all are to\r\nme, friends. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington", "http://www.amazon.com/Huffington-Post-Complete-Guide-Blogging/dp/1439105006", "http://www.who2.com/evagabor.html", "http://www.isagenix.com/us/en/home.dhtml"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/12/thanks-to-laura-and-arianna-huffington.html", "title": "Thanks to Laura and Arianna Huffington"},
{"date": "December 13, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m no professional shopper.\r\nBut the other day in the shower, as that dreamy Clarisonic ran circles all over\r\nmy face and neck, I thought,  this is one of the best things I've ever done for myself! \r\n\r\n I thought of calling this my Top Ten but I  can\u2019t  be pinned down so I\u2019m calling it The First Ten That Pop\r\nInto My Mind: \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n  1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Clarisonic . Pricey but worth it. I bought it last year with my Christmas money, feeling\r\nvery indulgent and vain. Within a month, my skin was visibly more vibrant and those micro-bumps were gone. Almost a year later, I am still a convert,\r\nbringing it along even on overnights. I\u2019ve used it on Fluffy on occasion and he thinks\r\nit\u2019s a huge treat, tickly and fun. \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Isogensix . Again with the cleanse, but I\r\nmust say, if anyone you know if wanting to loose weight, inches, and that old\r\nfarty feeling, then jump on a cleanse. I\u2019ve tried others but so far, this is my\r\nfavorite. It\u2019s expensive but made of lacto-vegetarian quality ingredients, and\r\norganics, and works. It may be a perfect for that new year\u2019s leaf? \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 HyperDash. \u00a0Neither Fluffy nor I are big\r\noutdoorsy folks when the temperature drops below 50 degrees. I know, I\r\nknow--there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, only  improper gear  but what can I\r\nsay? We\u2019re wimps. This game has been a perfect way to get a little bounce back\r\nin our step.  \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n 4. \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Klean Kanteen .  We have b ecome a\r\ncommitted Klean Kanteen family. And now they have them in all sorts of colors\r\nso you never have to have another argument about  which  bottle is  whose , or  who \r\nlost  how  many bottles at $18 a pop, er--not that we\u2019ve ever had those sorts of\r\nfights. You may be able to find these in your local health food store. I know\r\nthey have them at Whole Foods.  \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n 5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Donations\r\nin someone\u2019s name. Times are hard everywhere these days and lots of people are\r\nasking for donations to be made in their name rather than one more\r\nbook or tie or scratchy sweater. Your local food bank is a great place to\r\nstart. Here are a few of my favorites (is it odd to say favorite and charity in\r\nthe same sentence?) charities:  \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n a. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   FINCA ,\r\nan international organization that gives micro-loans to destitute mothers so\r\nthat they can start their own business.  \r\n\r\n b. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Smile Train  brings provides free cleft surgery to children, literally saving\r\ntheir lives.  \r\n\r\n c. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Women's Bean Project  helps American women get back on their feet. \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n 6. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 That said, I do have two favorite books right now, both by Tristine Rainer:  Your Life as Story . \u00a0 An amazing book for both professional writers\r\nand beginners learning the art of writing personal narrative. Recommended\r\nhighly. \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n 7. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 And, \u00a0 The New Diary . Look for the updated version. Even though this was originally published over twenty years ago, it\u2019s a\r\nwonderfully inspired guide to journaling in a host of creative ways. For the secret artist in your life. \r\n  \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n  8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Backscratcher--the telescoping kind. \u00a0This is the only successful gift I have purchased for Dave, my beloved and  particular  husband.  \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n 9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Body Brush . Many years ago, my childhood\r\nbest friend met someone on a plane who had the smoothest skin she had ever\r\nfelt. Don\u2019t ask me how she discovered this (those seats  are  quite close) but I\u2019ve never forgotten the reason:\r\ndaily brushing with a body brush. I promptly got one for myself, replacing it, year after year. It  does  make your skin soft. It has added benefits of  releasing\r\ntoxins and boosting your immune system . And it makes a great stocking stuffer. \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \r\n\r\n \r\n 10. \u00a0   Rock and Spin Top .\r\nEvery year, Santa brings something for the playroom. This year, it was between\r\nthis giant top and a barrel like  this one . The top won out for both financial\r\nand storage reasons. Great vestibular input and a bit of 'heavy work' thrown in if your guy does a lot of pushing, pulling, and carrying it\r\nabout.  \r\n\r\n I\u2019d love to hear your gift favorites!

{"date": "December 09, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n Warning: Weight Loss Talk Ahead \r\n\r\n I\u2019m only a beginner in the\r\nworld of  Isagenix  Cleansing Systems but I\u2019m already a convert. \r\n\r\n My sister told me about it\r\nabout halfway through her 30-day program, calling in every few days with weight\r\nlost and energy found in steady increments, both ways. She\u2019s been working with\r\na nutritionist for a while now, the kind of gal who ingests and slathers\r\norganics, exclusively, including face care and beauty products (while I soak in\r\nOil of Olay Regenerist products made with every last chemical on the earth\r\nbecause it is meant to reduce wrinkles. Yes! I am vain!) and she, the\r\nnutritionist, said,  you\u2019ve got to try this cleanse, it\u2019s an incredible\r\nproduct. \r\n\r\n They say things like that in the\r\nbiz\u2019\u2014 product. \r\n\r\n So she did. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n And now, I have too. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n There is a 9 day cleanse (you\r\nactually begin with 2 days of pre-cleanse so in my book, it\u2019s an 11-day\r\ncleanse) and a 30 day cleanse. I did the 9 day (11 day) and am now 5 days into\r\nthe 30 day. \r\n\r\n The  product  is meant to pull toxins out of the body, toxins that\r\nare interfering with one\u2019s ability to get the weight off. The  product  is meant to nourish and rebalance the body, taking\r\naway the crazy food cravings that are, at least for me in my regular life,\r\nrunning the show. \r\n\r\n Maybe you aren\u2019t like me. Maybe\r\nyou are sane around food, eating when you\u2019re hungry and stopping when you\u2019re\r\nfull. Maybe you always sit down to eat and chew fifty times before you swallow\r\nrather than stand while shoveling foodstuff into your cake hole like you\u2019ve\r\njust been pulled from a cave. And so, craving an assortment of protein, fruits\r\nand vegetable, whole grains, and natural sweets of this good earth is your\r\nnormal. \r\n\r\n Me? I\u2019m more of a potato chip\r\nand salami gal when the stress builds up. I eat pretty well most of the time\r\nbut I\u2019ve never really been able to sustain long-term good eating habits. I used\r\nto be able to take it but once I fell into my forties, the metabolism went on\r\nextended holiday. \r\n\r\n This cleanse seems to be doing\r\na few critical things: \r\n\r\n 1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  rebooting\r\nmy metabolism \r\n\r\n 2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  eliminating\r\nmy more severe and debilitating food cravings \r\n\r\n 3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  taking\r\noff the pounds and inches \r\n\r\n The most important component is\r\nthat I am in the real world with food while on I\u2019m doing the program. I\u2019m not\r\nrelegated to only eating this food or that liquid meal or these pre-made meals.\r\nI am drinking shakes, yes, but every day I also must eat a meal, anything I\r\nwant. And I must eat snacks. In fact, I must make sure my body gets food every\r\n2-3 hours. This is key. The metabolism is like a wood stove. We don\u2019t want to\r\nlet the fire go out. Imagine the energy is takes to start a new fire every time\r\nyou need some heat. Same with the food. It\u2019s much more efficient to keep your\r\nmetabolism on a steady burn. \r\n\r\n So, you have your cleanse days\r\nand your shake days. In the 30 day, you have 6 shake days followed by 1 cleanse\r\nday. On shake days, you drink 2 shakes, have one meal, and snacks. And LOTS of\r\nwater. On cleanse days, you drink the cleanse drink four times a day and no\r\nmeals. But you are allowed snacks. And you know what? If you need to eat\r\nsomething, do. I did. \r\n\r\n It appears, as long as you get the  product  in you, it works.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been cheating the whole\r\ntime. Not Big Mac or ice cream sundae cheats but smaller\r\nmeals in addition to my one meal on shake days cheats, eating a small meal on my\r\ncleanse days cheats, and eating more in general than they recommend cheats. It's still working. \r\n\r\n It\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s also\r\ninfuriatingly hard to find prices on  the site . They aren\u2019t there. It\u2019s one of\r\nthose programs where you need to buy from an actual person.\u00a0 I am such a person. \r\n\r\n That does not mean you have to\r\nbuy this from me or from anyone. But you asked, so there it is. \r\n\r\n This Isagenix is helping\r\nthis middle aged mama find some balance around the food and it\u2019s making it\r\npossible for me to wear some sexy-thass clothes I haven\u2019t been able to get near\r\nfor a couple of years. And I noticed that yesterday, that husband of mine couldn't keep his hands off me. Hmm, that's its own can of worms... \r\n\r\n\n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.isagenix.com/us/en/home.dhtml", "http://www.isagenix.com/us/en/home.dhtml"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/12/since-you-asked.html", "title": "Since you asked..."},

{"date": "December 20, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \r\n  A few of the wrapping paper sheets we did last night. During the summer, the family cozied up to the inspiring\r\nPete Seeger documentary,  The Power of Song. \r\n\r\n Pete, himself, thought it seemed too much like a eulogy and\r\nman alive, anyone can tell this man is NOT dead: chopping wood, ice skating and\r\nskiing, standing on the side of the road in the pouring rain to protest the war\r\nin Iraq with his handmade sign asking for PEACE, well into his eighties yet as\r\nstrong and lithe as ever. \r\n\r\n I love him. \r\n\r\n I got to see him this fall in concert. He maybe passed his\r\nbelting it out stage but the sight of him on the stage filled my heart with the\r\nbeautiful sound of his voice, still ringing out from my childhood. \r\n\r\n Watch the movie. He makes you want to be a better person.\r\nAnd he does it all with a startling lack of hubris. He couldn\u2019t care less about\r\nbeing star in front of the crowd; he only cares about harmonizing among the\r\nvoices of those gathered. \r\n\r\n During a scene in the extra features during which Pete and his\r\nfamily made wonderful wrapping paper, we all vowed not to buy any Christmas\r\npaper this year. It\u2019s been a project on my list for ages. I finally got to it\r\nlast night and it turned out to be even more fun than I imagined. \r\n\r\n Last night was Friday and Friday is movie night but\r\nyesterday was the day before leaving town to celebrate the holidays with family\r\nand everything was topsy turvey. Fluffy was on the computer in the middle of\r\nthe day while Dave and I raced about, gathering piles and the suitcases in\r\nwhich to dump said piles. Outside, the snow steadily fell from noon on. The\r\nscene out the window was straight out of a children\u2019s storybook, full of\r\nromance and magic as passersby dotted the white with colorful puffs of\r\nsnowgear. \r\n\r\n By the time I extracted Fluffy from the monitor screen, he\r\nhad about 3 molecules of blood sugar circulating through his veins and needed\r\nto eat so I heated up a frozen pizza and we all ate like retirees, done by\r\n4:30. The boys suited up and frolicked in the fading light for as long as they\r\ncould last, coming back inside with red chins and runny noses while I, driven\r\nby my adult-onset compulsion to clean out the refrigerator before any trip out\r\nof town with the fervor of a marine corps recruit, frantically sniffed, dumped, wiped and scrubbed. Then it was upstairs for\r\nmovie night. \r\n\r\n Movie night started early enough for a decent bedtime but by\r\nthe time the movie ended, Fluffy begged for more food and seeing as he hadn\u2019t\r\neaten for three hours, we trudged downstairs for grilled cheese. \r\n\r\n The reason I tell you all this is because the next part, the\r\npart that went so well, was all because I didn\u2019t get tense. After all, it was\r\nthe night before we\u2019re leaving on vacation with a scadillion things to do; it\r\nwell after 7pm, Fluffy\u2019s teeth were already brushed (never an easy task) and in\r\npjs (which would not last through the consumption of food) and we hadn\u2019t even cracked\r\nthe big stack of books waiting for us on his pillow. \r\n\r\n While Fluffy ate his grilled cheese at one end of the table,\r\nI laid big sheets of paper on the remaining available surface. I mixed simple\r\nposter paints and narrated my process aloud:  Hmm,\u00a0what kind of designs shall I make? Will they turn out? How do I even start?  I brightened when I remembered the five elements of shape that\r\nwe are learning about from the fabulous new art book I am using with Fluffy\r\ncalled,  Drawing with Children  (which I highly recommend!) and began narrating as I painted dots, circles, curved\r\nlines, straight lines, and angle lines. Fluffy was fascinated. \r\n\r\n Soon he was up and circling the table with me, commenting\r\nall the while about how he thought it was coming, remembering his favorite wrapping paper\r\ndesigns (who knew he even had noticed!), making suggestions about what I ought to try next. I offered blank sheets for him but he\r\ndeclined and I didn\u2019t push it. Instead, he offered the use of this stroke and that color and I followed his lead. It was our first true artistic\r\ncollaboration. Fluffy art directed me\u2013\u2013beautifully I might add, and I painted away and by the time we tossed\r\nthe empty paint holders in the sink, it was after 9pm and we were high as\r\nkites. \r\n\r\n So, we have our wrapping paper. At least, for the gifts from\r\n us . What Santa does is his business. I understand his paper looks remarkably like the rolls we\u2019ve seen at\r\nthe supermarket. \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/392221/Pete-Seeger-The-Power-of-Song/overview", "http://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Children-Mona-Brookes/dp/0874778271"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/12/painting-paper-with-fluffy.html", "title": "Painting Paper with Fluffy"},
{"date": "December 18, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Over the weekend, we all went to a  famous person\u2019s  party. I\r\nbelieve this now makes us all famous by extension.  \r\n\r\n The house was (I imagine it still is) grand and spacious,\r\ntastefully anointed with signed art on the wall, sleek modern furniture\r\nsprinkled about the vast sea of hardwoods peppered with handsome area rugs.\r\nEverything was newly done: new painted, newly remodeled, newly exposed, newly\r\ntiled, newly fabricked. The drawers in the kitchen floor to ceiling cabinets,\r\ndesigned by the hostess, gently and silently pulled themselves to a close with\r\nonly the merest touch of the fingertips. How thoughtful of them. \r\n\r\n There was a violent absence of clutter. \r\n\r\n A shelf in the library displayed six Emmys. Three Caldecott\r\nHonor Awards hung on a \u00a0  nearby\r\nwall. The third floor office space had a conference room, sitting area\r\nsurrounded by all his many many books, and multiple work stations. \r\n\r\n The host and hostess were very lovely and gracious. Their\r\n7-year old daughter breezed in and out of her room where hordes of children\r\n(Fluffy among them) were pawing through her closet and shelves for toys. \r\n\r\n In the star-struck category, I\u2019d put myself squarely in the\r\nmiddle. I don\u2019t fall to the floor and beg them to autograph my arm and I don\u2019t\r\nbreeze by, pretending they don\u2019t fascinate me anymore than my pharmacists. \r\n\r\n They  do  fascinate me. \r\n\r\n It\u2019s not the giant house or the loads of cash or even the\r\nshelf-full of awards. It\u2019s wondering how it feels to be doing what you love and\r\nhaving that thing responded to,  financially , so you don\u2019t have to engage in long\r\ndiscussions with your husband about whether it\u2019s okay to buy a holiday outfit\r\nor recover the couch since the materials you chose turns out to be hideous and\r\nscratchy and quite possibly made of plastic. \r\n\r\n I\u2019m still friendless here. Have I mentioned? I did my best\r\nto mix it up at the party; many of the attendees were my neighbors, after all.\r\nI had a very nice chat with the woman who lives across the street\u2014we\u2019ve had fun\r\nchats before. When she asked how it was going here for me, I said,  Well, we\r\nlove the area and things are mostly fine but I don\u2019t have any friends here yet\r\nand I\u2019m lonely for a pal!  and she looked away and said,  Yeah. Well, it takes a while  and\r\nnothing more. \r\n\r\n Fluffy, ever famous in my eyes, was a star. He navigated the tides of guests, small and\r\nlarge, slipped up and down the front and back staircases, helped himself to\r\nthe bathrooms behind nearly every door, and found us when he needed something, a\r\ndrink, more salami chunks, another brownie. Dave and I took turns keeping tabs\r\non him but for the first time, this involved long stretches when he was out of\r\nsight. We would find him, spy, confirm that he was fine (and he always was,\r\nonce kindly sharing a toy with a little girl, another time, playing on his own,\r\nanother time, playing playmobile with a boy, another time, giggling on the back\r\nstairs with two other children) and then go back to the grown-ups. \r\n\r\n UNHEARD OF A YEAR AGO.\u00a0 I would never have been in a new house\r\nfilled with assorted children and let Fluffy out of my sight for even an\r\ninstant. \r\n\r\n I can\u2019t say Fluffy is my  work . He is my  son . I don\u2019t make\r\nlittle statues out of clay representing each year\u2019s achievements. I don\u2019t  create \r\nhis progress. Yet, the work of the last four years of my life  has  been about clearing the\r\nstream so his waters can flow.\u00a0 But you know the funny part? Most of the clearing has been inside my own waters, slipping on rocks, hauling debris, plucking out dead things, liberating others tangled but still alive, in waters up to my waist or in rivers dry as a bone, but always within my own banks.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mowillemsdoodles.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/12/a-few-words-about-the-party-at-a-famous-persons-house.html", "title": "A few words about the party at a famous person's house"},
{"date": "November 12, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \r\n  Fluffy and Dave, consulting a map; October 2008. Hey, isn\u2019t Obama dreamy??? Isn\u2019t the\r\nwin still making you swoon? Laugh out loud, smile, cry, hug strangers in the\r\nstreet?  \r\n\r\n I love the joyous reactions\r\nfrom all over the world. Love it! Science is being pulled from the toilet where\r\nit\u2019s been disintegrating like old toilet paper for the last eight years. It\u2019s\r\nslowly getting dried out and pieced back together. Hearts are healing. Hope has\r\nbeen restored. I know! I\u2019ve totally drunk the Kool-Aid! In fact, I\u2019m on a\r\nKool-Aid intravenous drip! \r\n\r\n I met a woman while canvassing\r\nin New Hampshire. She was a life-long Republican. She and her husband had met\r\nRonald Reagan and both Bushes, had picture of them in their living room. Her name was on my list with the word,  Persuade , beside it. \r\n\r\n I talked to her for about ten\r\nminutes, standing in her doorway, her tiny white dog with the googley orange\r\neyes racing in and out across the threshold, doing that little hyper circus\r\nwalk on hind legs, working it for some attention or a treat. \r\n\r\n She stayed on the line. I\r\nlistened carefully for a way in and finally at the very end, I got one. She\r\nsaid, \u201cNow, I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 I\u2019m gonna vote for him, but that Obama, he\u2019s got\r\nboth black and white in him and so he\u2019s got somethin\u2019 to prove, you know, to\r\nthe whites AND the blacks, that he can be fair, cause, you know, it\u2019s IN him.\u201d \r\n\r\n I like to think she did vote\r\nfor him. \r\n\r\n So, now that the election is\r\nover, I\u2019m weaning myself from my news show addiction but my infatuation with\r\neverything Obama has not waned. My sister, mom and I are planning our trip to\r\nWashington for the inauguration in January. And I have this feeling I\u2019m going\r\nto meet him one day. Do I sound terribly grandiose? \r\n\r\n I\u2019m being pulled in a new\r\ndirection in the world of autism and aspergers and education. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m\r\nactually OFF the \u2018remediation\u2019 path because I\u2019ve come to think of that word as synonymous\r\nwith learning and who could stray from the path of teaching when\r\nit comes to their child? \r\n\r\n I can\u2019t say I\u2019m on board with\r\nthe  true  Indigo line that speaks of our kids as descending from an other-wordly\r\nbeing in space. \r\n\r\n But I\u2019m certainly not on board\r\nwith needing to \u2018fix\u2019 my child. My goal isn\u2019t to get rid of the autism. \r\n\r\n I am profoundly grateful that\r\nwe found RDI when we did. I see how powerful that approach has been in how Fluffy\r\nhas developed, how it shaped my role as his guide, and how fundamental competence\r\nis when it comes to motivation not just for our kids but for ALL all of us. \r\n\r\n Yet, we\u2019ve stepped away from\r\nRDI. We let our consultant go. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll go back. It doesn\u2019t feel right for us at this point. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to look at my son in terms of a long list\r\nof objectives that we \u2018work\u2019 on and then check off. \r\n\r\n I believe RDI is like magic and wish there were RDI schools in every district across the land. And I still think Fluffy is Fluffy and not his\r\nAspergers. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n I\u2019m sorry that I spent so much\r\ntime in a place of fear because what message did that send my son? About  where  he was and  how  he was? How much development can progress in an atmosphere of worry? \r\n\r\n But I\u2019m also sorry that I spent\r\nany time worrying about the worry or judging myself for the worry because I\r\nfelt what I felt and it can from my love and my desire to provide the most I\r\ncould for my child. I\u2019m not in a place of worry now but I may be again one day.\r\nAnd I reserve the right to be there without having to hide it or justify it to\r\nanyone, least of all the \u2018autism community\u2019 whatever that means. \r\n\r\n To be clear--RDI was  not  about coming from fear. In fact, it was through my experience with RDI, in the trainings, in the coaching from our consultant, and in my day to day experience, that I came out of the fear. RDI made sense. It taught me a way of being, a parenting style, that allowed for us to go back and 'redo' so Fluffy could learn what we didn't know how to teach him the first time around.\u00a0 Discussions of \u2018energy\u2019 comes closest\r\nto my current thoughts on autism, at least the version we have in this house,\r\nthe Fluffy Aspergers 1.0 version. \u00a0\r\n I haven\u2019t pieced it all together but it has to do with the way energy is\r\nexperienced and expressed in Fluffy, the words he uses, the way his sensory\r\nsystem, digestive system, belief system and point of view are\r\naffected by atmosphere, temperature, food, activities, attitudes, feelings\u2014his\r\nand those of the people around him. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Why do I include thoughts on\r\nautism with thoughts on President-Elect Obama? Maybe it has to do with Obama\u2019s\r\ngrasp of nuance, his willingness to see all sides of complex issues, his\r\nability to truly listen to dissenting views. Maybe it has to do with the\r\nmaturity and depth and wisdom he conveyed in his talk on racism. \r\n\r\n I was never a believer in\r\ntrickle down economics, but maybe I\u2019m hoping for trickle down mindset when it\r\ncomes to big topics like educating our kids, these beautiful kids, who aren't  high  functioning or  low  functioning, autistic or  autists , Aspergers or  quirky , painfully behind or way ahead of us, in other words, not black or white but every shade of gray imaginable. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/11/every-shade-of-gray-imaginable.html", "title": "every shade of gray imaginable"},
{"date": "December 31, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Family portrait; Ashfield Fall Festival; October, 2008. Sometimes I think the perfect situation would be to have two\r\nkids: one typical and one like my darling Fluffy.  \r\n\r\n In my imagination, the typical, easy child would provide the\r\nfeedback that I am not defective as a parent, that I have the ability to guide\r\nand teach, discipline affectively, shepherd my child towards his own,\r\nincrementally independent life through the baby steps of sitters, playgroups,\r\npreschool, elementary school, and the land of overnights elsewhere\u2014friend\u2019s\r\nhouse, relatives, summer camp, etc.,etc. I could finally be a member of the\r\nParents of Typical Children Club with all its requisite ease and normalcy along\r\nwith the trials and irritations, challenges and quirks that everyone has to\r\ncertain degrees since, as far as I can tell from this side of the plexi-glass,\r\nno child is a disney prince or princess. \r\n\r\n Continuing along in the la la land of my imagination, parenting the\r\nFluffy child would provide what it has all along: the discovery that nothing is\r\nwhat you thought it would be, the freedom and fear that such a discovery can\r\nbring, the experience of having the ground ripped out from under you just as\r\nyou think you are getting your bearings, the opportunity for developing inner\r\nstrength and fortitude like those characters in myths and fairy tales, the ones\r\nwho wander alone, underground, searching for their hands. \r\n\r\n I would have it both ways. I would stretch and see things I\r\ncould never have seen before. I would let go of old judgments and certainties\r\nand fall straight into the pit of what most parents fear: something\u2019s is going\r\non with your child that may profoundly affect their entire life, livelihood and\r\nhappiness and you may or may not be able to fix it, ie, give them a life that\r\nis better than yours. I would have a toe in the door to other people\u2019s\r\nstruggles. I wouldn\u2019t *get * it all but I would get a lot more than I ever\r\ncould have before. \r\n\r\n But I would also *get * the other side, the \u2018regular\u2019\r\nside. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n I wouldn\u2019t have to brace against someone else\u2019s child\u2019s\r\nsuccess. I wouldn\u2019t feel that stick in my throat that appears when Fluffy veers\r\nwildly off course and I don\u2019t know how to lasso him back to the track. I\r\nwouldn\u2019t feel the ground beneath me rumble when I see the judgment and\r\ncriticism of my son\u2019s behavior or of my parenting. That\u2019s when I veer off. I\r\ntry not to. I work hard to stay calm, focused, good humored, resilient, to stay\r\nin the moment and FAR away from comparisons, worry, fear, hurt, anger. \r\n\r\n But it\u2019s hard. \r\n\r\n And when the shit hits the fan, which it did over Christmas,\r\nin my imagination, with the two kids and the two worlds and the two points of\r\nview and me straddling the divide, I would be able to keep my balance, hold my\r\ntongue and wait it out, wait until the storm inside me passes with all the\r\nflying debris before I gather my words. \r\n\r\n Tomorrow is a new day, a new month, a new year. Outside, fat\r\nflakes of snow steadily fall, covering the bare trees and triangular roof tops\r\nwith soft and fantastically complicated designs, invisible to the naked eye.\r\nImagine, that\u2019s what the cold did to uniform and ordinary water droplets. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n Howard Glasser  is my new hero. His  Nurtured Heart Approach \r\nfeels like the answer we\u2019ve been looking for since the fall. We began a few\r\nweeks ago but we will begin again now, in this new year, with a new parent\r\ntraining class and  his most recent book . I even found a class for Fluffy at a\r\ncenter whose staff has been trained in the Nurtured Heart style of teaching. \r\n\r\n Glasser\u2019s main point is to look at the way we choose to\r\nradiate energy. That\u2019s the key. He says, many times a day, look at what is\r\nhappening with your child and find the ways you can accuse them of success,\r\nover and over. What  is  happening that\r\ncan be held up as a success? What  isn\u2019t  happening that can be held up as a success? Keep creating these\r\nmoments of success, what he calls the  Time In , so that, in time, your child develops a deep and\r\nabiding and truer sense of self that will then, naturally, manifest everywhere. \r\n\r\n Glaser calls the Nurtured Heart a spiritual intervention. I love that. I\r\nhave a feeling this will help me come up from underground. I have a feeling it\r\nwill help me find my hands. And when that happens, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have as\r\nmuch use for the perfect parenting situation of my imagination. The truth is,\r\nwhen I feel as if my own life makes sense, when I feel as if I am finding my\r\nown, perfectly imperfect expression of my one wild and wonderful life right\r\nhere, nothing sticks in my throat and the ground is warm and steady beneath my\r\nfeet. \r\n\r\n Here\u2019s to another trip around the sun with my son, myself, my man, my family, and my friends in the physical, and the virtual, world.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Happy 2009.\u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://nurturinggreatness.net/howie.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Transforming-Difficult-Child-Updated-2008/dp/0967050707/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b", "http://www.amazon.com/All-Children-Flourishing-Igniting-Greatness/dp/0967050782/ref=pd_sim_b_6"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/12/another-trip-around-the-sun-with-my-son.html", "title": "Another trip around the sun with my son"},
{"date": "November 13, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m in a funny place with\r\nFluffy and his homeschooling these days. It\u2019s not really Ha Ha funny or\r\nBoo \u00a0  Hoo funny so much as it\u2019s free\r\nform funny, cooking without cookbooks, ingredients for main courses, appetizers\r\nand desserts strewn haphazardly on the counter, ovens on with nothing inside,\r\nburners lit with pots straddling the heating elements. \r\n\r\n As I said in the last post, we\r\nare moving away from  RDI , not because we have any issue with it, per se. In\r\nfact, we are taking the foundations with us, the parent as guide, the focus on\r\nlearning happening within the context of relationship, the competence as the\r\nkey to motivation, the importance of appropriate challenge\u2014not too much or one\r\nshuts down from overwhelm and not too little or one shuts down from boredom. \r\n\r\n We\u2019re also moving away from\r\n Enki . No morning circles, no singing through transitions, no working with the\r\nstory through beeswax crayon drawing, no recorder, no no no no! \u00a0 \r\n\r\n We\u2019re taking materials from\r\nEnki and  Moving Beyond the Page and MathStart , this series in  Hands-on Learning in Science ,  Lego\r\nMindstorms , origami, games, and books books and more books. We\u2019re taking those\r\nthings and doing a daily improvisation that is working better than anything has\r\nsince we started 2 nd  grade in early September. \r\n\r\n At first it was a little hairy.\r\nI felt there was something wrong. Something wrong with the way I was doing\r\nthings, something wrong with the way Fluffy was responding to things. Something\r\nwrong with Dave, the dog, the plan, the \u2018shape of the day\u2019 the angle of the\r\nearth, our place in the solar system. School is not right, the social skills\r\ntheater class is not right, Enki is not right, RDI is not right. MY GOD! WHAT\r\nARE WE GOING TO DO!!! \r\n\r\n At the same time, I was\r\ncompletely flummoxed about how to discipline my child. I\u2019ve always been a groovy,\r\nco-sleeping, breast-feeding, baby-wearing type, attentive to his needs,\r\nhonoring the intensity, seeing the whole thing as jello powder, as if my job\r\nwas simply to keep adding water, mixing, and then waiting for the foundation to\r\nset. \r\n\r\n Same with the discipline. I\r\ntried to embody the three C\u2019s, being clear, calm, and consistent while also\r\nchanneling the three F\u2019s, being friendly, firm, and flexible. Rules are\r\nunavoidable and necessary. When they\u2019re broken there are consequences. Yet\r\nthere are instances where flexibility is called for but too much flexibility\r\ntoo much of the time renders the rules meaningless. \r\n\r\n As the years progressed, I\r\nfound that time-outs didn\u2019t work, that 'tough love' set the stage for deeper\r\nresistance, that anxiety ignored turned into full-on hysteria, that open\r\ndiscussions turned into protracted and convoluted contests in verbal stamina. \r\n\r\n Consequences were perplexing to\r\nme. I\u2019d often gather up my mommy authority and calmly say, \u201cIf you do that one\r\nmore time, you will get a consequence\u201d knowing full well, I had no idea what\r\nthe consequence would be, hoping that the mere mention of a consequence would\r\nmake Fluffy stop whatever he was doing that wasn\u2019t okay. Often that would work\r\nbut when it didn\u2019t, my brain would be a rabbit in the headlights, unable to\r\nfind the consequence that would work, that would be felt immediately and not\r\nlater when the infraction was long forgotten, one I could stick to when the\r\ngreat wails of protest rose up. \r\n\r\n I\u2019m a developmental gal, seeing\r\nthings in terms of readiness. I don\u2019t like the behavioral road, the charts and\r\nstickers, the stars accumulated and then traded in for goodies like extra\r\ncomputer time or a special toy. I also believe that Fluffy\u2019s thoughts,\r\nopinions, ideas, challenges, and feelings are important and need to be\r\nconsidered. Most of the time, the \u2018naughty\u2019 behavior comes from the\r\nunder-developed parts of him, his sensory confusion, a feeling of\r\npowerlessness, lack of self-control, problem solving, a general feeling of\r\nincompetence. Still, certain behavior simply isn\u2019t okay. We can\u2019t punch Mommy.\r\nIt\u2019s no good to violently bite your own arm when you can\u2019t get a second\r\ndessert. \r\n\r\n I don\u2019t do Fluffy any favors by\r\nallowing inappropriate behavior but punishing without a path to new learning is\r\nno better. \r\n\r\n My puzzle was: How to honor the\r\nchild without letting him run the entire household? \r\n\r\n To come: my answer! \r\n\r\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://rdiconnect.com", "http://enkieducation.org", "http://www.movingbeyondthepage.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Hands-Life-Science-Activities-Grades/dp/0787978655/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1226589441&sr=1-1", "http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/Ontario_dest/Default.aspx"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/11/how-to-honor-the-child-without-letting-him-run-the-household.html", "title": " How to honor the child without letting him run the household"},
{"date": "December 10, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Hi! Am I like that neighbor now? The one who comes over every day for a chat, clutching her steaming tea cup? Oblivious to your crying baby, your face caked in a Latvian green mud mask, the sound of chatter from your demanding house guests?\u00a0 I just have a few things to say.\u00a0 First, a tidbit:  if any of you moms of special needs kids out there are struggling with teaching your son to print his lower case letters, may I suggest switching over to cursive? We're doing it and it's a smash hit.\u00a0 Fluffy is so proud of himself! We've only just started and he's already writing 'dad dad dad' over and over in his fantabulous chalky swirls. I bought the slim spiral-bound  Loops and Other Groups  used from Amazon at the bargain price of $5,000 or was it $50? In any case, it was worth it.\u00a0 Now, an admission:  In our house, the tooth fairy is an idiot. Last month, Fluffy presented his fifth lost tooth to me in all its bloody glory. He swiftly deposited it in my hand and we danced and celebrated and once we were done, I lovingly placed it in a small glass ramekin for safe-keeping until nighttime.\u00a0 That night, after swooping through the kitchen with my sponge, dumping, wiping, and rinsing, I froze as the ancient axons sluggishly fired within my thick skull and then shrieked into my dishtowel. No small glass ramekin. No tooth.  What had I done? This is where my stint as a fabricator came in handy. I fashioned a tooth out of two pieces of brown rice. A bit of sculpting with the steak knife and voil\u00e1! After a slightly frantic search for the tooth pillow (which was never found) I slipped the facsimile into Fluffy's pillowcase and he was none the wiser. Last night, the sixth tooth came out. There was the usual fanfare and this time, I never let that tooth out of my sight until bedtime when we gently secured it in the tooth pillow's (now recovered from behind the bookcase) compartment.\u00a0 And then the tooth fairy forgot to come.\u00a0 Fluffy wandered into our room this morning with the tooth pillow's compartment and his mouth hanging wide open. What happened? I asked, silently imploring Dave with my blinking eyes to  go get a friggin' coin and sneak back into his room and put it somewhere on that bed!  It turns out that he was simultaneously and silently imploring with his own blinking eyes, \u00a0Well, then, get your butts out of here because the coin I'm after is here in my dresser drawer! So, Fluffy and I went to the bathroom to ponder the situation while Dave uncharacteristically zipped here and there and then we all methodically turned over every pillow until we found the coin,  OH! There is it! But, why didn't she take the tooth?  Fluffy inquired.\u00a0 Er, good question!\u00a0 And finally, a small rant:  The local Freecycle seems to be run by bitter trolls.\u00a0 Dave and I both joined when we arrived here in Northampton, energized by a second wave of purging our home of unnecessary  things.  Dave put a pile of said things on the street and then posted to the Freecycle list, including our address so people could feel free to swing by and browse. He promptly got kicked off the list. Apparently they have a strict rule about not posting addresses. The reason? They don't want to encourage others to waste gas driving by a house that may not have the goods anymore. Oh. We didn't know Freecycle monitored the gas consumption of its members. Dave was told he could reapply for posting status in two months. Two months went by; Dave applied to be reinstated and asked if he could have a discussion off-list about the policy and when the moderator agreed, Dave sent him what I though was a very respectful email, questioning the harshness of the punishment especially considering it was a first offense and done unwittingly.\u00a0And, considering he'd seen others on the list do the same.\u00a0And, considering that the moderators never post friendly reminders to the group, reiterating policy. The moderator replied with a bizarrely outraged answer, saying Dave sounded like a guy \"used to getting what he wants\" and that he \"didn't buy it\". He denied his request, and offered that he could reapply in another THREE months. Oy vey was me.\u00a0 I posted to the list, saying, hey guys, make sure you don't put include your address in your notices and summarized what had happened to Dave. And, yes, you guessed it,  I  got kicked off the list with this notification: \"Your post just earned you a place in the dog house with your friend.\" My question to all of you, does this seem in keeping with the spirit of Freecycle? I think not.\u00a0 There was more to the exchange. I tell you, I despise injustice! Even ones at this miniscule level! I sent a flurry of emails to this moderator, more than I ought to have were I the kind of woman to be in possession of a modicum of self-control.

I do have it. At least,\r\nthe answer that is working for us. \r\n\r\n So far. \r\n\r\n It\u2019s in this great book with\r\nthe bad title:  Transforming the Difficult Child; The Nurtured Heart Approach, by Howard Glasser. \r\n\r\n It all started about a month\r\nago, on my birthday week, my terrible, awful birthday when Dave and I were\r\ngetting divorced and Fluffy was struggling in the much-anticipated\r\ntheater/social skills group for the second week in a row, leaping on, grabbing\r\nat, and kicking the kids and generally losing possession of himself to such a\r\ndegree that I knew we\u2019d have to drop the class. Which made me feel a teeny tiny bit\r\ndespairing. \r\n\r\n The next day, I took Fluffy to\r\nOT and during our session, another boy came in with his team. This was fine. We\r\noften end up sharing the room for part of the time. The hospital-like curtain\r\nwas closed but the other boy race over to our side to stand and stare at Fluffy\r\nwho immediately yanked him to his chest in a sort of pro-wrestling hug and then\r\nthrew him to the wall where the big fat cushy mat hanging there, thankfully,\r\nabsorbed the blow. The boy seemed dazed but also, thankfully, fine as he was\r\nushered back to his side. \r\n\r\n But I was upset. \r\n\r\n And tense. And frustrated. And\r\nworried. The words, STOP DOING THAT! JUST STOP IT! screamed inside my head. I jumped up and crouched in front of him, cupping his shoulders\r\nand said through clenched jaw,  That is  not  okay. It\u2019s  not  okay to grab and push other kids. \r\n\r\n The OT said something cheerful\r\nabout the next activity. I skulked back to my seat feeling out of control,\r\nineffectual, and exposed. Fluffy laughed and climbed inside the big barrel.\r\nLater in the session, the OT said to me,  Do you know about the Nurtured Heart Approach?\r\nThe whole OT staff here took the training with the author. It\u2019s really very\r\neffective. \r\n\r\n Effective. Yes! That\u2019s what I\r\nwant to be! \r\n\r\n I went home and ordered the\r\nbook. When it came, I skimmed through the first few chapters and went straight\r\nto the section on what I was to actually DO.  JUST GIMME THE BASICS, DAMMIT!  I\r\ngrumbled as I started to read. \r\n\r\n I'm about halfway through\r\nthe book. I\u2019m going through it slowly, adding new techniques little by little.\r\nDave got the dvd; he needs to see and hear things for them to sink in. But the\r\nwonderful news is that he\u2019s on board. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m doing on my own\r\nand then hounding him to join. We\u2019re truly partnered on this one, and I think\r\nthat\u2019s why it\u2019s been working as well as it has. \r\n\r\n So, what are we doing? We\r\nstarted with what they call Video Moments, observations that mirror what Fluffy\r\nis doing throughout the day. Short observations, four or five times an hour,\r\nevery hour you\u2019re with your child. That\u2019s right, every 10-15 minutes. \r\n\r\n These are observations with\r\nwarmth and energy but without judgment. When Fluffy\u2019s swinging on his swing, I\r\nsay,  Wow! I can see you are pumping with such energy!  When he\u2019s folding paper,\r\n Man, you are folding with such focus. I can tell you\u2019re really motivated to\r\nfinish that plane!  When he\u2019s complaining about going outside,  I can see how\r\nhard it is for you to stop what you\u2019re doing and get ready to go outside. \r\n\r\n Whatever he\u2019s doing, I play it\r\nback for him. All. Day. Long. \r\n\r\n Of course, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t\r\nreally do it four or five times an hour for every hour. But I do it  a lot . I\r\ncatch myself, realizing it\u2019s been a while since I last said something, look at\r\nhim and really observe, and then play  him  back to  himself . I beam my attention\r\nand focus and energy back without editorializing, without the,  That\u2019s great! Or\r\nGood job! Or I like that! Or that\u2019s not okay! Or I\u2019m getting frustrated with\r\nyou!  Or anything that's about praise or disapproval. Never about disapproval. \r\n\r\n I do this even when he\u2019s\r\nannoyed or angry, frustrated or disappointed.  I can tell you are really mad\r\nabout that,  I say. \u00a0  I can see\r\nyou\u2019re having really big feelings about this. I notice that you\u2019re working very\r\nhard to use self-control. Wow, you are using incredible strength right now, I\r\ncan really see that. \r\n\r\n Etc etc. \r\n\r\n After a few weeks, we added\r\nphase two. In phase two, you add your own positive feelings to your\r\nobservations that are focused on your child\u2019s success. \u00a0  In addition to Video Moments, you now\r\nalso make hearty and positive exclamations when your child has done something\r\nwell, even when it\u2019s not something for which you\u2019ve explicitly asked. \r\n\r\n So, when Fluffy and I go to the\r\nstore to pick up a few things, I bring up what I noticed in the car on the way\r\nhome, mentioning things even if they\u2019ve not historically been a problem. I say,\r\n Wow, Fluffy! I am so proud of you! You were so well behaved in that store! You\r\nfollowed all the store rules. You didn\u2019t take things off the shelves! You used\r\nan inside voice! That shows such maturity! \r\n\r\n I try to be specific. I\u2019ll\r\nmention a small moment like,  I noticed at one point a woman we didn\u2019t know was\r\nstanding where you wanted to go and you waited until she\r\nmoved. You exercised such patience and respect!  Or,  I saw your hand start to move to take this from me and then you stopped yourself. Wow! I really appreciated the effort you made!\u00a0 \r\n\r\n We haven\u2019t gotten to the\r\nsection in the book about consequences. For now, I\u2019m sticking with Video\r\nMoments when Fluffy is struggling. I\u2019m sticking with my own non-judgmental\r\nobservations, taking care that I stay neutral. And you know what\u2019s happening?\r\nThe difficult moments don\u2019t last, they don\u2019t escalate. In fact, when Fluffy gets\r\nmad now, he storms out of the room usually yelling, maybe knocking over a chair\r\nor pushing books off the table top. But he goes to his room on his own\r\nself-imposed break. When he returns, I lay it on thick:  Wow! I really love that\r\nyou took a break and calmed down! That is not easy to do! A lot of kids have a\r\nreally hard time doing that and you just did it all on your own! I am really\r\nimpressed!  In the old days, I would have taken the time for a \u2018teaching\r\nmoment\u2019, going over what happened that wasn\u2019t okay, the inciting incident, the\r\nyelling, the knocking over of furniture. I would have also mentioned that\r\ntaking a break on his own was great but that would have gotten lost under all\r\nthe other words, words that only reinforce what wasn't okay rather than what WAS. \r\n\r\n We\u2019re also not yet to the\r\nsection about earning points. I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re going to do when we get\r\nthere. I\u2019m not sure I want to add in points or play money as the prize for good\r\nbehavior which is then traded in for treats (which could be anything) because\r\nwhat I notice is that Fluffy is already feeling good about himself. His own\r\nshifting self-image is the prize. He is earning his own sense of pride. \r\n\r\n The premise in the Nurtured Heart Approach (NHA) is that\r\nkids notice where we are putting our energy and they respond, they move toward\r\nthat energy. When they are acting well, when they are behaved, when they are\r\ndoing what it expected of them, we may feel pleased or we may simply feel\r\nrelieved but we often say nothing. When they are misbehaving, when they are not\r\ndoing what we want, we bring varying degrees of our intensity in the form of\r\nnegative attention. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n The NHA says we need to flip\r\nthat\u2014give very little or no energy to the behaviors we don\u2019t want and give lots\r\nof energy to the behavior we want. \r\n\r\n Behavior modification, anyone? \r\n\r\n I know. I know! But you know\r\nwhat? It\u2019s working! \r\n\r\n Dave, always more of a behavior\r\nfan feels validated at long last. It\u2019s like animal training, he says gleefully!\r\nIt validates his long-held theory the self grows by the food of attention. \r\n\r\n And frankly, it may be a\r\nbehavioral approach but what I\u2019m noticing is that the correction, if you will,\r\nis happening on a developmental level. Fluffy\u2019s sense of self, his perception\r\nand perspective is changing. His ability to self-regulate is maturing. His\r\nself-control is emerging. He\u2019ll now bring up his own behavior with a sense of\r\npride.  I was a help in the store, wasn\u2019t I, mom? I put my coat away without\r\nbeing asked! Yesterday, I even put the water bottle back where it belonged and\r\nDad was amazed! \r\n\r\n Maybe you\u2019re like I was at\r\nfirst and you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ve been doing this sort of thing all along and\r\nit hasn\u2019t worked. But you know, as I read and as I began to try this, I realize\r\nit\u2019s not quite what I\u2019ve been doing. Even though I\u2019ve always reflected Fluffy\r\nback to himself, always celebrated his efforts, always given him gobs of\r\nattention, there is something different here. \r\n\r\n I\u2019ve never paid as close\r\nattention to my own response when Fluffy is being difficult. And Fluffy can be\r\ndifficult. I said this book has an bad title but the truth is, some kids are\r\neasy and some are not and the one\u2019s that are not are, well,  harder . So parenting them is harder. The regular\r\nstuff doesn\u2019t work. And getting tougher doesn\u2019t work either. These kids push. And\r\npush. And push more.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\r\n And underneath that pushing is a big mass of swirling energy. I think these kids, certainly Fluffy, experiences energy differently, in their own body, mind, and heart. I think their energy often becomes intense, when they are excited, bored, anxious, worried, confused, hungry,\r\ntired, scared, sad, angry. And I think they are more affected by the energy of those around them. And I think (my my! so much thinking!) they struggle with filters, one of them being how much of what kind of messages are filtered back in from the things we say and do and the energy we bring when we say and do those things.\u00a0 I know in Fluffy's case, he seems to have this odd construct of himself: a startling cutout of 100% perfection behind which low self-esteem winces. He sometimes bites his own arm or punches his own head when he's done something he thinks was 'stupid', mumbling that we must think he's a 'terrible, awful' kid. It shocks us, every time. \u00a0I think the NHA is helping with this, allowing more of the positive messages through his filter, helping him SEE himself, more of his wonderful, passionate, curious, engaged, successful self, more of the time. \r\n\r\n Okay. There\u2019s my answer. Feel\r\nfree to try it out or toss it aside. \r\n\r\n We\u2019ve got a few more chapters\r\nto go. I\u2019ll keep you posted on what we do when it comes to consequences and\r\nrewards. In the meantime, I\u2019m pouring my energy into every moment of success I\r\nsee, staying neutral when negative behaviors rise up, and giving a steady\r\nstream of Video Moments, feeding them back to Fluffy, all day long. \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0967050707/104-9006854-5491961?SubscriptionId=03P5DH6KNFTA8Y1JCJ02"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/11/the-answer-at-least-for-us-so-far.html", "title": "The answer, at least, for us, so far..."},

{"date": "November 07, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \r\n  Fluffy at the start of a hike; October, 2008. I went to the first meeting of a Spirit Group on Sunday. I didn't know what to expect other than we were going to speak to, and be guided by, our angels. I'm all for vision work and prayer and tuning into the 'still small voice' inside, listening to one's intuition and using joy and inspiration as true north on our spiritual compasses. But I've never been a big  angel  gal, per se. But why not? I love using magnetic poetry as a way to consult to the oracle. I stare, transfixed and unblinking as Miss Daisy the psychic, confers with my spirit guide (apparently assigned to me since birth) by name. I believe in the great mystery and if it's a mystery, then doesn't it follow that some of the details might include a few way out things? Like angels sprinkled about, floating at our sides, gently nudging us toward this and away from that, whispering words of comfort and insight during a commercial break from our usual internal loop? So, off I went.\u00a0 I wrote to my angels, asking for guidance, and then wrote their answer back to me in the automatic writing style. Have you done this? You put pen to paper and let it fly. Don't think. Don't judge. Just write until it 'feels' done. Yes, it's very groovy and \u00a0you have to simply go with it. If you're sure you're making it all up, you're doing it right. If you're sure you're receiving dictation, you're doing it right. In other words,  there is no doing it wrong. I liked it. I liked the exercise, I liked the people, I liked the woman who led the group, the same woman who runs the new social skills group with an OT, the who believes our kids are Indigos, the 'new children', here to 'teach us'. The one who, years ago, I would have dismissed by saying,  All kids are new! All kids are here to teach us! I left the group feeling good. And then something cool happened. I began to feel better and better, lighter if you will, until I knew this good feeling was the truth about me, about us, about life. It was like I was a  Chia Pet , sprouting spiritual calm like grass until I was wrapped in a blanket of green fuzz, like the moon encircled by a glowing mist.\u00a0 I met a woman there who is launching a fantastic website. It's called  Hear To Inspire . She's collecting stories from every day people about every day moments that are transformed when we choose to respond with acceptance, honesty, kindness, love, and tolerance. She asked us to spread the word, contribute a story, and offer feedback.\u00a0 I'm here to spread the word. Go  check it out .

Win, that it.\u00a0 By then, I may have lost some readers but we, as a nation, will have gained our best chance for a restoration that has been a long time coming.\u00a0 As Bush once said, it's time to  make the pie higher. Me? I am barely hanging on. IS IT WEDNESDAY YET?\u00a0 I try all kinds of things to make Tuesday night come faster; compulsively watching Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow, checking and rechecking polls, sporting my Obama button on my Obama t-shirt,\u00a0erratically bellowing\u00a0 OBAMA! \u00a0driving around in my Obama-labeled car, canvassing in New Hampshire, calling my sister and mother every five seconds to shake out our hands so we continue to cup hope. Today, I found  this site  where I made my own electoral map.\u00a0 I highly recommend it. Mine has made me deliriously happy. I've got Obama/Biden with a solid 361 compared to Mccain/Palin's 177. I could make the entire country blue, even Alaska way up there where it's guarding Russia! Blue! Blue! I can make them ALL BLUE! (Cackle cackle!)\u00a0 In my map, McCain gets Florida but he loses Arizona. The thing is, I think this could very well happen. Hope. It's a lovely word that has taken on a sour sound. I hear people talking about drinking the Obama Kool-Aid. In one disturbing exchange on a homeschooling listserv, someone likened Obama's words of hope to Jonestown. Gulp. I wrote back, Are you  really  comparing Obama's message of hope to Jonestown?  Yes,  he replied.  Do you have a problem with that logic? As you can imagine, the list broke out in a heated flurry of emails, but surprisingly, most were along the same lines as those who cast me as a Kool-Aid drinking starry eyed fool hell bent on my own (and the country's) destruction. Many were furious about the word hope. FURIOUS! Angrily crushing it beneath their boots as if it were a saber-toothed moth let loose in the closet with their cashmere.\u00a0 Jeez. What had hope ever done to them?\u00a0 I've written before about the word hope, that it can sometimes, for me, come from this place of fear, of needing the thing I hope for to rescue me from what feels intolerable should it never change. But you know, when I hear Obama talk about this nation, about his story, about race, about his vision, about listening, I feel moved. I feel a swelling of a different sort of hope, one that comes not from fear but from a promise of what is right and true--the spirit to move forward into the unknown with the strength that comes from suppleness, permeability, literally, the ability to be affected by those around you. The belief that something good is on the way and the willingness, even eagerness, to meet that, engage with that. And be changed.\u00a0 Speaking of change, here\u00a0 is an inspiring clip from an upcoming film about hope and change and children of the world featuring the art of a dear family friend, the wildly powerful and equally talented  Helen Webber . \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/maps/obama_vs_mccain/?map=1", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8--VOmCIKOw&feature=email", "http://www.helenwebber.com/homepage.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/11/we-will-return-to-our-regular-broadcast-when-obama-wins-on-tuesday.html", "title": " We will return to our regular broadcast when Obama wins on Tuesday..."},

That is, too fast. \r\n\r\n I homeschool because that\u2019s\r\nwhat he needs. I\u2019ve taken it on. I\u2019m okay with it. It\u2019s stretching me in\r\nhealthy ways.

So he has pals, a\r\ncommunity, projects, outings. So he gathers positive experiences outside of his\r\nhome. So he sees himself as having a place out in the world. So a portion of\r\n\u201cthe village\u2019 can be involved in his life, in our life. And yes, so I can have\r\nthose hours for myself. \r\n\r\n I want those hours. \r\n\r\n This is the truth of where I\r\nam. I want those hours. I am not going to get those hours yet. Fluffy is not\r\nready for the school. And right now, the dream school is here, at home. \r\n\r\n The new sitter/teacher is\r\nwonderful, the perfect addition to the mix. He\u2019s an education major who dropped\r\nout after becoming discouraged by how much of the current paradigm would have\r\nto shift in order to truly meet the children where they are. He comes from the\r\nradical place that believes children hold the wisdom within. He comes from the\r\nradical place that believes in being truly present and curious. I can learn a\r\nthing or two from E. \r\n\r\n So, I find myself in much the\r\nsame place I\u2019ve been since I gave birth almost 8 years ago: how to take care of\r\nmyself and take care of my son at the same time.

I\u2019m exhausted!  \r\n\r\n I know it sounds nutty but I\r\nfeel as if I, alone, am holding Obama up, keeping him clear of the slime that\r\nis, this very second, flying through the air trying to find a place to stick.\r\nThankfully, Obama is too busy looking, sounding and being presidential as he\r\ncriss-crosses the country, in and out of those precious battleground states\r\ndelivering his \u2018closing arguments\u2019, his message of hope, of unity, frankly, of\r\nSANITY. \r\n\r\n It\u2019s not just me. We\u2019re all\r\nholding him up, aren\u2019t we? \u00a0  Keeping\r\nthe current slime at bay, guarding against the manufacture of  new  slime that is busily being churned up in all the\r\nright wing corners. Rev. Wright has made his reappearance, as expected. And now\r\nObama, in addition to being a Muslim, a terrorist, and a foreigner, is a\r\nsocialist who is hell bent on trying to turn the IRS into a welfare\r\norganization. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n I\u2019m planning on being in New\r\nHampshire this Saturday. My mom is going to New Mexico. My sister is going back\r\nto Pennsylvania. I really wish I could hop a plane and go to North Carolina,\r\nland on my cousins\u2019 doorsteps and shake and bake some sense into their\r\nneighbors. \r\n\r\n So, I\u2019m here to ask you this: Whether you\u2019re making calls or knocking on doors or simply yelling SHUT\r\nUP YOU IDIOT at the television every time you see McCain slink or Palin wink,\r\nwill you all please visualize Obama with his hand on the bible, taking the oath of\r\noffice? See him as our President. Right now. Know in your heart it happened and\r\nit is good and right and historic and an astonishing moment of pride and a\r\nmeasure of our maturation and courage as a nation that we dared to see a  man \r\nand not a skin color. \r\n\r\n Because I figure at this point,\r\nif you\u2019re voting for McCain, your infatuation with Palin has blinded you to her\r\nnaked and dangerous ambition or you are a racist who could never bring yourself\r\nto cast a vote for a man of color, or maybe you are a war-enthusiast who\r\nbelieves it\u2019s wise to engage in a real-life game of RISK that wages wars for\r\ngenerations, that imperialistic America\u2019s only hope for security lies in  total\r\nglobal domination,  or perhaps you believe that the potential life formed at the\r\nmoment of conception ought to be protected by the constitution, that it trumps the right of the mother in whose fallopian tube it floats. \r\n\r\n And one last thing: who are\r\nthese undecideds? What do they need to hear that they haven\u2019t yet heard? WHAT??\r\nThis boggles the mind. \r\n\r\n Oh, I am asking another thing:\r\ndocument your voting experience. Video your vote in partnership with PBS 2008\r\nis asking everyone to videotape their voting experience--early, mail-in or day\r\nof--it doesn\u2019t matter. Document it and then submit it to this  site : If you're not sure what the laws say about filming in your area, go  here. \r\n\r\n Because voter fraud is not\r\nabout ACORN registering Mickey Mouse.  Voter fraud  is\u00a0about  throwing out perfectly\r\nlegal votes,  ripping up lawfully filled out registration forms,  posting\r\nintentionally misleading signs  and instructions, and  computers that change votes. \u00a0 \r\n\r\n Me? I'm bringing my video camera, my regular camera and Fluffy. I'm documenting the event, for uploading to that site, but mostly for posterity. For the scrapbook. So Fluffy will have a record of where he was when we, all of us, made history.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Obama will win. Obama has won.  \r\n\r\n And we will reap the benefits\r\nfrom that fact. \r\n\r\n But only if we  get up  and  speak\r\nup  and  stay up  until we are assured that our votes have been counted. \r\n\r\n EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Edited to add this website left in the comments section by Jess (thanks, Jess!):  Go here  to get the facts about Obama and fight the smears. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/videoyourvote", "http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/documenting-your-vote", "http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen/", "http://www.amazon.com/Was-2004-Presidential-Election-Stolen/dp/1583226877", "http://www.truthout.org/102808VA", "http://www.democracynow.org/2008/10/22/votes", "http://www.fightthesmears.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/10/possibly-my-last-post-about-the-election-but-i-cant-promise-that.html", "title": "Possibly my last post about the election, though I can't promise that..."},

{"date": "October 08, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t yesterday was my birthday. i turned 49. forty-nine. that's a four and then a nine.\u00a0 i'm on my way to half a century.\u00a0 could i sound older? the indomitable  drama mama  wished me happy birthday on her blog. she is great. she rocks. i wish i lived in SF so we could slam back celebratory margaritas and smash the empty glassware into the fireplace. or sit in mudbaths with cucumbers on our eyeballs while romanians peel dead skin off the bottom of our feet with giant cheese graters. or gyrate on the dance floor wearing our bras on the outside of our shirts, sweat pouring down our face like tiny raindrops.\u00a0 halfway through the day, i sent her an email saying it was the worst birthday of my life. dave and i were on the brink of divorce; beegu was nearly killed when the outdoor table collapsed under her weight; fluffy was removed from his new theater/social skills class after a mere fifteen minutes due to behavior that compromised the safety of the other kids.\u00a0 the thing that is not really understood by many is that,  this behavior  comes  from feeling unsafe . one can feel profoundly unsafe even if no one else  sees  where it comes from. it is still real. this unsafety creates an imbalance in my son and then he acts from the imbalance in an attempt to feel better. but what he ends up doing makes the  other  kids feel unsafe and then  they  react and  he  reacts to  their  reaction and the whole thing goes round and round. at one point, after one of the teachers and i were coaching/talking to fluffy in a separate room, he went back in to 'try' but before he could join the activities, the main teacher thought it was appropriate to talk at great length about how fluffy's behavior made all the other kids feel unsafe. he asked fluffy to sit,  no, come back, sit, sit,  and listen to the kids talk about how what fluffy did made them feel scared. this was a disaster. as it would have been for anyone. can you imagine? asking a seven year old to sit and listen to that? it reminds me of that dear boy made to stand in front of his fellow kindergarteners and listen to the list of his 'bad behavior' before they all voted to kick him out of the class.\u00a0 we are  all done  with that class. i called the main teacher and told him that what he did was inappropriate. i'm not sure he was ever able to see my point. it's hard to have that heard above the fact that fluffy was behaving in a way that was not okay. it's not okay to jump on other kids, to kick them, to scream loudly in their faces. it's not okay to lunge for the teacher when she intervenes. it's not okay to race down to the waiting room and scream blah blah blah over and over again at the top of one's voice. but it's certainly communication. and it's certainly more than okay to listen; it's imperative. so. no theater/social skills class for fluffy. at least, not that one. i haven't been writing in here lately. i've been swept up by obama fever and mccain chills. i've been watching my three favorite shows each weeknight:  Countdown with Keith Olbermann, \u00a0 The Rachel Maddow Show , and  The Daily Show . that's where i get my news. that's where i hear a version of current events that makes sense to me, however unsettling those reports can be. at least someone else is talking about the insanity, the lies, the distortions. at least by the time i get to Jon Stewart's take on things, i can shout out big barky laughs. i haven't been writing here because i'm not sure how to put form to the formless. we are the definition of inchoate over here. the enki program is not working for fluffy. the rhythms i so dutifully worked out this summer do not fit. i found, i cannot simply pick up a 'shape to the day' and put it on my son as if i were fitting him for outerwear.\u00a0 remember when i cursed the resistance? well guess what, resistance is communication, too. if i really believe that  all  behavior is communication, that education is a conversation and not a lecture, then i must align my  own  behavior accordingly. i must honor what i am seeing in my son and not see it as 'wrong'. if he is pushing back against what i am offering, then i must take a closer look at  what  i am offering and be willing to adjust, amend, or even throw the whole fucking thing out the window and start from scratch. my friend  harvest mom  said she had this image of us literally throwing notebooks out the windows, papers wildly flying from the binders and flapping through the colorful trees.\u00a0 i love that image so much, i did it. well, figuratively. i wish i had done that literally but the truth is that moments after the breathless release, i'd have to race out there, soberly collecting all the trash from gutters and rooftops and telephone poles all the while peeing in my pants because that's what happens when you're nearly fifty and female and a little jello-y in the keigels.\u00a0 i'm reading  Theory U: Leading from the Future as it Emerges  that talks about leading with an 'open mind, open heart, and open will. i'm taking an on-line course designed to find a whole new way to approach education.\u00a0 but most of all, i'm willing to not know what i'm doing.\u00a0 i guess it's like the question from the debates last night that was sent in by woman in nearby Amherst: what don't you know and how will you learn it? my answer is simple:\u00a0i don't how to educate fluffy right now.\u00a0 how will i learn this? i don't know. yet. but i do know that i don't need to be afraid of not knowing any more than i need to KNOW in order to carry on with trust. i can trust right now. even as the committee of hysterical kids in my head wring their hands and jump up and down in a panic yelling OH NO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO! i don't need to shut anyone up.\u00a0 i can Keep Calm And Carry On, as the old WW2 slogan goes, listening for the greater wisdom that is, right now, on the way.\u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://likeashark.blogspot.com/", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/", "http://", "http://www.thedailyshow.com/", "http://along-the-crooked-path.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Theory-U-Leading-Future-Emerges/dp/0974239054"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/10/on-my-way-to-half-a-century.html", "title": "on my way to half a century"},

{"date": "October 13, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Before I move on to Fluffy and his Fluffy-greatness, I must link to this article, entitled,  McCain Volunteers Taught to Accuse Obama of Terrorism.\u00a0 This is what I'm saying.\u00a0 I've heard lots of people say,  That McCain--he's basically a good guy .  And you know what? No. He's not. He's not basically a  good guy . If we were basically a  good guy , he would not resort to lies and distortion, fear-mongering and slander in order to scramble to the top job in the nation. But hey,  my friends , this is his last shot and he knows it. So anything goes.\u00a0 He may  once  have been a  good guy , a long long time ago when he dressed up as a giant peanut or panda bear or something dear and sweet and innocent for Halloween to trick-or-treat in his elite Washington-area neighborhood growing up. But not now. But Fluffy! Now, THERE'S a  good guy . Unmistakably. Unequivocally. Irrefutably. Behold: Fluffy at the fair; October, 2008. I'm running out the door with him any minute, off to Rhode Island for the day to have a belated birthday celebration for me and a playdate with Fluffy's friend A. Here's my wisdom for the day: Trust. That's it, simply Trust.\u00a0 What happens to me is that I go through the big upheavals, riding them up and down like a rickety ship in the dark stormy seas, railing at the heavens, laughing combatively, gripping the tiller with fierce determination and fear and then suddenly I'm in the blue-green tropical waters of trust, clear and still.  Ahhhhh, yes!  I say,  I remember! Trust! It's the only thing that matters!\u00a0 Things don't need to go according to my plan for me to be and feel safe. I can trust in the universe, in the power and wisdom of the natural flow in my life, call it God or spirit or the law of attraction or a bra that really fits and a pair of shoes that make your legs look awesome, call it the face of child you cherish or the grunty sounds of love and support from someone who absolutely GETS YOU at your core. Call it whatever you want. It's that feeling that tells you all is well and always has been and will be.\u00a0 So, that class was the wrong class. Fluffy knew. He knew before I knew. The night we came home from that disastrous meeting, the night my husband and I were lighting each others' hair on fire with our words, the night I turned forty-nine, I drove into town to buy myself some kick-ass indian food. While it was cooking I went next door to buy myself a kick-ass bottle of wine and I saw a flyer for a new social skills group led by two woman, one an OT and one a woman who wrote a book called, The Highly Sensitive Kids Guide. Bingo. I called her up. We went to see her. Now, a few years ago I would have scoffed at the notion of seeing someone who claims to work with the 'new children', the 'indigos' who have come here to 'teach us'. I would have huffed and snickered under my breath,  jesus, give me a friggin' break.  But now? I'm open. I'm open to whatever is going on for Fluffy and whatever I can do to support him.\u00a0 What do I know? Do I think Fluffy is an Indigo? Well, I know he loves blue and he's certainly wise beyond his years and he seems in possession of a highly tuned in and frequently unprotected nervous system and always has harking back to his colic and his night terrors and the startle reflex that I am now convinced was actually seizure activity.\u00a0 But Indigo?\u00a0 Pfaw. What does it matter. What matters to me is finding people who are working from their heart.\u00a0From love. From where one is able to see and hear most clearly. Where one  trusts \u00a0in what will be revealed rather than one  knows  what will be revealed.\u00a0 There's a little 7 year old girl who lives across the street. I'll call her Missy. Missy and her younger brother--I'll call him Max, have been dying to be friends with Fluffy since our truck pulled up over a month ago.\u00a0 Missy is exceptional: bright, funny, friendly, and super-duper  duper  regulated.\u00a0 The mother and I have talked. She knows our challenges. She may have said something to Missy. I don't know.\u00a0 But I do know that Missy kept saying  hi,  kept circling our driveway in her little silver scooter, kept coming over with bouquets made of colorful beeswax and bunches of freshly picked flowers even as Fluffy looked beyond her or didn't answer or said  go away . The day after my birthday, Fluffy and Missy and Max played for over an hour outside. Together. Unsupervised. (Well, okay, both Dave and I kept peering out the door and windows and finding reasons to rummage through things in the garage.) They've played several times since. All three of them, on their scooters, making up a game, agreeing to all the rules, allowing Missy to be the leader, dashing in and out of the house retrieving various tools and toys, communicating via walky-talkies.\u00a0 When Fluffy came in from playing last night he allowed that maybe one day, he would marry Missy.\u00a0 What happens to me is that somewhere along the way, in my trusting and believing in Fluffy and his future, I take back the reigns and decide how the next steps ought to go, how it ought to look. And when it doesn't go that way, I forget. And I'm back on those swelling seas. Today, I remember.\u00a0 Fluffy is developing beautifully.

If you grow up in Hawaii, raised by your grandparents, you're 'exotic,\u00a0 different.' Grow up in Alaska eating mooseburgers, a quintessential American story.

Attend 5 different small colleges before graduating, you're well grounded. If you spend 3 years as a community organizer, become the first black\u00a0 President of the Harvard Law Review, create a voter registration drive that\u00a0 registers 150,000 new voters, spend 12 years as a Constitutional Law\u00a0 professor, spend 8 years as a State Senator representing a district with\u00a0 over 750,000 people, become chairman of the state Senate's Health and Human\u00a0 Services committee, spend 4 years in the United States Senate representing a\u00a0 state of 13 million people while sponsoring 131 bills and serving on the\u00a0 Foreign Affairs, Environment and Public Works and Veteran's Affairs\u00a0committees, you don't have any real leadership experience. If your total resume is: local weather girl, 4 years on the city council\u00a0 and 6 years as the mayor of a town with less than 7,000 people, 20 months as\u00a0 the governor of a state with only 650,000 people, then you're qualified to\u00a0 become the country's second highest ranking executive. If you have been married to the same woman for 19 years while raising 2\u00a0 beautiful daughters, all within Protestant churches, you're not a real\u00a0 Christian. \u00a0 If you cheated on your first wife with a rich heiress, and left your\u00a0 disfigured wife and married the heiress the next month, you're a Christian. If you teach responsible, age appropriate sex education, including the\u00a0 proper use of birth control, you are eroding the fiber of society.\u00a0 If, while governor, you staunchly advocate abstinence only, with no other\u00a0 option in sex education in your state's school system while your unwed teen\u00a0 daughter ends up pregnant, you're very responsible. If your wife is a Harvard graduate lawyer who gave up a position in a\u00a0 prestigious law firm to work for the betterment of her inner city community,\u00a0 then gave that up to raise a family, your family's values don't represent\u00a0 America's. If you're husband is nicknamed 'First Dude,' with at least one DWI\u00a0 conviction and no college education, who didn't register to vote until age\u00a0 25 and once was a member of a group that advocated the secession of Alaska\u00a0 from the USA, your family is extremely admirable.

I decided to do this one because it's something I can actually finish, unlike the packing which seems to go on and on and endlessly on. Okay!

What I haven't revealed is my latest infomercial purchase:  Zumba\u00a0Fitness DVDs . A must have! Quickly! Order them and we can all Zumbafy together! 2. I hate nose-picking. I do. You can talk about the most vile bodily function known to man and I'm on the edge of my seat, raucuos and laughing, looking for a way to join the discussion. But stick one finger in those caverns and I am repulsed beyond measure. I'm uncharacteristically prim and private about my own, um, grooming there\u00a0and, thank the lordy lord, Fluffy has yet to find anything fascinating about his own nose. 3.\u00a0The bottoms of my feet have been sore for two weeks. What is this about? 4. I have a collection of heart-shaped rocks, another of rocks encircled by a continuous line, one more of rocks that are small and smooth, and one more of thin perfectly smooth rocks that look as if they've been sliced from a stone loaf.\u00a0 5. Today, my sister and I watched scenes from the movie,  Swingers , on youtube. I had been telling her forever that she ought to rent it, if only for that  one telephone scene .\u00a0 6. I must admit, I judge  Palin  for having such a young baby at home while she is a Governor. True, the state of Alaska has less people than the city of Memphis and so, really, she's more like a Mayor, but still, now she wants to be VP?

{"date": "September 17, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Gang, I am greatly disturbed by the state of our union. I've been aware of the damage done these last many years but truthfully? Ever since Fluffy was born, my focus and attention has been on and for him. My strongest memory of September 11, 2001 was that my son was happy sitting on the floor in a puddle of his own drool, gnawing on his fist which freed me up for a chat with a friend that lasted more than a few frazzled seconds. It took a year before I was able to allow the events and the significance of the reaction of our leaders to those events sink in. It's still sinking in. In fact, because Fluffy is doing so well, because my life feels blessed, because our day to day has become our own wonderful (albeit, messy and still perplexing at times) norm, I am able to lift my eyes from my immediate surroundings and take in the wider view. And it is not looking so good. The war in Iraq was conceived as a generational war--I'm talking many decades--one hundred years in some estimations. It was not waged for freedom. It was an unconstitutional and imperialistic act waged for oil to line the pockets of the few at the expense of the many.\u00a0 I've been reading and listening these last weeks. And it occurs to me that we, as a people, have been complicit in our silence. I certainly have been. I don't say this out of blame, for me or for anyone else. But I do feel a powerful sense of responsibility to my nation. Some could argue it's the same thing that has motivated me for the last seven years: my passionate concern and preoccupation with my son and his future. Okay. That's fine by me. I care about Fluffy. I care about the world I've brought him into. I care about the future I'm leading him toward. I care about the lessons I hope to embody in how I treat people in and outside the walls of our home, in the words I use, in the dreams I hold. Vision, voice, and action. Visioning in part of our every day life over here. For the last couple of months, we've been visualizing Senator Obama as the President of the United States. Whenever we talk about him, we refer to him as  President  Obama.\u00a0 I hold in my mind the vision of Obama taking the Oath of Office; Fluffy told me that in his vision, a huge American flag takes up background of a platform stage. George Bush steps down and Barack Obama steps up to take his place. Voice is what I bring to this blog and my conversations with friends, family, neighbors, the man behind the deli counter, the waitress who brings my steaming delicious mug of coffee. Action is what I take when I sign up to volunteer at the Obama Headquarters, when I make calls to those on the fence, when I listen to what other people are saying even though what they say makes my face flash with the heat of shock and disbelief.\u00a0 Part of that action is passing along things like  this ad about John McCain .\u00a0 This isn't any different than what I've been trying to do with Fluffy since we began this journey: vision, voice, and action in the world of education, child development, and autism. I just feel ready to open the doors and windows, to see not only the surrounding neighborhood as an extension of my home, but the whole country, the whole planet, even Sarah Palin, bless her lying heart.\u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.brasschecktv.com/page/325.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/09/vision-voice-and-action.html", "title": "Vision, Voice, and Action"},

I\u2019m walking in and out of it all, around it,\r\ntrying not to get any of it on me. \r\n\r\n In fact, the beach of my mind these days is awash with\r\ndebris, as if far out at sea, a violent storm reached down through layers of\r\nocean water and scooped up the sand in angry fistfuls, roiled the waters and\r\nspit the underbelly on the sand. Worry, fear, envy, loneliness. \r\n\r\n Fluffy is lots of things too, lots of f words: fantastic, funny,\r\nfast, floundering, flailing, frustrated, flummoxed, furious, fearful. \r\n\r\n The house is for sale but so far, no one is buying. At\r\nfirst, I made the house sparkle, displayed vases of freshly cut flowers\r\nthroughout, offered cookies to prospective buyers with my brightest smile. Now\r\nI block the front door with my arms folded across my perimenopausal amplitude, jut my chin in their direction and bark, HEY! ARE YOU GONNA BUY THIS MOTHERFUCKING HOUSE OR WHAT? \u00a0 \r\n\r\n We\u2019re moving back to Northampton soon after labor day,\r\nregardless. We\u2019re taking everything despite the urgings of some to leave things\r\nhere, to \u201cstage\u201d the place. I can\u2019t. I want to be in  one  place. I want to be\r\n home . I want to be  settled . But we won\u2019t be, even when we move. We\u2019ll be in a\r\nnew rental. We can\u2019t really be home until we decide what to do about Fluffy\u2019s\r\nschooling. \r\n\r\n For now, homeschooling is the answer. But for always? I\r\ndon\u2019t know. I want to find the perfect school. I don\u2019t know where that is. I am\r\nwilling to  wait  for that school to materialize. I am willing to  move  for that\r\nschool. \u00a0  I am willing to  create \r\nthat school. All that takes time, time and trust, time to see where Fluffy is\r\ngoing, who he is becoming, and what is coming into form, what needs attention,\r\nhow much and what kind. \r\n\r\n He\u2019s social.  This I know . He\u2019s a deeply social. And despite\r\nhow some object to characterizations of autistic kids being TRAPPED inside and\r\nblah blah blah, my experience as Fluffy\u2019s mom is that, in some ways, this is\r\nabsolutely true. There are aspects of him, of his personality, temperment, and\r\nheart and soul that ARE stuck underneath a confusion of sounds and feeling and\r\nimpulses, as if he is fifteen or twenty radio stations simultaneously and\r\nvariably, tuned.\u00a0 Not always. But sometimes. \r\n\r\n He wants to\r\nplay with the kids. \r\n\r\n I want him to play with the kids. \r\n\r\n I am learning how to let him take the lead on this, how to\r\ntrust his timing. And also how to provide the necessary support. It\u2019s not\r\nalways clear how to do this. \r\n\r\n I am a bit lost. \r\n\r\n Fluffy tells me to back off. He uses different words but the\r\nmessage is the same. When he is around the other kids, it\u2019s hard enough. He\r\ndoesn\u2019t need me fluttering about, leaking anxiety. \r\n\r\n Fluffy is very aware. He knows he is different. He knows he\r\ndoesn\u2019t know what to do. He acts in ways that pushes kids away and then, when\r\nhe\u2019s alone, he punches himself in the head and calls himself  Stupid. \r\n\r\n I thought we could avoid this part. I thought I could shield\r\nhim from this. I thought I could protect him from feeling badly about himself.\r\nI thought I was that powerful. \r\n\r\n I hear talk about whether it\u2019s okay to want your kids to be\r\nindistinguishable from the NTs, is that wrong or right, a good or harmful wish\r\nor goal, etc, etc. When my son is near a group of boys that are playing in the sand, racing\r\ndown the walkway to leap over and over again into the sand, when I see him sit\r\ncloser and closer to watch out of the corner of his eye but then never join,\r\ninstead, dribble spit on his fingertips, fill his hat with sand and dump it on\r\nhis head, over and over, I think, Do I need him to run with those kids? No. Do\r\nI wish he would? YES. Do I believe he wants to be running with those kids? YES.\r\nAm I right? \r\n\r\n My mother instinct says yes. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Fuck that talk about indistinguishability. It isn\u2019t about\r\nwanting my kid to disappear in the crowd, it\u2019s about wanting him to  appear  in\r\nthe crowd, to be part of it, however small. \r\n\r\n You know that phrase, where two or more are gathered? It\u2019s\r\nnot religious. It\u2019s sacred. It\u2019s in this quote from  Krishnamurti : \r\n\r\n Action has meaning only in relationship and without understanding relationship, action on any level will only breed conflict. The understanding of relationship is infinitely more\r\nimportant than the search for any plan of action. \r\n\r\n We are human beings. We are about relationships, relationships\r\nwith ourselves and with others.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I want for my son. And in that way,\r\nyes, I long for him to be indistinguishable from any other human.  \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/08/on-indistinguishability.html", "title": "On Indistinguishability"},

Here. In his own home. \r\n\r\n He used to regard the phone as if it were a silly prop or a\r\nfaulty computer, staring into the receiver, annoyed and perplexed by its\r\ninability to display a monitor screen. \r\n\r\n I have much more to say but I don\u2019t know how yet to say it\r\nall. In fact, I haven\u2019t really known how to organize the many posts swirling\r\naround in my head on huge topics like marriage and communication and paying\r\nattention to one\u2019s own needs and letting go. \r\n\r\n I suppose I feel as if I\u2019m traveling in worm holes of my\r\nown, still in the tunnel but moving at a pretty fast clip. Things are changing,\r\ninside and out. And it\u2019s good. \r\n\r\n There have been times over the last four years times when, I\r\ntell you, I KNEW WHAT I KNEW and I could take a lightening bolt through the\r\nheart and still be standing strong and sure and a couple of terrifying moments\r\nwhen I\u2019ve wanted to hang my full weight on the lapels of perfect strangers and\r\nscreech,  BUT WILL HE BE ALLRIGHT? WILL HE EVER HAVE \u00a0  A FRIEND? WHAT AM I MISSING? TELL ME WHAT TO DO GOD DAMN IT! \r\n\r\n On Monday, we\u2019ll begin to pack up this house. After Labor\r\nDay, we\u2019ll move to the new rental in Northampton. The following week, Fluffy\r\nand I will start 2 nd  grade at home. \r\n\r\n A couple of weeks ago, I was feeling lost.\u00a0These days, I\u2019m feeling anticipatory. \r\n\r\n I\u2019ve come to find that in the realm of the gut, there\u2019s as much  not  knowing as  knowing .\u00a0 I\u2019ve always relied on my  feelings . But it\u2019s\r\nnot  one  thing, this trusting the gut, not like climbing to the top of a hill\r\nfor the big simple view. It\u2019s many things, some of them empowering and\r\nexhilarating, others of them wobbly and amorphous, isolating and shot through\r\nwith a spray of worry and still others, like running along, scanning the horizon, waiting\r\nfor the baton to be passed, the baton of inspiration or clarity. Forgive the\r\nOlympics metaphor but in the relay, you rely on  other  as much as  self . You have\r\nto stay on the field, have a clear plan but also be ready to align with\r\nwhomever and whatever is on the way. \r\n\r\n I don\u2019t know what this year will bring but my gut and I? We're out there, ready to catch, carry and pass. And we're feeling pretty good about it. \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/08/jumping-in.html", "title": "Jumping in"},
{"date": "August 31, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Coming out from under my pile of boxes to pass along five links and one story... 1. Chris Pureka  is an wonderful singer/songwriter from Northampton. Have a listen: Download cpureka2-01.m3u 2. War Dance  is a moving film about children in a northern Ugandan refuge camp, all of whom have been devastated by the twenty-year civil war in their country, most orphaned by the civil war, some who've escaped abduction after having been forced to commit unspeakable acts of violence as child soldiers. This film introduces us to a few of these children as they prepare and then participate in a nationwide music and dance competition.\u00a0 It's a beautiful and important film. After I watched it, I immediately went online to  Shine Global  to learn what I could do to help.\u00a0 What I really want to do is adopt one of the twenty thousand parent-less children.\u00a0 3.\u00a0 \u00a0Survivor Corps \u00a0is an organization that is leading a movement to ban cluster bombs, the very bombs being dropped by Russians right now, the very bombs that are killing and maiming the children of Georgia. Go to the site to learn how you can get involved. Here's one I found through the marvelous  Superhero Journa l site, a place where I always find inspiration and food for my soul: 4.  Sarah Groves  singing her song inspired by her recent trip to Rwanda. My god. Talk about devastation. If you haven't seen  Hotel Rwanda , you must. Be forwarned: it is not for the faint at heart.\u00a0 Our neglect of Africans sickens me. You know why we don't care about them? There's nothing for us there, no natural resources, no oil to wet our grubby little hands.\u00a0 5. Here are hands that  make magic from dirt .\u00a0 I will leave you with this: I held a vision that one day, my son would have a friend who'd come over to play. The doorbell would ring, I would answer it and greet the child and his mother but before I could even say a word, my son would race up behind me, calling out excitedly to his friend and they'd tear off to his playroom for hours.\u00a0 I didn't  hope  it would happen that way. I  saw  it as having  already happened . As I pictured it in my mind, my body flooded with joy; my body smiled me and I surrendered in glee. Well, that happened.\u00a0 Was it exactly as I had imagined it?\u00a0 No. It was better.\u00a0 A  did  come over. Fluffy  did  race up and call out to him. They  did  play happily for hours.  Three  hours to be exact. In that time, I puttered around upstairs, baking cookies with A's mom and her daughter. A's dad came over with some food and we grown-ups spontaneously cooked and chatted and sipped wine while A's sister played with Beegu in the yard and Fluffy and A continued to play downstairs.\u00a0 And then we all ate outside on the deck in green light as the late summer sun streamed through the leaves. Afterward, I put on a video for the kids and the grown-ups cleaned up and then piled in front of the Democratic National Convention where the next President of the United States was due to speak about change.\u00a0 At one point, I heard Fluffy say to A,  We need to build that transport for our trip to Mars.  Uhm, \u00a0 M ars? A queried.  Yes!  Fluffy answered confidently. \u00a0This is reality, A. We are GOING to Mars.\u00a0 I want you to know, this is the first time since becoming a mom seven and a half years ago that we, as a family, had another family over for the social and the conversation and the laughing and the playing and the one thing easily and naturally moving to the next without strategic and high tension down-to-the-microsecond planning or facilitating or supervising a babysitter or enlisting Dave to hover or suggest or intervene or join. I was completely relaxed, in the moment, present. We  all  were. There is so much out there in this world of ours, so much to call us to action, the action of creating art, community, safety, justice, salvation, play, connection, celebration. Fluffy and A may indeed one day go to Mars. Me? I'm thrilled to be here on Earth, living  this \u00a0reality.\u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chrispureka.com/newmusic.htm", "http://www.wardancethemovie.com/", "http://www.shineglobal.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=27", "http://www.survivorcorps.org/ConnectStoriesDetail.aspx?sID=1", "http://www.superherodesigns.com/journal/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSdP6PqsbJY", "http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041221/REVIEWS/41213001/1023", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1wfWPtjxMA&feature=related"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/08/quickies.html", "title": "reality"},

{"date": "September 20, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Finally, right? I\u2019ve stepped\r\noff my political soap-box and back into the homeschool classroom. Who cares\r\nwhat I think about the McCain/Palin ticket or the Obama/Biden ticket for that\r\nmatter. Just get back to the quirky things Fluffy says about space for goodness\r\nsakes! \r\n\r\n Okay, then! \r\n\r\n Fluffy is now working on\r\nlaunching an unmanned mission to Mars by the time he is twelve years old--for\r\nreal, he insists. He\u2019ll need to help of his cousins J. and E. as well as his\r\ndear friend, A. and his new babysitter, G. but, by golly, he\u2019s determined to\r\nrescue disappeared US aircraft that he believes have been stolen by denizens of\r\nthe land of rest dust, or red rust, depending on your source.\u00a0 This may be a\r\nresult of our reading  Thomas Disch's,   The Brave Little Toater Goes To Mars , or simply from his\r\nown research in the field of space science. I know not. I only know that he\r\nasks me every day if I think he\u2019s up to the task and every day I say, Yes, my\r\nsweet, I believe it\u2019s possible. Why not? \r\n\r\n So, meanwhile, I\u2019ve launched 2 nd \r\ngrade and if Fluffy\u2019s rocket could indeed get to Mars by the end of this school\r\nyear, at the rate I\u2019m going, my curriculum rocket would maybe get us to the\r\nroof of our new home by spring. \r\n\r\n Ahem. \r\n\r\n We\u2019re doing a modified  Enki ,\r\nfocusing a multicultural theme. Our first \u2018block\u2019 lasting until the end of\r\nOctober, is on Scottish culture. September, language arts; October, math. For\r\nthe rest of this month, we\u2019ll be singing Scottish songs, baking Scottish\r\ndelicacies, reading Scottish authors and traditional Scottish folk stories, and\r\nstudying the live and work of  John Muir. \r\n\r\n There aren't, as yet, any Enki science\r\nmaterials but the stories about John Muir lend themselves easily to further\r\nreading and experiments about trees, leaves, nature and conservation in general.\r\nThe 2 nd  grade crafts book is not ready but since we struggle with\r\nfine motor issues in our house, we\u2019ll be busy enough using projects from both\r\nthe K and 1 st  grade books from years past. \r\n\r\n So, what did Fluffy do this week? \r\n\r\n A lot of yelling and screaming. \r\n\r\n I would sing the getting\r\ndressed song; Fluffy would yell. I would sing the going for a walk song; Fluffy\r\nwould scream and run from the room as if I were chasing him with a flaming\r\npitch fork. I would sing the piano lesson song; Fluffy would topple the bench\r\nand fling himself to the floor to writhe in desperation. Yes! Even the beloved\r\npiano! \r\n\r\n I kept it simple. I had a\r\nfeeling we would hit a wall of resistance and challenge after a summer of chaos\r\nand free-for-all, a move to a new home, and a month or more of scattered mommy\r\nattention so I was all pumped up with my spiritual cocktail of calm, clear, and\r\nconsistent communication with a side of flexibility. \r\n\r\n My goal was simply to\r\nreestablish rhythms, a broad sketching out of contracted, expansive, and transitional\r\nactivities of the day. And you know what? By Wednesday, Fluffy said to me,  Mom?\r\nI think this new schedule is working. It\u2019s superb helping me with my computer\r\naddiction. \r\n\r\n I think of Pete Seeger and one\r\nof the songs he\u2019s known for,  Turn! Turn! Turn!\u00a0 and the lyrics,  To everything turn, turn, turn, There is a season, turn, turn,\r\nturn, A time for every purpose under heaven. \r\n\r\n As we go through the morning, I\r\nsing (inside my head for I daren\u2019t sing the \u2018wrong\u2019 words out loud until Fluffy\r\nis feeling more integrated in this new routine!)  A time to play, a time to eat,\r\na time to dress, a time to walk  knowing that soon enough, the shape of \u00a0  what I lead him through will sink down\r\nand provide a structure that supports us both. \r\n\r\n It's working. The second half of the week was remarkably smooth. We walked, we jumped rope, we read stories, we drew with crayons and wrote lower case letters, we sang songs, we did science projects, met the new OT, the new SLP, and had a wonderful playdate.\u00a0 To top it off, last night we had a houseful of people here to celebrate Dave's birthday. Many of them neither Fluffy nor I had never met, including children. I had the entirely new experience of attending to the guests while Fluffy moved in and out of the fray, unsupervised and entirely happy. At one point, he and the other two kids had taken Twister off the shelves and were tying themselves up in hilarious knots.\u00a0 My Fluffy. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you imagine?\u00a0 Listen, I have some academic goals for my son to be sure, but my vision for him is much the same as my vision for myself. To:\u00a0 \r\n\r\n find a new friend write every day \r\n\r\n feel connected to the earth and\r\nour neighborhood \r\n\r\n discover new things \r\n\r\n deepen our involvement in the\r\nthings we already know and love \r\n\r\n feel strong, flexible, and integrated in\r\nour bodies, minds, and spirits \r\n\r\n And now I shall set out on my mission to  collect signatures for peace \u00a0to end this messy, illegal, protracted, and deadly war in Iraq.

{"date": "June 27, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \r\n Family portrait at a Florida mall; February, 2008.\u00a0 Three years ago this July, I went to my first  RDI \u00a0workshop. Three years ago this August, Fluffy had his first RDA. Three years ago this September, we started working with our RDI consultant.\u00a0 The first order of business was establishing what, at the time, was called the Master/Apprentice relationship but what is now called Guider/Apprentice. This was tricky. The way our consultant guided us\u2013to keep Fluffy with us when he was resistant, stop the action and sit with him by our side\u2013failed miserably. In fact, as much as I tried to end on a positive note during these struggles, Fluffy began to associate activities together with frustration and I lost some of his trust.\u00a0\r\n It wasn\u2019t until I went to the next RDI workshop and heard Dr. Gutstein say, \u201cIt\u2019s  never  about trying to  get  your child  to do  anything. It\u2019s about  being in an interaction with your child  where you both have a clear role and you are  guiding them to a feeling of success .\u201d that I really got it.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I came home, scrapped the old way and began inserting tiny moments through-out the day where I initiated joint interactions. And by tiny, I mean  tiny \u2013ten, twenty, sixty seconds, tops. I thought of it as shaking on some salt, like seasoning my food, sprinkle sprinkle. We\u2019d carry the bag to the car, each holding a handle. We\u2019d sender/receiver library books into the slot: I\u2019d hand them to Fluffy; he\u2019d drop them in. We\u2019d clean up a small area on the rug: I\u2019d choo choo the box on the floor; he\u2019d toss something in. We\u2019d put a few books back on the shelf. We\u2019d throw laundry into the basket. Tiny moments. And the trust returned.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Things have changed over the years. Fluffy has become a good apprentice in many ways. I\u2019ve seen his competence and confidence grow. I think I had some notion that one day he\u2019d turn into one of those kids that walks calmly by my side, looking up every so often to see what I\u2019m doing or where I may be looking, one of those kids that calmly comes by my side, watches me engaged in an activity and waits for his role to become clear, one of those kids that, well,  calmly  does anything.\u00a0\r\n He\u2019s not that kid. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the autism.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I\u2019m beginning to realize that Fluffy\u2019s resistance is not so much about competence and more about his particular personality. \r\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t like being led. He likes being in charge. He likes DOING it, whatever it is, on his own, in his  own way , and in his  own time. \u00a0\r\n Some of it is what he calls his \u2018Professor Distraction\u2019 tendency. He says,  I start to do what you tell me to do, Mom, but then I my mind shoots out a new thought and I HAVE to follow it, Mom, I have to! \u00a0Some of it is simple forgetfulness, some of it, processing and motor planning challenges.\u00a0\r\n\r\n We do a few  HANDLE  exercises at bedtime. They take about three minutes. I know Fluffy doesn\u2019t mind them but you see, they aren\u2019t wads of cotton candy or creamsicles or videos or extra computer time and so when I climb into his bed and pat my lap for him to climb on for \u2018motorcycle helmet\u2019, he ignores me. Or flops on the floor and becomes entranced by invisible bad guys. Or suddenly has to go pee. Or needs to read just one more sentence of a book he grabs from the shelf or he insists he\u2019s hungry, really hungry Mom, about to starve or he needs water or he has an itch! Hurry! A really bad itch! Or he has to bite something, where\u2019s his  P ?\u00a0Or has to tell Daddy something super duper important or wants to show me something on the computer, lightening fast, Mom!\u00a0\r\n\r\n Every night.\u00a0\r\n\r\n And all through the day.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I tell you, it can wear a gal down.\u00a0\r\n Last night I asked him about it. I said, Honey, you seem to know what\u2019s next and what I need or want you to do and yet you often seem to look for other things to do instead. I wonder why?\u00a0\r\n Well, Mom. I\u2019m the kind of person who likes my life to follow along a path of the most fun. That is always what I am looking for. Fun, Mom. I really love fun. \u00a0\r\n What followed was a discussion of things in life that are fun and things in life that aren\u2019t as fun but that are needed in order to  get  to more fun and I\u2019m not sure how much got through but at the end of it, he climbed into my lap for the first HANDLE exercise, cupped my face in his cool little hands and said,  Thanks for this life, Mom. It\u2019s a really great life.  \r\n\r\n \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com/default.asp", "http://www.handle.org", "http://www.sammonspreston.com/Supply/Product.asp?Leaf_Id=557253"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/06/resistance-and-fun.html", "title": "Resistance and Fun"},

{"date": "June 26, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Last week, I went to a workshop led by  Elizabeth Holtzman , author of the book  Conscious Eating, Conscious Living: A Practical Guide to Making Peace with Food and Your Body, \u00a0and during this two-hour period, I had a huge breakthrough with the food.\u00a0\r\n Actually, it was more like breaking through to a new way of being.\u00a0\r\n I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to hear all the details about me and food, my compulsive relationship with salami and potato chips, my propensity to eat many voluminous snacks from an upright position inches from the refrigerator\u2019s hum and refreshingly cool and lighted open shelves so, suffice it to say, a single monumental utterance of speech turned my whole world around and here\u2019s what it was:\u00a0\r\n Give yourself permission to eat whatever you want as long as you eat it consciously. \u00a0\r\n\r\n WHAM.\u00a0\r\n Right then it occurred to me that I go into a kind of black out when I eat. Not always. No. But sometimes something happens to me and the next thing I know, I am groping an empty fig newtons box in the dark, a scattering of fig crumbs or newton crumbs clinging to my chin, my pjs, and sprinkled around me on the floor.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I can eat lots of anything. It doesn\u2019t have to even taste that good. In fact, the less satisfying, the more I eat, looking and looking for the pleasure that can\u2019t be found.\u00a0\r\n Remember when I found the answer with  this book ? Back in Florida, the land where  poisonous jellyfish  hunt down my innocent son? It\u2019s the same answer now, the very same: Pleasure. Tuning into the senses. Reconnecting to the body, this one, the one dangling down there beneath my head. \u00a0 Since that workshop, I have been doing just as Elizabeth suggested. I have been eating whatever I want, consciously. This has required a change in lifestyle as I can no longer allow myself to do much of what I used to do:\u00a0\r\n Eat while driving\u00a0 Eat while standing up preparing food for others Eat while talking on the phone Eat while writing Eat while watching a movie\u00a0\r\n What I do when I\u2019m eating now is, well, eat. I allow myself to also talk while I\u2019m eating as long as the person is live.\u00a0\r\n It\u2019s so invigorating! And it is taking zero will power. It's not a will power  thing . It's not a striving against. It's a tuning in, a sinking into my own internal stream. I see how much my  misunderstandings , my  distortions , my  scarcity  about time is connected with the food. If there is  no time  than I  must  eat while doing everything else. If there is  enough  time, I can prepare the food, sit down, eat it and then do the next thing.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I am eating less, fitting into clothes I had pushed to the back of the closet, and denying myself nothing.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Can you imagine?\r\n\r\n\u2028\u2028 And now I must sign off so I can go  consciously  eat some of the fresh fudge Fluffy and I bought at the  Mystic Seaport  yesterday.\u00a0 Yum.\u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.makingpeacewithfoodandyourbody.com", "http://www.healthjourneys.com/product_detail.aspx?id=210", "http://www.mysticseaport.org/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/06/me-and-food.html", "title": "me and food"},
{"date": "July 16, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \r\nOur house in RI. For Sale. Come browse! Forgive my dropping out of sight. Again. I fell in a ditch that had a big hole in the center that dropped me in a cave that fed me through a looooong tunnel and now look!\u00a0 Light!\u00a0 I must be at the end of the tunnel!\u00a0 At least until the end of August, when we begin to pack up again and move,\u00a0 again , to the new rental in Northampton. I must say, moving three times in the space of one year is really delightful--no, I would say \u00a0more\u00a0 restful\u00a0 and\u00a0 rejuvinating . Like a trip to the spa.\u00a0 So, please come buy our house.\u00a0It's been dear to us these last eight years. We wish we could strap it to the top of the car and move it with us but there's apparently some problems with that, something about foundations and costs, highway regulations and structural blah blah blah. \u00a0\u00a0 Back to our home; It's lovely.\u00a0And clean.\u00a0And freshly painted in the interior.\u00a0 And that rotting floor by the shower out back? By the new wood chipped path on slate stones alongside the protected marshland? That's been entirely replaced.\u00a0 And now, don't fly through the windows even though they are so spotless they appear to be clear space.\u00a0 But I will say a few things:\u00a0 (1) If you won't buy my house, the least you can do is immediately purchase  The Book Thief . And read it. I love it! The voice (it's narrated by Death himself--actually he doesn't refer to himself as male but I think it's obvious that Death is a man, yes?) is intoxicating, full of invention and wonderful surprise. I want to EAT the sentences.  Zusak  is brilliant.\u00a0\r\n (2) Fluffy is now officially an east-coast surfer-dude. He's been catching the waves on his boogie board and his smile when he's been carried by white water for thirty feet and deposited on the dry sand is so wide, it wraps clear around to the back of his head.\u00a0\r\n (3)  My husband's  new book is due out next month. It looks adorable. I don't often mention his books and I've been remiss. They are charming and funny and full of life. These  are great early readers. This  would make a fabulous addition to your holiday book bin.\u00a0\r\n I've seen  this one  on recommended lists for kindergarteners. It ought to be a classic. As should  this one , which you can hear and see read on  youtube .\u00a0\r\n Okay. That's enough for today.\u00a0 We're off to a playdate with the 7 year old girl Fluffy hit it off with at my nephew's graduation party a few weeks ago. We haven't seen her since that wonderful afternoon. I hope the stars re-allign for  this  afternoon. \r\n\r\nSend us your most excellent friendship vibes. \r\n  Yours, in endless appreciation and anxiety, as always. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375831002", "http://www.randomhouse.com/features/markuszusak/author.html", "http://www.childrenslit.com/childrenslit/mai_milgrim_david.html", "http://www.amazon.com/See-Otto-Adventures-David-Milgrim/dp/1417628383", "http://www.amazon.com/Santa-Duck-David-Milgrim/dp/0399250182", "http://www.amazon.com/Cows-Cant-Fly-Picture-Puffins/dp/0140567216/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1216214351&sr=1-3", "http://martsubhub.lib.wv.us:8000/kcweb/kcContent?isbn=9780816743933&type=review&controlnumber=+++97011373&referedby=titlelist", "http://nz.youtube.com/watch?v=6r88a74nL44"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/07/come-buy-our-house.html", "title": "Come Buy Our House"},
{"date": "June 15, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \r\nFluffy and me, walking along a Cape Cod Trail; August, 2002, taken by Dave.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure where I fit in.\u00a0\r\n I\u2019m not an autism expert. I\u2019m not an autism activist. I\u2019m not an autism panelist. I\u2019m not called for interviews or quoted in newspapers.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I\u2019m not willing to stand up and say, vaccines have never played a role in autism. I can\u2019t say that. I don\u2019t believe they played a part in Fluffy\u2019s Asperger\u2019s but that is all I can say with certainty.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I'm not going to say, autism needs a cure. Cure is a loaded word. Those with autism are not suffering an illness.\u00a0\r\n Am I a straddler?\u00a0 Am I straddling by not finding myself willing to topple over  here  where they say autism is a disease that ought to be vigorously researched in order to discover its cause and thereby, step closer to wiping it off the face of the earth?\u00a0\r\n Or to topple  there  where they say autism is a joy, a difference to behold and honor, something parents ought not speak about in terms of difficulty, concern, or worry of any kind?\u00a0\r\n Is it because I am mother to a boy with so much language? The ability to express himself with clarity and metaphor that sometimes takes my breath away? Is it because he washes and bathes himself, dresses, feeds, laughs at my jokes and fills our house with unimaginable life? Or is it because I have worked hard to change what needed changing in me in order to meet him where he was to find the best path to his learning?\u00a0\r\n Do I just not know what it\u2019s like to have a child who has more profound disabilities that interfere with a parent\u2019s ability to feel and be effectual in providing what their child needs to learn and grow? \r\n\r\nIs it because I believe that remediation is possible and happening right now? In this house? In other houses?\u00a0\r\n\r\n Is it because Fluffy's autism may be remediated to the point where he is able to make meaningful connections in the world and feel safe and make a contribution and have meaningful work, and then I won\u2019t give a damn whether or not he still can be said to have autism or Aspergers?\u00a0\r\n Is it because I think the issue ought to be:  Is the world willing to see all people as valuable and capable of learning?  and not:  Is autism good or bad? \u00a0\r\n\r\n Autism is. That\u2019s it. Autism is. And there are teaching methodologies that are powerful and respectful and child-centered and they ought to be common-place and available to ALL.\u00a0 Autism is neither good or bad. It brings with it many challenges, some mild, some profound. It is right and good to work toward alleviating those challenges and if possible, eliminate them. Is this radical to say? For some reason, yes.\u00a0\r\n Is it okay for parents to express their sadness and concern when they see their autistic child struggle with not being able to make meaningful connections in the world, feel safe, and contribute? \u00a0Why is that seen as  against  acceptance?\u00a0 Why is there this drive to decide ahead of time who is able to learn what and how much?\u00a0 I use to want to get rid of the autism. I felt it was a tic that was ON my son and I wanted it OFF. I was scared of it.\u00a0\r\n But I\u2019m not anymore.\u00a0 The change in me came from casting off what I heard and what I read and tuning in to what I felt and what I saw.\u00a0\r\n You know, I put myself in the neurodiversity camp. I\u2019m for the wide embrace. I'm not sure if  founders  of that camp would consider me one of them...\u00a0\r\n I guess I\u2019m for the wearing of slippers AND the carpeting of the world. I\u2019m for both.\u00a0\r\n Am I a straddler?\u00a0\r\n A few years ago, I would say, \u201cFluffy is the kind of guy who...\u201d and fill in the blank with any number of things that are now, no longer true. Is he still the same child? Or did he, fundamentally, change? Things that I and a number of autism specialists would have identified as  expressions  of his autism have changed and even disappeared.\u00a0\r\n\r\n So,  is  Fluffy his Aspergers? No. Am I trying to get rid of his Aspergers by teaching him? No. Will he still have Aspergers if he, one day, behaves in ways that are not Aspergian? Who knows. Does it matter?\r\n\r\nWell, only if the goal of clearing away the confusion and fear that the Aspergers brings to his interactions in the world becomes  synonymous  with what is required in order to be accepted.\u00a0\r\n\r\n In other words, what if Fluffy grows up extremely Aspergian? Is that going to be okay with me?\u00a0\r\n There is nothing that Fluffy could do or say that would diminish my love, admiration and delight in him. But motherhood has brought with it this passionate preoccupation for my son\u2019s happiness. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s as particular and unusual as they come, as long as his life is working for  him , or as long as he feels he\u2019s got a reasonable hold on how to move in that direction.\u00a0 That's what parents want for their kids. And when that doesn't happen, there is pain.\u00a0 Somehow, when you have a child on the spectrum, this has become not okay for parents to talk about. Why not?\u00a0 I think fear drives the need to simplify. \u00a0If we take away the fear, we can allow for much more complexity in the conversation.\u00a0 I work towards a world that makes a place for everyone, that seeks to shine the light on discrimination, cruelty, ignorance and intolerance. I\u2019m not out  there , working in the public eye but rather in  here , the micro-community of our own home and neighborhood, a very small circle of family and friends.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I don\u2019t  like   or   dislike  autism. I\u2019m very  interested  in it. Fluffy\u2019s version of autism is an everyday part of my life. I\u2019m better for my experience with our version, not just for the obvious fact of my son's precious presence in my life but for what I\u2019ve learned over the last few years, specifically about narrow places within myself that needed widening.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I guess that\u2019s where I fit in, walking alongside my son, straddling the lines in the talk of autism. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/06/straddling-the-lines-of-autism-talk.html", "title": "Straddling the lines in the talk of autism "},

Packing.\u00a0 Packing, packing, packing.\u00a0 The truck arrives in one week to clear us out of this house for good and everything must be boxed and labeled.\u00a0 Some of it's easy--the stuff that's been up and back to the rental in Northampton and therefore, sorted, organized and paired down considerably. With that stuff it's basically,  put the shit in the box. \u00a0 But there are bags of other stuff hanging like bromeliads from top closet shelves and stacked in leaning pisa towers in the scary attic where it is so oppressively hot and airless, the moment I mount the top stair I instantly fall to my belly and begin anaerobic respiration, like my ancestors the blue-green algae. I'm soooooooooo connected to my roots. Anyway, today I picked through a box of old notebooks, one I amassed during my divorce from my first husband when, miraculously, I walked around without skin and lived to tell the tale, actually, lived on cereal and rage and frenzied dictation from my subconscious. Rail thin from heartache, I looked heroine chic in my chunky-heeled cowboy books, riding the fibrous membrane between this world and the next. It was terrifying and painful and in some weird way, I've never felt so powerful.\u00a0 One of my midnight pastimes was what I called, 'consulting the oracle.' I'd select a handful of words at random from my beloved magnetic poetry, spread them on the table and then construct the message with as little thinking as possible.\u00a0 Here is one from sometime after my ex-husband split the scene : Petal girl Y do I scream? She of sweat Falling to blackness Fluffing a delicate dream Cheery stuff. Did I mention, I have notebooks of this? The thing is, I find it all fascinating! \u00a0 Wait--here's another from that heartache time: Love rips the top. And she is like none. And another: By our ache We will pound out frantic music of diamonds. And, yet, another: Sun shows easier Language you only blow away Fast wind moan Ask Do not say never Lastly, one that I embellished with extra words of my own: Answer me now Without practice or waiting I'm tired here without you as boxes crawl up graying walls shocked and gaping holes ripped by nails\u00a0 where wires once held pieces of our home It's 11, 1, 3 Still up Still puzzled Still wiping spots off the floorboards Spring sang heavy with dread Fall petalled away Winters now rounds the branches\u00a0 And I never saw summer this year. Huh. I wonder what the oracle would tell me now? I'm off to find my box of little magnetic words. Now,  go order a set of your own  and tell me what the oracle is telling you.\u00a0 Come on.

But in place of my words, I give you those of Markus Zusak. This from  The Book Thief , as you may know or have heard, narrated by Death: He lay in bed with one of his sisters. She must have kicked him or muscled her way into the majority of the bed space because he was on the very edge with his arm around her. The boy slept. His candlelit hair ignited the bed, and I picked both him and Bettina up with their souls still in the blanket. If nothing else, they died fast and they were warm. I carried him softly through the broken street, with one salty eye and a heavy, deathly heart. With him, I tried a little harder. I watched the contents of his soul for a moment and saw a black-painted boy calling the name Jessie Owens as he ran through an imaginary tape. I saw him hip-deep in some icy water, chasing a book, and I saw a boy lying in bed, imagining how a kiss would taste from his glorious next-door neighbor. He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It's his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry. \r\n See those dominoes on the cover of the book? It's true. We are all connected. Touch one. Touch all.

{"date": "July 23, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I must begin with this: Typepad is painfully slow and increasingly prone to malfunctions. It irritates me but I have no time to move the blog so, suffer I must. I have begun planning Fluffy's second grade curriculum and may I say, it's not going to be a straight-forward year.\u00a0 Although we'll use a large smattering of  Enki , Fluffy is not really an Enki guy and never will be. Gnomes and fairies mean nothing to him. Beautifully crafted wooden toys are no more intriguing than the cheap plastic and electronic counterpart in many instances. In fact, he was aghast at the toy selection offered during the homeschool conference this summer, snorting in disgust, \u00a0There's nothing to play with here! Now, one could say remediation would shift his view, that once certain developmental pathways are connected up and widened, he'd be all over the dress-up gear and little baskets of acorns, periwinkles, colorful assorted buttons, beads, stones and sea glass that I gathered in our mathematics area this past year. Mmm, maybe. But maybe he wouldn't be, see?\u00a0 Fluffy is Fluffy.\u00a0 And that is a wonderful thing. A wonderful, mysterious, combustible, incongruous mix of things. My desk is covered with notebooks and notes, books and manipulatives.

I just can\u2019t shake the feeling that it would bore the behooges out of every last one of you.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t indulge in all sorts of talk about me, my son and every last thing that orbits the two of us--I mean, just ask my friend, Kim, to whom I\u2019ve been known to itemize each article of food and drink I\u2019ve consumed at various meals, but could daily musings really accomplish anything other than catatonia?\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n Hello? Are you still with me? \u00a0Here are some things:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n My neighbor claims to be \u2018all about the peace\u2019, drives a car with a vanity plate that claims we are all one, waves a flag with a picture of earth and fluttering white doves silkscreened from beside her front door while she tosses us the ICIEST of vibes in the history of meteorology since wooly mammoths roamed the land and all because we didn\u2019t employ her husband to sell our house. She turns her back to me, avoids my eyes, disregards the words I gently bat over the fence, recoils from my embrace. But I ask you, is it wise to have your neighbor sell you house? Does the phrase, Conflict of Interest strike anyone else as applicable?\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n The Book Thief  is a rare a wonderful piece of literature. It\u2019s full of humanity, a mesmerizing story, captivating characters and a spectacularly original narrative voice. I closed the back cover, set it down on the nightstand and cried and cried. I don\u2019t want to let it go so I won\u2019t. Tonight I will pick it back up and start at the beginning. I have no doubts that it will be optioned for film if it hasn\u2019t been already. I hope it\u2019s one of those rare and wonderful cases when the movie can do the book justice.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n Fluffy seems to be going through an early pre-adolescence and I am often left standing with my mouth hanging open, I mean like hanging down to the floor. I don\u2019t always handle it perfectly (ahem) but today I was textbook. Really. You ought to have filmed it for How To Talk To Kids so Kids Will Listen and How to Listen to Kids so Kids Will Talk.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n The incident was over cleaning up.\r\n\r\nI was helping, as I always do but very quickly it turned into what\u2019s been happening lately which is that I am steadily working and Fluffy is staring regally off into space. Or, he is sitting jester-like and tossing things into every-widening scatter patterns. Or, he is noisily railing against the idea of putting anything away, flopping this way and that. Or, he is protesting the horror that is his mother who calmly leaves some items for him to deal with as she gets up to finish packing for the beach.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n I totally kept my cool, repeated the rule of the house which is that he needs to help clean up when he\u2019s done and if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll take the item away for the rest of the day.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n It was sort of like someone died. You know Kubler-Ross\u2019s 5 Stages of Grief? They all came pouring out: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance though, truthfully with Fluffy, there was a bit of bargaining and anger tossed in all the stages and the depression wasn\u2019t so much depression as tearful, well, bargaining.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n But after Acceptance came a bonus stage, Self-Reflection, as is Fluffy\u2019s way.\u00a0\r\n\r\n He told me that he\u2019s learning how to deal with his anger in a healthy way but that it\u2019s like  anger is a high place upon which he\u2019s trying to balance and if he falls to one side, he can\u2019t do it and if he falls to the other side, he can.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Actually, he said, refining it further,   it\u2019s more like there are two parts of him that are fighting and they are fighting no matter which way he falls. If he deals with his anger in a healthy way, the part that wants to argue and fight is trying to get its way. If he deals with his anger in an unhealthy way, the part that wants to cooperate and follow the rules is trying to get its way. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n \r\n\r\nHe allowed that,\u00a0 he needed me to work on saying less because he often needs more time to find the right words to describe what is really happening inside him and that when I say what I think is happening and it\u2019s feels right, that\u2019s okay but if what I say feels wrong, he can\u2019t often explain more than simply that\u2013what I\u2019m saying doesn\u2019t fit. And if I keep talking, it stands in the way of him finding his words. And finally, he said,   it\u2019s more like there is the center part of him, deep inside where change first happens and then ever-widening circles that go out and out and out and the final circle is what I see on the outside and that the inside circle may be full of the change\u2013the new learning he called it\u2013but it hasn\u2019t made it to the outside circles yet where it can take over.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n \r\n\r\nThis most remarkable conversation ended at the beach where we dug our toes into the warm impressionable sand. Fluffy turned his imploring face to me and asked me to  please tell him the truth and not answer like a Mom trying to make her son feel good about himself but only as a Mom telling the absolute truth: Did I think he could really and truly and honestly be a rocket ship pilot one day?\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n Of course I said yes because that\u2019s what I really and truly and honestly believe. \r\n\r\nWe talked some more about space and whether I thought it was possible for his kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s kid\u2019s to one day land on Pluto to which I said, who knows? and then we headed for the turbulent waters of the Narragansett Bay that have been churning and swirling with rip tides for over a week now.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n As we jumped over whitecaps, Fluffy held me by one hand and the taut black cord of his boogie board with the other and said, his eyes glued to the monster waves crashing ahead,  Mom? I think you are the best mom I could have. I think the things I don\u2019t like about you would be the same no matter what mom I had.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n And then while I noticed two rescues carried out to the left and the right of us and Fluffy notice nothing but the exhilarating sensory splendor of salt, surf and sun, we rode the waves to the wet elephant sand, over and over and over.\r\n\u00a0\r\n The end. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375831002"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/07/untitled.html", "title": "Untitled"},

And I\u2019m right to have this higher standard.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I know teachers are underpaid and overworked. It appears that many are undertrained and undereducated about special needs, specifically, autism.

For neglecting to find a squishy toy and twist and pull it until their knuckles turn white. For not sticking a chewy in their mouth before the say things that wound and humiliate.

He was appalled, bringing it up several times during the course of the day.\u00a0\r\n\r\n At dinner he told me he wanted to post something on this blog and  his own .\u00a0 I quote:\r\n\r\n\"The teacher had the class vote Alex out so I think the country should vote  her  out.\"\u00a0\r\n\r\n He told me he wanted this teacher to see what it  feels  like to have people tell her things they don't like about her and then kick  her  out.\u00a0\r\n And to Alex, he wanted to say, \"I am Fluffy. I care about you.\"\u00a0\r\n He also spontaneously brought up how it feels to be in airports--a place that clearly bombards his sensory system. He said, \"It feels like there are paddles inside my head batting my brain back and forth.\" and wondered if this is how Alex might feel in the classroom.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Sounds to me like empathy, yes? And understanding of what it might feel like in another's shoes, or rather,  head,  in this case.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n We're getting ready to spend a week in New Hampshire at  Enki Education Homeschoolers' Conference . Fluffy's going to be with the kids for a whole day (with a long mid-day break that we'll spend together) while I attend workshops with the grownups.\u00a0\r\n\r\n This is a HUGE deal for us. Huge.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Did I mention that it will be huge?\u00a0\r\n Huge.\u00a0\r\n I paid an extra fee so an additional teacher could be hired to lend support to Fluffy and one other boy there, a boy we actually know, a son of a dear friend of mine.

{"date": "June 10, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t 1) Thanks to everyone who's weighed in with their own stories and experiences with medication, both for themselves and their children. It is hugely helpful, I cannot tell you. In the middle of our current chaos and impending displacement, I feel, as always, bouyed by the connection to community through these mysterious and invisible internet la la waves.\u00a0\r\n\r\n 2) Stress levels are at an all time high over at Fluffy Central and little of it has to do with Fluffy who is hanging in despite our housing crisis. We must leave this house by the end of the month. Our second bid on a different house fell through. A rental fell through. This current rental is now as hot as a sauna due to wildly inadequate insulation. Dave has been cooking up there--I run up and down the stairs periodically, to baste. I am trussing him as I type this and Fluffy, Beegu and I will be eating him, forewith, for lunch.\u00a0\r\n 3) Over the weekend, we all zipped off to Rhode Island to my nephew's high school graduation--more on that later. Suffice it to say that I am enormously proud of him and his mother, my sister, who raised him entirely on her own and did a phenomenal job. He is a star.\u00a0\r\n\r\n During the party, Fluffy bonded with a typical 7 year old girl, battling odd creatures with her on my nephew's super cool playstation, having a grass fight in the yard, sharing his much-treasured backpack toys with her, and generally palling around in a way never before seen. Huge. Dave and I kept half an eye on him but in general, had the entirely new experience of being at a party with our regulated and independent child while we mingled with the grown-ups. We stayed from mid-afternoon until long after bedtime. No meltdowns. Only fun. A a bit too much wine for me.\u00a0\r\n 4) In our absence, our Rhode Island house has become infested with bees. There is a colony living in the watering can in the garden shed that may, in fact, be killer bees vacationing from South America. I crept in there to retrieve the clippers in order to hack back the rainforest-like growth when a swarm erupted from the tiny opening. I flailed my arms and stumbled backwards, tripped and crashed into and then over the lawnmower which I had forgotten was directly beyond the door. The ensuing gash required 18 stitches.\u00a0\r\n 5) I got myself into a panic this morning, convinced the wound was infected and that septicemia would kill me before the week was out. Such is my way.\u00a0\r\n 6) A trip to the doctor this morning proved me wrong.\u00a0\r\n\r\n 7) So, off we go to Rhode Island with our first load. We'll be back and forth over the next few weeks to take what we need for the summer and put the rest into storage. It's very dangly over here, dangle dangle dangle.\u00a0\r\n\r\n 8) We will make trips back and forth over the next few months in the hopes of finding suitable housing by the fall when we return. 9) Oy vey is me.\u00a0\r\n 10) I hope every one of you is not similarly as oy vey-ish.\u00a0 11) Miraculously, as Dave and I ride the stress swells, we do not fight.\u00a0\r\n 12) And Fluffy has left last week's camp experience behind him, encoding none of it as a failure. As Dan Quayle would say, he is 'heading forward into the future'. \u00a0That Quayle. He's a genius. I love it when I head forward into the future as heading forward into the past is so darn confusing. 13) Sometimes leaving is the best thing.\u00a0\r\n 14) But having somewhere to go is even better.\u00a0\r\n\r\n 15) Carry on. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/06/many-things-in-no-particular-order.html", "title": "Many things in no particular order..."},

{"date": "May 26, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\tAs I wrote  here , we decided to do our version of NYC\u2019s  Teach Your Child To Ride A Bike  program starting last weekend.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 The weather cooperated. We drove to an empty, open parking lot, took the pedals off Fluffy\u2019s bike, adjusting the seat so he could easy rest his feet on the ground while on the seat.\u00a0\r\n All we had to go on was the footage on Bike New York's  site . Our instructions to Fluffy were to use his feet to get the bike moving and then do his best to balance for a second or two.\u00a0I rode alongside, modeling as best as I could, using my feet in unison, push push, then alternating. I pushed my seat down so I'd be in the same position as he. \u00a0\u00a0 At first, Fluffy was flummoxed. It was not at all easy to balance or push himself along. We kept it super short, five minutes at the most. We were going for a feeling of success; I wanted him to have a taste of the task\u2013just a taste.\u00a0\r\n The next day, we tried it again, this time in our driveway. It was amazing how much easier it was for him. It brought to mind the three-fold learning process stressed in  Enki Education  homeschooling curriculum we\u2019re using, the idea that material is learned in three steps: introduction, a period of sleep (leaving something alone, at least overnight) and reawakening/deepening and that\u2019s just what I witnessed.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \r\n\r\n He practiced the pedal-free balance riding four more times during the week, each time for five or ten minutes. We missed Saturday for some reason but when he broke out the bike yesterday, something was different and he knew it. \"I feel different, Mom! I want you to put the pedals on! I'm ready!\" he announced. I had him go round and round the driveway a few more times and then we put those pedals back on.\u00a0 It took quite a number of tries before he could get it going himself. He crashed into me (guarding the edge of the road that dips into a four foot prickler-infested ditch), wiped out once or twice but he kept getting back on that bike with more determination than I've ever seen him muster.\u00a0 It was really something to see. He would not stop until he got it. .\u00a0\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n And once he got it, he wouldn't stop. He rode up and down our street, over and over, me jogging and guarding and peeing in my pants (I need a keigel intensive workshop), Dave video-taping for over a hour. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel  good , Mom. It feels  great! \u201d he said. \u201cI never knew it would feel  this good! \u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could master something  so quickly! \u201d \u201cI am  so proud of myself!\u201d  \u201c I love riding my bike! I didn\u2019t know I was going to love it so much!\u201d\u00a0\r\n\r\n He asked me to tell him what it was like when I learned to ride. He wanted to know how I felt, whether I was proud of myself.\u00a0\r\n\r\n When he came inside, LONG after his usual bedtime, he wanted to write in his journal, something he\u2019s done exactly four times since he got it over a year ago. He raced around, looking for a pencil, instructing me not to look until he was all done. And then he presented us with this: It says: DATE MAY 25 i RODE a BiKE FORE THE FRST TiME. YERE 2008. This, by the boy who exclusively draws scribble battle scenes.\u00a0\r\n\r\n As he was getting into pjs, he heard me mention something about the laundry and in a breathless second, he was standing next to me at the washer. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d he asked. And then later, \u201cThank you for everything you do to take care of the house, Mom. You do a really great job.\u201d\u00a0\r\n My boy.

I have been remiss about keeping you all a-boob of our crafts but I do have a super fun, easy, satisfying one to report on\u2013my favorite kind\u2013 though it\u2019s not necessarily spring-y: \n\n Making felted soap scrubs: \n\n Materials \n\n bar of soap (we used a delicious smelling chamomile) \nwool for felting \na bit of yarn \nbowl or tub  \nwater \nthe foot of a pair of tights \n\n Directions \n\n The idea here for the clotheshorses in the crowd is to create a pretty outfit for a bar of soap, wrapped in a belt of yarn. When it\u2019s done, it sits on your sink edge looking stylish. When you rub it between your hands under running water, you get a sudsy and washclothy sensation all in one. Oh la la! \n\n 1. Fill you bowl/tub with water, as warm as you can stand. Wet a strip of wool and wrap around the bar of soap, making sure to have a half inch or so overhang where the wool meets itself. \n\n 2. Repeat with a second sheet, wrapping in the opposite direction. \n\n 3. Repeat two more times, alternating directions with each sheet. \n\n 4. String a bit of yarn around and knot. \n\n 5. Slip the whole thing into the cut foot of an old pair of tights and tie closed. \n\n 6. Dunk it in the bowl/tub of water and agitate. Rub vigorously in the palm of your hands, lengthways, sideways, all sides. Poke, rub, needle, pulse, pinch, and squeeze with enthusiasm. Lovingly call it a knuckle head. Go ahead. You know you want to. \n\n 7. After a while, a good ten minutes or as long as you last, rinse, rub and soak it in cold, cold water.   \n\n 8. Remove it from the stocking foot. Leave to dry overnight.  \n\n Voil\u00e1! Our soaps. Fluffy\u2019s is the more colorful one. I snapped a picture before he sent it off to Mama Mama for her birthday: \n\n \n\n Off with you now to give this a try. You won't egret it. \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/felted-soap-scr.html", "title": "Felted Soap Scrubs"},

I think he went into emergency mode right away--all those sounds and movements an incredible bombardment.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Sink or swim = sink.\r\n\r\nJust as I have always thought.\u00a0\r\n\r\n See, I never would have opted for a sink or swim trial. I never would have signed us up.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I was told this person was, after 1 1/2 days, 'overwhelmed' and in danger of getting 'burned out' and so a new person would be assigned to Fluffy this morning for 1/3 of the day and then another for another third and even another for the last third.\u00a0 I was told that the first consideration must be for the teacher's health.\r\n\r\nI understood. I also wanted to say, fuck that, the first consideration is my son.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I was told Fluffy was, intermittently, violent. I was told that throwing things was violent, yelling in another child's face was violent, grabbing hats out of other kid's hands was violent.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Those things are inappropriate, disruptive, but violent? No. Those things come from feeling unsafe, stressed to one's limit.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I was also told of some incidents that  were  aggressive. Yes. This also comes from the same thing.\u00a0\r\n We could have stayed. I could have tried the three counselors a day suggestion. I could have taken time away from my workshops and been with him, taken him off here and there for 1:1 the way the  inexperience  counselor attempted the first day and a half, trying to weave him into the group.\u00a0\r\n\r\n Maybe I could have turned things around?\u00a0\r\n But Fluffy was already at his limit. I could see it in the time we spent together. I could see it in his gigantic black pupils, so large they almost swallowed up the ring of beautiful greenish gold. I could see it in his expression, dazed and unfocused, as if he'd been wildly swung around the room by his feet and then abandoned in a field.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I didn't want this to be his experience. I didn't want him to be feeling that level of stress. I didn't want him to see himself as separate or weird. Or feared.\u00a0\r\n\r\n After the head teacher told me all this last night, I sat on the floor in the rustic cabin, twenty empty bed pushed against the wall all around me, and watched Fluffy peacefully sleeping. I sat in dark, two tiny fans of illumination sprayed from the nightlights we brought with us; the red EXIT light glowing over the front door.\u00a0\r\n\r\n It's like he goes into a kid version of a blackout,  I said to Dave, whispering into the cell phone. W hen he's that stressed,   I don't think he is conscious of what's happening; I don't think he even remembers most of it later. It's certainly not a teaching opportunity; he's not available for learning in those moments. It's like a brain siege. He just needs out.\u00a0 \r\n Fluffy and I awoke this morning to the sound of rain falling.  It's raining , I said. Fluffy offered hopefully, 'Oh! Maybe they'll cancel the kid classes!' \r\n\r\nI told him they probably wouldn't but it didn't matter since we were going home. I said we could cuddle as long as we wanted, play any game he wanted, and then we'd pack up the car and go home. 'Okay, mommy! I've had enough of this camp already.' he said.\u00a0 I told him it wasn't the right camp for him, there were way too many kids running around making too much noise. He was so relieved. ' Oh! Good!  My brain felt like it was getting smacked with a paddle but super hard, back and forth like this (smacking the air frantically). My brain felt like that the whole time! I'd rather spend two hours in an airport than go back to that class again!'\u00a0\r\n I asked him if it was scary and he hesitated. 'Not  scary  exactly,' he said carefully, 'but my head felt like this (scribbly spider gesture with his fingers at the back of his skull) and this (again, this time in front of his face and chest).\u00a0\r\n\r\n Anxiety.\u00a0\r\n Sensory overload.\u00a0\r\n The kids. They're too much for him.\u00a0\r\n\r\n So. Now we're home sweet home.\r\n\r\nDave and Fluffy are out on a bike ride with Beegu panting along beside them.\u00a0\r\n And I'm researching something I never thought I would: Medication.\u00a0\r\n\r\n I know this camp wasn't set up for him, for his needs. That's clear. But I  don't  know if I can continue to exclude the possibility of medication. At least the  possibility .\u00a0\r\n\r\n I need help, dear blogobuddies. Will you all weigh in on this topic?

{"date": "April 24, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t There have been times in the past when brushing teeth with my son nearly brought me to my knees. I don\u2019t know why, but it was so incredibly frustrating at times, I once threw his toothbrush across the room.  \n\n But we all hung in there, day after day, making amends when necessary, starting anew, breaking it down, by example, with mirrors, chanting, singing, some hand over hand, every way imaginable.  \n\n Fluffy is now brushing his own teeth at bedtime. He does it methodically, the way we taught him, going on the flats, in the cave, across the front, top to bottom, side to side.  See, I knew I could do it , he said,  I just needed more time to learn.   \n\n And that\u2019s not all: Fluffy let me be BLUE! In a game! \n\n Blue is his color. He uses the blue chess pieces, the blue guy in all games, the blue marble, the blue ball, the blue anything when there\u2019s a choice. But the other day, sitting outside under the summer-like sun on a blanket, I said, I wanna be blue. And he said,  Okay. \n\n Just like that. No fanfare. \n\n He\u2019s changing. From the inside out. The night before last he wondered aloud,  What does it feel like to be someone else? I know what it feels like to be me but I always wonder how I could know what it feels like to be another person. \n\n Huh. Me too. \n\n And the biggest one yet: \n\n Yesterday at the homeschool group there was a scuff with another boy, D., also on the spectrum. It\u2019s a mark of progress that I wasn\u2019t even in the room when it happened; I had zipped to the car to get something we needed and left the boy\u2019s mother in charge. As I walked back in, Fluffy tore down the hall to me, crying his eyes out. Turns out, there was a scuffle over the game the two were playing.  D. did not explain all his rules so when Fluffy inadvertently broke one, the boy got furious and physical.  \n\n This is not an unfamiliar scene for us, as you know. Fluffy often has struggled with impulse control, his need to micromanage the scene, invent rules so complicated Stephen Hawking would be stumped. He\u2019s been known to use his body instead of his words to communicate his dissapointment, hurt, or annoyance. The news here is that Fluffy didn\u2019t do any of these things. And when he was on the receiving end, he burst into tears and came looking for me. \n\n At first he was so angry he said things like,  I want to kill him! and If I had a gun I would shoot him!  which made me gulp as I have always been haunted by this scenario though truthfully, I think many kids say things like this when they\u2019re pissed off.  Goodness,  I  feel like this in the explosive moment. The injustice! Thankfully I didn\u2019t say anything other than murmur mirrorings,  you\u2019re really mad right now  and  wow, that upset you.   \n\n After a few minutes, the four of us were ready to \u2018work it out\u2019, D. against his mom on the couch, Fluffy on my lap on the floor.  \n\n Fluffy spoke in his own words, no prompting from me: \n\n D., you do what I used to do. You didn\u2019t tell me all the rules so how could I know? I didn\u2019t mean to break your rules. I used to make up so many rules in game with my daddy that even I didn\u2019t really understand them all and I\u2019m wondering if this is what happened with you? I used to get so mad I would push instead of talk.  \n\n Now, the thing is, I listened and realized that he was right. He isn\u2019t making up these long impossible rules anymore. He is mostly co-creating, finding ways to include us, consider our input. He often yells or throws things or stomps away when he\u2019s upset but he rarely lashes out physically.  \n\n D. was able to apologize. We all went in the other room to clean the aftermath and then D. said he wanted to show Fluffy something in his car. On the way down the hall, Fluffy said,  D. I want you to know that I forgive you and I\u2019m not mad at you anymore and I still want to be your friend.  \n\n Again, all his own words.  \n\n New growth.

{"date": "April 05, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019ve been talking about writing a memoir for a while.  \n\n At first, when I said, \u201cI\u2019m writing a book\u201d I meant, occasionally ideas that felt profound and original flew through the carnival of my mind but were never written down, you know, on paper. Then it meant I was cobbling together various posts into something that approximated a narrative. Then it meant I abandoned the idea as ludicrous and investigated other professional avenues like installing a home hair salon.  \n\n Now I\u2019m back to writing the book. This time it means I sit down in front of the screen and write one word followed by the next. Soon I have a page, then a few, then a chapter. Then I bring that chapter to a group of writers I admire who read it and give me feedback. Then I go back to work on that chapter while continuing with the next chapter, sometimes confidently, sometimes anxiously, but always with great interest. \n\n The book is getting written.  \n\n And you know what? I like it. \n\n My son has gone through an explosion of growth over the last few years and so have I. I daresay, all kids go through an explosion of growth from age 4 to age 7 so this is not unique to Aspergers or even RDI. He has taught me as much as I have taught him and I don\u2019t mean about referencing or how to make a proper lower case \u2018g\u2019.  \n\n My identity is changing. My self image is changing. And it comes from being a mother. And mothering my son has taught me that I am a writer. I always have been. Only now, I\u2019m a writer who writes. \n\n I don\u2019t know why writing about motherhood is dismissed. Can there be a more powerful topic? A more transformative experience? Or, at least an experience that holds within it as much potential for transformation? I don\u2019t mean to discount fatherhood but most people I know doing the bulk of the changing and searching and sacrificing and adjusting once having a child are women. I may be wrong here but it seems to me that most non fiction books by men about their children, about their fatherhood are judged on their writing and storytelling merit and not cast as \u2018daddy lit\u2019 , books written for themselves, as therapy.  \n\n I started this blog to help me sort through my own experiences in the early stages of discovering my son\u2019s Asperger\u2019s. I kept writing because it served a need in me, to write, to express. Once I passed through the crisis stage, I kept writing because for years I had been longing for a consistent writing practice and now I had one and it felt good. \n\n Writing this book, stepping back and looking at the last seven years has shown me that I am at the end of a stage. I\u2019m closing the door on a chapter of my life. I\u2019ve stepped out enough to have perspective about her, the Kyra that first gave birth, the Kyra that felt scared and panicky, the Kyra that needed other people to see it my way, the Kyra that wondered if it was self-indulgent grandiosity to call herself a writer.  \n\n I\u2019m not that Kyra anymore. \n\n Writing is what I need to do. It has nothing to do with my schooling or degree or where I have or haven\u2019t been published or whether so and so likes what I write. I write. Now I know I will always write.  \n\n I spent a lot of years participating in my own disability, the disability of self-doubt and insecurity. It\u2019s had a powerful hold on me. It\u2019s shaped a lot of my life. The funny thing is, for the first time I see now how I can use that to my own advantage.  \n\n You can\u2019t run from who you are. That\u2019s good news.  \n\n I have learned about courage from parenting my son. I\u2019m more willing to risk now. I still have a lot to learn. I\u2019m an anxious and overprotective mother, overly controlling, overly verbose. I want to protect my son from being bullied or attacked. That\u2019s impossible. And quite possible bad for him.  \n\n I'm also supremely glad for how we've lived the last few years in our household. It's been an imperfect journey but I'm proud of it, proud of us.  \n\n We're in a different place. We're at the start of something else. It's time to dangle out there. It's time for both of us to dangle out there.  \n\n What will it look like? \n\n I have no idea. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/dangling.html", "title": "Dangling"},

The best thing about Barack Obama has almost nothing to do with him as a person or as a leader or even as Oh My God The First Black President Who Could Really Change Everything I Mean Wow. It's not even the wondrous oratory power or the charisma or the sweet sense of deeper change overlaid with all kinds of sparkly utopian futuriffic goodness. \n\n There is, I think, something more. Something richer. And it's rather startling. \n\n See, I've read the profiles and the liberal fawnings and the intelligent analysis, the attempted takedowns and the right-wing smears, all the valiant attempts to dig up something dirty or problematic or frightening about Obama and his family, his past, his middle name, his beliefs and his pastor and his favorite flavor of ice cream \u2014 attempts that, rather amusingly, have all failed. \n\n I've read, too, the glut of wonderment, how Obama is this generation's JFK, how he makes Hillary Clinton's brand of retro cronyist politics feel like the equivalent of rubbing salt on a paper cut. He is, they say, that once-in-a-lifetime candidate, a fantastically rare mix of intelligence, consistency, inspiration, hope, charisma, humanity, articulation, and an almost shocking lack of manipulation and sheen (well, relatively speaking), all packaged in a strikingly handsome unit in whose closet apparently live almost no skeletons at all. \n\n I also nodded in agreement when snark-master Jon Stewart appeared slightly stunned and taken aback and very nearly jokeless as he pointed out, following Obama's remarkable speech on race in America, that at long last, here was a top-tier politician who dared to speak to us like we were adults. It wasn't just refreshing; after seven-plus years of humiliating, monosyllabic dumb-guy Bushisms, it was downright jarring. \n\n And I even enjoyed the overall assessment that the fact that Obama is untested and inexperienced in the higher and more dire realms of government is actually a good thing, just the kind of wild card we crave and need, given how he shows absolutely zero signs that he'd screw it up, not to mention how the last thing anyone really wants is more of the same old-school, inbred crap we've had for decades. \nStill, this wasn't what riveted me the most about Obama, still not what's most fascinating about this moment in political history. It was still something more. \n\n Initially I thought the most impressive aspect of Obama's run was, well, how the guy made it this far at all. That someone of his caliber and obvious intelligence could survive what has become a truly caustic, brutal political system and still emerge into the international spotlight as, well, not deeply f\u2014ed-up and insane, not possessing that creepy demonic gleam shared by so many politicos (hi, Sen. McCain!) that suggests they've had souls eaten whole by the same scabrous trolls of greed and war and corruption that birthed two Bushes and gave Bill Clinton that nearly intolerable aura of ego and slickness. \n\n See, I've long believed that, if nearly eight years of the World's Worst President has taught us anything, it's that the American political system has moved well beyond merely deeply flawed and broken and sad, and is now wholly rotted, ruined from the inside out, a true moral wasteland barely suitable even for cockroaches and leeches and Rick Santorum. I thought George W. Bush had actually managed to do the impossible: make an already defective system truly unbearable, turning something already gray and murky to turgid and pathetic, toxic to all decent human life. \n\n And I'm happy to report that the fact that Obama exists at this stage of the game is proving me very wrong indeed. \n\n But I'll even take it a step further. Because the greatest thing about Obama isn't really about Obama at all, per se. It's actually about, well, us. \n\n This is the great revelation: We still got it. The collective unconscious, the deep sense of inner wisdom, that intuitive knowing that borders on a kind of mystical proficiency, where millions of people can actually look beyond rhetoric and media spin and merely feel the presence of something great in the room? Yep, still there. Who knew? \n\n See, this is what I hear most from relatives and readers and friends and newborn activists who were never activists before: Obama speaks to the intuition. It's about the sixth sense. It's not just what he says or how he behaves in the debates or the policy wonking or the \"Change\" banners or any of the typical, tangible factors \u2014 although those have proven to be remarkably positive, too. \n\n It's this: People feel it. They hear an Obama speech or read the articles or talk to like-minded folk, and they squint their eyes and weigh everything and then dismiss all that surface crap and get that look on their face that says, you know what? This guy gets it. He feels right. It's not a trick of light. It's not complete bulls\u2014. It's not the usual spin and manipulation and fakery. There is actual meat on this bone. What a thing. \n\n Of course, I've plenty of readers who are die-hard cynics and jaded anarchists who say: What the f\u2014 is wrong with you? Can't you see it's just another vicious ploy? All candidates at this level are essentially the same, interchangeable, all abhorrent simply by default because when you reach that stage of the game there is simply no way to avoid deep corruption and rampant lies. They tell me that even just to write a column like this is akin to merely washing the windows in your little pod in \"The Matrix.\" Sure, the world may seem shinier, but you're still just buying into the same old revolting corporate/military machine. \n\n After all, once the vipers of big money and big oil and military spending and corporate cronyism get their fangs sunk in, it's pretty much \"game over\" for any candidate's remaining integrity. Has Mr. Perfect Obama spoken out against the insidious Patriot Act or taken on the absurd farm subsidies or talked up issues of global warming? No he has not. As nice and smart as he may be, strip away all the fawning and the oratory tricks and give him a year in office and boom, just another corrupted, compromised former visionary. Right? \n\n Whatever. I'm not buying it. At least, not yet. For the moment, I trust the collective intuition. I trust the shockingly widespread sense, not merely of hope and change, but of collective wisdom swimming though the air like an electrical surge between every smart, creative person on the planet right now, a bolt of energy that says: Hey, we're still together. We still got it. Smart, intuitive people are still a force. There is life in the revolution yet. \n\n And Obama? He gets it, too. Hell, he may have kindled it anew, all by himself. Either way, it's back. And it's powerful. And that, to me, is the most hopeful thing of all. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sfgate.com/columnists/morford/archive/", "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/g/a/2008/04/04/notes040408.DTL"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/my-new-favorite.html", "title": "My new favorite guy..."},
{"date": "April 06, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I went to a writing conference in Mendocino a while back where I heard an author from Florida say, were  he  to live and write overlooking the northern California coastline, the weather would have to be a major character in every one of his stories. \n\n He\u2019d probably say the same of the setting in  Jennifer Graf Groneberg's  memoir,  Roadmap to Holland: How I Found My Way Through My Son\u2019s First Two years With Down Syndrome . The winding road that leads up to the house on the hill where Jennifer lives with her husband and three boys, overlooking the lake surrounded by the Mission Mountains, Blacktail Peak, the Swan and Whitefish Ranges are as much a part of this story as the narrator and Avery, her son with DS. \n\n I met Jennifer through the wonderful world of blogging. I\u2019ve learned some about her life through posts at  Pinwheels  and columns at  Parent Dish ,  Mamazine , and  Literary Mama . Every time I read her writing I find myself breathing more deeply. I love the way she observes her life. It helps me slow down and notice more in my own life.  \n\n The title refers to piece written by  Emily Pearl Kingsley  called  Welcome to Holland . Kingsley likens the experience of preparing to have a baby to planning a fabulous trip to Italy and the experience of finding out your child has a disability to being told your plane  has landed in Holland. Holland may be slower, a bit less flashy but no less wonderful.  \n\n A roadmap implies a journey, going from one place to another, new place and this is what happens in this book. The narrator takes us with her from her twins\u2019 premature emergency cesarean, her days in the neonatal intensive care unit, the homecoming of one son and then the other, and through moments in the first two years of Avery and Bennet\u2019s life with their older brother, Carter.  \n\n I trust this narrator, trust that as she takes me along on this journey, she will carefully describe what she sees as she unearths recollections and memories like an archeologist. I feel her own trust in herself, that as unwieldy as this all feels to her, she will find her way.  \n\n And I appreciate the message of a journey, of someone sharing what she went through to arrive at a place of peace, so that other mothers who give birth to children that have Down syndrome or anything outside the typical know it\u2019s okay if they feel grief at first, if \"at first it hurts to breath\" the title of her first chapter. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t make them wrong or broken, doesn\u2019t make their family broken, their children broken, their mother instincts broken. I appreciate that she shows us that we can go through dark feelings, anger, shame, sadness, fear, and it doesn\u2019t break our love.  \n\n I was moved by so much of this story. I loved the connection between the twins, between Bennett and Avery, the way Bennett insisted on climbing into Avery\u2019s crib to be with him. I loved the connection Carter felt to his brothers, his protectiveness, natural and matter of fact.   \n\n I loved the support and love of the family, Jennifer\u2019s husband, his parents, and most of her friends. I was angered by Cathy, the neighbor who abandons the friendship and impressed with how Jennifer turned her attention and focus to where she needed and wanted it to be, with her child, and not on convincing someone there was no reason to leave or fear.   \n\n I loved hearing of the words Jennifer and Carter wrote on the walls in the babies\u2019 room before fresh paint engulfed them. These words disappeared from view but knowing they lay beneath the paint seem to soothe, like benevolent spirits whispering their messages of love. \n\n I loved the scene of Jennifer stepping into the water by the lake when the babies were still in the ICU, her life as mother to three boys now begun and not begun, her self split between her home and the two hour drive to the hospital where she\u2019d deliver bags of freshly pumped breast milk and hold her babies surrounded by the steady and oppressive hum of the HVAC. She writes of this surrender in the lake that day:  \u201cI spread my arms wide, suspended, holding my breath, the difference between floating and drowning merely a matter of inches.\u201d \n\n Her writing is lovely, rich with detail. You feel as if she has taken your arm and lovingly led you into her home to look through in each room, at her beautiful boys, at the thick file of information and forms having to do with Avery's care that once sat on her microwave, out the window to the ever-changing waters of the lake held in the protective arms of the mountains.   \n\n Here\u2019s one scene toward the end of the book between the narrator and a fellow writer under a summer night. They have just left a meeting of their Wild Horses Writing group where Jennifer read a paragraph she had written about Avery\u2019s birth and wept. The friend, a healer, asked if she could give Jennifer something and has brought outside by her car: \n\n \n \u201cShe dabs some of the liquid from the jar on her index finger, then taps each of my earlobes. I\u2019m enveloped in fragrance\u2013the white lilacs blooming in the moonlight. The heady peonies. Sun-dried cotton pillowcases. My grandmother\u2019s kitchen in the mornings.\u201d \n\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask. \n\n \u201cForgiveness\u201d she says. \n \n\n Soon after, for reasons unknown, fireworks fill the sky: \n\n \u201cWhen the fireworks end, the silence is round and full and perfect like the moon as it rises over the mountains to the east. I can\u2019t think of any reason for there to be fireworks on an ordinary Thursday evening, a night like any other, except on this night, I was forgiven.\u201d \n\n \nThat\u2019s what the story is for me: a love story of longing and forgiveness. A woman yearns for something\u2013one more child, and out of that comes a tumble of events that she could not have imagined and cannot control, twins, premature delivery, Down syndrome. We all have experiences like that, innocently picking a flower and falling into the hole that opens up in its place. Like anything transformative, we temporarily lose our way.  If we\u2019re lucky, we emerge with stronger spirits and the ability to forgive ourselves for anything that delayed our reunion with what, somewhere, we  always  knew to be true.  \n\n Jennifer Graf Groneberg has emerged with both, an unequivocal gratitude for and pride in her son, and a marvelous, heartfelt book to boot.  \n\n \nThis post was sponsored by  MotherTalk .  \n\n As always, I have a copy to give away.

It made a perfect arch from horizon to horizon. I drove through its center. I sang along with my ipod at the top of my voice, sometimes breaking into wild laughter and sometimes tears. The best kind. Cleansing, celebratory, liberating.  \n\n It was the final scene of a movie and any number of the songs I listened to could have been played as the credits rolled. \n\n I just googled 'seven year cycles' for the hell of it and this is the first thing I read:  There is a natural release of energy every seven years which encourages you to move forward and make changes . \n\n I feel it.  \n\n I'm moving. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kristenspina.wordpress.com/", "http://www.mywonderwheel.com/", "http://www.iamprettynyc.com/", "http://www.innerself.com/Channelings/Cycles_of_Seven.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/my-weekend.html", "title": "My Weekend"},

It's easy as pie. \n\n It's slightly modified and has a handful of typos like all my posts. What am I gonna do? I'm imperfect. Oy, am I ever.  \n\n Fluffy ate his smarties, aka, M&Ms last night. And here is how he sorts them: first one, in the mouth right side; second one, in the mouth, left side; third one, in the mouth, right side; fourth one, in the mouth, left side, etc., etc., all done very rapidly with a cursory glance to color. \n\n And, I might add, all done in a state of utter bliss. \n\n Yesterday, we had our first playdate in the park with a family we met at last session's homeschool Wednesday. Spring is shy this year, standing on the threshold, unsure about stepping all the way in the room. For us, she threw on the sunshine floodlights and cleared the sky of clouds with mighty winds. We needed every article of our winterwear, greeting each other through the little oval openings of our hoods.  \n\n As we played zombie tag, coats unzipped, scarves, mittens, and hats were shed like sepals of a blossom peeling away for the bloom.  \n\n The other mother and I were an integral part of the play, stepping in and out to interpret, facilitate, jump start, restart. It is a different sort of playdate, not the kind where the adults regard their kids from the benches while they sip their starbucks and talk about racy topics. It was more of a  practicum  rather than a  lecture , if you know what I mean.  \n\n We ended up staying outside for over an hour and then convoying to a local restaurant to eat lunch, a spontaneous extension of our time together, this mother with her similarly challenged son who is Fluffy's age and her almost five year old neurotypical daughter.  \n\n Fluffy hadn't wanted to go, hadn't wanted to meet these people.  How about if we meet them tomorrow?  he asked before we left home. I think I know how he feels. Playdates sound good in theory. But what are they really like? Is it really fun? To play with other kids? Who have their own games that aren't always fun and who often interfere with his play scenarios? These kids I hesitate to call our new friends because I don't want to throw that word around at the same time I am trying to help Fluffy learn what real friendship is, that is rises out of a common sense of interest and genuinely positive internal feeling. \n\n On our way home I was thinking about  RDI , about productive uncertainty and staying on the edge of someone's competence and how that, to me, is the heart of all learning. It's quite a dance and I often get it wrong, coming in under or over the wire many many times.  I see how much we mothers of kids who need things  just so  strive to maintain that for them, like going through life with a bowl full of water on our heads, doing our best to keep it from spilling over the edge. Seeing it in someone else highlights the ways I compensate and how it often undermines new learning. \n\n I don't have a wrap up for this, other than to speak aloud my own commitment to being as unpredictable as possible without creating unhelpful anxiety. I want to guide my son toward points of true connection which happen through improvisation, not by slipping pegs into already formed holes.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-8404", "http://www.ireport.com/upload/2678.topic", "http://www.rdiconnect.com"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/productive-unce.html", "title": "Some thoughts on learning"},

I remember feeling concerned, about the ice, about how clear it was   black ice  I said to myself, the most dangerous kind because you don't know it's there until after you've started to slip. \n\n When I woke up, I remembered driving north in my car years before along a country road one wintery morning and hitting a patch of black ice. The car began to spin and as it spun it skidded to the other side, turning a full 360 degrees and then another 180, slamming to a stop in a snow drift on the shoulder of the southbound lane.  \n\n Miraculously, no cars were behind me, no cars were coming from the opposite direction. I had been driving with one hand, the other holding my precious, steaming coffee.

I was fine. The coffee was fine. I spent more than a few minutes blinking in my seat, regarding the country road from this new angle, resting my cup on the dashboard as the adrenaline surged from behind the dam where it had been rising and banged its way to my heart. \n\n And then, after a time, after getting out and climbing around the car, over the dirt covered mound of ice and debris, after shaking my head at the air and letting out a slap of laughter like a sharp high five to whomever had been doing the steering, I got back in the car, did a U turn, and continued on to work.  \n\n The end. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/a-little-story.html", "title": "A little story for no reason"},

{"date": "April 02, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I think Autism Awareness is good. I guess you could say I\u2019m for April being Autism Awareness Month. I\u2019m for getting the word aut, as  Kristina  might say.  \n\n Not  everyone  feels that way. \n\n But, wait. What  is  that word? What is the word about autism? \n\n A couple of years ago, I longed to read a book of essays by parents with kids on the spectrum. I wanted to hear them talk about what it was like, for them. Not how it would be for me or anyone else. I needed to collect armfuls of stories to help me find where I was because that\u2019s how it works for me. It\u2019s not that I won\u2019t know what I feel unless you articulate it for me but if what you say resonates, it helps bring me into focus.  \n\n It just does.  \n\n It\u2019s why I like people who look at the world in a similar way. They don\u2019t need to be carbon copies of me but if each and every time they open their mouth I find myself squinting or straining or puzzling, it will wear me down. I need to be plumped up in relationships\u2013not  pumped  up\u2013plumped up, you know, in the way that makes my cell walls more permeable, so more things can get in and out, like an eye, breathing not like an eye with a big old fat glass contact clamped down, slowly suffocating sight. \n\n I wanted to hear parents talk about parenting. Parenting kids that happen to be on the spectrum. I didn\u2019t want to be shunted to a different category, the A) land of the devastating life long neurological disorder that constituted a tragedy, the long low wail of affliction that sounds ominously at diagnosis and extends into eternity or B) land of cursive flowering writing about gifts and miracles and heaven sent beings here to teach us.   \n\n What about everything else? In between? What about being able to talk about parenting our kids? And what makes it hard, wonderful, scary, funny, confusing, and enlightening? The way the other parents are talking about it?  \n\n But we\u2019re not like other parents. Our kids are different and so our trajectory is different. And then we become different. It\u2019s true. We do.  \n\n And we don\u2019t.  \n\n Therein lies the first contradiction I noticed about my own experience parenting Fluffy. I wanted others around me, those leading the typical family life, to recognize the ways that my life was different and, yes, harder. But if I felt judged, if I felt my child was judged, if I saw pity or fear or impatience, I got furious.  I\u2019m no different!   I'd want to shout,  And neither is my child!  \n\n As I was in the shower this morning, I was thinking about one of the debates in the autism community, the cure versus accept debate. I was thinking about people who say, there is nothing here to cure! Autism is beautiful! I accept my child exactly as they are! I wouldn\u2019t change a thing! And the people who say, don\u2019t sugarcoat this. These kids are struggling with the basic day to day of living, up against misinformation, discrimination, terribly vulnerable, often alone and marginalized. I think of those who want to say, Congratulations, you child has autism! and those who say, Autism is a devastating disorder, those who perpetuate the fatalism and fear parents feel when they first learn of their child\u2019s diagnosis. \n\n I was thinking, what if we had a Personhood Awareness Month? And we wrote posts and made video essays about what its like living with Peopleness? And we asked, what are the lessons? What are the gifts? And we slapped bumper stickers on the butts of our vehicles, ribbons fractured into different colored shapes and they said:  \n\n PERSONHOOD AWARENESS \n\n and when we saw them, we honked our horns and gave each other the thumbs up? \n\n Fluffy has Asperger\u2019s.  \n\n Is there something wrong with him?  \n\n Many years ago, Dave would ask questions about Fluffy. He\u2019d wonder aloud about this and that, saying, is this right? Is something wrong? And I\u2019d snap at him, THERE\u2019S NOTHING WRONG! HE\u2019S AN INDIVIDUAL! WE\u2019RE ALL UNIQUE! THAT\u2019S THE JOB OF THE PARENT! TO SEE WHO YOUR CHILD IS, TO FIND WHAT WORKS FOR THEM! THERE ARE NO INSTANT ANSWERS! NO RULEBOOKS!  \n\n But one day, after a series of incidents that occurred over months, a realization grew inside of me like a ball rolling down hill, building in size and speed and I said these words outloud,  There is something wrong with my child.  \n\n What that meant was, my child\u2019s future depends on me providing for him and there is something going on here that requires a completely different approach and I MUST FIND THAT. Not for me. For him. The person I brought into this world. And not knowing what that is and not having an informed, trustworthy pool of people and resources to consult with, is a scary feeling. \n\n What I\u2019d like the adult ASD population to know is that a parent can feel this, this fear, this worry, and not be trying to  fix  their child.  \n\n So, no, there is nothing WRONG with my son. He is not WRONG. But he was born with personhood, a need to:  express himself, understand himself, discover and make inquiries into the world around him, connect with others, feel safe in the world. And this requires, in part, a fundamental ability to process sensory information and self-regulate. And because of this personhood, his Asperger\u2019s brings pretty significant barriers to those things and I, as his mother, will absolutely pursue strategies to remediate his autism as I continue to love, cherish, respect, and admire everything about him.  \n\n Is  Fluffy his Aspergers? I say, no.  Fluffy is a person first.  \n\n I\u2019ve long contended that remediation is simply another word for teaching. That guiding and educating is another word for parenting. Effective teaching strategies change the brain. The brain changes as it grows and develops, as it sits in that skull in that head on the top end of your child as they run in the yard or listen as you read to them or watch the sun streaming through the curtains or splash in the tub. We, none of us, have the same brain we had when we came out of our mother's oceans.   \n\n We need not  fear  the autism but is that a reason to  revere  the autism? Let's revere people, the  personhood . Yes.  \n\n Remediation creates more permeable membranes, if you will, it allows for more exchange of information, in and out. Let's talk about that. Let's hear stories about how we can best teach our kids to express their personhood. \n\n Autism Awareness = Personhood Awareness.  \n\n If that's not true now, let's work to make it that way.  \n\n Note: This is cross-posted  here . \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.mac.com/kjchew/iWeb/kc/kristinachew.com.html", "http://rettdevil.blogspot.com/", "http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-8404"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/autism-awarenes.html", "title": "Autism Awareness = Personhood Awareness"},

{"date": "March 31, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nT. Rex, roaring at us; yesterday. \n\n \n I have to go pee pee! I have to go pee pee!  Fluffy said as we were on our  way  to the bathroom at Panera Bread where we stopped for lunch before we saw Walking With Dinosaurs. \n\n I came along, as I always do, to either compulsively wash hands or practice various expressions in the mirror or to, surprisingly, use the neighboring stall. This time, I applied lipstick. Just as Fluffy came out of his door, he froze, blanched, and then announced with alarm,  I have to go poo poo!  \n\n I wonder what it feels like to him, you know, inside? I wonder how that sensation is experienced? He seems to greet it with a combination of great concern and exhiliration, like I might feel should I be racing to the door to greet Barack Obama and a camera crew when I suddenly realize my used tampon is still sitting on the side of the tub where I left it that morning while in the shower.  \n\n There also seems to be a new found sense of privacy that propels him to announce,  I have to go poo poo!  in a loud register at home, calling up with this news to Dave who is drawing his cartoons in the loft office or maybe even on the phone with his editor discussing the latest f & g\u2019s (And doesn\u2019t that sounds like a swear? a literary swear?  the goddamn f & g\u2019s are at it again... )  \n\n I\u2019ve noticed he doesn\u2019t yell it when other people are around. Then he whispers it to me with his mouth so close to my ear, little Fluffy spittle sprays out of my opposite ear. It's indecipherable. Even to me who knows what he is saying when he\u2019s got an entire half a sandwich crammed in his mouth because I said he could have dessert once he finished his lunch.  \n\n But I know what he\u2019s saying. He has to go poo poo. \n\n He doesn\u2019t want anyone to go in there while he\u2019s in there. Is it so that no one will see  him do his personal business? Or so no one will catch him tapping out the tune of Star Wars on the back of the toilet tank with the top of the toilet seat?  \n\n In the bathroom at Panera, I said, What perfect timing! I can\u2019t think of a better time to have to go poo poo than right now!  \n\n I can think of the LEAST perfect timing ! he said as he disappeared behind the stall door. \n\n Oh?  \n\n Yes, mommy! The least perfect time to have to go poo poo would be when you were throwing up! \n\n How did he know? \n\n \nFluffy loved  Walking With Dinosaurs . It was a good mixture of information and thrill. In fact, he could have gone for more thrill, specifically more battles and quite possibly, blood. Our collective peak moment was when T Rex came barreling over to us in all his gigantic magnificence and let out a roar that displaced our spleens. The three of us contracted into a human egg shape and screamed.  \n\n It\u2019s not for the little ones or the faint at heart. I saw quite a few in the hall, trembling, their faces streaming with tears. Mothers and Grandmothers hunched over them saying,   But it\u2019s not real! It\u2019s pretend!   as they playfully shook florescently-colored dinosaur dolls at them.   It\u2019s just a show!   \n\n It was. A show. I was glad Fluffy had a good time. If you\u2019re on the fence, I\u2019d say skip it. It\u2019s pricey, it could have been half the length (but you gotta have that intermission to push the merchandise! and hot dogs! more hot dogs!) and the dinosaurs? They\u2019re either sporting extra legs or they\u2019re mounted atop slabs of rock that are really very small cars with people inside, driving them hither and yon: \n\n \n\n I wanted to be  taken back in time!   like the couple said they were in the promotional video! I wanted to be scared out of my wits, plucked from my seat by that dastardly T Rex rascal and then rescued by the gentle plant eaters, who would be all,  Dude, that's mightily uncool, dude. She, like, paid a thousand dollars for those seats, man.  \n\n Still, the robotics are mighty impressive.  \n\n Now, when a dinosaur has to go poo poo what does he do? Lets it fly right there on the stage. And did you know? Within the brown ball lurks a dung beetle just waiting for a chance to eat its way out.  \n\n Hmm. \n\n I\u2019m glad to say, Fluffy missed that bit of trivia. Can you imagine the urgency he\u2019d feel? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dinosaurlive.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/poo-poo.html", "title": "Poo Poo"},

I hereby dub today, Aging Mothers of Children with Aspergers Face Saver Thursday.  \n\n My face is beaming from an expert combination of a few things I just have to share: \n\n The  Clarisonic , of course. I've mentioned it before but it bears repeating. One minute a day of this delicious mini whirling brush treatment will have your skin feeling smoother than a baby's bum-didee-bum-bum in a week. I've been feeling my cheek and then the cheeks of unsuspecting babies Fluffy and I meet in the library play area and it's true. I swear. \n\n Follow the buffing with  StriVectin . Originally a treatment for stretch marks, this magic lotion is working wonders on wrinkles, no matter how deep they be or how many years they've been tunneling through your epidermis. I apply under and beside the eyes, on the forehead, and around my butt mouth. It's true. I have those unsightly sphincter lines all around my tiny lips. But not for long. \n\n Moisturize with something. I don't have a good one here but I do make sure it's got an SPF factor. Suggestion welcome.  \n\n Then, quite possibly the best concealer on the planet:  Dior Long-Wearing Moisturizing Concealer#430 .  I have the brilliant Kim to thank for this. Apply sparingly to all the many colored dots that appear with alarming momentum after 40.  \n\n Now it's time for the  Bare Minerals . Again, I've sung their praises before but let me repeat for the unenlightened: Dab, Tap, Buff. Presto, flawless skin. \n\n Honesty eye shadow by MAC . A touch of sparkles on the lids and my eyes are so very sincere. \n\n MAC eye kohl \u2013Teddy.  \n\n The final touch is a quick swipe with the  Stila clear color moisturizing lip tint : pink. This lovely little stick applies the barest hint of color, has an SPF  of 8 and goes on in microseconds.  \n\n These last three items were purchased at the insistence of the brilliant  Kim  the last time I was in New York. She strode through the cosmetics lair at Macy's and I scurried behind her, dragging my club foot and eating flies.  \n\n You're off, troops.  \n\n Edited to add: It's later in the day so the whole effect may be muted but okay, here's a picture for Eileen from my built-in computer photo booth (note the flattering yellow light blasting from my side): \n\n \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thewonderwheel.blogspot.com/", "http://www.clarisonic.com/?gclid=CLSBnaa5rZICFRE0FQod-32ERg", "http://www.kleinbecker.com/sd/strivectinsd_1.html", "http://www.cosmeticamerica.com/cd74541-520.html?synertech", "http://www.sephora.com/brands/bare-escentuals/brand_assortment.jhtml?brandId=5737&categoryId=C108&pCat=C108&cm_mmc%3dus_search-_-GG-_-br%20bescen%20face-_-Bare%20Minerals", "http://discount.makeup.com/-79/brands-2/mac/eyeshadow-42159/?campaign=googlemaceyeshadow&gclid=CIXRkKe6rZICFQurPAod1V3LRg", "http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2791052/0~2377897~2377898~2378438~2383804~2383815?mediumthumbnail=Y&origin=category&searchtype=&pbo=2383815&P=1", "http://www.stilacosmetics.com/search.asp", "http://www.iamprettynyc.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/rapidly-aging-m.html", "title": "Rapidly Aging Mothers of Children with Asperger's Face Saver Thursday"},
{"date": "April 01, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Today is April 1 = the first day of Autism Awareness Month.  \n\n I\u2019m aware of autism, specifically the way Asperger\u2019s expresses itself through my dear and singular son.   \n\n But I\u2019m also aware of something else. \n\n Fluffy\u2019s been asking about this site more and more. He comes in while I\u2019m posting and starts reading over my shoulder. He\u2019s tells everyone we meet that they should go to This Mom dot com and learn what he and I do every day.  \n\n It\u2019s starting to make me uncomfortable. You know why? Because I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019d feel about everything I say here.  \n\n Some of the time, I\u2019m posting about our adventures or our art projects, posting pictures of him hiking steep mountain trails or holding wonderful things he\u2019s made. I toss pictures  of me deep in the throes of my preoccupation with facial hair, wrinkles and other assorted bumps on the road to the fountain of youth as well as other topics under the heading, Me: On Me. and Me again. \n\n But some of the time I\u2019m talking about what\u2019s challenging. For me. In terms of Fluffy\u2019s autism. And would he like to read that?  \n\n I think not. \n\n I hope I am always respectful. I try to show restraint, keeping very personal things out of print. I don\u2019t have to  try  to show my son in a good light because I already see him in a glowing light. I admire him. I learn from him. I delight in my time with him. I feel a physical space of lack within my body when I\u2019m apart from him for too long. I am bigger because of him, stronger, smarter, clearer. If I were inside the shapeless slab of stone that god and the universe and all of you are carving, the most precious and meaningful details of me did not even begin appear until mid-day on a blustery Groundhog\u2019s day in 2001 when a slippery fish of a boy covered in waxy vernum was plopped into my arms and gazed up into my eyes.  \n\n But would my son understand what I\u2019m writing? Or why? \n\n I think it would confuse him, maybe even bother him, unsettle him, upset him?  \n\n It\u2019s not  for  him. It\u2019s for me. And hopefully for other grown ups who are going through something similar or who\u2019ve grown up with something similar.  \n\n But is it okay for me to keep talking about this? About him? About his life? \n\n I don\u2019t know.  \n\n I don\u2019t have an answer. \n\n And so, I\u2019ve been writing less lately, less about the details of our life, our remediation, our approach to working on what\u2019s challenging for Fluffy, what I see as the things that keep him from being able to express himself and share himself in the world the way he says he wants to.  \n\n I\u2019m wary of writing that seeks to sum things up,  Okay! And then we did this and now all is well! Now we\u2019re beyond such and such! Now we fully accept!  As if that is possible, as if the destination is somewhere  out there , floating around, awaiting our arrival. As if there is a place where it\u2019s all wrapped up, without conflict, confusion, doubt, fear, sadness, anger.  \n\n Life isn\u2019t like that, at least, not in my experience. Life is on-going, dynamic, ever-changing and evolving. It\u2019s like the way I feel about god or the mystery of the universe, about creative inspiration and all spiritual matters. I believe. But I continue to search. And stumble. And make adjustments. What interests me are those who also believe but also continue to search and question.  \n\n I want to read about someone grappling with the whole big sticky messy son of a fucking bitch of this wonderful life, this life whose streets I sometimes crawl through, rooftops I dance upon, open spaces I regard with steady confident gaze, rocky shores I rail against, rivers that carry my twirling body with reckless grace.  \n\n The whole journey. \n\n As long as we agree on the ground rules: everyone is valuable, everyone needs to be included, everyone needs to be considered, everyone needs to contribute, everyone has a voice, we just need to be willing to listen for it. \n\n We need to be willing to change, from what we thought  before  to what makes room for the truths we allow ourselves to see, again and again.  \n\n And in that process, we are go through something. \n\n So. April = Autism Awareness. \n\n Maybe it\u2019s time for me to step aside and let someone else do the talking for a while. \n\n I\u2019ve asked Fluffy if he would like to tell y\u2019all a few things about himself, in his own words.  \n\n And he said, yes. \n\n Stay tuned. \n\n EDITED TO ADD: Well! It turns out, Fluffy didn't just want to say a few things, he wanted to start  his own blog.  And in the process, he made a pretty big decision about what to call it. He wanted to make sure I enabled comments so he could hear from all of you. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/04/in-lieu-of-writ.html", "title": "In lieu of writing tuesday..."},

She jots things down in our file as if we're a couple of gals having a chat and she's just remembered something about tonight's dinner, holding up her finger as if to say,  I don't mean to be rude but let me just get this down before I forget. \n\n 3. She talks to Fluffy.  \n\n 4. And listens.  \n\n 5. She doesn't look at her watch. \n\n 6. She asks about support and brainstorms ideas for both Fluffy and me.  \n\n 7. She makes suggestions like,  Rent a movie together and pause every once in a while and talk about the scene, what a character might be feeling and why.   \n\n 8. The first time we saw her, she suggested a remedy, a homeopathic remedy she thought might work. I'm not saying it's the magic pill but I tell you, a few weeks after she first plopped it under his tongue, social things in Fluffy's world began to shift. Seriously shift. For the better. And the fascination and preoccupation with drool abated. Drastically.  \n\n 9. You know what it was? This remedy? \n\n 10. Mercury. \n\n 11. You heard me.  \n\n 12. At first, I was aghast. I think I may have fainted or made a little poo in my panties. But then she propped me up and wiped me down and explained, again, how homeopathy works and how the doses are created. One microscopic drop of one one-billionth quadrillionth of diluted mercury in the Atlantic Ocean. Then one microscopic drop from that ocean into the Pacific. Then one drop of that into all the remaining collective waters of the world and then one fraction of that drop into a tiny pill. Or something like that. \n\n 13. Okay, I said. \n\n 14. And then I watched as my Fluffy shed a translucent skin of agitation and fear. It's not the whole skin but it's a layer of it.  \n\n 15. What do I make of it? I made a joke to my friend  Kim  because I could, because she knows me so well and would  get  it, get that I'm not making stabs at anyone, not making light of anyone's experience or belief.

He'd dash over, toss a few rubber bands on an egg, plop it in a color and dash away. Where was he off to? I don't know. I was dying eggs. He'd come back, wind some scotch tape around another egg, find a new color and plop it in and then was off again.

He wants to find a doctor in our bathroom, waiting with his clipboard and blank expression, asking the same questions answered on the phone and at the front desk and then again when the nurse comes in and out in the flowered top and powder blue pants. \n\n But not this doc. My new doc. She came in with her laptop, sat down in front of me balancing the computer on her knees and chatted for about forty minutes. I sat across from her, my torso dripping down the wall, barely able to keep my eyes open.  \n\n THE FATIGUE! Is it normal? What is going on?  \n\n She asked questions and I kept jolting awake,  Huh? Wha'?  wiping the drool from my chin with my limp hand. \n\n And that is how the intake went. It ended with a baseline EKG and a stack of lab slips being pressed into my hand the way my great grandmother used to close my fingers around a nickel at the end of a visit. We're going to take all my blood out, examine it, shoot it up with amphetamines and put it back in while my boob gets flattened into a dinner plate and I run on the treadmill, or something like that. I don't remember exactly what was said. I think I fell asleep.  \n\n I've been neglectful of the blog, of your blogs, of emails and phone calls. Dave's been sick since Saturday. The sitter cancelled again.  \n\n WHAT ARE WE, ICKY?  \n\n Why don't I open the door to a veritable flood of young college girls bobbing in the melting snow on our front lawn, just  dying  to play with the boy and cook us organic meals and spit shine the tub? \n\n Okay. It'll all work out. Spring is almost here. That is what sustains me. Spring! Dying easter eggs! The hopeful blossoms of crocuses, hyacinth, the trumpeting daffodils, heralding softer winds and brighter skies! \n\n Oh, and speaking of that, Fluffy and I have been having a great time reading  The Trumpet of the Swan . We recently re-read an all-time favorite,  Make Way For Ducklings  and now I can't wait to get to Boston for a visit. For the first time, being in the  Public Gardens , taking a ride on the swan boats, and feeding the ducks will mean something to him. And therefore to me. \n\n Because we are the same person. \n\n Of course not.  \n\n But in a way, yes. \n\n But, no! How codependent of me! \n\n But listen to this: when your kids are doing well, you are doing well. When your kids are struggling, you are struggling.  \n\n I love the Al-Anon and you can recite every slogan and put up banners emblazoned with the steps and detach until you're a whisper white cloud looking down serenely on all mankind but it's still true. \n\n And that is that. \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=445979&in_page_id=1770", "http://www.amazon.com/French-Women-Dont-Get-Fat/dp/1400042127", "http://www.amazon.com/Trumpet-Swan-E-B-White/dp/0064408671", "http://www.amazon.com/Make-Way-Ducklings-Picture-Puffins/dp/0140564349", "http://www.swanboats.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/down-swing.html", "title": "Down Swing"},
{"date": "March 22, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t We loved Easter in our house. It was all about the eggs. Growing up, it was never about Christ rising or even the miracle of rebirth in general, in the seasonal sense, though I don't know why not. I'm sure it did coincide with a celebratory feeling about the warming of the days, the shortening of the nights, the lengthening of desired outdoor play time. We did skip around in the yard each year, after all, hunting the golden egg. \n\n Easter is always the first Sunday, after the first full moon, after the vernal equinox. I never knew that. Apparently the church was so opposed to holding its holidays in connection with lunar events, if the first full moon after the equinox occurred  on  a Sunday, they deemed Easter must fall the  following  Sunday. This year, it was all pretty close, yes? The moon outside our window last night was positively glowing; it looked like a great marble ball, like a fallen planet, like pluto made perfectly round and set down to float at the edge of our atmosphere.  \n\n Fluffy had his first no fever day yesterday. Dave went out to a concert (Flying Suitcases or something? I tell you, I am soooooooo grandmotherly now about music.  What are the kids listening to? ) and I am climbing out of my pajamas, buffing my cheeks with my precious Clarisonic, lathering the  StriVectin   on all the withering parts to the sound of a trillion skin cells collectively sighing  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! \n\n Back to the eggs.  \n\n We boil both white and brown eggs. The dyes work differently depending on shell color. We have two sets of dye, the toxic set and the non-toxic. We set them up at opposite ends of the table so as not to poison ourselves when we need to eat the despondent ones that have rolled to the edge when no one's looking and hurled themselves to the hardwood floor below. Here are some of the tools we use: \n\n Toxic \nRubber cement \nBlack india ink \nPaint \nSharpie pens \n\n Non-toxic \nRubber bands \nDripped wax \nGlue sticks \nCrayons \nKnives (scraping makes beautiful effects--monitor pressure used!) \nErasers \nRolls and rolls of paper towels \nTape\u2013scotch tape or electrical, experiment with different looks based on how much dye seeps under the covering \n\n The process? It's really anything goes. That's the fun of it. You start with many dozens of eggs so you have plenty of room for exploration. There ARE no errors here.  \n\n Scribble a white egg with white crayon. Dip it in a color. Take it out and see the lines appear like magic.  \n\n Drip circles of candle wax on a brown egg. Dip it in a color. Take it out, scrape some of the wax off, leave some on. Add some new drops. Dip it in a new color. Take it out, scrape some of the new and old wax off, consider how beautiful your batiqued egg is! Scrape more, drip more, dip more or leave it as it is, with or without the wax still clinging. Sometimes the textures adds to the appeal. \n\n Paint an entire egg in india ink. The black egg. Mysterious. Timeless. Classic. \n\n Dab rubber cement all over, like a spotty application of face foundation. Dip in color. Pat partially dry with paper towel, dab more cement, re-dip. Voil\u00e1! A Monet! \n\n Wrap many rubber bands around an egg. Use care. Dip for a loooong while in one color. Let dry. Remove rubber bands. Use care.  \n\n Apply short, thin strips of tape. Dip. Dry. Remove some, keep others. Dip again.  \n\n Of course, there is also the purest in the crowd, the simple single color. Peaceful. A necessary place for the dazzled eye to rest. And a requirement as the coveted golden egg is also monochromatic.  \n\n This year, we're going to try printing with leaves.  \n\n \n\n I got the idea from  the Family Fun site . In fact, they have a gazillion links for Easter crafts  on this page. \n\n We're also going to add a third station\u2013the stove where I will be concocting dyes from natural materials: beets, onion skins, berries, cabbages. My best sense of this is that you need to boil the eggs IN the vegetable water to get coverage. You can experiment with dripping wax on the eggs first or adding oil to the mixture as you simmer. This will give you a batiquey or marbleized look, depending. \n\n Here's a clip about the natural technique from  curbly.com : \n\n \n\n As Curbly says, Happy Dying!  \n\n \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kleinbecker.com/sd/strivectinsd_1.html", "http://jas.familyfun.go.com/crafts?page=CraftDisplay&craftid=11921", "http://familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts/season/specialfeature/easter_eggs_ms/", "http://www.curbly.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/its-all-about-t.html", "title": "it's all about the eggs"},
{"date": "March 14, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy, playing craps in Miami.  \n\n \nYou are all kind.  \n\n My down swing is still down but at least it's swinging. That's what I say. Movement is the key.  Just keep swimming , as Dori sings through Finding Nemo. I love that Dori. I love her forgetfulness. It's so innocent and lively. \n\n My down swing is really mine, you know? It's not about Fluffy the Great. It's true that I am very tied in to how he is doing but lately, given the sickness and the vacation and the fluctuating rhythms and Dave's flu that's eliminated special daddy playtime all week, he's doing pretty darn well. Marvelously well in many ways. \n\n We went to a birthday party last weekend, a wild affair with wild boys racing around wildly inside while outside it was wildly (what else?) raining and Fluffy navigated it all with an impressive degree of regulation. He even had himself some fun, wrestling and cavorting about, though at one point a little boy scrambled out from underneath him, stood up red faced and shouted, HEY, DON'T DO THAT! YOU COULD HAVE KILLED ME FOR REAL!  \n\n Fluffy was choking him, something he does when he wrestles, inadvertently. He hasn't figured out where to put his hands during the contact\u2013they naturally end up around the other kid's throat. I was monitoring the scene, casting myself out like a line and dangling in the nearby waters, ready to intervene if necessary. But this little boy could take care of himself. He had a rough and tumble older brother and he was the original wild child himself with his waist-length hair and darting eyes. I think he had been plucked from a vine deep in the rainforest that morning.  \n\n There's more to Fluffy's greatness: We swam the length of the pool at the Y yesterday, side by side, underwater. The entire length. As we neared the wall, I heard the gutteral sounds of his submerged grunts. He touched the wall and blasted through the surface, victorious and gasping, and said,  I was almost dead under there but I saw the wall and I saw how close I was and I told myself, you can do it! \n\n And: \n\n As we said our thanks to the universe at bedtime last night, he listed everyone he was grateful to know, everyone he knew he was going to be grateful to meet  some day  and closed the prayer with,  And Universe? That's enough with the jellyfish already! I don't need the gift of any more stings!   \n\n Afterwards, he got up to pee and ran into a friend of Dave's from his guitar class. He and his wife had come over to retrieve  a book  for the upcoming auction at the local Montessori school where the wife works. When Fluffy got back in bed he said,  Daddy's friend from guitar class is here with his wife. How nice for Daddy to have his friends over. I bet that makes him feel really good.  \n\n The night became sort of elastic then as Fluffy got up again and again to pee and then I got up to meet them because in all this time, I haven't met my husband's new friend or his wife, and we all had an impromptu visit in the hallway, me in my orange pjs and Fluffy in his red pjs and Beegu sniffing everyone's crotch. Fluffy played the piano for them and invited them to do a google search for This Mom in order to find the website where they could learn about all the things we do together. \n\n By the time we got back to bed, it was well past bedtime but it was fine.  \n\n This is what he's missing. People. More people in our life. Unexpected visitors. Spontaneous interactions. Fluffy loved it. He said,  Oh! They are so nice! Did you think they were nice? I really liked meeting them.   \n\n I did.  \n\n This is what my down swing is made of: not enough people, not enough unexpected visitors and spontaneous interactions. Somehow, with all the focus and energy and remediation, all this moving of Fluffy forward, I've moved outside the bounds of my own life.  Not really  because parenting is part of my life, but I'm off track. It's no one's fault. It certainly isn't because of Fluffy and his golden heart.  \n\n I leave you with some pictures from Florida. I love the colors. I want to wipe them all over me, like moisturizer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.davidmilgrim.com/mainpages/kids.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/miami-colors.html", "title": "miami colors"},
{"date": "March 21, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Happy Everything! \n\n Today is: Beegu's birthday, Purim, Good Friday, and the first day of spring, at least in our house.  \n\n It's also day 13 of Dave's illness, day 7 of Fluffy's, and either day 2 or day 32 of mine, depending on your criteria. If your yard stick is one of fevers, chills, and other aches and pains, it's day 2. If it's general fatigue and inability to stop eating or start exercising, then I'm working on over a month. \n\n It's disheartening to have slipped out of our rhythms, though how can one slip  into  them with illness stepping in and out like a line of contra dancers?  \n\n The blood tests have come back normy, which is good. I may need the happy pills to shove me back on track, which is also good, I guess, yes? The shoving back on track part though I'm not one for meds.  \n\n The odd thing is, this doesn't feel like depression, per se. I'm not feeling sad or even flat. I have burst of feeling my fine old self. I'm making progress on the book. I might even have myself an agent. In a week, I'll hear some potentially very good news on another project. Fluffy excels, even through sickness. It's hard to encapsulate but it shows these days in conversation; he joins in effortlessly as Dave and I are talking, sharing the topic, asking meaningful questions, adding his own thoughts or idea.  \n\n We still have loooooooong talks about computer games. He still asks the same people the same question each time he sees them:  How many Star Wars movies have you seen? I've seen them all! How many Star Wars movies have you seen? I've seen every one!   But he also distorts the world of intergalactic space in his play, makes jokes about the characters, invents board games. In Miami, he held up his hand to the street, closed his eyes, and moved his arm in an arc, over and over. He was using the force on traffic.  \n\n Despite our collective viral infection, we all bundled up today and drove in a big loop around the Pioneer Valley looking at houses for sale. Nothing called out to us, not yet, but it's fun to be looking.  \n\n Hamentaschen dough  is in the fridge awaiting Fluffy's rolling pin maneuvers. Beegu is out on a special doggie walk with a pack of new doggie friends. Preparations are being made to go back to Rhode Island tomorrow to see family and dye easter eggs, a much anticipated annual event. Outside, the snow slowly melts. \n\n I think I'm going through a transition. From what it's been to what it will be. It's not yet this and it's no longer that. I don't mean to be cryptic. That's my best explanation for today. \n\n Sometimes parenting reminds me of The Whip, you know this game in ice? Kids hold hands in a long line, skim the wet surface, and gain speed down the length of the rink or pond. When they come to the corner, the center one stops, the line keeps moving, whipping around. The tension of holding on against centrifugal force builds until the last clasping hands are pulled apart and the end skater is sent off, reeling, spinning, flying. Depending on your point of view and your skill on skates, the ride is either exhilarating or terrifying. \n\n When Fluffy was born, we began that game, holding hands. His journey through the opening of me pulled me through a portal of my own. We\u2019re still holding on to each other. I know one day, the momentum will build and I\u2019ll have to let go, let him swirl in his own direction, leaving me to discover what it\u2019s like to skate with my hands free, after all this time.  \n\n I hope by then, we\u2019ll both be steady enough on our blades to survey the new terrain, to find our way. I hope by then, we\u2019ll find the solo ride divine.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/happy-everythin.html", "title": "Happy Everything"},

They came to Fluffy's birthday party; we've been to their birthday parties.  \n\n Fluffy feels comfortable with them, he knows who is whom, a huge deal since face recognition is a challenge.

If this was the kid who made you laugh or the kid who made you cry? \n\n We have a couple more classes set up for the spring at the same place.

How can you not fall in love??? \n\n \n\n \nLast summer, my mom and I went to the Newport Film Festival where we saw,  Autism: The Musical.  It was held in a small, art film house to full capacity audience and was followed by a chat with the director, Tricia Regan.  \n\n We loved it. The audience loved it. I recognized one of the kids, very Fluffy-like in his mannerism, pontifications, charms and struggles. One of them has Fluffy's real name. My mom and I exchanged looks, squeezed each other's hand, cried into our kleenexes, laughed out loud. I saw myself in at least one of the mothers, in her intensity, her involvement, her over-involvement.

The instructor would have us read an excerpt from say, Cormac McCarthy or Mary Oliver or Raymond Carver, begin transcribing what we were reading and then take off on our own tangent, playing with that voice.  \n\n Last night's writing prompt had the same sort of effect on me though it wasn't designed that way. I think writing prompts can do that, can lift your fingers and take you to a different era or different personna. It's a wonderful feeling, a wonderful way to warm up.

I will take it from your outstretched hands, my ghost arms appearing, and place it inside my cavernous chest, like reaching blindly inside the body of an empty featherless bird, like reaching inside the slick and bleeding opening of a birthing animal, and rest it there.  \n\n And then I will know.

The air between us will grow thick and rich and charged like the singed ground after a forest fire.  \n\n We will put our pieces back inside and fold ourselves over the holes we made like the petals of the moonflower closing onto herself at the first signs of dew falling, of sun rising.  \n\n We will take leave of each other. \n\n And in that space, that space that grew between us, that space we leave behind, a universe is slowly being born.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/writing-tuesd-1.html", "title": "Writing Tuesday--trying on voices"},

{"date": "February 26, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m finding out why  French Women Don\u2019t Get Fat  and then I\u2019m defecting, but only in my gut.  \n\n I\u2019m putting myself through Guiliano\u2019s program beginning with the two-day leek-fest the day we fly back to the north pole, I mean, western Massachusetts and then it\u2019s on to three months of recasting. I\u2019m thinking of it like a big knitting project, ripping out the old loops and casting on a long line of lovely, balanced stitches. \n\n Aside from the fact that the author refers to her 20 pound weight gain while a teen living in America as her  weight calamity  (I mean, really, compared to those struggling with full-fledged obesity? Isn't that more like a American female rite of passage?) I\u2019m with her all the way on her program which centers around  pleasure , eating for pleasure. \n\n There\u2019s that word again: pleasure. \n\n I\u2019ve discovered that I don\u2019t have a very good relationship to pleasure in my life. I\u2019m not pleasure-centric and I think I need to be. I\u2019m not sure how much of it is motherhood, the world of special needs parenting, or simply being a homeschooling SAHM or as the mighty  Dooce  calls it, a Shit Ass Hole Motherfucker. Not sure. I do know I\u2019m better off in the neighborhood of my slippery little mind when I see everything in my life as about my own growth and becoming and not as a mistake, not as something that\u2019s thrown me off course. In other words, this  is  my course. So, the way I see it, I\u2019m at this point in my life in order to turn over this particular rock, this pleasure rock and see what skitters around beneath.   \n\n Being at home with Fluffy has brought me pleasure. Seeing his gains, watching a smile spread across his face, knowing he feels safe and loved in his home brings me pleasure. As retro and unrealized as this might sound to some, creating a home, a system, a relaxed order in our day to day life brings me pleasure. Stocking the refrigerator and kitchen with colorful fresh healthy food brings me pleasure. Leading Fluffy through the school week with projects and activities that ride a nourishing rhythm brings me pleasure.  \n\n What else brings me pleasure?  \n\n An overflowing basket of self-care bodywork sessions. I'd like to summon a veritable platoon of robust swedes and set them loose on every square inch of my body: to kneed, massage, shape, stroke, wax, buff, polish, heal, tenderize, energize. Next, fat chunks of time to luxuriate, in the bath, in bed, on the couch with a book. Put me in nature, at the beach, under the blossoming cherry tree, on the craggy mountain top, in a lush meadow with dazzling wild flowers. All the arts inspire me: photography, paintings, plays, movies, dance. And music! Dancing until the sweat sprays off the tip of my nose. Spending time with those I love, I mean the kind of time when I can really visit, attend to the other person, to what they\u2019re saying, to myself, to be there for more than a squeezed in five or ten minute conversation. \n\n How much of my life is spent on those things? Not nearly enough.  \n\n I think it's worth noting that I haven't even mentioned sex. Sex! It used to be top of my list of pleasures! I just don't get anywhere near enough of it and not because my man's not game. I need to get back into sex shape, into the practice or habit of it, undergo some sex training. Somebody review the basics for me, you know, to get me started. \n\n And food? Ug. I am in such a rut. I\u2019m buying the same things at the store; I\u2019m eating the same things at home, far too often, standing up or walking around. I\u2019m shoveling it in, trying to fill up, trying to feel satisfied. I\u2019m not savoring the sensations, the flavors. I\u2019m not venturing out into new territory.  \n\n This time away has shown me how much of my life has fallen into a rut. Drone drone drone. It doesn\u2019t feel like an improvisation. There isn\u2019t enough uncertainty for me, not enough surprise, not enough adventure. Certainly, not enough pleasure.  \n\n I took a long walk down the endless beach this morning. I collected shells, stones, coral, sea sponges, whatever caught my eye. I stopped and made an avatar of myself from the assorted treasures. I picked up each piece of me and blessed it for what it/I had done out of love, out of fear, out of loneliness: my arms holding Fluffy hour after hour, reaching for help, for answers, for guidance; my lungs, unable to breath more steadily, more deeply; my heart clenched then open then breaking then expanding; my head, loud, misunderstanding, running the show, getting on my back, getting on other people\u2019s backs. I tossed each part behind me into the ocean, asking for compassion, inviting in a broader view, inspiration, possibility, happiness, pleasure, balance. After I threw the last piece, a fan-shaped piece of coral that represented all the thoughts fears plans beliefs worries and dreams that pour from of my head, a big wave rushed up and washed away the circle I had drawn around my little altar. Washed it away.  \n\n No lines. No ruts. Clean slate.  \n\n As I walked back to our beach chairs, back to Dave and Fluffy and the little section of jelly-fish free sand marked off by the red, blue, and yellow buckets, I collected new treasures. Sitting on my towel, I arranged them into a new likeness as Fluffy played and Dave read and the sun shone and the waves rolled and the umbrella flap flapped in the warm wind and a single seagull watched me through his sideways, unblinking eye. \n\n \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/French-Women-Dont-Get-Fat/dp/1400042127", "http://www.dooce.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/miami-and-tho-2.html", "title": "Miami and thoughts on pleasure"},

Despite some kinks the first few days (one of which prompted Fluffy to ask Dave, \"What are the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of your anger on the earth of your moods?\"), we've had a lovely time, all of us soaking in the ease of simple clothes and nary a jacket, scarf or hat for outdoor travel. Bracing against the cold is so stressful! I wish I were one of those robust northerners who loved the snow and ice, the steely blues of the winter skies, the light low and slanted from the horizon. But I'm a gal who loves these soft breezes! This air! The rounder light! I may have to petition for us to move to a more temperate climate year-round.  \n\n We've eaten dinner out nearly every night, cuban cuisine mostly but last night we dined at a fancy restaurant, the kind where the staff bends over backwards for your comfort even though you dress in wrinkled cotton and plastic shoes. The waiter fawned over Fluffy who was an absolute star, like a kid in the movies, talking to the chef about the fantastic fries (award-winning!), the balance of the crispy exterior and soft interior, the perfect blend of spices, tasting our specialty dishes, going to the bathroom when he had to rather than denying it and contorted into a human pretzel.  \n\n I was amazed by how regulated he was, due in large part, to the snack right before we left for the restaurant. I'm seeing how much he is affected by low blood sugar. I tell Dave, if Fluffy is struggling in  any  way, the first thing to do is calculate when he last ate. Nine times out of ten, it's been over three hours\u2013too long.  \n\n I'm also tuning in more to what I need for self regulation. I love the new focus on pleasure. Ahhhh, pleasure! I can't wait to get home and jump start my 'recasting', dive into that leek soup and set the stage for more conscious, pleasure-centric eating and living! I must attend to my own self-care with the same mixture of patience, flexibility, and discipline I try to bring to Fluffy's care.  \n\n I need me some things: sleep, sex, the social, the arts, exercise but the fun kind not grunty leg lifts and the like, time to read, to write, to be in quiet contemplation, time to prepare for Fluffy's homeschooling and time for NOTHING, precious space-out time with no agenda! When I am not accomplishing ANYTHING! \n\n And, apparently, I need a few other things, things I brought along to support the bod: \n\n OPC-3 for joint health \nfish oil for brain health \n5HTP for emotional health \nmulti-vitamin for overall health \nhormones for hormonal health \ntincture for adrenal health \ntincture for immune health \n\n I feel a little like Felix Unger.

Our landlady lives two doors down. When we were on the ground, we called and asked her if she'd please scoot over and turn the thermostat to the lowest possible setting.  \n\n Now, the house is a piece of turd. Truly. You can actually see the heat pouring through every board of wood. Wild animals build nests along the exterior footprint. Mice arrive by the mini-truckload and hold reunions in and around the sparsely tossed insulation. But it's  our  turd, at least, our  rented  turd. We call it home, stroke its sills, scratch it behind the molding. It meets many of our needs but once the north winds began to blow, it was clear that efficient propane usage was not going to be one of them. \n\n In any case, we reached our landlady and she said,  Why, sure! Of course! \n\n That was nine days ago.  \n\n We got in tonight after a twelve hour trip door to door (loooooong delay in Newark) and the heat was still blasting.  \n\n Blasting, I tell you. \n\n For nine days.  \n\n I guess the wild critters had a bit of Miami vacation right here.  \n  \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/03/nine-days.html", "title": "Nine days"},

And isn't that sexist? A bit? Or is it in order to avoid confusion since her husband of the same name\u2013he had it first actually\u2013was already President? But would we really be confused at this point?  \n\n In any case, it would be tops to have a woman president. But the thing about Obama is that he's galvanized the electorate like no other in a recent memory, surely my memory which often gets fuzzy going back before my last meal. This Hillary, she seems defensive to me, reactive. I heard her making fun of Obama's oratory style recently. Is this what we want? A president who makes fun of the other candidate? When the race gets tight? When things become stressful?  \n\n I also hear there's in-fighting in her campaign. I know. She can't be in charge of every person who's on her team but can't she? I mean, isn't it something that Obama's team is so harmonious? Positive? Doesn't this sort of attitude trickle down? Wouldn't we all like a leader with exceptional character in this area?  \n\n *** \n\n Now, on to Writing Tuesday. The workshop continues through the end of this month. I've signed up for the next session, trying to keep the homefires burning.  \n\n Last night's free write is part of a larger piece I'm working on so I won't share that but this is from a couple of weeks ago.  \n\n Go to your  'firsts' and 'lasts' list . Pick one. Set the timer for twenty minutes. Write. Don't think. Don't edit. Keep your fingers moving and your critic at bay. Here's mine: \n  \n\n The last time I told a lie  was a few minutes ago when I said his Halloween candy had gone bad, had to be thrown away. The time before that:  I don\u2019t know where it is,  I said, when I could see the fidget toy full well, the one that failed to form the shape he held in his mind which made him growl and smash it against the coffee table and careen into my legs and then drop to the floor unable to move now because of the sad energy. The time before that was maybe an hour or so earlier when I said,  I would love to build a snowman!  \n\n I liked the idea of building a snow man but truthfully, in that moment? I was content in my warm socks, my tea beside me, the house around and under me, my coat far far away in the frigid hall closet hooked beside winters\u2019 wardrobe: snow pants and scarfs and mittens I was loathed to don. Where\u2019s the pinch hitter? one of those OT moms with boundless energy and enthusiasm, her shouts of AWESOME SNOW MAN BUDDY! LET'S MAKE ANOTHER! LET'S MAKE HIS WIFE! AND THEN SOME KIDS! COME ON!!!!! reverberating across the snowy plains? \n\n The time before that? This morning, last night, yesterday afternoon and every day in the last three years when I used my own feigned incompetence or forgetfulness or confusion to create moments framed for his learning, ripe for his brain to send rivulets from the isolated pools of knowledge, idea, and thought out to connect to another pool, spotlighting opportunities for the expansion of this juicy roadway ever outward in all directions, north, south, east and west, saturating the landscape, engulfing every underground root. Grow grow grow. \n\n They are not the lies of malice. They are not even the lies of the bedraggled and bored though, at times, I have felt bedraggled and bored, waiting for the reinforcements that never come soon enough or with enough supplies. \n\n These are the lies a mother tells to a son because she envisions a full and connected life for him, one with easy friendships and meaningful work and spontaneity.

Fluffy had spent his time sitting, standing, walking a bit, then sitting and THEN sitting some more in the car and it was 2:30 and now he was in for a bit more, ah let's see--sitting.  Maybe  some standing with a dash of walking around a 10 x 10 foot room. Followed by another hour and a half of more sitting in the car on the way home in a snow storm.  \n\n Sensory processing disorder, anyone?  \n\n E., Our HANDLE practitioner is a calm one.

It worked for most of our 2 hour check-in but toward the end when Fluffy had run out of regulation juice and we were packing up to go and this and that happened, I got tense.  \n\n E reached over and gently touched my back. I looked over and gave her the single thin line that is my lips in times of stress. She smiled warmly and moved her fingers up and down my spine on either side of my backbone--the \"two finger spinal\" one of the exercises we do with Fluffy that is meant to be calming and organizing, coaxing the spinal fluid up and down in even flow.  \n\n \"There's no hurry\" she said, smiling still, her fingers dancing up and down my back. Hmm, I thought. \"Really. There's no hurry. I think you may be putting pressure on yourself and there's no reason to\" she said. \"There's no reason to\" she repeated and I thought of Obiwan and his subtle turn of the wrist, his hand drifting through the air sending out waves of the force. \n\n And I breathed because it seems I was forgetting that simple tip and smiled my gratitude at E with both lips.  \n\n Two finger spinal. That's all I'm saying. \n\n I don't know if I can tell you how HANDLE works but I do know that the approach is rock solid grounded in slowing down, being with what is happening, and breathing into it, because there's just no reason to tense up and push forward.

{"date": "February 17, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Today was a slippery pig day, the kind of day that escapes your grasp at every turn. By the time we had finally gotten ourselves out of the house, our blood sugar was plummeting and so emergency sandwiches were purchased at a place where the most scrumptious bakery items repeatedly threw themselves against the glass and begged for rescue.   \n\n Perhaps it was a mistake but we all ate chocolate--Fluffy, 1/2 cupcake, Dave and I, 1/2 an eclair each.  \n\n We were on our way to meet a fellow RDI mom and her family that moved from D.C. to a neighboring town at the same time we moved here from Rhode Island. She and her husband have two children, a three year old girl, S., who is typical and a six year old boy, R. who is on the spectrum.  \n\n I know her from the now defunct RDI mid-atlantic listserv. We exchanged a flurry or emails when we discovered our mirror plans to relocate here to western Massachusetts but it wasn't until the last week that we spoke on the phone and made an in-person date. \n\n Post-chocolate consumption, it was late afternoon--not an optimal time for Fluffy to meet new kids, but ahead we forged.  \n\n Now, I won't go into all the details. Suffice it to say, Fluffy's recent social gains were not in evidence today. It was a bit of a two-way street and I so appreciated that we all *got* it, no one needed to explain or flit around, poofing up the flowers or snapping into distraction overdrive.  \n\n We left gracefully after a short stay and I was glad for having made the effort, glad we connected with another family and got 'aut', as my friend,  Kristina  says. But the real gems of the day were revealed once we got in the car. \n\n Fluffy talked about the visit the whole way home. He started the conversation as soon as he closed his door and buckled himself in.  Aw. It felt like that boy didn't like me even though I think maybe he DID like me. But it felt like he didn't.  \n\n Friendship is one complicated mother, isn't it? We talked about 'who started it' about what we called, 'get the last poke-in-itis' and how hard it is to stop. We talked about how it's different to have someone over to your house versus being a guest in someone else's. We talked about giving people second and third and fourth chances, about not making snap decisions about who someone is.  \n\n By the time we pulled into our driveway, Fluffy said emphatically,  I want to call R up! I want to tell him that I DO like him, that I DO want to be his friend! I feel terrible about how I treated him! I want to call him up and tell him.  The idea entirely his own. \n\n So we called R up. I had warned Fluffy that some kids don't like to talk on the phone and so he might talk to R's mom instead and she would tell R what he said and was that okay? Yes, he said, determined and excited to take over the receiver. \n\n Hello? Is that you, R? It's me, Fluffy, the boy that was at your house today? The boy who came over to meet you for the first time today? I want to tell you something. I wanted to call you and tell you that I like you and I want to be friends with you. I feel bad about the way I treated you.  \n\n There was a pause and Fluffy waited and then went on: \n\n Oh? Hello is that you, R? Oh.  (R had passed the phone to his mom)  Okay. Well, make sure he understands that I like him and I want to be friends with him but I feel like he doesn\u2019t like me but I know he DOES like me but when I feel like he DOESN'T like me even though I know that he DOES like me, it\u2019s hard to feel like being friends with him. \n\n (And here Fluffy paused as R's mom told him that R had a great time and wants to be his friend and likes him, too.) \n\n Oh, yes?  (His voice soft)   Okay. Oh!  (a genuine exclamation of such tender heartfelt joy I almost cried)   I\u2019m SO glad he likes me. Okay, then. Bye bye!  (whisper quiet, almost melancholy) \n\n I'm so proud of him, I'm kvelling all over the place, I'm positively giddy with kvellitude.   \n\n I tell you, it may be years in the making, but one day that kid is going to be one  hell  of a friend to one hell of a lucky kid. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.mac.com/kjchew/iWeb/kc/kristinachew.com.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/working-it-out.html", "title": "working it out"},

{"date": "February 17, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nKim and me; yesterday, NYC. \n\n \nI took the train in and out of New York City yesterday. It was outrageously expensive and loooooong on both ends but I didn\u2019t have to pay attention to the road and I could spread out, read, do my work, uninterrupted. It was like renting a mobile office for 6 hours.  \n\n I read the wonderful  Emma-Jean Lazarus Fell Out of a Tree  by Lauren Tarshis, a middle grade novel about a 7th grader with Asperger\u2019s. They don\u2019t say that outright but it seemed obvious to me. I recommend it for you and maybe for your kids, if they're a bit older. Fluffy\u2019s not quite ready for it but he will be in a year or two. \n\n I saw my dear friend Kim, the gal who stood by me through the whole confusion, suspicion, discovery, fall out and recovery/acceptance that was my journey as Fluffy\u2019s mom. She never shied away from my emotions, as volatile as weather systems, the calls I\u2019d make with exactly 32 seconds to talk, sometimes whispering frantically, sometimes shouting, sometimes grunting, barely audible. She started me blogging, shining her little flashlight down the hall to my own piece of internet real estate.  \n\n I\u2019ve come a long way from that time. Phew. I came across something I wrote back then back in late December 2004 in the throws of it all, something I never posted: \n\n i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m up to the task, the task of providing for him while maintaining the barest minimum i need for me. i kept putting things on the back burner, trusting that i would return to them, things like: eating a meal sitting down, returning a phone call, wasting time, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen for another couple of years.   \n\n can i make it?  \n\n i\u2019m eyeing this enormous tsunami wave of bitterness and resentment, of disappointment with life and what she's tossed my way and i\u2019m scared of it. i can\u2019t get washed down that beach. it wouldn\u2019t even be this great sweeping wall of as i imagined a tsunami before the real one stretched from Somalia to Sri Lanka, the one that sucked back the water slowly but in a magnificent inhale of horror before it ate small children who waddled by the disappeared shoreline with shovels and sandy fists.  \n\n mine would come like that, like the devils exhale, blowing a cloud of tightness and rage. it\u2019s unseemly to compare the loss of my resilience with the loss of over a hundred and twenty thousand, and of course, i don\u2019t. my own happiness and the happiness of my child means more to me than all those dead. but maybe in their memory i can do what is needed to honor my need to have my own separate life as well as honor what my son needs to have a chance at his too. \n\n \nSo, I had a lovely time with Kim, actress, writer, mother, make-up artists extraordinaire. We bought make up, had a lovely lunch, saw a  funny play , thumped out boots on the city pavement, took a taxi, gabbed and laughed and felt at home with each other in the city where we met. Something about New York works for me at my core. I remember how simply navigating through the day was often an invigorating accomplishment, criss-crossing from east to west, sliding from north to south, catching the bus, making the lights, striding by characters outrageous in any other setting, weaving in and out of pedestrians without every breaking my stride. \n\n There are so many stories there. There are stories everywhere but they seem to vibrate more there. \n\n I met a man on the platform in New Haven, waiting for the connecting train to NYC. He folded his newspaper and clucked,  That\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s what that is. That just don\u2019t make no sense.  \n\n Our eyes met and pressed his lips together.  \n\n Uh uh. Getting a gun and shooting up the world, That just don\u2019t make any sense. You know what the problem is?  he said, guiding his wheeled suitcase towards me by the expandable handle as if he were walking a stiff and obedient dog,  \n\n No one knows how to fight anymore, you know, fist fight. We called it throw hands when I was a kid. And if you pulled a knife or a gun, you was called a punk and I don\u2019t mean nothing about being homosexual or whatever. I mean it was disrespected.  \n\n Nobody knows how to defend themselves anymore. Used to be, someone pissed you off, you just punched him and then it was over. People got nowhere to put their stuff.  \n \nHe shook his head and looked down at the empty tracks and then back at me, now holding the paper out, as evidence. \n\n You see the pictures in the paper of them that does the shooting and they all look, what? peculiar, you know what I mean? Why don\u2019t no one check up on them? Say I go buy me four guns and a shitload of ammo--why don\u2019t someone come over to my house and see how I\u2019m doing. You know? We gotta be willing to stop and really look at each other.  \n\n On the train home, I sat behind a mother, father, and nine year old son, all wearing polyester Giants jerseys, excitedly going over their day of adventure. Across the aisle, a woman with her formidable bosom assisted her daughter who wielded a pencil as if it were on loan from a giant. Barreling down the length of the car, the man taking tickets barked,  Tickets! Tickets! Hey, you need to sign your ticket, man. Hey! I said tickets! \n\n When he got to me, I looked for what might help and then saw it--an impressive square and silver ring the size of a small piece of toast, embedded with diamonds and one central blue stone, a sapphire? I knew right away that he loved that ring. Wow. That\u2019s a beautiful ring,  WHAT? What\u2019s that?  he demanded, jutting his chin down at me. Your ring. It\u2019s amazing. You could see a puff of anger leave him like an escaped helium balloon. I didn't hear him shouting after that. \n\n Stepping in and out of New York is a mega-version of what my life needs in smaller more, frequent doses. It enlivens me. It keeps me in the practice of seeing people, paying attention to what they love which brings those places in me into sharper focus. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Emma-Jean-Lazarus-Fell-Tree/dp/0803731647", "http://www.novembertheplay.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/focusing.html", "title": "Focusing"},

I've got two, one for each of us, and instructions for learning (for me) and then teaching (Fluffy) along with sheet music and a cd of the songs. Yet, holding the instrument, manipulating the holes with precise fingers, coordinating the breath--it's all a bit overwhelming.  \n\n I decided to put it in my back pocket until the fall but didn't want to postpone all musical experience for Fluffy outside of our circle and silly singing. \n\n Enter,  Simply Music . \n\n I started taking piano lessons back in October after a nearly 40 year hiatus (how am I that old???) with a wonderfully innovative teacher who weighs three and a half pounds but is surprisingly strong and energetic. She discovered Simply Music a couple months into our lessons and was so impressed with it, she instantly started the teacher training and switched everyone of her students to their method. I was so impressed with it, I purchased the home program to use with Fluffy who'd been plunking the keys of his toy piano/xyelephone combo with increasing dedication. \n\n The program dives right into learning songs, building a repertoire--no reading music until way down the line, when the student begin to compose. It's based on recognizing and learning patterns. And who better to grasp patterns than kids? Especially our kids?

{"date": "February 13, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n \nIt's very stormy here. I was just at my desk answering emails when we lost electricity. Everything clicked off, the monitor screen contracted to a spooky O that got smaller and smaller and then disappeared into a pinhole at the center of the screen.  \n\n I'm sick. Dave's building a lego star wars structure with Fluffy. Beegu the goat dog is sitting inside staring out the window, imagining herself tracking and killing wild animals when in real life she's scared of the wind, doesn't have the sense to leave an old rotting opossum carcass alone and so has been leaving islands of puke all over the berber carpet. No matter how much we scrub, light green splotches stubbornly stare back at us. \n\n Fluffy\u2019s at the tail end of a sickness he's had for 8 days. There\u2019s been a shadow of depression clinging to my heels made, in part, by my immune system attempting to fight  off this nasty bug but mostly by what\u2019s shifting inside of me.  \n\n I had a great session with my coach last night during which she had me connect with the wisest part of myself and then fly up to look down on where I am right now. I was immediately flooded with compassion and the insight that the last 7 years have been about a major contraction, a necessary contraction to provide what Fluffy has needed but also one for my own growth, an important time to pull back and connect with my need for solitude, to clear away some last vestiges of that sort of flighty social nervousness does-everybody-like-me sort of thing I had.  \n\n It\u2019s funny because in the writing workshop on Monday, one of the prompts was,  I\u2019m thinking of migration : \n\n I\u2019m thinking of migration, of how liberating it would be to lift my wings and let the wind pull me off the ground and into the air. I\u2019d like to be one among a thousand fluttering bodies drawing our shapes the sky, majestic V\u2019s, W\u2019s and arrows. I wonder what it would feel like to swoop and shift direction without thinking, to allow some other part of me outside of me to make decisions and respond without first or second thoughts. \n\n I imagine a perfect balance between the half worlds of winter and summer, a tickling in my shoulder blades is all I\u2019d need to know it was soon time to let go, drop the bits of straw from my beak and deaden my planning mind, surrender to the sounds and movements around me, tossling my feathers backwards so that some of them stick up, pointing, confused, and rise up and away. \n\n Instead, I walk along the gravely edge of highway 17, on my way to the post office to pick up the mail that\u2019s been waiting for me since the weekend. The trees around me reach up to the white sky, asking questions about how long before they have a bits of color to offer to the line of black birds that land in their branches. These dotted bodies become temporary buds before swooping up and darting back down, sluicing through the thin air like a shoal of fish avoiding a drag line and then one by one, settle down in perfect horizontal precision on wires that bring the power to the row of buildings on the corner of 17 and High with the single American flag limply hanging from a make shift pole. \n  \n\n This shifting is about a stirring at my shoulder blades, a time of moving from one sense of home to the next, a natural migration initiated by a change in season, my own internal season. \n\n As the keen and magnificent  Amy  mentioned in the comments section, I am a true extrovert in the sense that I need me the people, to bounce myself off, to recharge, to be in collaboration, even the simple collaborations of adult conversations. I need that. A time of expansion is long overdue. Fluffy\u2019s ready for this. The issue is how.  \n\n It will come to me.  \n\n I\u2019d like a whole week off to stare and sit and stare and sleep in and read and wander in bustling towns with no goals in mind, no errands to accomplish. I'd like another week of being immersed in working on my book and another of pure heady fun, frivolous self care which is, of course, essential and dead serious self care, a week of consuming art like a bulimic but instead of puking it up like Beegu and her oposum custard, I would let it digest over looooooooong talks with friends, funny movies, and animated discussions about creative living. I think I\u2019d need another week off to swing back home and pick up Dave for adventure, just the two of us, so I could see him in a broader light, get to know the parts of him that have changed in these last intense years of parenting, things I have either overlooked or cartoonized. And then one last week to stick a cardiac needle full of epinephrin to our homsechooling plan for the spring. \n\n Instead, I\u2019ll take this Saturday in New York City and many more in the months to come. I have a feeling that will go a long way to scratching my itch. \n\n When I am at my most calm and trusting like after my coaching session, I see this as completely right and natural. This is part of a larger rhythm, the in and out breath and the grace between. This is a time of the out breath, to move out out out, for Fuffy too. \n\n Dave and I were in his room this morning, tag-team scratching a recalcitrant itch on his heel. The three of us were in the white sea of his many puffs as snow was steadily falling outside as it had been all night. Fluffy was talking about something, his mind awake before the rest of his body, before his own sweet face and then there was the moment when it bloomed into a smile and he was all awake. Dave said,  There it is! That smile! \n\n He wears it all day long.  \n\n Aside from some powerful and intermittent waves of anxiety, he is one happy kid. I know that's come from the safety of home. I know that. Not to say ANYTHING about any other child's unhappiness. I worry that we parents take on too much. Our children are unhappy = our failing; our children are happy = our success and surely the equation is NOT that simple but I know, deep in gut, that Fluffy needed the ultra reduced stimuli of our smaller, pared down world, that he absolutely would have contracted too far in the setting of schools available to us, that he needed to have years and years, steeping like a fragile tea bag in the warm waters of his own home and family in order to grow.  \n\n There are fibers that strengthen when wet, the moisture knitting microscopic connections, weaving the fabric together to become more resilient.\u00a0I was part of that knitting, providing the bulk of the moisture. I\u2019m grateful for that.  \n\n And now, we\u2019re ready to tap new springs.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://live-learn-knit.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/new-springs.html", "title": "New Springs"},
{"date": "February 23, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Okay, far from salacious whales, yes, but apparently not far enough from nefarious marine life. \n\n This morning I sat in the grand pedicure throne sipping my smoothie and reading a novel while a wonderful woman with a satchel full of implements snipped, scraped, massaged, and actually blasted my feet with what looked like a belt sander. At this moment, I am sitting inside the condo eating a satchel full of potato chips and sipping a beer while the emerald green ocean and smooth beige sands of Miami Beach, Surfside, shimmers less than 300 feet away. \n\n The reason I've switched venues, beverages and snacks is the aforementioned marine life. \n\n What is it with Fluffy and jelly fish? He has some sort of astonishing jelly fish magnet. Dave and I have endured one sting between the two of us our entire lives; Fluffy's been stung four times already. Make that five. \n\n The day before yesterday, the afternoon of our arrival, we all three danced to the shoreline and laughed at the view, the warm soft breezes, the heat, the sun peek-a-booing out from puffy marshmallow clouds. So lovely! While Dave and Fluffy scampered into the water, I set down our bags and saw to my immediate left, the carcasses of two bright blue jelly fish.  \n\n Portuguese man-o-war. Potentially deadly. But only if you are allergic, sickly, old, a very small adult. Or a small child. \n\n I didn't say anything to Fluffy whom I knew would fly out of the water and stay out during our entire stay. I did say something to Dave and later while on a walk down the beach, we passed the first aid station (I noted its presence with a mixture of relief and alarm) which flew two flags, green for safe surf and blue for dangerous marine life. Those dreaded portuguese man-o-war.  \n\n Damn. \n\n That afternoon, we all swum with no incidents; our eyes scanning the surface and below since those buggers trails looooong tentacles. The next day we opted for a trip to a beautiful public pool at the site of an old quarry, some exploration, topping it off with a walk through the Art Deco-dripping south beach bustling with tourists and vendors and generally, quite a scene. At one point, Fluffy and I ducked into a disco club to find the bathroom and Fluffy played tag with the pivoting lights that danced on the stone tiled floor. \n\n So, today! Today we were off to the beach just in front of our condo! We arrived, dropped our bags, noted the clear green-blue of the water and calm waters\u2013perfect for swimming and jelly fish sighting. Dave walked Fluffy down to the water's edge and stood upstream to monitor the water like a secret service man. They returned and Fluffy dove into the sand to begin his vigorous sand battles and the second his knees hit the surface, he leapt up and screamed in pain. \n\n Turns out, detached portageuse man-o-war tentacles strewn about in the sand can remain dangerous for up to several months. MONTHS. \n\n Stung again. \n\n Badly stung. \n\n I carried him to the first aid station; Dave jogged ahead to alert the guard to what we needed. When we arrived, he administered the medicine right away but it seemed to do nothing to alleviate Fluffy's intense pain. I noted, actually, that the guard seemed annoyed by Fluffy's writhings and tears, telling him,  aw, come on, it's not that bad.  \n\n It looked bad to me.  \n\n Why say something if it isn't going to be helpful? \n\n Fluffy feels things more intensely. I think part of it is that any injury kicks his anxiety in. Thankfully, we had said nothing about these particular jelly fish being far worse than the ones that occasionally drift along our shores back in Rhode Island because that would have sent him into full-fledged panic. But no matter. He kept hurting and it was terrifying. And painful. \n\n I carried him to the condo and into the tub where he was begging to be. I will say that even in his extreme condition he managed to eek out a joke saying through is choked tears,  my jelly fish magnet is so strong, I bet I'd get stung if I was playing in the ice and snow on the north pole!  \n\n The bath only soothed for a short time. It was the cold he wanted so soon he was on the couch wrapped in towels with a bag of crushed ice on his leg. That helped. By then, Dave was off to the drug store for ammonia which, mixed with water, is meant to help the sting.  \n\n He returned with CVS brand window cleaner. I don't know, maybe I would have returned with the same? But somehow, I don't think I'm going to be spritzing my son's leg with that. Should I? Like a NYC homeless guy who jumps in front of your car at the light?  \n\n It was pretty hairy for a while there\u2013I wondered if I ought to haul us off to the emergency room. All is well now. Dave and Fluffy are on the couch watching Star Wars, movie 1. It's unbearably loud in here but every time I say something to Dave about turning it down he holds up his hand in traffic cop fashion and says,  \"I've got it covered.\" which I take to mean, Butt out, Dear. \n\n Oy.  \n\n Will we return to the beach? To the sand? To the tropical waters?  \n\n Only time will tell. My plan is to lure Fluffy back to the scene of the crime by promising to delineate a safety zone with giant circular lines in the sand. I will crawl around on my hands and knees, pushing the top layers of sand aside, tumbling and scanning for offending material like a special op bulldozer. When it is time to swim, Dave and I will stand upstream like aqua sentinels.  \n\n And that bottle of window cleaner? I'll slip it in my bag alongside the suntan lotion. You never know. \n\n But for now, we're in the condo, the shades are drawn, Fluffy clutches his knee and calls out orders like the King of Siam,  More chips! Salami! Water! Chocolate pops! Pause the movie! Restart the movie! No no! Never going back to the beach!    \n\n I just returned from retrieving our abandoned bag where, despite the dark clouds rolling in and the start of rain, every other man woman and child is splashing in the water and rolling in the sand and not a one of them are getting stung. \n\n Not a one. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/miami-and-nefar.html", "title": "Miami and nefarious marine life"},
{"date": "February 21, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t It's after midnight. Dave and I are up packing for our trip to Miami. We must leave our house tomorrow at six ay em. This of the house where mother and child typically saw zzzz's until eight ay em.  \n\n We are staying in my sister-in-law's parent's condo or ought I to say, my brother's in-law's? I know. You don't care. The point is, I am going to Florida and you are not. And so you are bitter.  \n\n But don't be. Because I am going to be walking around in broad daylight with not that much on and you will be far from that sight and for that, my friend, be glad.  \n\n Here is Fluffy's fortune from our night of take-out chinese food: \n\n You are vigorous in words and actions.  \n\n Here is what Fluffy asked me today in the car: \n\n When you and Daddy saw each other for the first time, was it love at first sight?  \n\n And here is what he said to me last week, also in the car: \n\n Mom? I noticed that when you are a mother, you must love your child in different ways depending on how old they are. For example, today? In the library? That mother of the little boy who wanted to knock down my structure? She had to bend down low and follow her son everywhere and say things like, oh! OH! look! this is green! it goes round and round! yes! yes! round and round! And if her son was as big as me, she would never say all that because I would be like, ah, hello? Mom? I'm, like, seven! \n\n Fluffy's been talking a lot about friends and love and boys and girls and the difference between them, asking how it is man/man couples and women/women couples can have children since he's pretty clear you need a boy and a girl to make a baby. I think I have our friend David Attenborough to thank for that given all the footage of mammals mating. \n\n We have this book: \n\n   \n\n \nAnd I love it though it made the babysitter's hair stand on end when Fluffy trotted off to his room and trotted back with that and plopped it in her lap for storytime. You can't tell by the cover that  Willy  is a sperm. I mean, he  could  be a pollywog, yes? They handle the union part very well, just a lump of two people under the covers but therein lies the difference between a picture book and a nature documentary.  \n\n For example, a blue whale's teste is the heaviest on record weighing in at one ton. ONE TON. I bet he's swaggering along with some mighty fine 'tude, that big blue dude with his tongue the size of an elephant and his heart as big as the family car. When it came time for a lesson on the mating habits of whales, we watched a handful\u2013well, a  large  handful\u2013of male whales (though not blues) roll and shove a female, probing the sea and air and finally her body with their twelve foot-long penises.  \n\n Twelve foot-long penises!  And remarkably flexible!  our narrator shared!  \n\n It was quite a tangle, all those gigantic bodies splashing this way and that but that penis! I tell you, it was an eyeful. \n\n Fluffy watched with the blank expression of a scientist until he sputtered,  What is going on??? \n\n The silly big fishies are playing!  I thought of saying but instead, I said cheerfully, \"The males need to put the sperm inside the female so it can reach the egg and make a new baby whale.\" and nothing more.   \n\n But had I been my mom, I would have stopped the film, pulled out my pointer and detailed visual aid and said,  The male whale's PENIS has SPERM inside and it must get INSIDE the female whale's cavernous VAGINA and stay there until it deposits the SPERM that is suspended in a liquid called \u2013AHHHH! who cares what it's called, Fluffy would scream as he tore from the room to safety. \n\n Oops\u2013that's what  I  used to do... \n\n \nWait\u2013why am I discussing massive-scale reproduction at almost one in the morning?  \n\n I haven't a clue.  \n\n Off to swim in the warm salty ocean, far far from salacious whales.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Where-Willy-Went-Nicholas-Allan/dp/0375830308/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203575107&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/miami-salt-wate.html", "title": "miami and whales"},

I will not rehearse the multiple crises facing us, but of one thing I am certain: this opportunity for a national evolution (even revolution) will not come again soon, and I am convinced you are the person to capture it. \n\n May I describe to you my thoughts? \n\n I have admired Senator Clinton for years. Her knowledge always seemed to me exhaustive; her negotiation of politics expert. However I am more compelled by the quality of mind (as far as I can measure it) of a candidate. I cared little for her gender as a source of my admiration, and the little I did care was based on the fact that no liberal woman has ever ruled in America. Only conservative or \"new-centrist\" ones are allowed into that realm. Nor do I care very much for your race[s]. I would not support you if that was all you had to offer o r because it might make me \"proud.\" \n\n In thinking carefully about the strengths of the candidates, I stunned myself when I came to the following conclusion: that in addition to keen intelligence, integrity and a rare authenticity, you exhibit something that has nothing to do with age, experience, race or gender and something I don't see in other candidates. That something is a creative imagination which coupled with brilliance equals wisdom. It is too bad if we associate it only with gray hair and old age. Or if we call searing vision naivete. Or if we believe cunning is insight. Or if we settle for finessing cures tailored for each ravaged tree in the forest while ignoring the poisonous landscape that feeds and surrounds it. Wisdom is a gift; you can't train for it, inherit it, learn it in a class, or earn it in the workplace--that access can foster the acquisition of knowledge, but not wisdom. \n\n When, I wondered, was the last time this country was guided by such a leader? Someone whose moral center was un-embargoed? Someone with courage instead of mere ambition? Someone who truly thinks of his country's citizens as \"we,\" not \"they\"? Someone who understands what it will take to help America realize the virtues it fancies about itself, what it desperately needs to become in the world? \n\n Our future is ripe, outrageously rich in its possibilities. Yet unleashing the glory of that future will require a difficult labor, and some may be so frightened of its birth they will refuse to abandon their nostalgia for the womb. \n\n There have been a few prescient leaders in our past, but you are the man for this time. \n\n Good luck to you and to us. \n\n Toni Morrison \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://my.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/main/ardnek"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/vote-for-my-sis.html", "title": "Vote for my sister, will you please?"},
{"date": "February 12, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nDesert sentinels; Arizona, 2003. \n\n I\u2019m out of steam. I\u2019m a pot on the stove with not one lick of moisture and the burner is on. I hope someone notices before my butt gets blackened beyond salvation and I have to be thrown away. Blackened Kyra. Not a taste sensation.  \n\n Oh? It\u2019s up to me to notice? My job? I\u2019m the adult here?  \n\n That\u2019s the thing. I need a break from the adult world. I need a crack to slip through, a worm hole. I need a no nonsense big bosomed broad to swoop in and take over, a mommy nanny. Someone get on the horn and get me the mommy nanny.  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s been sick since last Tuesday. I awoke this morning with a small campfire in my throat. We\u2019ve been wandering around, rhythmless, for days upon days. There are no morning circles here, no candle lighting ceremonies marking our morning storytime. Right now, I\u2019m at my computer talking to y\u2019all and Fluffy\u2019s by my side, blasting asteroids to smithereens.  \n\n But you know what? He\u2019s been in remarkable form the entire time.  Typically , sickness brews for days before physical symptoms appear, stealing his appetite and ability to sleep for more than two hours stretches, previous areas of flexibility solidify like the moment cement barrels stop turning and dysregulation reigns supreme. Not so this time. Fluffy\u2019s cheerful and considerate, inventing jokes, waxing poetic, pondering the spirit of my friend\u2019s deceased sister one minute and orchestrating our day the next, like a miniature life coach.  \n\n Well, we may or may not go to the library today. It all depends on how we\u2019re feeling when the time comes. Let\u2019s not rush to make that decision. \n\n How was your wake, Mommy? Did you have a good time? You know,  even though you never met your friend\u2019s sister, I bet her spirit knows that your spirit loves her. I bet that\u2019s why the room felt welcoming to you--her spirit was there with everyone in that room feeling their love. \n\n I tell you who\u2019s the most successful mammal, David Attenborough! He goes everywhere! He must be an opportunist like us, like us humans or those clever rats! There\u2019s probably a rat under me right now! Under the house! They can live everywhere!  \n \nAnd a million more things I can\u2019t remember. I need to be miked twenty four seven these days to catch all the things he says. It feels like fireflies lighting up in my head, blinking with warm surprise and delight every time he says something amazing.  \n\n I\u2019m in danger of becoming one of those moms who interrupts every conversation to relay and yet  another thing great thing  their kid said and did. Like right now! As I\u2019m typing, Fluffy is excitedly yelling about his game, the current level and so on,  Watch this! Mommy! You gotta see! Look! Look at the imperial flame! This is what I was telling you about!  And man oh man! I have to rely on my lightening fast reflexes! I\u2019ll never follow your directions because it always leads to early destruction! Oh, but, Mommy, don't feel sad. I DO like to hear what you think.  \n\n So, why out of steam?  \n\n We\u2019re entering a whole new phase after seven years of churning along in this one. It\u2019s time for a reordering of the scene and I\u2019m not sure quite what that\u2019s going to look like. I\u2019m too close, like when Fluffy brings me something to read and presses it against my nose. I need some distance. I wish I could freeze the frame and step out of it, the way the Grinch steps out of Max the dog who\u2019s wrapped himself around him like a canine belt. I need to step out and look at the picture, slowly, with my hands behind my back like I\u2019m at an art show, hmmm, see it from all angles and then wander off to let it percolate, have a sumptuous meal, a riotous and redemptive theater experience, dance in a mini skirt till I\u2019m drenched in the ocean of my own sweat and then wander back to the gallery and ponder some more.  \n\n In the past, any mention of school for Fluffy was met with my swift dismissal. I used to allow for that possibility  one day, down the line,  but lately?  \n\n It may be time to start investigating the options. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.  \n\n Because you know that freeze frame in the gallery? There are other installations in neighboring rooms, variations on the theme of our family, variations on the scenes of me. I\u2019m ready to step into those.  \n\n I need to be around more people. More of the time. All kinds of people. That\u2019s one of the reasons I loved living in New York City. I\u2019d walk down the street and be drenched in the experience of all those people.  \n\n I need that contact, their spirit, their juice. I need to be in collaboration with other grown ups. I need to bounce myself off someone else, the land of riffs and retorts. It\u2019s where my spirit is replenished. It keeps me moist, if you'll forgive my metaphor.  \n\n As long as I have the chance to keep filling up, I can handle any burner, on, off, and all the in betweens. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/drying-out.html", "title": "Drying out"},

{"date": "February 05, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nTulips, from the top; March, 2006. \n\n \nThis is from last night's  workshop : Set the timer for 20 minutes. In a first person, present tense narrator, imagine a gathering. Imagine that something small gets broken, stolen or lost. After 10 minutes, shift to a third person narrator and either stay with the first character or switch to someone else in the scene.  \n\n I couldn't do it. I couldn't think of a gathering, couldn't think of something getting lost or stolen or broken (even in the symbolic sense). I sat for a good long while, unable to write anything which happens to me more than I care to say. Finally, I just started clicking,  made  my fingers tap on the keyboard, which is the only remedy--to get all Nike on myself:  Just do it.  I would offer the same advice to you should you have any of my blocked angst. Just do it! Write it, read it, and move on. \n\n Since I started this Tuesday madness, I shall continue. Here's mine: \n\n \n\n Mommy? Mommy? Is it morning? \n\n I see I\u2019m my bed and the curtains are down. They\u2019re always down in the morning because Mommy always puts them down at night after she sings the getting into PJs song and I remember she did that and I got into PJs much faster than she thought I could. I did it fast because I was afraid I would miss out on video time and I love video time even though Daddy says that all we end up watching is about five seconds of it because we have to stop every nano second so I can ask a question and Mommy and Daddy don\u2019t like it when I talk while the show is on. So they stop. Yes? Daddy asks and it\u2019s usually him who stops because he likes to hold the controls and then I ask a question which sometimes gets me to asking another question because that\u2019s the way my mind is, like a race car or a rocket ship and ZOOM! I\u2019m out of the atmosphere even though there is this very strong gravity puuuuuuulling me down but I get out and then I\u2019m in space and then Mommy looks at the clock and I get worried that she\u2019s going to stop the video time so I say,  Okay, okay, Mommy, okay, Turn it back on Turn it back on.  When Daddy turns it back on I have to say,  Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Will you rewind it a little  because there\u2019s always a delay and the tape jumps ahead and if you don\u2019t rewind it a little every time you pause, you\u2019ll miss something. Mommy says it\u2019s not a big deal but I don\u2019t know because if I miss it how can I know? How can I know what I missed?\u2028 \n\n Mommy?  I think it\u2019s morning. I\u2019ll go get her and ask if it\u2019s morning.  \n\n I don\u2019t think it\u2019s night. No. Surely it\u2019s not night.  \n\n I\u2019ll go find Mommy. She\u2019s usually in her office in front of her computer in the morning or sometimes she\u2019s in the bathroom and once she was in bed. Once I called a lot and she didn\u2019t answer or at least I couldn\u2019t hear her answer and I got very worried about where she could be and even a little mad, not furious, that\u2019s for much bigger things but I did get very worried and yelled a lot, louder than I\u2019ve ever yelled, louder than even Mommy yelled at me the time we went to that lady\u2019s house who was taking care of the Great Dog Max and I turned away from her because I didn\u2019t know her and I was quite sure she had nothing to say to me after all, Mommy was talking to her so I turned back toward the car and ran, ran super fast like I can do and Mommy called me but I kept running past the car and Mommy called me again but I kept running until I saw the cars in the street, I saw how fast they were going and I knew it was a dangerous street because I could see the yellow line and Mommy told me that if there\u2019s a yellow line that means you have to be careful and can not ever ever try and cross it alone or you could get smashed into and CRASH! you would be dead which I would  never  do, cross the street by myself--not dying because one of these days I  will  die but not for a  long, long  time, not until I\u2019m at least 100, that\u2019s what Mommy told me. I  did  see that road and I ran fast but I wasn\u2019t going to go  into  it, I knew  not  to but then Mommy screamed so loud I froze BAM! and was shaking like this, so much I thought my head was going to fall off and catapult my heart SPLAT and onto the window one of those zooming by cars. But it didn\u2019t.  \n\n Mommy? It\u2019s morning! I\u2019m all done sleeping!  \n\n ** \n\n She\u2019s gotten up earlier than usual and in her own bed which is rare, rare at least since her son was born. He\u2019s is still sleeping, miraculously. Normally he rouses the moment her eyes flutter open as if her waking brain sends out signals through the porous membrane of her lenses, like cartoon fingers drifting through the rooms to signal enticingly under his tender nose.  \n\n Her husband is upstairs in his office; she can hear his two finger peck and hunt pounding on the keyboard like he\u2019s killing ants, squashing their crunchy bodies,  bang-bang-bang-bang .  \n\n She gets out of bed and pads over to her computer against the far wall of the bedroom, what amounts to her office now in this new, temporary house. She turns it on. The miniature orchestra sounds it\u2019s awakening. She leaves for the kitchen to put water on the stove, checks the time: 7:45. She doesn\u2019t have long. She stands at the doorway to the bathroom and weighs her next move, coffee in the bath and no time at her desk or coffee at the computer and another day of hasty splashing in the sink? \n\n Mommy?  She hears his high voice call from his room.  Mommy? Is it morning?   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/writing-tuesday.html", "title": "Writing Tuesday: Perspective"},

Today, the fever is down but the coughing is up, eruptions of wet rumblings that sounds like walruses barking underwater. We've been padding around in our pajamas for days; the sitters don't want to come given the potential for contagion and who can blame them? Although part of me wants to play the fool, Oh? Coughing? No, no, we're doing a unit block on sea life!  \n\n Today we rallied and made fortune cookies, stuffing them with secret messages and thickly coating them in red sugar. We broke out some decorations from last year and made new paper lanterns. Since we were house-bound and there aren't any tangerine trees in my backyard, we crumbled orange construction paper into balls instead. \n\n  I made little cards for the table with, Do Fu Do Shou ('May you be blessed with happiness and long life') on the inside and a chinese character on the outside--for Dave: Long Life; for Fluffy: Happiness; for me: Friendship. I started a new tradition for us and made a Hung Bao ('red envelope') for Fluffy, stuffing it with eight one dollar bills. \n\n Here's a little story taken from  here  about the order of the Chinese new year zodiac signs: \n\n When it came time for the Jade Emperor in heaven to decide the order of the zodiac, he invited all the animals to participate in a race. The order of the zodiac would be decided by the order in which animals finished the race. \n\n When the competition started, the ox was leading the pack, but the rat jumped on his back. Since the rat was so light and small, the ox did not realize that the rat was hitching a ride. As the ox approached the finish line, the rat leap off his back and was crowned as the first animal to complete the race. \n\n After all the creatures finished the race, the order was finalized: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. \n\n It reminds me of a similar story from our  Enki  folk tales curriculum but in that Native American version, the magpie rides the buffalo's back only to fly off at the last second and cross the finish line first.  \n\n Click on  this calendar  to find your animal. I'm a Pig. So is Dave. Ahem.  Okay,  I'll go with that.  Fluffy, a snake. \n\n Off to watch more animals--meat-eaters--a familiar bunch in this household. Did you know they fall into one of two categories? From the dog family or cat family.  \n\n So, does that make me a pig dog or pig cat?  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://holidays.slides.kaboose.com/118-animals-of-the-chinese-zodiac", "http://www.enkieducation.org", "http://www.chinesezodiac.com/calculator.php"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/year-of-the-rat.html", "title": "Year of the Rat"},

From the early morning treasure hunt  \n\n \n\n to the woodworking class Fluffy attends with his Dad every Saturday where Fluffy cut, shaped, hammered, glued, and painted this: \n\n \n\n to  the fantastical wonderifically phenomenalicous party held at the local athletic club with the rock climbing wall that soars thirty feet in the air, \n\n \n\n ending with some Lego Star Wars computer time battling Imperial forces and a post-pizza viewing from this  nature documentary on mammals  that has been wowing us for over a week.  \n\n Fluffy was happy. And regulated. And relaxed. And social.  \n\n And so was I. All of four of those and so much more. \n\n In fact, when one of his friends arrived, Fluffy greeted him, took his hand, and said,  Do you want to come see the rock climbing wall?  \n\n Everything about this day rocked.  \n\n Last birthday  was difficult, for both of us. As much as Fluffy liked the idea of a party, he wasn\u2019t ready and the result was tense and disappointing for both of us. I had no idea what I was going to do this year; we\u2019re in a new town and the one possible friendship fizzled before it got warm. Before panic set it, I had a light bulb moment.  \n\n We\u2019ve been getting together with two other RDI moms about once a month or so since we moved here in the fall. We tried this over a year ago when we lived in Rhode Island, but the drive proved too far and Fluffy, too overwhelmed for the interaction. We dropped out after a couple of meetings vowing to try again when we moved closer.  \n\n We\u2019re still pretty far from each other but we\u2019re definitely closer. My friend,  Harvest Mom  (oh! I just clicked over there and saw that she posted about the party! So fun!) found a great park about mid-way, a 45 minute drive for each of us whether we are travling south, east, or west. This year, Fluffy\u2019s ready for the practice and this small group of four boys is the perfect fit. \n\n So that\u2019s who came. Fluffy\u2019s three friends. Yes. For the first time ever, I think I can say, Fluffy has friends.  \n\n We met at the athletic club. In addition to the wall, they have a cafe, and a child care area with games, toys, and a huge indoor climber, like a McD\u2019s playscape. There were no other kids there. The club did set up and clean up. The staff allowed us to hang out well over our allotted time. The wonderful thing for me was that Fluffy  wanted  this extra time with the other kids, after two hours of interaction. \n\n *                                              \n\n Fluffy awoke this morning amid the waves of his white comforter, stretched his day old seven year old self and inquired: \n\n What sort of fun games and things can I do now that I\u2019m seven?  I know there are disadvantages like I\u2019ll have to do more chores around the house and stuff. But what are the advantages? \n\n Which makes me feel like I have to make it attractive, you know, growing up, getting older, as if I\u2019m the sleezy Doorman of Aging, clutching my pamphlets and casting furtive looks for the fuzz, Pssst, Right here, Buddy, this way, I got candy like you\u2019ve never tasted, late bedtimes and Ghost Boy cartoons \u2018round the clock! \n\n He loves being seven.

I topped it off with cappuccino and a delectable french pastry where I sat at my round marble table and eavesdropped on the conversations of those around me, an assortment of accents and lifestyles. I need me the people. Even in this way. \n\n The funny thing is, being out and about is a little like being on a Covert Op. No one knows I'm a homeschooling mother of a boy on the spectrum.

Had my dad been english and, you know, raised in a completely different way with a completely different set of parents and education, he could have been this guy.  \n\n Spooky. \n\n It's such a great thing to watch together. I am learning so much, for example, were you aware that a particular water shrew, a marsupial and one of the most primitive mammals alive, nurses her young by secreting milk not through delicate and distinct little nipples but simply allowing it to ooze through her skin?  Or that a baby platypus, also a marsupial, hatches out of an egg? I wouldn't have minded hatching Fluffy from an egg.

Through my skin and shit?  \n\n I feel very Keanu Reeves from  Parenthood  when I learn things like this, all douche chills and,  Whoa, Dude, no way.  \n \n\n When Fluffy got into bed, he brought up the animals, how different they all are, how important it is to him that we do what we can to take care of them.  \n\n I  don't want any of them to go extinct, Mom.

I think that every animal has a channel that extends out from it and at some point, they connect to the channel that led to people and if one of those animals dies that channel will stop and it could mean the end of our channel, Mom.  It could mean the end of us.   \n \nHe thought some more. \n\n Just think of the bees? They pollinate everything. If their channel stops, we would have nothing, Mom. Nothing. We would all die o ut. \n \nDavid Attenborough has taught us a lot but I think I have Jerry Seinfield and his  Bee Movie  to thank for that last insight.  \n\n Not the best insight at the end of the day, just before lights out and a solitary descent into the dream world where anything can happen.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Life-Mammals/dp/B00008OM6K", "http://www.amazon.com/Horton-Hatches-Egg-Classic-Seuss/dp/039480077X", "http://imdb.com/title/tt0098067/", "http://imdb.com/title/tt0389790/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/channels.html", "title": "channels"},

She is looking for all sorts of stories. I'll let her give you the details: \n\n Since this is a user-drive site, the final book  \nwill really depend upon the parents who  \ncollaborate and the stories they share.

{"date": "January 30, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n \nI'm having trouble getting out of bed in the morning.  \n\n I go to bed each night with high hopes, the alarm set at 6, my husband instructed to wake me up by 7 should I still be cranking zzzz\u2019s by that time. But each morning, it\u2019s the same thing: 6:59 and I wave him away as if I've been drugged, regarding him dangerously between my slit eyes, my body like bags of sand slit open along my seams, the contents spilling into the folded sheets, my limp hand barely strong enough to flip my wrist,  Be gone, dreadful fellow!  I am under such bone crushing fatigue, feeling as if I\u2019d been dragged behind the garbage truck under the mournful moon. \n\n At first I wondered if I was sick. Some low grade flu bug? But I\u2019m okay once I get going, sucking on my half-caff, the momentum of my day pushing me along like a broom under a lazy dog\u2019s ass. I don't feel depressed in the usual sense but I think that might be what\u2019s underlying this exhaustion.  \n\n I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m out of gas. I\u2019m at the end of the first long leg of the course and my engine's sputtering and coughing, looking up ahead for the pit with the crew--you know the one, not the gang with pneumatic lug-nut removers and spare tires covered in grease but the gang in sling-backs and little black dresses, waving coupons for Mac eye shadow and mani/pedis, sipping on sloshing margaritas and boogying to Sly and the Family Stone in a mist of glitter. \n\n It started with  EG\u2019s book , the part in Italy, and her single-minded quest for pleasure. Pleasure. Pleeeeeeeeaasure. Yes, she\u2019s single and childless (or child-free, as I\u2019ve sometimes heard it called), self-centered and narcissistic. A bit. Yes! So what? Why not? As an antidote to crushing depression, a wretched divorce, heartache and her arrival at the cliff that extends at the edge of the world, over that abyss of cold darkness, calling out for the answer to the big question,  What\u2019s it all about, Alfie? \n \nI don\u2019t have that existential angst at the moment. I\u2019m pretty clear that I\u2019m here for Fluffy, for his continued emergence, and for my own. One of Fluffy\u2019s greatest gift to me outside of the myriad ways he\u2019s opened my mind and heart and wrapped it in the perfume of his perfect imperfection, is that he got me writing. I could no longer tangle myself up in the corner of the page, pull at my fingertips, writhe in self-doubt. There was no fucking time. It was combat creativity, time to leap into the center of the blank white page.  \n\n But I can relate to the parched hike and the longing for lush, overflowing greeeeeen, the desire to saturate in all the senses, roll in the milk, then slip into the bread crumbs, somersault into the seasoned flour, boneless like a slippery chicken cutlet, the yearning to hum in dreamy oblivion (the opposite of wakeful vigilance), the seduction of pleasure. Ah, to be pickled in pleasure.  \n\n It\u2019s important. Actually, sometimes it\u2019s essential.  \n\n To use Nigel's (from  Spinal Tap ) scale, I've been parenting on  eleven  for almost 7 years and mostly, alone, calling out to the rafters, hearing my own echo in response--not to be melodramatic. There\u2019s been marvelous Dave and some lovely sitters, my family, a sweet handful of friends. There\u2019s been all of you, the Wonderful World of Bloggers, wielding your mice, clicking on cyberdoorsteps, typing funny and heartbreaking and moving words of compassion, friendship and inspiration.  \n\n You see, Fluffy's made such strides. He's at the threshold of this breathtaking world of social interaction. He's taking his show on the road. I think it\u2019s exactly because of this that I am DEAD DOG TIRED. I\u2019m dizzy with my own inertia after a long burst of activity. It\u2019s when you collapse into a heap after the final touches on a crucial project. It\u2019s when you spend the week in bed on your Tahitian vacation, staring at the emerald sea. Your body finally gets the message that it's down from code, well, I wouldn\u2019t say  red --we haven\u2019t been at code red in a long, long while. Or yellow for that matter. I think we've stepped down from code scales of any configuration. \n\n You know what I need? A girlfriend. In person. It\u2019s been literally years since I had me some regular girlfriend time, laughing, lying on the floor, shooting the shit, buying makeup, scouring boutiques for finds, watching tear-jerkers, striding the sidewalk in our chunky-heeled shoes looking funky and hip and fascinating and free, making wine come out each other's noses, you know. YEARS I tell you!  \n\n So, this post is my prayer. I\u2019ve been praying a lot these days, secretizing, visualizing, asking for help, acting as if, etc., etc. The  Clarisol Skin Care System  is helping, believe it or not. The soft spinning brushes clearing off microscopic barriers. I want to clear off all barriers. \n\n I\u2019m poised for it. My dear husband takes on the bedtime routine more than half the week nights; I live in a happening town; I\u2019ve got a growing cadre of sitters. There\u2019s a new one here right now. I think she\u2019s multi-talented with tons of settings, like those coffee machines that tweeze your mustache hairs while you sleep, draw you a bubble bath and then wake you to aroma of black liquid gold.  \n\n So. Universe? I\u2019m here. And I\u2019ve got my arms wide open. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/eatpraylove.htm", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/universe.html", "title": "Universe?

Set your timer for 20 minutes and write in the first person. Keep your hand (or fingers) moving across the page (or keyboard). Try not to think or judge or edit.  \n\n If you want to play along, please let me know so I link to you and come read! \n\n \nHere's mine: \n\n The first time I had sex , my mouth was numb. I had just returned from a dentist appointment where Stanley Saltner drilled and filled my cavity, peering down at me through his double set of lenses. Six eyes, we called him, though never to his face. His receptionist called him Dr. Saltner. In public. Lord knows what she called him when no one else was around. Something scandalous, something reckless, perhaps with a blast of air from the compressor-- plooop --up her stiff white skirt. I didn\u2019t know it then but it turns out they were having a wild affair, one that spanned the entire time I as in high school.  \n\n It was a Saturday. My boyfriend had stayed over the night before. His family lived about thirty minutes away so every once in a while on the weekends, he was given permission to stay at my house. His parents assumed my parents were decent, responsible, would keep an eye on us.  \n\n Fools.  \n\n He stayed on the third floor with me in my sister\u2019s room. She was away at college. It was a farce, really, a not very disguised one. I don\u2019t know what my dad thought but my mom practically tucked us in the night before, Nighty night, kids, she said, winking. She knew I was a virgin. We had been discussing that and birth control for months. I was thinking about having sex with him, with James, my boyfriend with the face full of acne and hair the color of lemons but I wanted to be careful. I wanted to be protected. \n\n And on this morning, fresh from the chair where six eyes may have been drilling in quite a different manner only moments before, armed with a diaphram and spermicidal jelly, I ran up the two flights of stairs and through my sister\u2019s door.  \n\n He  was still asleep. I climbed in next to him and in an instant we pulled toward each other, magnatized, instantly heated and ripe. I remember that feeling now. My eyes are closed, my neck stretched up, my mouth broken open in a smile that spills out of my lips and makes me almost cry. We knew each others bodies so well.  \n\n I want to say we were hungry but it sounds like something from a movie and yet, it was true. We were hungry and without any shame or confusion about what to do, even though the mechanics of it were sometimes a puzzle, funny and intoxicating. We had been over each other for hours and hours and hours over the previous months with fingers and tongues and flashlights, taking each other over that cliff like diving into the warm water when you first learn how and you jump up, breathless, swim directly to the edge and clamor out only to dive back in again and again and again.  \n\n We had kissed and rolled around like seals in the sea, swift and agile and then suddenly, we stopped still at this, this  doorway . I lay on my back. James climb on me, his legs between mine, my hands between us, my palms resting under his hips, against his skin.  Okay , I said, easing my hands off him and he began.   Stop , I said, my fingertips quickly back to his skin. A second or two later,  Okay , I breathed and he inched forward and that\u2019s how we did it, inch by inch, my fingertips tap tap tapping him in. \n\n We had to go downstairs at some point, afterward. There was no other way out of the house. When we did, my mother caught me with her eyes. And it was then that I first felt it, her penetrating stare, piercing through me and James, pushing up backwards up those sixteen stairs, the number of my years, down the hall, through the doorway and back to the rumpled bedsheets, the three of us, together.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/writing-tuesd-2.html", "title": "Writing Tuesday, brought to you on Monday"},
{"date": "February 01, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Last night, Fluffy made his first prayer to God. \n\n I've been feeling a little impatient lately. Antsy.  Lonely . I've been needing a bit more of a social life. I'm working on it. In the meantime, there's the cast of  LOST . I know. They aren't real people but they'll have to do until I scratch a few more names on my dance card. \n\n The first episode of the new season was on at 9. I desperately wanted to watch it. In real time. With my husband. Hardly a lofty request.  \n\n Dave and I have gotten back in the habit of staying with Fluffy until he falls sleep. Not every night, but enough for this to feel commonplace again. Last night I told him I had to leave at a certain time to watch a grown-up show with Daddy.  \n\n At 9, he was drowsy but still awake (that magical state all the parenting books say is what you are aiming for in teaching the child to fall asleep on their own, the state I could never shepherd Fluffy to no matter how many years I tried). I gave him a kiss, slipped out of the bed, and settled next to Dave on the couch in front of the humming TV. \n\n In moments, Fluffy was at the door, covering his eyes because he knew the show wasn\u2019t \u2018good\u2019 for him to watch.  \n\n I\u2019m scared,  he said.  \n\n There\u2019s nothing to be scared of, I said, annoyed.  \n\n I know that,  he said,  but I\u2019m still scared. \n\n I got up in a huff and marched him back to his room, reminding him of how big he is, how many many times he\u2019s fallen asleep on his own. I tucked him back in and left. Back in front of the TV, I see Jack talking on the satellite phone, tears welling in his eyes. Rescue is imminent.  \n\n Fluffy appears at the door again, wringing his hands.  I\u2019m scared, Mommy! I\u2019m scared!   \n\n Fluffy, I said through clenched teeth as I marched him back to his room, I cannot stay with you until you fall asleep.  Mommy  is watching her show. This is her one chance to see it.  Mommy\u2019s  been waiting (Why do talk that way? Why not talk in the first person like a normal person?) NINE MONTHS to see this show. It\u2019s only on now and she\u2019s going to watch it. (Again with the inane third person?) I tucked him back in rather tightly and left.  \n\n On the monitor, I hear Fluffy start to cry. \n\n I tried to ignore it and watch.  \n\n Fluffy cried more.  \n\n I went back in.  \n\n What can I say? I\u2019m a sucker for the being scared at bedtime. I remember that feeling. I remember the anxiety, the dark corners, the spooky boogie man feeling in the air. Plus, I'm all for boundaries and consistency and blah blah blah but the hard line tough love bit has never worked for us. \n\n I climbed in next to him. Fluffy was working it out, outloud, as he often does, speaking through his abating tears.  \n\n Yes,  he said,  I understand. It wasn\u2019t a dvd. You couldn\u2019t watch it later. It's like when Daddy watched the football game.  \n\n That\u2019s right, I said. But Daddy\u2019s going to tape the show for me so I can be here with you.  \n\n Yes,  he said.  You wanted to watch it. You were waiting a long time for it but it wasn\u2019t more important than your son. It wasn\u2019t more important than me being alone here and feeling scared, even though I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019m scared of, Mommy, I was just scared and when I get scared, Mom? It gets bigger and bigger and I have so much trouble settling myself down. I tried, Mommy. I tried but when you left? I felt it get bigger. And now that you\u2019re here? I think I can do it. Yes, I\u2019m sure I can do it.  \n\n We talked about how many nights he\u2019s put himself to sleep, how good he is at it, how no one can put him to sleep anyway, it\u2019s only something he can do. \n\n  But Mommy? It\u2019s hard to just jump back in the flow. It\u2019s been such a long long time  (tears starting up here).  There was vacation and then being sick and now? I\u2019m out of the flow. \n\n That\u2019s okay, I said. You\u2019ll get back in the flow. I bet it will happen much faster than you think.  \n\n Okay, Mommy. Yes, Mommy. Mommy? Maybe what I need is a worry doll? Something to tell my worries to each night?  \n\n Oh! What a great idea, I said. You know what you can do in the meantime? You can pray, if you want.  \n\n Pray? \n\n To God?  he asked. \n\n Yes, to the God spirit in you and all around you.  \n\n But how...?  (tears completely gone now.)   How? Do I pray?  he asked, looking over at the wall, suddenly shy.  \n\n Just talk, I said. Say, God? It\u2019s me Fluffy. Say, I feel scared and I don\u2019t know why but I need help or will you take this scary feeling away. Say whatever you want. Anything at all. \n\n But. Out loud?   \n\n Out loud or inside your head. However you want. God will hear it.  \n\n Yes,  he said slowly.  Yes!  he said, eyes bright, a smile dawning  Yes. I will do that. I will do that inside my head.  He rolled on his back, closed his eyes, clasped his hands together most sincerely and whispered his wispy secret words for a long, long while.  \n\n  I did it,  he said, beaming. I  feel better. \n\n We hugged and kissed and said our usual nighttime words:  You\u2019re the greatest Mom.  You\u2019re the greatest son.  You're great.  You're great.  The greatest.  The greatest.  You are.  You are.   You.  You.  And then he curled his warm, almost 7 year old body next to mine and settled down. And I turned on the lava light and opened my  book  and read. And by the time EG arrived in Indonesia, Fluffy arrived in dreamland.  \n\n It was 9:45. Dave had quit watching, leaving the VCR to record so we could watch the entire show together. But when we returned at 10:00 to watch the much-discussed premiere of  Eli Stone , we noticed the tape has stopped, at 9:46.  \n\n No LOST episode for us that night. \n\n So I went to bed with  The Diving Bell and The Butterfly.  There was no rescue from his island.  \n\n I read  Bauby's  beautiful words, like sonnets, like love letters, like prayers, and wondered, what would I have blinked?  \n\n Surely nothing with a fraction of his grace.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dynamic.abc.go.com/streaming/landing", "http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/eatpraylove.htm", "http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2008/01/eli-stone-autis.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Diving-Bell-Butterfly-Memoir-Death/dp/0375701214", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Dominique_Bauby"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/02/prayer.html", "title": "Prayer"},

It\u2019s the last thing on Fluffy\u2019s lips as he fades off to sleep and the first thing on his lips when he awakens. \n\n He got a Star Wars Lego  Naboo fighter  for Christmas and a few Star Wars figurines in his stocking. He\u2019s slated to get another Star Wars Lego kit on his birthday in less than a week when he turns seven. ( How is that possible?  My little Fluffenmeister, whose fourth birthday celebrations I reported here three years ago? Have we gone through a worm hole? Is our ship cruising on light speed?) \n\n When he was sick a few weeks ago, we watched Star Wars IV, V, and VI. Twice each. On the weekends, he plays his beloved Star Wars Lego computer game in Dave\u2019s office, his little body dwarfed by the big black swivel chair and double monitor set-up. Each morning while I pad around in my bathrobe, clutching my half-caf, and squeezing in my morning routine while trying to stay in the \u2018now\u2019 and \u2018just notice\u2019 and \u2018step into my power with ease\u2019 as the white notes I\u2019ve pasted up through-out the house remind me, the boys battle the Death Star or create the invented Life Star or kill Darth Vadar over and over again.  \n\n Now. I have a friend whose son loves Spider man. It\u2019s a veritable Spiderman convention over there.  Spiderman figures adorn the table as Spiderman glasses are lifted with Spiderman gloves, Spiderman masks slipped aside for a Spiderman sip. He had a Spiderman theme birthday party with a Spiderman cake and various superhero games including pin the spider on the web. Is she, the mom, spending one second worrying about it? About the perseveration? He loves Spiderman! Big deal! It\u2019s a stage! Next year--next month, it\u2019ll be something new! \n\n Over here, I\u2019m not that blas\u00e9. I\u2019m not OVERLY worried but I\u2019m watchful. I weigh things, my hands out like a scale. Fluffy is a boy.  Fluffy has autism.  Boys love battles.  Fluffy has no friends.  Star Wars is a great movie.  Fluffy\u2019s play is still pretty scripted.  Building lego kits is cool.  What about weaving?  Boys love Star Wars!  Hey, how about making pot holders?  Dave likes Star Wars.  Dave never had many friends as a kid.  Star Wars can be a jumping off point for all sorts of scenarios!  Hey, how about playing restaurant! Luke must be starving!   It\u2019s a stage!  Fluffy has autism. \n\n My friend\u2019s son has a spiderwebful of friends. Spidey\u2019s his guy but he can toss him aside in a heartbeat for any number of games or play scenarios.  \n\n He's NT. \n\n So. I\u2019m watchful. That's all I'm saying. \n\n We limit screen time. There is Friday movie night, weekend Daddy computer time and one, sometimes two weekdays during which Fluffy can play on his own computer, a beat-up discarded desk top of mine that still works yet emits waves of sound like a band of insects are tuning up for a concert. As we were debating which movie to watch this past Friday, Fluffy campaigning for Star Wars VI in a style befitting a former first lady. I made the mistake of saying, yes, we can watch Star Wars VI sometime this weekend but not tonight. Pre-bedtime Star Wars of almost any kind makes for a very very late night.  \n\n We watched the Disney version of Peter Pan that night.  \n\n Skip to  last  night at bedtime when Fluffy remembered my promise. C an I watch Star Wars VI tomorrow AND have my Daddy computer time? Mom? Pleeeeeeease? You promised! Remember! Pleeeeeeeeeeease, Mom?  I said, Well, we don\u2019t have time for both the computer game and the movie. You can decide on one or the other. \n\n Decisions!  \n\n Fluffy positively agonizes over the \u2018right\u2019 choice. It can bring him to his knees. Literally. It was bedtime, actually already passed bedtime. I pinched the inside of my dura matter and groped around in that soggy material for some strategy or resolve should things begin to spiral. Climbing into bed to read with my son is like being shot with a tranquilizer dart. I am soooooooooo sleepy. The bed feels sooooooooo warm, the weight of the puffs (two fat bright white down comforters like thick layers of frosting) sooooooo cozy and soothing.   \n\n The agonizing began. He flipped and flopped on the bed like pizza dough. He hung over the side in an effort to bring oxygen to his brain. He hyperventilated. He begged and pleaded. He then began to panic that he wouldn\u2019t remember about any of this in the morning and would miss out on either choice. I suggested writing it down, telling him that lots of people, including Mommy and Daddy, write things down to help them remember! He jumped out of bed and with a little help sounding out he words, wrote this: \n\n \n(Look at those letters!) \n\n That seemed to do it. He calmed down. I turned off the light. He climbed back into bed and stared thoughtfully at the glow in the dark stars on the ceiling and said,  Mom? Listening to my brain doesn\u2019t always work. I think I can make the right choice if I listen to my feelings. My feelings will give me all the information I need. I\u2019ll just go to sleep, wake up in the morning and find out what my feelings have to tell me. \n\n Trust your feelings, Luke. \n\n I'll continue to be watchful, but you know? I don't think there's anything to worry about.  \n\n I leave you now to meet my boys at a play called   Tatterhood , an adaptation of the Norse myth which tells the \"story of an unconventional girl who combats trolls, saves a princess, and enchants a prince \u2013 all the while remaining true to herself.\" \n\n Hmm. I wonder if I ought to get  this  from the library? Or  this one ? Or maybe some other version that you all could recommend? \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Lego-Star-Wars-Naboo-Fighter/dp/B00002SSUG", "http://www.picturebookart.org/Programs_Events/Upcoming/#E342", "http://www.amazon.com/Tatterhood-Other-Tales-Stories-Adventure/dp/0912670509/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201453236&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Tatterhood-Hobgoblins-Norwegian-Lauren-Mills/dp/0316573345/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201453263&sr=8-2"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/star-wars-spide.html", "title": "Star Wars, Spiderman, and Feelings"},

It feels risky and right to be doing this free writing, exercising this part of me, waking up its lazy, sagging ass and send it around the block for some laps.  \n\n I'm glad for the company, the other women in the room scribbling on their pads, tapping away at their laptops. I love listening to their writing, all different and all inspiring. We, humans, have stories to tell, We've got such jewels inside of us.  \n\n We were given a writing prompt from a poem--I wish I had the poem to post here but all I have are the first three words. Maybe that's all you need? \n\n Set your timer for twenty minutes and start here:  I am from... Write. Don't think.  \n\n Here's mine: \n\n I am from darkness ; I am from tangled hair and mucus; I am from calls of  \u201cI have to go to the bathroom!\u201d  yelled through the hospital halls of flickering lights, my father beside her, fumbling with the change no one needed and the splintered toothpicks from his clean, straight teeth.  \n\n I am from heartache and promises broken, from school rings tossed in anger that skitter beneath dressers, from knees that bend down, from fingers that blindly feel through the wispy balls of dust and mites and coffee grounds.  \n\n I am from laughter and longing, from shouts of protest and rage, from songs sung off key and with feeling, eyes peering out of the comedy, hoping someone sees something more. \n\n I am from Great Grandmothers birthing bastards and traveling across stormy seas in the slick and dirty basement of ocean liners, Away! Away! to the Americans!  I am from lies told to lure daughters from their rightful homes, their rightful mothers, from courtroom dramas that unfold under the glare of just discovered flashing bulbs.  \n\n I am from Grandfathers on horseback, directing traffic on Main Street, slipping sideways off the bare back, no stirrups beneath his feet, nothing to hold him steady, hands waving dramatically in the air moistened by his liquored-up breath.  \n\n I am from mothers that lose their minds and get carted away to rooms with locked doors and well-tended lawns, from iron gates that clang closed each day at supertime. \n\n I am from illiterates and lawyers, architects and seamstresses, curled over sewing machines, pumping foot pedals, stitching together beautifully matching outfits of red and gold velvet. \n\n I am from Victorian homes with 14 foot ceilings and visitors who sit on doorsteps, too frightened to announce their arrival, from long winding staircases and banisters of mahogany, from twenty foot banners of peace suspended between floors, a single white dove swaying in the wind of our exhales. \n\n I am from floorboards, creaky but strong, giving beneath the weight of seekers and meanderers, expanding in bursts of heat, contracting in cold winds, extending in all directions, looking for the walls, hoping for the definition they bring, railing against their confinement. \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/writing-tuesd-1.html", "title": "Writing Tuesday--I am from..."},

Because I said so. \n\n \nThe deep end of the small pool at the 'Y' is only 4 feet and as warm as a baby's bottom, perhaps due to the copious amount of pee that pours forth from said bottoms? I shall never know. There must be a gallon of chlorine in there. Excessively warm chlorine. No matter. I'm a sucker for warm. \n\n It was there this afternoon, only a scant few hours ago, that my dear Fluffy, be-goggled and be-suited, fluttering like a submerged bumble bee, paused from his deep (well, 4 feet deep) diving to say ponderously,  Mom? Today, it's like I've rediscovered the glory of chess. It's like God told me about it all over again because God, Mom? God can't really talk so the way I think he talks to me is to put a thought in my mind and today, he put chess there. \n\n That's not all he said. He also said,  Mom? Mom? Mom? Do you love chess? Do you love my chess board? Do you wish you had a chess board like mine when you were a kid? Mom? Are you so glad Daddy gave me that electronic chess game even though at first you didn't like it? Mom? I love that electronic chess board. And my real board. At home. Did you ever have a board like that when you were a kid? Isn't it great? \n\n And a few thousand other things about chess. \n\n When we got home, he broke out the game, set it up, and promptly wiped the board of every last one of my pieces. Before you get impressed, beating me at chess is a victory akin to whipping your toddler's ass at Jai Alai.  \n\n But still, I love that he spoke so wistfully about God bringing the glory of chess home. And I agree with him about how God talks to us, through these fleeting images, thoughts, and feelings. I've been reading  Eat, Pray, Love.   I know I know. I'm behind you all. What can I say? I don't watch Oprah so I haven't the foggiest idea what to read outside of whatever the librarian, who wears dresses over jeans, puts up on the display shelf in the children's library when Fluffy and I tear through.  \n\n (Speaking of that? Today when we tore through, Fluffy was heart-breakingly tender with a girl who was no more than one, certainly no more than two, in fact, I think it was little Cindy Loo Hoo, herself, and may I say? She looks shorter in real life. Anyway, Fluffy was astonishingly, incurably gentle with her and for the first time ever I continued to run through the halls, slipping every single book balanced on it's open V-legs into my canvas bag and left him, unattended, in  there,  in that play room area with heavy blocks and viciously hard plastic super-sized dinosaurs! And no blood was shed!) \n\n So, I love  Eat, Pray, Love . I love it. I've been brainstorming some way to blow out of town for a year, or maybe just for a weekend of do-able I's, like maybe Ithica, Ipswich, and Illahee (in Washington--a stretch for a weekend trip, but it's so fun to say! Illahee! Illahee!) I could say  much  more about this but the main point, for now, is that she,  Elizabeth Gilbert , the author, chats with God by writing both sides of the conversation in a bedside journal.  \n\n I want to write my questions to God and have him/her/it answer as I take dictation and you know what? I'm going to. Starting tonight.  \n\n And where did I get the idea? God. \n\n Well, okay, Elizabeth Gilbert.  \n\n Or maybe it  was  God, talking to me through the glory of books.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/eatpraylove.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670034711", "http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/eatpraylove.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/the-glory.html", "title": "the glory"},

Be as specific as possible. If you can't think of what you want to write about, write on what you  don't  want to write about.   \n\n In the interest of fair play or foolishly exposing myself, here's an excerpt from what I wrote yesterday: \n\n I want to write about the time I left the playroom and went upstairs to scream into my pillow, came back down and stared blankly at my son who talked incessantly at me like he was flinging sand into my eyes, handfuls of sand, and I turned my back on him and scribbled words on the blackboard as if I were writing my own life line, as if the chalk marks were tiny bits of rope that would keep me from floating away down the drain of my own exhaustion and fear.  \n\n I want to write about that fear, about saving my son, I don\u2019t care how politically unsavory or uncool it sounds, my son was down for the count and I hovered over him, not calm and in charge of my senses, not like time had slowed and I could see every move, every blade of grass, hear the heartbeat of the universe, count the lashes in my child\u2019s fluttering lids, but like the house was on fire and someone had me by the leg and they were swinging, wildly swinging me round and round like an old floppy toy that you can toss a mile across a dry field of grass.  \n\n I want to write about losing my sense of humor and finding my voice. I want to write about finally not giving a fucking shit what anyone else thinks about me and my dreams, my longings, my trouble, the green and slimy bile that spewed from my lips, the same ones that kissed my son\u2019s tender pterodactyl forehead and sang to him for hours and hours into the night and long hours of the day ticking ticking, my son screaming, rigid with pain, as if I was holding his toe in the fire.  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Mind-Living-Writers-Life/dp/0553347756"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/what-do-you-wan.html", "title": "What do you want to write about?"},
{"date": "January 25, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy and me on the cape but, it  could  be Europe, no? \n\n \nOne night back when Fluffy was about two years old, back when we thought he was merely eccentric, a very chatty,  highly bonded  eccentric who would spend his days fused to some part of my anatomy and sleep only when sprawled across me like a fleshy pancake on the griddle, he spat out my nipple where he had been nursing his drink for  hours upon hours  and said in his high monotone,  Mommy. Do. you. know. Italian.  \n\n As I think I said here when I first reported this, we hadn't been talking about Italian or any other language at the time. It just came out of his wonder mind and through his milky lips.  \n\n Why, no, honey. I said, not a  parola. \n\n I'm at the first part of  Eat, Pray, Love,  when Elizabeth is in Italy and man, do I wish I spoke Italian! I want to say,  Eccola, mio bravo ragazzo, caro mio! , while breakfasting on cappuccino and pastry. I want to converse with little old ladies in black outfits and sturdy shoes and handsome young men in form fitted t-shirts. In my imagination, speaking Italian transforms my wardrobe, increases my height, curls my hair into tumbling waves of chestnut brown, I become luminous and earthy like Sophia Loren without those glasses.  \n\n In fact, the whole book is filling me with wanderlust.  \n\n The other night, I said to dave,  Ah, I wish I could put you and Fluffy in the deep freeze and go to Europe for a year, travel, eat glorious food, see magnificent shows and art.  And he said, What? Do we have a bad marriage or something? Why don't you want to put Fluffy in the deep freeze and go off on this trip  with me ? A romantic interlude with your man? I stared at the glistening weapon-like icicles that hang outside our bedroom windows.  Nothing personal, honey,  I said, shrugging,  I think I'm just so short of me time. But maybe the next year,  I offered,  I'd thaw you out? \n\n I saw an old friend of mine the other day, the ex-landlord of the house my ex-husband and I rented near the Berkshires right up until I was dumped that fateful summer of 1994. He came by with his girlfriend, the Italian teacher. She used to call me Angelina. I'd call them on the phone and she'd answer, her voice sultry and soothing,  Ciao Angelina, Sono Barbara,  drawing out the words, making love to them.  \n\n They have a house in Italy, in a little village. Go, they said. Go on. It's free.  \n\n Huh. \n\n Maybe I don't need the deep freeze after all. Maybe Fluffy, Dave and I can walk on roman cobblestones together, eat gelato in sidewalk cafes, twirl homemade pasta noodles and dance in the fountains, and when the  policia municipale  stop us to inquire if we know Italian we can twirl in our bare peasant feet and shout, Si, si!

{"date": "January 26, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n I used to act. I used to be an actress. I\u2019m still an actress, at heart. My dreams and fantasies put me on the stage more times than I can count.  \n\n My sister and I would put on plays when we were kids. In school, I was in every class production. By the time I was in high school, I played the lead, well, in the straight play, not the musical. I can belt \u2018em out with the best of them but not to pleasing affect. \n\n My favorite role was  Annie Sullivan  in  The Miracle Worker . I have stills from that production tucked away somewhere. In it, I\u2019m austere and determined in my plain grey frock, my hair pulled into a tight bun, my dark glasses pressed up to the bridge of my nose.  \n\n The girl who played Helen Keller was brilliant. She and I found this connection, a bond sinewy and electric. We became these people, for those moments on that sagging stage above the modest gymnasium.  \n\n I remember the dining room scene vividly, the one where Annie clears the room of indifferent and indulgent family members and locks herself in with the frenzied and firey Helen. A tempest ensues. We crawled and climbed over that set, mounting tables, knocking over chairs, smashing plates, slapping, scratching, lunging at each other. We never inflicted real wounds but we were operating from them, hot blood pulsed through our veins, indignation, self-preservation, fury. But in control. We were spitting fire and we knew it. We were these girls and we were wholly ourselves.  \n\n \nI just finished reading the middle grade novel written from Annie Sullivan's point of view,  Miss Spitfire; Reaching Helen Keller,  by  Sarah Miller . I started at bedtime last night and couldn\u2019t put it down, not until she got through, not until she reached Helen.  \n\n I'm sure you know the story. If you don't, run out and get this book and then rent  this movie . If you do, run out and get this book and then rent  this movie .  \n\n I\u2019ve never been one to call those with ASD 'locked in their own world' because I don't know their experience and I worry that the stereotype of the \u2018lost and silent one\u2019 does a terrible disservice to those on the spectrum. They are \u2018in there\u2019 and we must cinch our belts and attune our  EMF detectors , go in and yank them out like scrappy mediums elbowing poltergeists aside as we drag captives back from the dark hallway between worlds. So violent and presumptuous. \n\n But there are some children, teenagers, and adults with autism, some who are blind, some deaf, most who are neither, who are unable to communicate. I won\u2019t say  talk  because speech is not the holy grail of this world, communication is, knowing oneself, having a way to make sense of one\u2019s inner world and how it fits or doesn\u2019t fit into the outer world. They are in a kind of darkness, maybe not locked inside but certainly closed off, separated, in rooms with doorways that have yet been opened. \n\n Connection, making connections within one's own mind and between oneself and others is an overriding theme in my life. Using words or symbols to describe things and experiences is the way we make these connections. The moment Helen discovers this, makes the connection between the water pouring over her hand and the shapes her teacher\u2019s fingers make into her other hand is the moment she steps out from her own darkness and into the light of her own self. Doors open, lightness shines not  in  but  out  from within a place in her. That\u2019s what I see. That communication--words, symbols--gives us the chance to greet the luminous inside someone else. And then we can share ours, and there can be an exchange, a conversation.  \n\n After Helen makes her miraculous discovery, she is scrambling through her yard, hungry for everything she touches, for confirmation that the shapes her fingers make do, indeed, name it. It is an exhilarating explosion of learning, spreading out like a river overflowing her banks and seeping into acres of parched soil. But it is when she stops, pats Annie\u2019s chest and holds out her own hand to say, And you? Who are you? And \u2018hears'  teacher,  when Annie guides Helen\u2019s hand to her own fluttering chest and spells,  Helen,  you are  Helen , that I wept the most.  \n\n There is what we teach, what we learn, and what we seek. There is the sea of our own innate and unique intelligence straining against dams, and there are the teachers, mothers, fathers, strangers, looking for ways to let those waters flow.  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Sullivan", "http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Worker-William-Gibson/dp/0553247786", "http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Spitfire-Reaching-Helen-Keller/dp/1416925422", "http://www.sarahmillerbooks.com/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056241/", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056241/", "http://www.prairieghosts.com/detector.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/spit-fire-go-ah.html", "title": "Spit fire; Go ahead.

NT kids are astoundingly competent! It strikes me especially with the toddlers who clomp around independently and rearrange the Duplo Lego structures, adjust the sagging diapers of the under one set, select goldfish out of stray cups with perfect pincer grasps, all while eating a yogurt. Out of the container. With the spoon. Which they direct into their own mouths. Successfully. These are feats Fluffy, less than two weeks away from turning seven, is not yet able to do. \n\n 2. I am embarrassingly out of practice with the every day world of adult socialization. I knew Fluffy's newly acquired regulation in the company of kids would mean we'd be at the very start of  his  socialization, that just because he's ready to say,  Hi, Can I play? Can I help? What are you doing?  etc. it doesn't mean the other kids will uniformly smile up at him encouragingly, and begin to calmly coordinate actions, facilitate repairs, suggest variation, offer pretend play scenarios with neatly assigned complementary roles like miniature RDI therapists. I knew it was far more likely that they would stare at him blankly, curl up their nose and say, No. You can't. Go away! or What is he DOING? or Why does he keep FOLLOWING ME??  \n\n But I didn't know I would awkwardly stand around, alternately gaping or smiling like a deranged clown, that my hands would swell like oven mitts and flap around completely out of my own control, that my best conversations would be during the Sorry game when I came in dead last but had the six-and-under-set eating out of the palm of my, er, mitts. \n\n 3. The kids love me. And I love the kids. Unabashedly.  \n\n 4. I had five minutes of heaven, feeding an eight month old baby in my arms. There is nothing sweeter, except maybe nursing an infant but that would have surely gotten me kicked down the stone steps faster than you could say crazy bitch with her shirt yanked up. \n\n The little baby belonged on a billboard, the roundest head, cheeks that looked like they were stuffed with a truck-load of acorns, the chunky arms and legs you could suck on all day.  \n\n His mother died giving birth to him. I almost fell off my chair when I was told. How could that happen? It's meant to be a thing of the dark past, like having your leg sawed off while you choke on a rag.  \n\n I think he's as round as he is because the pit we all feel when hear that news, a pit like an elevator is falling too fast down the shaft through our core, that pit makes us  need  to give him things, to fill him up, bottles, more bottles, more and more bottles. \n\n What will that be like for him? Does any part of him remember her?

{"date": "January 29, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n I stumbled on  Patry Francis  while blogroll hopping one afternoon last week. I discovered that soon after Patry\u2019s first novel,  The Liar\u2019s Diary , was published by Dutton, she was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of cancer and was unable to promote her own book.  \n\n The post I was reading hailed January 29th at Patry\u2019s day, a day orchestrated at the initiation of  Laura Benedict  and then by a growing group of writers, some who know Patry personally through writing groups and the like and some who don\u2019t, to spread the word about this gifted writer on the day The Liar\u2019s Diary was to be released in paperback. \n\n Today is that day. \n\n I clicked on her blog,  Simply Wait , and was immediately drawn in by her writing, a moving post describing a recent trip to her doctor\u2019s waiting room. I\u2019ve been back since and have lingered over her beautiful words, drinking them in, marveling at her strength and perspective. \n\n I got my copy of her book in two days, thanks to my Amazon one-click ordering trigger finger and read it in one sitting. \n\n It\u2019s a psychological thriller, the best kind, if you ask me. It starts out innocuously enough, inside the ordinary mind of Jeanne Cross, 37, an attractive but plain secretary at Bridgeway High, the school where her 16 year old son, Jamie, is in attendance. She is married to the Wonderful Dr. Gavin Cross, a successful orthopedic surgeon. They live in a perfectly tended house in a beautiful suburban neighborhood, attend church on Sundays, and sit down as a family each night for home-cooked meals.  \n\n But beneath the calm exterior, the ground rumbles. \n\n Enter Ali Mather, 46, the school\u2019s new music teacher, the alluring, provocative and brilliant violinist and her trail of heart-sick men. She\u2019s self composed, independent, dangerous, all the things that Jeanne is not. Jeanne, who\u2019s unhappiness is apparent but in check, is drawn to this woman and they become unlikely friends.  \n\n It is from this friendship that the unraveling begins.  \n\n Nothing is quite what it first seems. The Wonderful Dr. Cross is critical of his son, dismissive of his wife, sanctimonious, a master manipulator who bullies with a tight smile and a clinking gin and tonic in his hands. Jamie, who possesses a social ease enviable and reassuring to his mom, struggles with dyslexia and possibly some much darker demons. Yet Jeanne\u2019s the kind of mom who wants to fix everything with a hot chocolate and whipped cream, who would rather sneak candies to her overweight son than confront what may be underlying his eating disorder and his difficulties at school. \n\n The Cross\u2019s facade has fooled the neighborhood, the community, and even themselves to a point. But the wind Ali creates by the way she lives and breathes won\u2019t let things stand so neatly for long. \n\n The tone is matter of fact, confessional, and yet, Jeanne, the narrator can\u2019t be trusted, she\u2019s whitewashing, distorting, omitting. It\u2019s a story about secrets and telling the truth, the way we come to the truth in layers and stages, if we come to it at all, hoping the thin skin we shed will be enough, that we won\u2019t have to dig any deeper. Hearts catch fire and are broken, houses are broken into, rooms are upturned in search of evidence, someone dies and someone else is murdered.  \n\n I was surprised by the ending, caught up in the suspense that built so slowly I didn\u2019t notice it until about half way through when I found myself saying,  Oh, just one more chapter, one more chapter!  It creeps up on you until you feel the hair stand up on the back of your neck, your heartbeat quicken, your hands tense as you hold the corner of the page. \n\n Jeanne is unnervingly passive, standing by as her husband\u2019s verbal abuse and icy dictatorial manner grows louder by the day, as disturbances in her son\u2019s field fly in to the red zone, as the behavior of her friend Ali becomes more and more reckless.  \n\n By the time she\u2019s called a locksmith on a Sunday to break into a desk drawer to get at some answers, I am practically shouting at her. \n\n I want her to act, to say no, to say yes, to stand up, to wake up, to steer her life in a new direction, any direction! When she finally does, I am not at all ready for what happens, or, happened. \n\n I don\u2019t want to say anymore. Buy the  book . Read for yourself. And visit Patry\u2019s  blog .

(I won't spoil it!)  \n\n Nearby sits his toy, a creation made at the  Eric Carle  this weekend where we heard the concert. I give you this detail: \n\n \n\n I've mentioned the art room before and it bears repeating as the three of us have been been a number of times now and have left each time with snappy homemade objects d'art that tickled us to the bone. Fluffy, not a guy who clamors to explore these sort of materials if left to his own devices at home, there pulls up a chair and immediately begins to experiment.  \n\n Fluffy continues to amaze. Something big is going on. Both the Woodworking and Recess Games classes over the weekend went well. Very well. The weather cleared enough for our Monday Outdoor Adventure class to run and that went. A trip to the library today went well--better than ever before. Fluffy played in the central room, the site of some swift departures in weeks past, alternating between his own pretend play and interactions with other kids. I hovered, but only minimally.  \n\n A boy about four was playing with heavy plastic dinosaurs. Fluffy crawled over, pushing his wooden block structure. They met, nose to nose, and began to battle. Crash, grrr, rerrrrrang, bang, crash! they both said, knocking opponents. I looked up. It was all in fun, all in play.  \n\n Then the boy's dinosaur smacked down mistakenly on Fluffy's hand. Hard. Fluffy dropped his structure and squeezed his finger, ow ow, he cried. The mother descended, admonishing, reminding. That's too rough. That toy is hard. Be gentle.  Ask the boy if he's okay.  I'm okay. It was an accident, but it did hurt , Fluffy said. No hitting. No pushing. No spitting. No yelling.  \n\n The snow continues to fall. More is on the way. The neighbor comes in his speedy plow, scrapes the driveway clean and leaves behind a dirty mountain range. \n\n I give you monday's snowball: \n\n \n\n And a sensory smart project for a winter's day:  \n\n \n\n 1.

Something has shifted inside Fluffy and I think he is poised to use the social interaction for the first time more consistently as practice, a kind of intuitive skill buidling rather than simply endure or skirt the perimeter only to dart in and out sporadically.  I've signed Fluffy up for a number of things, like sprinkling a handful earth in a sieve--some pieces will make it through the filter and some will stay behind.  \n\n Wednesday Homeschoolers Group \nOutdoor Adventure \nYoga & Movement \nRecess Games \nWoodworking (with his dad) \n\n The last three are taught at a local center for special needs kids and their typical siblings where Fluffy took gymnastics in the fall.

Even just one great class where Fluffy can feel safe, to feel part of the whole, where he may even make some connections that I know he craves, would be a huge success. \n\n I don't imagine it will be seamless. Few things in life are for any of us.  \n\n What I notice is this: I'm feeling good about Fluffy's developmental progress.  It's delayed, yes, but it's moving along a beautiful trajectory. With adults. He's had practice practice practice with us. He's logged thousands of hours in play with Dave and with me. He's had wonderful relationships with the babysitters and other adult 'playmates' over the years. \n\n But with kids? The social anxiety--maybe even true social phobia--that he seems to feel, seems to have felt over the years, has made it hard for him to log the hours he needs to practice being with his own set, to try and fail and then try again and succeed, to see himself as competent, to recall previous experiences of working it out with a friend that would boost his confidence enough to try a new way when things get tough. The world of friends, of fellow kids, has been a foreign one to him and while I'm not ready to toss him into the deep end and shout SWIM YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

{"date": "January 20, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Yesterday, Dave, Fluffy, Uncle Bill, and I watched the  UMass Minutemen swoosh to basketball victory  down the road in Amherst courtesy of the funny, generous, and multi-talented  John E. Robison  of  Look Me In The Eye  fame. I haven\u2019t been to a basket ball game in a million years. I can still hear the squeak from the sneakers on the lanky all-girl\u2019s team ringing out in my old cramped high school gymnasium--a far cry from this vast stadium filled with over 6,000 cheering spectators. \n\n And we were four of them.  \n\n We had a ball! John ushered us into the private Massachusetts room, perched on the third floor and overlooking the court through a wall of glass that Fluffy immediately dashed towards and leaned his full weight against. Is that, er, safe? I asked, warily. There were a couple of other kids there, too, climbing and leaning so I figured, if Fluffy tumbles, at least he\u2019ll go out with his peeps.  \n\n After visiting for a few minutes, John led us down to the playing floor, pointed to where he'd be sitting courtside, snapping photographs for an upcoming book, and directed us to our seats. \n\n I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d last the whole game. I emailed John with this warning of our early departure, all those people! the huge space! the sights and sounds! the overload! But we did. Right down to the final buzzer, and the long line of lanky giants hardly older than Fluffy\u2019s own cousin Jake, jogging by on their way to the dugout or batting cage or locker room or whatever you sportsfans call it, leaning down low low low to slap the eager hands of all the kids lined up in anticipation, Fluffy\u2019s outstretched paw being the cutest of the lot, if I do say so myself.  \n\n Here\u2019s the thing: we were there, making the scene, just like all the other families with kids. We were at a basket ball game on a Saturday afternoon, eating hot dogs and shouting from the bottom of our bellies when the Scream Meter came up on the big screen. Fast rewind to how it might have gone a year ago:  \n\n Cue Mission Impossible music. Dave packs The Bag, you know the one, with the snacks and water and back-up water, a extra set of clothes, books, a fiddle toy and a portable game or two. I hold Fluffy\u2019s hand tightly as we walk through the front doors. Dave strides ahead, gathering data, feeding the information into his wristwatch walkie-talkie: the sound levels, the degree of echo, the bathrooms, the exits, the feeling of the crowd, the seats, empty rows in front? behind? to either side? the coveted aisle seat? Available distractions deemed good news: hallways for running, someone with an electronics device, candy of any sort; possible distractions deemed bad news: nearby kids, someone with an electronics device, candy of any sort. We\u2019d have the cell phone charged up, a car with driver circling the block awaiting our call of Abort! Abort!  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s favorite part was exploring in the Massachusetts room, climbing under the tables, crawling navy-seal like between the other patron\u2019s legs, circling the other kids near the big glass windows, trying to get in on their game. Isn't this what you did as a kid at these sort of functions? I loved stalking the knee-and-under space of my parent's parties, prowling in and around furniture, through the forrest of all those legs. \n\n At one point I even lost sight of him. I walked up to Dave and John and said, Fluffy\u2019s gone AWOL in that  kids are such kooks  tone of voice Really? Dave answered, only midly alarmed given the fact that my eyeballs were still in their sockets and then I think it was John who said,  Oh, there he is  in a supremely relaxed voice and there he  was , up on his knees like a prairie dog, scanning the crowd for me.  \n\n That\u2019s what he does now, stops every once to find me, to make sure he\u2019s still connected.  \n\n We hoped to meet a friend of John\u2019s whose son is a fellow Aspergian of the small variety but they didn\u2019t come. Maybe next time, there or next door, at the beautiful indoor skating rink during one of the many open family skates. A few weekends ago we donned blades for the first time in a million years and spent the hour slipping, skidding and falling like a bunch of cartoons but it cracked us up. We\u2019d shuffle along the perimeter, clutching the edge, let go and chh chh chh scramble along a patch of scratched up ice, glide a little and then violently teeter back and forth before steadied ourselves for a giggle. We were game.  \n\n We\u2019re game for almost anything these days.  \n\n Now, if you haven\u2019t read John\u2019s book, go  here  and order it now. You\u2019ll love it. It\u2019s funny and gripping, the writing crisp and moving, both perfectly described and unadorned. There is nothing superfluous there.  \n\n His courage left me breathless. He seems to have been born with plumb line to this sturdy belief in himself. He spent years as a self-described misfit and came to be a pleasantly eccentric Aspergian, a word of his own coinage (which I also love. How awkward was it these last years until John came along, to find the appropriate adjective? Asperger-y? Aspergerish? No, no. Aspergian is clearly the right word.) and by the time I closed the back cover, I wished for half his initiative. Everything he touched, shone, (or at least dangled, squirmed, or smoldered--you'll see what I mean) not the least of which is his new career as an author; his first book debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list. As it should have.  \n\n Thanks, John, for getting us out there. It was a wonderful family event, a great venue, and you were a gracious and delightful host.  \n\n Woof. \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.masslive.com/umassbasketball/", "http://jerobison.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Look-Me-Eye-Life-Aspergers/dp/0307395987", "http://www.amazon.com/Look-Me-Eye-Life-Aspergers/dp/0307395987"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/were-game.html", "title": "We're Game"},

{"date": "January 12, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t My friend had a miscarriage this morning. While I was clicking away at my keyboard, updating bloglines, posting about our \u2018sweet spot\u2019 as  Maddy  called it, my dear friend was  losing her baby. \n\n She was devastated, as you can imagine, though oddly validated as this pregnancy had felt tenuous from the very start with double lines appearing and disappearing and her own body swelling and then receding from day to day. The woman who delivered the news of her positive pregnancy at the Obgyn\u2019s practically shouted, WHAT\u2019S THE MATTER? YOU\u2019RE PREGNANT! BE HAPPY! as my friend looked at her with suspicion. I  would  be happy and maybe I  will  be happy once I believe  it\u2019s true , she was thinking.  \n\n She\u2019s just turned forty and she feels worried. I see her succulence and I have confidence. But I\u2019m over here in my sweet spot and she\u2019s in the ditch where it\u2019s dark and dry.  \n\n In Arizona they have street signs that say, \u2018Dip Ahead\u2019. Dave and I have joked about seeing the other one on the side of the road,  Oh, look! There you are! Hi dip!  We\u2019ve dipped our heads down as we passed through the gully as passing through low slung portals. Mostly we\u2019ve simply slowed down. Around here, the local department of transportation doesn\u2019t warn us of dips. They do let us know of treacherous turns, merging traffic, missing shoulders, and the like and that\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s nice to know what to look out for, how to adjust our speed.  \n\n My friend and I talked a while. She had left a message for me first thing this morning which I didn\u2019t hear. The phone and machine were both turned all the way down and I hadn\u2019t even thought to look for the blinking light, so intent was I on spending time alone at my desk. I had just stepped out of the shower when she called back with her news, desperately sad and even more wounded to think I had simply ignored her earlier message.  \n\n When things were straightened out and she told me of her mourning, she said, I\u2019m so glad things are going well for you. Yes, I answered, though I know hard things will spiral round again; they always do. How great that you can see that, she said. Well, now, I can, I said. But when things get really rough, we\u2019re all just cats on a car trip, nauseated and shaky, like the many many cats of my childhood captured for the drive to Maine, seven hours of lurching and chugging along in a beat up old VW bus. Cats can\u2019t remember where they\u2019ve been, can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s in store.  Their lives are only this: a vomitous ride trapped within a hot and rumbling car.  \n\n She laughed. I guess she had cats growing up and witnessed them try in vain to stand in one spot, the toothy panting and plaintive cries of protest and discomfort. \n\n Forgive the corny metaphors: life\u2019s street signs and cars symbolizing our life journeys, our frightened selves as cats lost in the pain of the moment, gingerly placing paws on mountains of hard and tippy luggage, looking for a soft spot on which to rest. I can\u2019t help myself.  \n\n I can\u2019t have cats anymore. Dave is allergic. I could kill him tonight by dangling a furry kitten over his snoring nose.  \n\n  I don\u2019t know why I think of cats so much at times like this. I don\u2019t know why the conversation with my friend reminded me of my cat, Max, from long ago and the time he didn\u2019t come home for days. He was a hunter, a tiny orange tabby with oversized pointy ears like cardboard triangles perched at constant attention for the sound of the vulnerable wildlife lurking around every patch of grass. I was used to him prowling for a day or two but by the third day, I got scared. I canvassed the neighborhood, calling out his name until something caught my eye. Max, in the faraway window of an abandoned shed, his thin neck supporting his impossible ears, his mouth opening and closing, frantically, furiously, silently.  \n\n I guess I want us all to be in it together, before during and after those long car rides. And I want us to find each other when we\u2019re stuck in old sheds with doors that jam and windows that muffle our cries for help. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://whitterer-autism.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/my-friend-is-sa.html", "title": "My friend is sad today"},

I hesitate to say it's a resolution to update more regularly since I'm not  doing  the resolution thing this year other than my commitment to be with what is happening in the moment, whatever it is, BUT I'm into a new rhythm--at the moment--which is bringing me here every day and I like it.  \n\n And now that I've got urls at my greedy little fingertips, I can read you every day.

Welcome. \n\n The homeschoolers' group was a huge success! It was held in a beautiful old brick school building now the home to self-directed learning center for teens who are homeschooled, kids like our new dog walker who  comes once a week to take Beegu on a deliciously loooong walk with a pack of dogs. She (the human) dropped out of  high school in her freshman year and taught herself right through to college. Right on. \n\n The rooms in this old school house are big, tall, and flooded with natural light. Inside, about 45 of us gathered in either the open-play noisy room or the quiet room downstairs or sectioned off to one of the classrooms upstairs to sing songs in Spanish or fashion a hemp rope bracelet. We did neither class but instead, opted for a free-play/quiet room combo with a snowball fight outdoors thrown in. \n\n Fluffy looked right at home. \n\n Let me repeat: Fluffy looked right at home. \n\n \n! \n\n After a brief morning circle when the schedule of the day was announced along with a few rules (no running inside, no switching from room to room without an adult present, eat only in the noisy room where snack was presented, etc. etc.) Fluffy sat down in a group of kids and started playing a new game.  \n\n !! \n\n While I talked to another mom and her twins, one of whom offered me a scrunched up and soggy name tag with the most earnest expression on his face. I talked to a few other moms, all of whom were relaxed and friendly, while Fluffy finished the game then explored the room, then joined a movement circle for a short while, then investigated some other games, then observed some more kids, a pleasant expression on his face. \n\n !!! \n\n We stayed two hours. \n\n !!!! \n\n This on the heels of our new Outdoor Adventure Class that feels like a good fit, followed by a playdate at my friend,  Harvestmom's , and another mom with her wonderful Aspergian son. A playdate!  \n\n And at this very minute, Dave is with Fluffy at their new Saturday morning Woodworking class. I'll find out how that went when we all meet up at  The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art  where we will take in a live music and a puppet show. \n\n 2008 is feeling pretty good so far. We'll see how the new  Pema Program  holds up when the tides turn, as they surely will, but for now, being in the moment feels like emerging from the plane that flew you from the snowy northeast to a tropical land. You step onto the tarmac and that easy, warm air surrounds you like a longed-for embrace.    \n\n EDITED TO ADD: I just found out it's de-lurking day! So, I say to one and all: De-lurk! It's fun! It's free! I've been bitten by love bug and I want to say hello to every last one of you!

{"date": "January 19, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy with his handmade jump rope; November, 2007. \n\n \nI am still learning about process. I must have suffered some wounding in my early years, some block that prevented me from successfully completing stage 4 in Erik Erikson\u2019s Developmental Stage of Man--Industry versus Inferiority, the stage that is critical for the developing competence, learning new skills central to feeling capable, trusting, autonomous, and useful in the larger world of community. \n\n \u201cThe shame or guilt-filled child will experience defeat and inferiority\" if they have not passed successfully through the challenges of this stage,  it says on one page of my Erikson google results.  \n\n Oh. \n\n Or: no kidding, Dick Tracy. \n\n According to  Erikson , stage 4 spans the years six to twelve. In my case, more like six to at least forty-eight and still counting.  \n\n It\u2019s clear to me that Fluffy, like most kids with autism, is in many developmental stages simultaneously. In Erikson\u2019s classification, I would put Fluffy at Stage 2, Autonomy versus Shame (18 months to 3 years) the central theme being the development of will, skills of self-care, control of one\u2019s bowel, and a time when relationship with the parents is most important; Stage 3, Initiative vs. Guilt (3 to 5 years) developing a sense of purpose, copying adults, expanded pretend play, experimenting with being part of a team, the birth and explosion of \u2018why\u2019 questions, a time when family relationships are still the most significant; and Stage 4, Industry vs. Inferiority (6 to 12 years) developing a method of how one works, a time of emerging competence, of learning and accomplishing new, more formal skills that are critical to success in the larger world of neighborhood and school, and a time when key relationships are first forged outside the family system.  \n\n I don\u2019t want Fluffy to feel defeated and inferior. I want him to feel trusting, independent, full of initiative! I want him to discover, little by little, how he learns, how he best works, how he moves from inspiration to accomplishment through trial and error, success and failure, exasperation and delight. \n\n It\u2019s not all up to me, of course. But I do see my job as his parent to plan activities that allow for his best chance at success. Don\u2019t we all? It\u2019s what I love about RDI, the focus on framing (how and where we set up a project) and scaffolding (how much support we provide) and building competence. The most brilliant thing I ever  Dr. Gutstein  say was, we humans are primarily motivated by  competence  not fun. \n\n Fluffy loves to jump. It gives his body wonderful proprioceptive input. He\u2019s good at it. He jumps on the couch, our heads, the dog, the trampoline, the  Air Pogo  that hangs from our living room ceiling. We have tape marks on the rug for jumping contests--long jump, two-footed, one-legged, you name it, we jump it. But the jumping can fly through energizing and organizing and land on completely out of control in a heartbeat so I wanted to find a way to give it structure, a framework. \n\n We started with ropes on the floor, like our tape marks, jumping over in all sorts of ways, together and in turns. After a couple of weeks, I added jumping to our morning circle with a chinese jump rope, suspended between two dining room chairs. That\u2019s when we introduced the first verse from the  Enki  movement curriculum: \n\n Wiggling snake by the ocean side \nHow will I get to the other side? \nOne foot, two foot, across I go \nNot too fast and not too slow. \n\n We experimented with different patterns, at first very simple ones, adding complexity each week.  After three weeks of the chinese jump rope, I broke out the traditional jump rope, a tri-colored beauty that  Fluffy made  out of yard at the Waldorf school festival we attended this fall. \n\n Dave and I held the rope on either side and simply wiggled it, like a snake. The following week, we added a second verse holding the rope a bit higher, wiggling more vigorously: \n\n Wiggling snake by the ocean side \nI stay in the water in the highest tide. \nOne foot, the other, and back again \nMy two feet are the best of friends! \n\n The week after that, we swung the rope round and round. We stayed with this for three weeks, adding a third verse that we made up with claps in front and behind. There was a break for the holidays and when we returned to circle this winter, Fluffy, feeling a sense of competence, of trust, of autonomy, initiated variations on his own-- jumping while turning around in circles .  \n\n Next week, we\u2019re going to add jumping  in  while the rope is moving, jumping in and and then out.  \n\n It\u2019s more like real life, this finding one\u2019s way into the thing that\u2019s already in motion, the rope, the conversation, the game, the spinning earth, and developmental itself--much more a spiral as Pamela Levine proposed, that circles round with its sampler of stages like delectable hors d\u2019oeuvres on a tray, offering us the chance to reach again for what we missed the first time around.  \n\n Or second, or third, and so on.  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Erikson", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/RDI/AboutSG.asp", "http://www.swingset.com/prodinfo.asp?number=AIRPOGO34904", "http://www.enkieducation.org"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2008/01/the-jump-rope-p.html", "title": "The jump rope progression"},
{"date": "January 13, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I just finished reading  A Thousand Splendid Suns , sobbing through the last three chapters. That last line. A more perfect last line for that story, I could never have found. \n\n It left me split open, soft. If only Fluffy knew my state at the time, he\u2019d have been before me in a flash with documents to sign: unlimited computer time, access to my bank along with my pin number, the right to slurp ketchup in a glass--straw planted in the center like a stick in a mud pond, cotton candy for breakfast until he reaches double digits.  Okay, dear,  I\u2019d have answered, scribbling away,  that\u2019s fine. Just don\u2019t go near Afghanistan in wartime.   \n\n My tears washed away my ability to put pen to paper, or finger to keyboard, as it were. Dave and I watched  Snow Cake  last night and I\u2019ve been trying to put two coherent words together for the last 20 minutes.  \n\n I have lots of things I want to say, about how we need many many more movies populated with autistic characters so we can move away from stereotypes of autistics being one way. It will take time. We\u2019re just now getting to the point where a gay character isn\u2019t thrust upon the screen to mock and entertain, to indicate that,  them dang gays only stop their rough hamster sex long enough to nervously spritz lysol on every available surface while singing show tunes in Judy Garland drag.  We\u2019re just now getting to the point where a character is there to explore something about our humanity regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\n I think Snow Cake did a pretty good job. It tells the story of a young, free spirit named Vivienne (Emily Hampshire) who meets a reticent older man named Alex, (Alan Rickman), just out of prison for killing a man. Their encounter leads Alex to Linda, (Sigourney Weaver) who is Vivienne\u2019s mother and also autistic.  \n\n Linda is \u2018high functioning'. She lives independently. She loves sparklies, keeps a highly orderly house, allows no one into her kitchen, doesn\u2019t \u2018do social\u2019, eats a gluten-free diet and loves to bounce on her trampoline. She\u2019s matter of fact, not given to linger facial gazing and won\u2019t touch garbage.  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s not big on handling trash and he loves to bounce on his trampoline. At the end of the day, his room looks like a mine field; his clothes covered in whatever meal he experienced that day. We are actively working on the whole concept of NAPKIN, that the fabric rectangle in his lap is there for something other than flipping around over his head or knocking over his glass of water, that when he happens upon a distasteful blueberry or unsatisfactory clementine section, catapulting it across the room as he violently gags may not fly in certain social circles. He\u2019s not much disturbed by the disorder of his own making, though I continue to sport a stream-line decorating style to keep down the visual information, and impose a system of order, baskets, cabinets and closets to reduce visual clutter. \n\n Fluffy and Linda are very different. One is six and has Aspergers. The other is a made-up character played by a professional actress.  \n\n It isn\u2019t that Linda\u2019s character struck me as off-base. I don\u2019t personally know anyone like her in real life but I don\u2019t know a lot of autistic adults.  It\u2019s just that there haven\u2019t been enough portrayals of those on the spectrum to represent the entire SPECTRUM of expression so people with ASD are not yet viewed as individuals, with some common threads--yes, but with distinct and individual quirks, personality traits and life experiences. So I feel a tiny bit on guard when I watch any movie portraying autism, concerned audience members will mistakenly believe they *get* it, that all they need are some rubber gloves and a bagful of colorful flashing balls and they got this autism thing covered. \n\n And yet, I liked it. It was predictable at times, a sad lonely man thrown off course by a traumatic event which introduces him to an unusual person who challenges him and in the process, he undergoes some healing. \n\n And yet, I was moved. I ended up believing Linda, liking her, believing in her friendship with Alex. It was really Alex\u2019s movie; he was the character on the journey, the physical and metaphoric one. Linda\u2019s character doesn\u2019t change but helps provides the impetus for Alex\u2019s change.  \n\n The acting was good across the board. I\u2019m an Alan Rickman fan, even with the mumbling. Sigourney did a credible job. David Fox, who played her father stood out for me as did, Emily Hampshire as Vivienne, Linda\u2019s free spirited daughter who loves unconditionally and celebrates differences. It\u2019s not an easy part to play without being maudlin and she left me wanting to see more of her which, I imagine, was essential to this story.  \n\n The script was pedantic at times, delivering information to us in a text-book manner, as if we are gathered in an autism seminar and not watching a movie in pair of fleece Costco pants in our own home, eating miniature peppermint patties like they were carrot circles. (Despite  Drama Mama\u2019s  spot-on reference to autism as the \u2018new black\u2019 apparently, there are people who don\u2019t yet know what it is.) But there were also a lot of funny moments like when Linda bruskly dismisses a neighbor\u2019s cloying and intrusive attempt to interact on the street. The neighbor turns to Alex as Linda lurches ahead and says, \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay. I know  all  about autism. I saw  that movie.\u201d  It reminds me of the little old lady who pulled my mom aside during an autism awareness event and rasped in her ear,  You can get it from tuna fish! \n\n Angela Pell, who wrote the script, is mother to an autistic son. Linda\u2019s daughter, Vivienne, also a writer, is daughter to an autistic mother. At one point, the grandfather reads one of her stories allowed, a children\u2019s book from the point of view of a girl with an autistic sibling. It was a beautiful story. It made me cry. A lot. \n\n There is a moment toward the end of the film when Linda is unable to tolerate a houseful of guests that she never wanted in the first place. She finally darts into the living room calling for them to leave, cranks her music and begins to dance and sing. Some of the guests are horrified; one tries to stop her. Linda\u2019s mother intervenes, saying,  Let her dance! let her dance!  In that dance, Linda sees her daughter, though Vivienne's not there. Tthey are dancing together in the shimmering snow. They are dancing together. They are dancing.  \n\n I read some criticism of this cinematic moment but, though it bordered on hokey, I thought they pulled it off. It was an important moment, one we needed to see, Vivienne and Linda together, Vivienne letting Linda be Linda, seeing her, loving her, accepting her, joining her.  \n\n I want more movies with autistic characters of all types and levels of functioning living all kinds of lives. Some of the time, the director is going to bring us into their head and they may or not get it right according to those who are on the spectrum or those who live with those who are, but as long as they start where we can see ourselves, and stay with the emotional truth, in my book, they\u2019re halfway there. \n\n I think Snow Cake may have gotten even a bit more than halfway.  \n\n \nM--I haven't forgotten!

{"date": "December 12, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n I wish I had a good selection of kid craft sites to pass along as Liza in the comments section asked about this very thing. I wish I were that organized and methodical. The way it works for us is more, well, improvisational.  \n\n A while back, my sister-in-law started a blog where she posted some wonderful crafty things she did with her two kids. She linked to more great sites and soon I was wandering in the ethernet of quirky crochet dolls and fantabulous handmade bags and every manner of hip apron art button mirror cup saucer wall-hanging in the land. And I started to feel like shit. Who were these mothers? Blissfully sewing their children's funky wardrobes while expressing breast milk into glazed bowls and giving birthing yet again while baking and cooking and decorating their homes in the colors of the greek islands as their older children quietly frolick nearby without needing supervision clad in hand-knit sweaters and crochet caps, kneeling by wool felted play mats with toys crafted from discarded merrimeko fabric and cherry wood scraps in the shed where the husbands are busy building the new barn? In which more projects will merrily unfold during community craft-ins that benefit the homeless?  \n\n My sister-in-law stopped blogging about crafting and I was released from my compulsive clicking on those uber-craft sites. Thankfully, she started  a new blog  about books for the whole family to enjoy which I think you should all go to immediately as it delights, educates and inspires without making you feel bad about eating off plates you didn't throw on the potter's wheel in your back studio. \n\n So. I don't, as yet, have a list of craft blogs to suggest but I do get updates from  Crafty Daisy . Go there and poke around; they have links to some beautiful crafting sites down the page a bit on the left.  \n\n I get ideas from Family Fun magazine and  their website here . I get ideas from library books and a handful of others I purchased that focus on seasonal family celebration rituals:  Celebrating The Great Mother ;  Circle Round ,  Festivals Family and Food .  \n\n I get ideas from  this new craft magazine.  I get some ideas from the  Enki  curriculum. I often get ideas and practical guidelines from google searches after seeing something I liked or thought Fluffy might like and don't have a clue how to do.  \n\n I just ordered a few more books for OPERATION ART that I hope to devour, try with Fluffy and then post here:  Scribble Art ,  Mudworks ,  Encouraging the Artist in Your Child  although that last one may have to go back. What I can't take are the art books for kids that proclaim how natural art making is for kids! How they dive in with reckless and passionate abandon! Losing themselves in the process of experimentation! That is not my experience. My child stopped all coloring, scribbling, painting, drawing writing for two years. My child only recently has shown an interest in the basic materials of creative play. My child talks of the pressure he feels to 'do things perfectly' which is so great it can bring him to his knees. Literally. \n\n My focus lately is all about how to nurture Fluffy's creative confidence. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. I wonder if presenting projects is the right thing? or if I ought to just cover the back room in plastic and let Fluffy have at it with a case of glue, tape, and fifty pounds of glitter every morning for an hour? \n\n Yesterday we played with sand, colored sand. Fluffy and I made funnels out of card stock and then he poured and repoured into these little jars: \n\n \n\n More sand + glue: \n\n \n\n By far, the most exciting thing to him was making his own sandpaper, his own idea. He used HUGE amounts of tape and handfuls of sand that rained down and exploded through the air. Here's one example: \n\n \n\n Huh. Maybe OPERATING ART is working? I tell you, tape is clearly his medium. The weekly construction of sticky spider web contraptions he calls his Tape Perimeters are site installations. I may have a budding  Christo  on my hands. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://bookstogether.squarespace.com/", "http://craftydaisies.com/handmade-christmas/", "http://familyfun.go.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Celebrating-Great-Mother-Earth-Honoring-Activities/dp/0892815507", "http://www.circleround.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Festivals-Family-Food-Diana-Carey/dp/095070623X", "http://www.livingcrafts.com/", "http://www.enkieducation.org", "http://www.amazon.com/Scribble-Art-Independent-Experiences-Learning/dp/0935607056", "http://www.amazon.com/Mudworks-Creative-Modeling-Experiences-Learning/dp/0935607021", "http://www.amazon.com/Encouraging-Artist-Your-Child-Even/dp/0312033311", "http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/otr.shtml"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/12/kid-craft-sites.html", "title": "Kid Crafts"},

Great guider/apprentice moment as you need to work together to keep the deckle level. \n\n 6. Lay the deckle flat on a folded towel, wire side down. Lay a towel on top of the wet pulp and press, press, press. We pressed like a couple of lunatics.  \n\n \n\n 7. Take towel off, invert deckle and tap the wet sheet of paper onto a dry flat towel. Another great guider/apprentice opportunity; we tapped all different ways, together, hard, soft, alternately, to the beat of tunes, etc. etc. \n\n 8. Let dry.

{"date": "November 27, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n We made these lanterns over the weekend. Last year we made  these . Both were fun but this year's won out on speed and ease. \n\n 1. Tear up tissue paper.  \n\n 2. Slather mod podge (I'm sure any craft glue would do) on the outside of a glass jar (we used bell canning jars since we had them around). \n\n 3. Apply tissue paper. \n\n 4. Add handle (we used thin leather rope around the mouth of the jar and tied them with a few colorful beads). \n\n We bundled up and took a moon walk to the big cow field down the street. The moon was full, or nearly so. It peered out from behind wispy clouds and hovered inside the branches of a bare tree, glowing, round and mysterious--an unblinking eye in a misty dream.  \n\n I'm going to craft like crazy with Fluffy for the next month. I'm going for fun, simple, tactile, and pleasing to the eye. It does matter to Fluffy what the end result looks like. It just does. It also matters to him that what he makes is as good as what I make, in his eyes. This perfectionism saddens me because it interferes with his ability to sink in and explore in the world of art making, to feel a sense of excitement, accomplishment and pride at what he makes. It's such a bully. I seem to remember babysitting for truckloads of kids that would basically drool on a tissue, slap a sparkly sticker on top and beam for days. Fluffy looks over at what I'm doing and exhales in a defeated way.  Aw, mine doesn't look as good as yours. Mine's awful,  he'll say. \n\n So. I'm going to load us up with lots of quick, simple holiday projects that end up looking great and very much the same. Like these lamps.  \n\n That's beautiful, Fluffy, I said when he finished. He looked up at me, surprised and relieved, like he had been holding his breath the whole time.   Really, mom? Oh! Thank you for saying that!  \n\n I'm glad he felt good about it, but I want him to feel that way from the inside out.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/more-lanterns.html", "title": "More Lanterns"},
{"date": "November 30, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n The other morning I bolted awake before the sun in one of those, slap-yourself-in-the-head  DUH!  moments re: Fluffy and crafts: Make everything available to him in an obvious and orderly way!  This would not have been possible a mere six months ago as everything would have ended up in a heaving mass on the floor, held together with three roles of scotch tape, afloat in a pool of white glue.  \n\n But now--now! He is ready!  \n\n After circle, I announced that he was old enough to have all the craft supplies within his reach so he could create something whenever he wanted. \n\n He was elated! We spent the morning rearranging the project/lesson room, sorting through stickers, scissors, pens, glue, wool, googly eyes, pipe cleaners, feathers, and on and on, experimenting and tucking on shelves and in cabinets.  (I did keep some within my own purview, things like needles and bags dry plaster mix, fancy tubes of paint, etc. Ahem.) Fluffy was overcome with pride and inspiration and pulled out a letter making kit his Mama Mama had given him back in October, one that he barely glanced at having declared it 'wrong' and therefore not worth his time. \n\n While I sprawled on the floor surrounded by stacks and piles, Fluffy sat down and made this, entirely on his own. The art  and lettering may look like a 4 year old's but to me, it is Rembrandt. I nearly cried when he presented it to me, breathless and asking for an envelope and stamp so he could mail it off that minute. \n\n The cover: \n\n \n\n The message: \n\n \n\n It's a card for Mama Mama--a face of his own design on the outside and a note of his own creation on the inside. I shall translate: \n\n I love you Mama Mama. How are you doing? I wrote this letter by myself. I sounded out it by myself except for the first are.  \n\n Which was true. The first 'are' did come after a combination of sounding it out together and remembering 'are' is an outlaw word and doesn't follow the traditional rules of spelling.  \n\n Yesterday, we made felt ornaments following the directions in a beautiful family crafting magazine called,  Living Crafts . It's a lovely, simple and relatively quick project that we'll return to at least once more before the Christmas. \n\n What you'll need: \n\n 1. felting wool--we got ours from  here .   \n\n 2. liquid soap--we used dishwashing liquid and gobs of it as Fluffy was in charge of the dispensing. \n\n 3. cookie cutters, any shapes--we used the star and angel shapes below. \n\n 4. bowl \n\n 5. water \n\n 6. fingers for poking \n\n 7. needle or nail to make a string hole \n\n 8. string, ribbon, or yarn for hanging your finished product \n\n \nPlace your cookie cutter in a bowl. Place bits of wool inside your shape. Add soap. Add very warm water.  I'm afraid I didn't read the directions very carefully, as is my tendency, so you can learn from my mistakes and make sure the soap is added first and then the water, and that the water is, indeed, very warm. Poke the wool with fingertips. Poke poke poke. Continue poking. The fun here is that this sort of wool needs to be agitated in order for the felting process to happen. Fluffy loved that. This wool wants to be bothered!  \n\n After about 5 minutes, you'll notice your shape will begin to harden. Keep at it a bit more then take it out of the cookie cutter. It ought to hold its shape well at this point. If it doesn't, as ours didn't (see above re: my                                                               boo boo) don't despair! Just rinse, squeeze and push it back in its cutter shape and start the whole thing over, adding soap, then very warm water and poke poke poke. If it does, hurrah! Take it out and poke at the edges a bit more then rinse out soap and excess water and leave to dry flat. When dry, make a hole at the top. We broke out Fluffy's kid-size hammer and let him have a go at a nail. Thread through whatever you want to use to make a loop for hanging. \n\n \n\n \n\n This weekend: a simple handmade menorah in preparation for the first night of Hanukkah that will commence at sundown on Monday, a day early, so we can celebrate with family from out of town. \n\n L'chei-im! \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.livingcrafts.com/", "http://www.waldorfsupplies.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/art-epiphany-an.html", "title": "Art epiphany and felt ornaments"},
{"date": "January 06, 2008 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t What\u2019s this? Gee, It\u2019s looks sooooooo familiar...wait a minute--it\u2019s a blog. It\u2019s  my  blog!  \n\n Hello! Hello!  \n\n What? Oh, I don\u2019t  talk  into it? You mean, I  write  in it? Oh my.  \n\n Merry Christmas!  \n\n Wait, that\u2019s over.  \n\n Oh!  Happy New Year!  \n\n Oh dear, I\u2019ve missed that, too.  \n\n Er, well. We\u2019ve been on extended vacation here over at Fluffy Central and I must say, Fluffy wears it well. We\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow when we return to our homeschooling rhythms which includes much newness: new stories and circle songs, new classes to test out, new playroom helpers to train and hopefully a new part time teacher to add to the mix. But for now and for the last couple of weeks, he\u2019s been in wonderful form. I see how social he is with those he knows, how much he loves activity and having extended family around. I\u2019ve been peering into this window as if it were a crystal ball saying, this is your son\u2019s heart and soul, this is what lives along with the anxiety and fear. \n\n And I\u2019ve been sitting with my own bumpy feelings, my own grasping for ground, as  Pema Chodron  would say in her book,  When Things Fall Apart . I love her wisdom. I love that it comes in the center of a jumble that describes the human condition. I love that her mindfulness is about being with all the conflicting feelings and drives, to see them, to know them, to allow them, rather than to transcend as if being  beyond  it were the goal rather than just being  with it , whatever  it  is. \n\n It\u2019s been in rereading this book that I find myself closest to what I might describe as my faith, my religion, this kind of buddhism, this kind of practice of being in the world. As much as I love the message of The Secret, the law of attraction, the drawing in what you are willing to see and believe, I recognize that it doesn\u2019t allow for the darkness that does come and I need a way to allow for that. It may sound simplistic but there can\u2019t be light without darkness and to forge ahead, intent on seeing only that which glows in perfect resonance and calm is a kind of grasping too, a way of needing it to be a certain way in order to feel safe, to be okay.  \n\n I think it\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve been trying to say for the last few years about being the mother of a special needs child: it\u2019s neither a tragedy or a gift. There is some tragedy in the stories of those with special needs children and there are countless gifts. But what I\u2019ve asking for is a way into the conversation about parenting that includes all the wonder and frustration, delight and tedium, exaltation and desperation that any other parent goes through as we trudge along on this swirling ball, confronted by life and all her complexity and challenge. In other words, I\u2019ve been wanting to talk about it all and allow for it all, even embrace it all. There is no need to raise the flag on the Fight Against Autism but I don\u2019t necessarily want to march with the banner of hope either and not because I don\u2019t love the way it feels when I\u2019m hopeful or think that hope is a bad word. But because, as Pema says, \u201chope and fear is a feeling with two sides; as long as there\u2019s one, there\u2019s always the other.\u201d  \n\n Now. I\u2019m not here to stamp out hope--the word, the feeling, the need for it, anything like that. I\u2019m here to keep rereading Pema\u2019s book and those like it because in it, I find the place where I feel my most resilient and curious, joyful and open.  I know what it feels like to be scared out of my mind about my son\u2019s future; I know what it feel like to be tense, worried, to think that what is going on ISN\u2019T OKAY, to want it to be different so that I can feel better, calmer, more sure about what I\u2019m doing. I know what it's like to be hopeful, to feel good about what\u2019s going on, to feel confident and calm, sure that I\u2019m on the right track. One is good. The other is bad.  \n\n But is it? \n\n Wanting to avoid the bad and hold onto the good is what doesn\u2019t work for me. The situation is always changing anyway. It\u2019s like walking along on a path, staring down at the ground alternately confident or insecure depending on what I see and what I think it all means. Staying with whatever is happening and being willing to breath it in, learn what it tells me about me--that's what does work. \n\n And that\u2019s where I am these days. On this 6th day of January in this new year, 2008, a big fat juicy number, unfathomable to me when I was a teenager and Star Wars had just come out. 2008. How can it be? \n\n Oh, that reminds me--the epiphany! I haven\u2019t missed that! \n\n So, Happy Epiphany to all! May yours reveal aspects of yourself in new and glorious light. May you look upon those places with tenderness and renewed strength that comes from arms wide enough to hold things that are unwieldy, conflicting, and incomplete. May this year bring you closer to whereever you are in each moment.

I have much to say and many pics to post, including one of the menorah Fluffy made that we are using each night as we light our Hanukkah candles. But it will have to wait.  \n\n In the meantime, I bring you gift wrapping paper!  \n\n I got the idea from  D.I.Y. Kids , a wonderful compilation of projects to do with kids of all ages. Most of them are way out of our league right now and quite a few may never appeal as Fluffy has little to no interest in sewing skirts and making dolls but I decided to do this as part of my overall OPERATION ART approach to bolstering Fluffy's confidence and enthusiasm for creative exploration. \n\n \nHere's what you do:  \n\n 1. Scan in your child's art at your husband's desk. \n2. Get your husband to email the files to you. \n3. Get your husband to load photoshop onto your computer. \n4. Open photoshop and begin manipulating files and art. \n5. Stand on chair and screech until your husband comes racing in to put out the fire. \n6. Promise all manner of sexual favors in exchange for a photoshop tutorial. \n7. Space out during tutorial; retain only sketchy sense of what to do once he leaves. \n8. Limp along for ages, clicking and swearing until somehow you achieve passable results. \n\n Fluffy's signature rockets \n\n \n\n Fluffy's rendition of Woodstock from the Peanuts strip \n\n \n\n \nI added the color in photoshop.

Ages ago, I had a dance teacher who would lead the class in this warm up: Lift arms high, look to fingertips, reach and reach and then let torso and head fall, sweep arms along the ground and then swing back up. Again and again. As she led us, she would rhythmically chant, \"Let it GO Let it GO Let it GO Let it GO\u201d emphasis on the downswing as we collapsed our upper bodies.  \n\n That\u2019s the little chant in my head lately: Let it GO.  \n\n Tonight: I threw Fluffy\u2019s costume together and brainstormed a last minute one for myself: skeleton. Well, it actually was a no-brainer. Toss on a black top, black pants, masking tape and a bit of makeup.  \n\n \n\n \nWe jumped in the car and headed for a neighborhood near the Y that seemed like it might be perfect as the cows in our neighboring field are clueless about candy--they\u2019re all, have some grass! Throw it up in your mouth and have it again! \n\n We hit on the hot street, everyone was there. Some of the houses did it up with smoke machines and strobe lights and some fantastic carvings. Fluffy took the whole thing very seriously, uttering  Trick or Treat  in his sotto, stirring the bowls, looking for a novel candy type, checking and rechecking his bag to make sure there were no worm holes, no possible line of escape for the confections that sat inside. \n\n On our way home, the clouds looked like ancient writing sliding sideways along the horizon, gray blue and mysterious.  \n\n Day 1 of my cleanse was, frankly, hell. I was hungry all day. But I made it. Six 10 ounce glasses of that kooky lemonade mixture, 12 ounces of warm water and salt, and two steamy cups of smooth move tea. Makes your mouth water, eh? \n\n I\u2019m doing it for the cleanse. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some weight loss along the way but after 10 days, it\u2019s back to me loose in the kitchen and, unless I make some permanent changes, well, all that weight will dive back on like Beegu on a string of light bulbs. I want to clear out the system, press the giant reset button. All that stuff in there. Let it go. \n\n Tomorrow: Day 1 of  NaNoWriMo . Last year I made it about halfway.

Charlie Brown!  Dave answered in his best cartoon voice and the young girl close by shot her head up expectantly and then regarded Dave with some alarm.  Charlie Brown! This is a big day for me!  Fluffy went on, breathless.  Not only did I just make my OWN jump rope but I\u2019m jumping rope WITH IT for the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!  \n\n Some things that are happening for the first time in my life: \n\n Fluffy routinely goes to sleep after cuddling with Dave, whether I\u2019m home or not. It\u2019s remarkable and even more so because I\u2019m so blas\u00e9 about it. Okay, goodnight sweetheart, I\u2019ll say with kisses and hugs and then putter about, la la la, as if this has been the routine for years and not something nearly seven years in the making. Huge.  \n\n Fluffy and I made paper. \n\n Dave and I dropped Fluffy off at my dad\u2019s house and then sailed off to see my nephew, Jake, in his high school production of Tom Jones. This was the first time Dave and I have been able to see my nephew in one of his many stage appearances at the  same time , you know, sitting side by side. \n\n We all went to the Boston Science Museum and got caught in the circle of hell on the way home. Bumper. To. Bumper. For hours and hours. Fluffy and I both stayed calm. We made it home late but without drama. \n\n We stayed overnight at my dad\u2019s, a first since giving birth to Fluffy and something Dave and I haven\u2019t done in ten years. \n\n We spent the holiday at my sister\u2019s. Now, that\u2019s happened before and it was as joyful then as it was this year but this time my son and I were our most relaxed and independent. We went here and there (both, separately), chatting (both, together and separately), fixing food (me), hanging in the basement with the teenagers playing video games (him), eating (both), going to the bathroom (both, separately!), chasing the dog (him), hunting the cat (him), watching a bit of football and the Thanksgiving Day Parade (both), sneaking extra whipped cream (both!). It was delightfully ordinary.  \n\n At one point, Fluffy was spinning and spinning in the kitchen, wildly round and round. I gamely suggested he punctuate it all with a big frog hop or stomp or somersault, some proprioceptive activity to ground the vestibular activation. I was coaching in the way that I do, as if what I was suggesting was intensely tantalizing like eating a chocolate pop. Fluffy ignored me and I looked up to see my sister staring in a friendly way . It\u2019s Thanksgiving , she said with a smile, you know? And I knew what she meant:You can take the day off. Let it all be. \n\n And she was right. Because it all be just fine.  \n\n Today we went for a family hike up a nearby mountain. It was a steep climb, hard work to keep perpendicular to the ground; I don\u2019t know how those trees manage at that angle. We started in full winter gear and ended practically in our underwear with everything else tied around our waists. It was invigorating for all, especially Beegu, who exhibited ibex-like agility--further grounds for calling her our goat dog, our mountain billy goat dog now.  \n\n We all loved being outside, breathing in deeply, tromping across mud and ice and a sea of dried leaves, exerting ourselves, accomplishing a goal, clear and measurable. I thought, this is how I want to feel more of the time. I want to climb a mountain every day. And then I thought, that\u2019s what Fluffy does; he climbs a mountain every day though we don't always acknowledge the view.  \n\n So then, that\u2019s what I\u2019m after--a way for us to both really  see  the view. \n\n Firsts happen every day in our house. I bet they do in yours, too. \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/together-and-se.html", "title": "together and separately"},

My new naturapath went over the test results with me not thirty minutes ago.  \n\n She'll be perscribing herbs to boost my own adrenal production and cinnamon for some other thing I must boost and two teaspoons a day of an herb that tastes just like sugar--yummy--an immune booster that even the kids would love. Come to think of it, I'll be giving a bit to Fluffy as we move into the winter months. It's entirely safe, delicious, and powerfully effective protection from the various bugs and viruses lurking about. \n\n I'm on day 6 of NaNoWriMo and day 7 of the fast. It might be time to let go of both of them. I'll hold off a bit more on the writing but this business of not EATING????? I'm not a fan. I've done it, drunk my 16 ounces of warm water and salt (blech), smooth move tea morning and night and six glasses of lemon, water, maple syrup and cayenne pepper every day since Halloween and wow, all I can say is, we are some lucky duckies to get to eat food.  \n\n Have you really looked at food lately, REALLY looked at it? The colors and shapes and sizes? the aromas and textures? the steaming frying saut\u00e9ing braising basting baking blended candied lusciousness of it all? A pomegrante, do I even have to say more? The garnets glistening beneath opaque shelter, crying out to be plucked? The beautiful simplicity of a pear, the delectible crispness of a fresh garden vegetables, the nearly diabolical allure of cheese in all its forms? I'm on my way to taste them all again. The bounty! \n\n In Fluffy news, I had the talk with the OT today and we did not see eye to eye. I'm the kind of person who speaks my mind and then speaks it again and speaks it once more when I don't feel heard. No. That's not entirely it. I fall into repetition when I don't feel AGREED with. I find not being agreed with challenging. Especially when it concerns my son and hs care. \n\n The OT was open to 'working together' on Fluffy's challenges but what I'd want to brainstorm is a way to change her personality. I asked to switch to one of the other two therapists there. I am waiting to hear back. In the meantime, we are on two other waiting lists. I must believe there is someone wonderful out there, someone who  gets  my son, someone who sees  him , someone who knows behavior is not personality, that it's communication and that it's the therapist's job to stay open, to keep looking for the way in, build trust, be respectfully and dare I say, always work from a place of love. \n\n We're hungry for that.

{"date": "November 02, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Day three is almost over--seven to go. Wow. These first few days have been hard. Detoxing. It started in my body and it's seeping in, or should I say, OUT of my mind. I've been so emotional today. \n\n It started with the OT whom I'm afraid I may have to dismiss. She has always struck me as a bit tense but I figured it was her style, the tense super and FIT FIT FIT type A style that I see in some OTs that I've met. And so I figure, okay, well, she's dotting her i's which is good when it comes to what Fluffy's body needs and how she's been able to guide me in meeting some of those needs at home. But she's not gifted in the realm of personal relationship. And RDI is all about the relationship, not the task but what's going on  between  the two people who are doing whatever they're doing together.  \n\n It's a tricky line to walk; I know she has activities to get to in a certain amount of time but she's striking me as a bit intolerant lately and, frankly after today, almost clueless about what Asperger's mixed with sensory processing disorder IS. \n\n We're seeing her twice a week right now. Dave brought Fluffy on Tuesday and I guess there were some difficulties that resulted in Fluffy fleeing the room a couple of times (why Dave didn't tell me is another story) and other instances that ended with Fluffy saying angrily that she was mean! mean! and not at all like his parents. Dave told me today that during that session she was short with him, grabbing things back from his hands that he had grabbed from hers, being imperative and short in her tone. \n\n Apparently, one of the things she was concerned about was that Fluffy had something he wanted to say at the beginning of the session and  she  wanted to get started and he wouldn't let it go and so she just started the warm-ups and he became furious, saying she didn't care about him, about what he wanted to say. She said, it was like he couldn't  help  himself, he just was  compelled  to say what he wanted to say! looking at me in a surprised sort of way and I thought to myself, Yes, and?  \n\n She said some other things about him controlling his body, saying almost in an exasperated and concerned voice that he was so very impulsive! And again, I was thinking, what the hell is up with you, lady, you don't know that kids on the spectrum, six year olds on the spectrum with Aspergers and sensory processing issues can be like this? You're the professional here. You're the one with training and experience and expertise. That's what I'm paying you to do, help my son with his particular neurological and sensory challenges! \n\n She began our appointment 15 minutes late and as she went in with Fluffy, she allowed that she'd leave time for us to talk at the end, giving her about 30 minutes with him. But, I said, pointing to the clock, you're starting 15 minutes late. Don't we pay you for the hour? She said nothing. If we talk for 15 minutes at the end, I said, that ought to give you the full 45 minutes with him. She hesitated and I wondered later, after our talk, if she hadn't  wanted  the whole time with him.  \n\n I don't like it. I don't. I have been working my fucking butt off doing my best to provide for my son while providing for myself, looking for help, not just adequate help but fantastic help, passionate, committed gifted people to help, help me, help my son, help bring him into the world, help bring  me  into the world. I'm done with the isolation. I'm done with struggle. I'm up for hard work--don't get me wrong, my shirt sleeves have been in the perpetual roll up my arms for years now--but I've been putting out my prayers, my visions, my calls from the depths of my very soul for a long long while now and I am at the end of my rope. \n\n She doesn't *get* my son. She isn't working from a heart space. Now, I know Fluffy can be a handful at times, I know the talking  at  and the incessant negotiating and the high resistance to following a plan and the sometime allergy to doing what is asked of him and the general bent of non-compliance can wear a person down but not in a 45 minute session twice a week. Please. Dig down, lady. Dig down. \n\n And if you can't dig down then we'll take our checkbook and move on.  \n\n I don't know if it's the cleanse that is riling me up so? But I tell you, I'm breaking OUT. I'm getting rid of blockage and toxins and doubt that paralyzes and people who talk from behind fat-free, folded arms and I'm out in my boat, trolling for juicy wide open beautiful hearts pulsing with joy, curiosity and creativity, and the strength of one thousand bulls.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/the-cleanse.html", "title": "The Cleanse"},

I got so upset with myself, furious actually. I kept saying, OH! I'm so mad at myself, Fluffy! I missed the exit! I made a big mistake and now we're going to be even later! I could NOT let it go. Fluffy calmly said,  Oh, Mommy, being late is no big deal. Why don't you think positively like you are always telling me to do? Why don't you secretize, Mom? It will be okay. We're not going to miss this playdate for the world. \n\n It took a while but I did manage to calm down and secretize. We arrived almost 40 minutes late. As we got our hands stamped with butterflies, the woman at the counter said, Are you meeting people here? Yes, I answered. Well, they just got here about 5 minutes ago. \n\n In the pavilion, hundreds of butterflies fluttered and swooped, hung upside down and drank sugar water off bright green sponges with their feet, miniature quails scurried about, a turtle meandered slowly across the path, birds chirped, and plump goldfish the size of watermelons lazily swam figure eights.  \n\n It was dreamy and warm, just my kind of pavilion. \n\n Fluffy and I will be back to see the butterflies this winter. And we all plan to meet again in two weeks.  \n\n Thanksgiving's starting a little early this year. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/homeschoolers-d.html", "title": "Homeschoolers' date "},
{"date": "November 11, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy, with his beloved perimeter made with a roll of scotch tape; October, 2007. \n\n \nI\u2019ve been through a few things in this life and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that feeling bad feels bad, feeling lonely is a lonely way to feel, and hard times are hard on a gal. \n\n It may not look so brilliant in black and white but upon reflection, I think you\u2019ll see the wisdom in it. One can go on about lessons learned and insights gained, but when you feel bad, it feels bad. When you feel misunderstood, when you misunderstand someone else, when something said in good intention cuts through to an old and unresolved ache and the floodgates open and you stand up to your armpits in painful feelings, it feels, well, painful.  \n\n And bad. \n\n I don\u2019t want there to be a cost. I want things to come without tags. I wanted to get to a place with Fluffy where he didn\u2019t have to be aware of his own vast bafflement in the face of social interaction. I wanted to skip the part when he begins to feel bad about himself, about his differences. We\u2019ve had two playdates with the boy of whom Fluffy said he\u2019d been waiting his whole life and they\u2019ve been strained. The first ended badly, the second was punctuated with Fluffy screaming loudly in his friend\u2019s face, shaking items close to his nose. He doesn\u2019t know how to play with the other guy. He doesn\u2019t know how to let him have his own ideas. He doesn\u2019t know how, if you\u2019ll forgive the techno-speak, to be in a dynamic interaction with another kid.  \n\n I see him in gymnastics class now in its sixth week and instead of him finding his way, becoming more comfortable and at ease in the group, seeing himself as part OF the group, his disorganized behavior has increased, he appears more and more  ill  at ease. He yells and lunges at the kids; he climbs on off-limit areas of the gym; he is asked to take breaks outside of the room several times each quarter hour, and when he returns, he collapses on the mat and cries out,  Nobody likes me! Nobody wants me here!  This is a class of six other special needs kids, all of whom follow along and abide, and one wonderfully clear and flexible teacher with her two assistants. There is support there and structure and consistency. And it appears to be too much. \n\n I do see progress. Fluffy used to instantly hit, push, bite, and spit when he got frustrated or upset. Now he screams, yells and throws things around. It is an improvement. I believe he will be able to access his wellspring of words one day and tell us what he needs, wants and feels. Lord knows he\u2019s able to do that beautifully when he is calm, when he is regulated. We\u2019ll get there. Practice. Practice is what he needs and not just with us, with other kids, with other kids who will hang in there with him. \n\n But this is another place where I feel bad: Where are those kids? And where are the other players on Team Fluffy?  \n\n I feel like a utter and complete failure, incredibly inadequate at finding appropriate and reliable resources for me, for Fluffy, for our family. I do not want to do this alone but I keep looking around for the other hands and the air is empty. I do not want to be the martyr, the super star homeschooling mom who does it all for her son but has nothing left for herself, for her own creative life, personal expression and plain old fun and games. I desperately miss my pre-mother self, strutting down the street in my chunky-heeled boots, kickin\u2019 it up, chortling with a friend. Where is my tribe? It\u2019s been years since I felt that connection. I\u2019m acutely sad, sandpapering and dry, like the bottom of the sandbox where the scratchy handfuls stick in the corners.  \n\n I know we\u2019ve only been here two months. I know it takes time. I wish I had more patience. I wish my own internal need for social interaction had been reset when we moved but it wasn\u2019t. I am operating on a deficit of the last three years, a false floor, if you will. I press my feet into the ground when the load is heavy and I feel the board immediately give under my weight.  \n\n I rail against the black and white thinking in the larger world out there and in the smaller world in my mind. When I talk about my depletion and frustration to my husband, he says, put Fluffy in school. But why ought it be homeschooling alone or frolic in my overflowing bowls of free time if Fluffy\u2019s in school? What about the big fat juicy in between? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been after since we moved here and it hasn\u2019t happened yet and today, I feel exhausted and inept.  \n\n It feels bad to feel bad. It\u2019s lonely to feel lonely. It\u2019s hard to go through the hard time. My mind takes a problem like a thief takes a lock in his hands, agile, confident, flexible. I roll it around and around, believing there\u2019s a way in, around, through. But where is it? What is blocking me?  \n\n My life has felt intense but small for too long. I cannot imagine it without my son, without our connection, I cannot think of anything more important than honoring his needs other than honoring my own. But man, I need that fucking lock to click, open up and let us into a whole new place.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/ive-been-throug.html", "title": "Picking the lock"},
{"date": "November 16, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n No, silly! That's our same old wonder guy: June, 2007. \n\n \nWe switched  HANDLE  facilitators this week. The folks at the main office in Seattle have been phenomenal, understanding and supportive, making the transition smooth and stress-free. Our decision is based solely on distance: we are too far from the New Jersey facility to have regular check-ins with  Judith Bluestone , the brilliant woman who came up with this teaching and healing method and the practitioner we were lucky to work with in our first two appointments. That\u2019s what we need right now, monthly feedback and fine-tuning with someone closer to home.  \n\n E., Our new gal is about an hour away. Fluffy and I saw her earlier this week. So now I\u2019ve seen two professionals trained the HANDLE way and may I say that it\u2019s remarkable what they teach these people to do while they\u2019re working with you: NOTHING. That\u2019s it. Nothing else. Just work with you, be present with you and your child. There is no rushing, no tense preoccupation with agenda, no looking at watches or glancing up from folders because they are already  seeing . \n\n I was given excellent coaching on the exercises we\u2019ve been doing at home. I was given some new ones. But the most important thing I was given was a reminder to slow down and tune in to my own self while performing these simple movements. It was an eye-opener. On the sheet next to one of the new exercises, E writes to do it until I feel a \u201crelease\u201d. On another, she writes, \u201cremember to breath and feel energy release\u201d, not only in my son but in myself. \n\n I realized that I\u2019d been doing the exercises more in order to check them off the list, more so that I could say I\u2019d done them rather than as an opportunity to do them in those moments and NOTHING ELSE. I\u2019d been forgetting the other side of the equation in the Fluffy/me interchange. Me. What can I expect from Fluffy and his frazzled little nervous system if I\u2019m buzz-snapping his fingers with the mindfulness of a harried short order cook washing the string beans?  \n\n The main tenet of HANDLE (HANDLE is an acronym for Holistic Approach to NeuroDevelopment and Learning Efficiency) is Gentle Enhancement, a process of gradually strengthening the neurological systems without producing stress.

{"date": "November 12, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I think I must follow the last post with something lighter, something that better reflects the larger picture which is that Fluffy is doing remarkable things and we, as a family, are making great strides and I, as gal, am feeling my way around in the dark and that's okay because that's all any of us are doing here, when you think of it.  \n\n It's not a bad place to feel around, as places go, this life, this crazy life.  \n\n I was just on the phone with a friend, talking about updating our visions, and I looked up to see Fluffy in the glow of the nightlight, clutching his pillow, calling out,  Mommy?  He's only done this a handful of times, gotten up on his own in the night to find his way to the bathroom. I helped him there and settled him back in bed, confused by the flat landscape of the mattress. Where were all his pillows? As I turned to make my way back to the living room I found them, the pillows, dotting the carpet from his bed to the place where he called me, a soft trail through the darkness like something out of a fairy tale. \n\n Earlier today as I was editing some video footage to send our RDI consultant, Fluffy came in and said,  Is that on the internet so everyone can see?  No, it's only on my computer right now.  But do you have a place on the internet where you put things that everyone can see and is that place called this mom?  Yes! I do, I said, trying to remember when I told him about it.  And do they know that you're a real mom?  he asked. Oh yes, they do. \n\n Real moms feel lonely. Not all of us and not all the time but it's true. I used to judge loneliness. I used to think someone must be doing something wrong or not enough if they felt lonely. I must have thought there was some shame in loneliness, that it reflected something weak and unrealized about one's basic character. But I don't think those things anymore.  \n\n I'm an optimist at heart. I'm down for the count, wildly thrashing around and then the bell rings and I'm up and scribbling again, hair in knots, glasses akimbo, snot tissues strewn about my feet but no matter! Hello! What's that? Yes, why come on in! Let's go! \n\n I need the in-person tribe. I believe they are riding toward me as I type. But you know what? You are my tribe. I mean it. Say what you will about the internet, the place where you put things that everyone can see. I feel connected, supported, and inspired by the people I've met here, by you all. You've all been a big part of my journey. As I said to one internet friend in an email earlier... \n\n I hate to think of any of us feeling isolated, alone; I hate to think of the mothers of our wonderful kids enduring anything other than love love and more love and then tremendous and shining piles of support and services and a continuous flow of brilliant gifted people streaming through our doors to work with our kids, our families, and us. I wish for us ease and community, comraderie, inspiration, bounty, fun, goofy pee-in-your-pants times out with girlfriends clutching wine glasses or steaming cups of tea, shouting boustrously, throwing cans of paint at wall-sized canvases, CREATING, breathing deeply, feeling flushed and satisfied by  round after round of athletic expressions of freedom. \n \n\n But when we are finding our way in the dark, feeling isolated and alone, we need soft places to rest, like Fluffy's pillow trail. \n\n  I leave you with a little window into our movement circle this morning. Dear Fluffy is clearly embracing his role as part of  this  group. \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/11/pillow-trails.html", "title": "Pillow Trails "},
{"date": "December 14, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy and his tape perimeter; October, 2007. \n\n \nI\u2019ve been thinking about fear, in light of NYU\u2019s  Ransom Notes  Campaign, and the corrupt way it drives action.  \n  \nWhen I discovered that my son, Fluffy, had autism, my own fear was great. When I started blogging three years ago, I said I wanted people to come into our lives, climb inside my son\u2019s world and softly whisper,  grow . I asked them to play and challenge and stretch so that his diagnosis would one day fall off him like a coat that no longer fits. \n  \nI don\u2019t say that anymore. I don\u2019t need the Asperger\u2019s to fall off him like a coat that no longer fits. What I want is for him to feel comfortable in his own skin. What goes on his skin will one day be his business. I hope that he\u2019ll be able to take care of that easily and appropriately long before he is off on his own. \n\n My fear was and sometimes still is about my own ability to teach and educate, in other words, to parent my child in the way he deserves, which is no different than what every other child deserves. And what is that? Ideally? Many many things but in some ways you could say it is the loving, appropriate, and gradual withdrawal of support from a time when the child is completely dependent to a time when they are completely independent--a slow transfer of responsibility from the parent to the child. \n\n Not every parent has this job. There are many children who will never be able to live a life of complete independence. And maybe we, as a society, place too high a value on that, complete independence, as if anything less is dishonorable, shameful, or sad.  \n\n My fear came from needing to parent my child, this real child, in a way that worked. In order to know it was working, I needed to see progress. Now, my way, though full of enthusiasm and great desire, wasn\u2019t working, wasn\u2019t providing the right stimulation for my son\u2019s brain. Enter RDI and things started to cook. I was feeling calmer; Fluffy was progressing. Results! But the need to see progress had to be balanced with authentic celebration and acceptance of my darling child. I believe that process goes on in every conscious parent\u2019s head and heart. We love our children just as they are. And we want more for them. \n\n I\u2019ve been looking for playroom help these last many weeks, people, as I said at the start of this journey, to come into my son\u2019s life and softly whisper grow. I hired someone who was overflowing with enthusiasm and great desire in the interview.  \n\n The day before she came, Fluffy had constructed one of his tape perimeters.  \n\n Fluffy loves his tape perimeters--his phrase for his creations. He methodically unravels a roll of scotch tape, sticks it to walls and doors and countertops, intertwines and crosses, zig-zags and winds until the room is saturated with an intricate and sticky spider web pattern. I\u2019ve heard him tell people he uses them to control the house. I\u2019ve also heard him say they protect the house--they keep out intruders. Their construction is very deliberate, staked out according to a specific plan in his mind. They mean the world to him.  \n\n We aren\u2019t allowed to touch them or dismantle them or interfere with them in any way. They make moving through the house ridiculous and impossible and after the first few times the perimeter went up, we devised some guidelines. The guidelines are working beautifully: tape perimeters may go up no more than once a week, on the weekends, only in his room, and must be modified at bedtime so that the achy old people in the house can enter and exit without getting on their knees.  \n\n La la. \n\n The new playroom helper arrived. BOOM. She went right for the perimeter. She found out it was important to him, that he had his own rules about it and got it in her head that progress was about extinguishing the perimeter. That was her goal, one she devised on the spot without any input from us. She was there to MAKE SOME PROGRESS. Here\u2019s an excerpt: \n\n PH (playroom helper): What\u2019s this? \n\n Fluffy: My tape perimeter. It-- \n\n PH: Cool! \n\n Fluffy: Yes. It\u2019s my tape perimeter. I put it up-- \n\n PH: Can I touch it? \n\n Fluffy: No. \n\n PH: Why not? \n\n Fluffy: Because it\u2019s mine. I--I--I constructed it and I-- \n\n PH: Can we hang things on it? Like art? Like things you draw?  \n\n Fluffy: No! \n\n PH: But look! It\u2019s sticky! You could hang things on it! You might like it! \n\n Fluffy: I--I--I--I don\u2019t want to do that. \n\n PH: But why not? You might like it? How can you know you don\u2019t like it if you haven\u2019t even tried it? You have to try new foods to know you like them, right? Right? So, why not try this? You might like it! \n\n Fluffy: I DON\u2019T WANT TO DO THAT. \n\n PH: Can I touch it? \n \n\n NO! I wanted to scream. MY GOD! SHUT UP! This, moments after she came in, before establishing any relationship, any trust, any sense of him of who he is.  \n\n She won\u2019t be returning. \n\n In my view, this sort of interaction comes from fear, fear or insensitivity which comes from fear too. Anything that isn\u2019t coming from love is coming from fear. What if she had gotten Fluffy to let her touch it? It would have come from WINNING! She got him to do it! Now, doesn\u2019t that feel good?  \n\n No. It doesn\u2019t.  \n\n Listen, I want Fluffy to become more flexible, to let go, to try new things, even scary things. But there is a huge difference between wrestling something from someone and inviting them to share. The two things can look very similar but they are world\u2019s apart. \n\n And this is my issue with the Ransom Notes Campaign. They say they want to promote awareness but their actions and words comes from fear. And violence. Hostage taking is a violence. They are coming at human interaction from a siege mentality, literally, your child is under siege: what are your choices? Adopt a battle mentality, negotiate from a position of weakness, strategize, coerce, deceive, delude, attack? There is a divide. Lines are drawn. Sides are taken. It's more  them  versus  us . \n\n What if we were all on the same side? What if we believed in the opposite of fear? Only love? The desire to see, understand, connect, and draw out the child\u2019s potential while staying awake to that which makes them extraordinary?  \n\n What if we left perimeters up? Until they transformed or until we, the seer, underwent our own transformation of perception? What if we let them fracture our view of the world so new ways of creating and recreating were possible?  \n\n \n\n \nPlease add your name to the  petition  to urge NYU to come to their senses.  \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aboutourkids.org/about_us/public_awareness", "http://www.petitiononline.com/ransom/petition.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/12/tape-perimeters.html", "title": "Tape Perimeters, or, Fear and Alternate Views of the Universe"},

{"date": "October 24, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy has a hard time writing. We\u2019re working on it slowly, using a combination of  Handwriting Without Tears  and the  Enki curriculum  which, so far in our first math block, used stories, games, and movement songs and verse to explore the relationships between numbers.  \n\n The stories are fairy tales, each spotlighting a particular number. We follow the three-fold learning process: introduce new material, allow it to sleep or rest overnight, and then recall and deepen the material the next day or two. \n\n So, I\u2019ll read a story to Fluffy during our storytime and then put it aside. The next day, we recall the story together. I\u2019ll say something like , What was the story we read yesterday?  Either he will start or I will, and little by little, we retell the story. I try to let him do as much as he can on his own; I\u2019m there as mostly the guide, to redirect if he remembers things out of sequence by saying things like,  Yes, that did happen but that\u2019s later in the story  and bring him back to where he left off. Fluffy may jump ahead to the more exciting parts or to the conclusion, especially if what happens in the middle is a bit scary but I\u2019m always surprised by how much better he is at remembering the details than I am after only one reading. I have to re-read it at least once to retain as much as he does in one hearing. \n\n After we\u2019ve recalled the story for each number, I bring out our \u2018good\u2019 notebooks and \u2018good\u2019 crayons and lead him in drawing the number. I have him do what I do, for example, our number 2 story involved a shell with a magic pebble inside that was given by the good fish to the girl and boy who had been trapped in a cage under water by the sea witch. I started my crayon at the top of the page and drew the rounded shape of the shell curving down to the bottom of the page and then across horizontally while saying,  the magic shell curved round and down to the flat bottom of the cage . Fluffy followed me and then realized that he had drawn a 2. !!  \n\n \n\n \nNext month is our first Language Arts block. We\u2019ll be reading more fairy tales. The led drawing will be a bit richer with more detail; the drawing is meant to reveal the \u2018hidden\u2019 letter, something that the child may not even notice right away. I\u2019m a bit unsure about how this will go. So far, our drawing together is very rudimentary, straight and curved lines, number shapes, dots, and simple geometric forms for each number. I need a way to create the hidden letter drawing together than will build in Fluffy\u2019s burgeoning sense of success, a way to create the surprise without adding anxiety, his or mine.  \n\n I wanted Fluffy to be able to record his thoughts. I know he will get the the writing down but I decided to try a typing program to give him more choice, to capitalize on his lightening fast fingers on the keyboard. And I\u2019m so glad I did.  \n\n We\u2019re using  Read, Write & Type Learning System  and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough. I actually worked with the people who created it when we were out in California. It was the best  job  job I ever had. The people are phenomenal and the program really works. I, by the way, receive no kickbacks from purchases so you can take me at my word here. \n\n In fact, even though I loved the program when I first learned about it, I was surprised by how affective it was as I watched Fluffy move through it. Fluffy reads like a champ but I noticed he didn\u2019t really hear words, the individual sounds of the words, and so it was nearly impossible for him to try and write, invented spelling or not. This program helped him listen to the letter sounds and he\u2019s actually typing! Touch typing! And paying attention to language in a new way. \n\n It\u2019s set up as a game. The letters are all characters who live in the keyboard, divided into Fadasa\u2019s house (on the left) and Jack\u2019s house (on the right). There are two helper hands on the bottom of the screen, Lefty LaDee on the left and Rightway McKay on the right. Vexor, the evil virus, hates stories. He\u2019s flown to the storytellers village and stolen all the storytellers\u2019 sounds so no one can tell or write any stories. Fluffy\u2019s job was to play games with Vexor to try and win back the storyletter sounds, one by one and the hands help. \n\n Fluffy loved it! He loved the story, he delighted in discovering each storyteller and their special signature. He loved beating Vexor and he was incredibly proud of his success. I watched his fingers get stronger and stronger and was floored at his tenacity. He made mistake after mistake but he kept at it until he typed the word perfectly. This is huge for him, this pushing on when things get tough. And it didn\u2019t translate into needing every turn to be perfect.  \n\n I have some video footage of him playing that I have to figure out how to add here so you can see it in action. It really was something to see.  \n\n Fluffy finished the program, won all 40 of the sounds back but I want to keep at it, schedule in regular practice sessions. I want to go at this expression from all sides. I want Fluffy to feel at ease with a pencil but he may always feel better at the computer. I want him to have the choice. The pencil or the keyboard, either\u2019s okay with me as long as he writes down what\u2019s on his Fluffy mind.  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hwtears.com/", "http://enkieducation.org", "http://www.readwritetype.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/read-write-type.html", "title": "Read, Write & Type, Enki, and more"},
{"date": "October 21, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy, flying in his bodysox; October, 2007. \n\n \nFluffy was sick all week. He still coughs like he\u2019s got the black lung, but I gotta say, he was the least dysregulated during a sickness than I\u2019ve ever seen him. We kept to the basic shape of our rhythms though very laid back, mon, more like da island rhythms, we stay in da pjs all day, eatin\u2019 da banana under da coconut tree. Well, today we really  could  have with that baffled sun out there, all fired up like summer.  \n\n I think the rhythms are really supporting him. I know they\u2019re supporting me. For the first time ever, I know how to move through our day with some sense of how to adequately direct my son and that complicated brain of his, to stimulate the cognitive and nourish the sensory-motor. We are still missing community. Right now it\u2019s pretty much still the Fluffy and Me Show. But I trust that will come. \n\n This idea of rhythms, of creating a balance among the contracted, the expansive, and the breathe in between is, oddly, new to me. I never was able to get Fluffy on to any such thing as a schedule and my own life felt a little like chasing a marble down a sloping seaside hill since I gave birth, so this feeling of having a tiny bit of a handle on things is very, very satisfying. And you know what\u2019s helping the most? Singing through transitions. \n\n I wrote about this last year. We did get off to a good start but I didn\u2019t have staying power. I sang. I tried to do it like Kyra would do it but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was putting on a persona, the Enki homeschooling mom persona. This year, it\u2019s all me. I don\u2019t know what the difference is other than a belief in what I\u2019m doing and the willingness to keep doing it you see because for me, beginnings are easy, exciting, invigorating; it\u2019s the sticking with it, making it a habit, where I falter. \n\n So, last month, I picked about 10 songs: getting dressed song, brushing teeth song, cleaning up song, breakfast blessing song, morning story song, movement circle song, going out song, etc., and sang them as I moved Fluffy to and through the activity.  Fluffy resisted at first. I\u2019d hold out my hand and walk him where we were going next, the bathroom to wash hands, the bedroom to get dressed, to the vestibule for his shoes to go outside, sometimes I\u2019d even pick him up and carry him, staying calm, continuing to sing. Sometimes I\u2019d forget and say something like,  Okay, honey, let\u2019s clean this up , or,  Time to go! Come one, Fluffy, let\u2019s get a move on!  but I noticed that Fluffy almost never responded to my words and he almost always responded when I sang. In a couple weeks, I would begin to sing and he'd come along with a dreamy look on his face as if in a trance.  \n\n I\u2019ve heard that music accesses a different part of the brain and I can see it. It\u2019s as if his  body  walks his  brain  to the table or to the pjs on the bed. It seems to access a different place for me too since I stay out of the land of debate and repetition which was always dicy and instead, focus on the moments that occur as we are moving to the next thing. \n\n I can't recommend this enough. Pick one transition in the day, any one, sing a song you know and love as you move your child to that thing--getting dressed, washing hands, getting out the door to school--stick with it, stay calm, believe in it, watch and see. I tell you, it's some kind of magic. \n\n Now I need a set of songs just for me, for writing, for yoga, for long walks in the potato fields beneath  the shimmering sun. \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/a-set-of-songs.html", "title": "A set of songs"},

Unless you like chemically scented parafin wax candles in glass jars and figurines and fake snow and overpriced housewares. It was retail overload there and not the variety that charges my pulse. It was not the Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory or a second hand store and there was no natural lighting. \n\n I tell you, maybe I\u2019m the one with sensory issues. Fluffy was a star. He walked near me and reached up to hold my hand. He told me where he was going before he wandered over to inspect a hideous Christmas display and came back without my calling. He made his own stuffed animal, a baby bear he named Little Rakes to keep Rakes, his big polar bear, company. Rakes--so named for the Reiki Fluffy gave him as soon as he was out of the box--was purchased so he could hug and squeeze and climb and pummel it to his heart\u2019s content. It was meant to be his transitional object for sleep but it turns out, he didn\u2019t need it. For sleep, that is. He loves it just the same. \n\n The making of this new baby polar bear stuff animal was the highlight. Fluffy recorded his own voice into the thingy that we stuffed inside and then the woman graciously allowed him to help work the machine that blew in the stuffing (after I asked). Fluffy filled out the adoption papers sitting at the computer on his own and typing in all the information. And I mean all. He\u2019s been doing a computer program called  Read, Write & Type!  that requires its own post due to the brilliance of its design and implementation, and can now type most anything he can say. Touch type. It\u2019s quite a sight to see.  \n\n What I loved about the recorded message is that he did it many many times. There\u2019s a button on the underside that is set to either Play or Record. The time allowed is minimal. Fluffy started with a long story, then modified it to fit, then modified it again and again. By the time we got home, the switch had mistakenly shifted to Record and so Little Rakes said  Shkkrlllltrgrr  so he worked on it for a while in his room. He took his time; he held the device a good distance away so the sound was not distorted; he experimented with different voices, doing his best to \u2018sound like a bear\u2019. A talking bear. The results are simple but the process was phenomenal.  \n\n This place is billed as great for kids and I tell you, I cannot fathom it. There is a tiny room called The Museum that was okay but manned, at least today, by two workers in the garb of yesteryear, heatedly discussing Africa\u2019s inability to get a handle on herself despite many opportunities afforded since the 1950s.  \n\n We did dip a couple candles. Again, Fluffy enjoyed himself while  I  exercised great restraint in not clocking our \u2018helper\u2019 with my  stainless steel reusable water bottle . She was so abrasive I thought of taking her home to use on my feet. Fluffy selected a rocket and star candle combination and pink for the color in which to dip. She scoffed and rolled her eyes. She forced his hand through the process. Okay, I said. He\u2019s got it. She kept at it and I reached over and grabbed her hand.  OKAY , I said again,  HE'S GOT IT. \n\n Let him do it himself, lady. \n\n We listened to a bible story on the way home, Noah and the Ark, one of the  Rabbit Ear's  series. We were enthralled. That Noah. He toiled for years on that honker. Everyone thought he was a nut. I\u2019m not a bible gal, per se, but the thing I love about that story is not the man as wicked part, not the death and destruction part, but the listening to the gut part, the godself, no matter what it looks like to anyone else, no matter what reason says.  \n\n Why do I end here? What does it mean?  \n\n I don\u2019t know. \n\n Aspergers. Is it a difference? Or a disability? Or both?  \n\n And how is it up to me to determine the \u2018right\u2019 way to do things? I'm here to guide, yes, but we all have our own destiny. Remediation is one thing, but we need trust a bit more in personal destiny, in whatever it is we're each here to build. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.readwritetype.com/readwritetype/RWT-learning-system.html", "http://www.kleankanteen.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Rabbit-Ears-Beloved-Bible-Stories/dp/0739337092/ref=sr_1_1/102-2898949-6954567?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192055187&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/outing.html", "title": "An Outing"},

I ought to have read the book instead and I will, if for no other reason than to find out what about the part of 'Mozart' has been fictionalized for the big screen.   \n\n The movie has some sweet parts. Josh Hartnett is wonderful as the male lead, the \u2018whale\u2019 in the title. I believe his struggles, his brilliance and his sincerity. It\u2019s Mozart I have a problem with. I don\u2019t know how much is the direction and how much is acting. Radha Mitchell is beautiful but, and I hope I\u2019m not going to offend, she just doesn\u2019t seem Aspergerian to me. Wacky, emotionally damaged and energetic but not autistic.  \n\n I checked myself at every point the performance bothered me saying, every person with Aspergers is unique, an individual, there are no wide sweeping generalities we can offer up. But  can\u2019t  we? Isn\u2019t there a general consensus that those adults with Aspergers who didn\u2019t receive much if any intervention or even know of a diagnosis until their adult years struggle with facial gazing, reading social cues, body language? That they may have a tendency to talk enthusiastically on a few specific topics, launching in with whatever their mind was just ruminating over, dispensing with most of the banal social rules and conventions that us NTs cling to, sometimes foolishly so? \n\n From the reviews I\u2019ve just found in my google search, the very well received memoir    Mozart and the Whale: An Asperger's Love Story by Jerry Newport, tells the story of how he met his wife, Mary, and fell in love. Once they got married, the two were catapulted into fame as Mr. and Mrs. Autism. Stories about them appeared in newspapers like The Los Angeles Times, 60 Minutes did a piece on them. The pressure from all sides mounted until they split up. Happily, they agreed to give it one more go, reconciled and remarried.  \n\n Now that is a remarkable story! Make that into a movie! But no. \n\n What is so hard about making a film with autistic characters? Walking that line, it seems, between the genuinely eccentric and human versus the madcap devil may care genius hollywood so adores, showing us real human beings with real challenges and some out of the ordinary behaviors that have real meaning behind them. At least the movie was successful with Jerry\u2019s character. I believed him. And not because he was just like the Aspergian\u2019s I know. \n\n Mozart--Mary from the book--is called Isabelle in the film. She\u2019s depicted as a highly gifted musician/painter working as a hairdresser in a nice salon. Maybe she really did in real life but it seemed an unlikely occupation for someone on the spectrum, all the social contact,  listening to the clients, touching all that hair, the product, the smells, the dyes. And she had amazing eye contact in every scene, not just looking but gazing and inquiring and asking about and doing for and showing remarkable flexibility, reciprocity in conversation, going so far as to clean her new boyfriend, Donald\u2019s, (Jerry in the book) apartment without him knowing, the apartment where uncaged pet birds streak droppings every surface, stacks of newspapers leaned awry in every room, and the bathroom grows new forms of life. Does this seem like typical Aspergian behavior? \n\n I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to see it and tell me what you think. I want more depictions of those with autism in movies. This started with an autist\u2019s own story. But maybe we need autistic directors to really get it right and here I don\u2019t mean capture the ONE autistic experience, but someone who can communicate the authenticity of the character\u2019s experience so we in the audience can either have that specific feeling that comes from recognition or from a wall tumbling down to make room for expansion. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392465/", "http://www.amazon.com/Mozart-Whale-Aspergers-Love-Story/dp/074327282X"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/mozart-and-the-.html", "title": "Mozart and the Whale"},

We'll be working with her on that. \n\n In the meantime, has anyone heard of the \"Flow\"? My new piano teacher (yes! I'm taking piano after a 39 year break!) told me about it.

By chance, Dave and Fluffy met them at the park earlier this week and Fluffy and boy played together for about 20 minutes.  \n\n !!!!!!! \n\n They played a made up game, the boy's made up game, complicated and space-related. Fluffy played along, allowing the boy to lead the way, Dave recounted later that night with glowing eyes.  \n\n I told the new doctor about the spontaneous playdate when Fluffy was out of earshot. Later, she asked him about it, about how it was to play with this new friend and Fluffy said, and I quote: \n\n \"He has the kind of imagination that I like. It's more fun to play with him than to play with Mommy or Daddy. I've been waiting for a playmate like him my whole life. \" \n\n !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n I raced home, dove at the phone and called the boy's mom. She told me that the morning after they played together, her son looked up at her and said,  Can I have a playdate with Fluffy? \n\n !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n I'm about ready to move IN with this family. \n\n So, we're going to be setting up playdates, playdates for my Fluffyster.  \n\n Maybe we're already IN the Flow? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/the-flow.html", "title": "The Flow"},

{"date": "October 27, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy, out to lunch with me and his rock candy at the Yankee Candle Factory; October, 2007. \n\n \nMy dad took slides. Slides of us in bad hair and Halloween costumes, of buildings, bricks, ceilings and trusses. After he and my mom split up in my senior year of high school, he gave the slides to me. But he kept taking them, of his new wife, the rest of us, and more buildings.  \n\n He\u2019s an architect so, for him, structures and  things  are full of information, inspiration or perhaps warnings of what not to do. He taught for years and years and I know his slides spilled across the wall during many a classroom lecture.  \n\n He\u2019s letting go of those slides too now, from his trips in this country, in China, Cuba, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Columbia, Guatemala, and other countries I\u2019m forgetting. He's sorting through his meticulously labeled trays and boxes (he often returning from trips with close to a thousand exposures) pulling out the ones with people in it, putting them aside to keep, making piles of the rest to donate to the nearby university library. \n\n I grew up with weekly or monthly viewings of our family slides, watching the images spread across the white wall, listening to the click of the tray advance, the whir of the fan as it cooled the motor, the unexpected poses that appeared upside down or those that refused to fall down the gap to be shot through with the hot beam of light.  The patch of wall would gaze back at us then, bright and quivering while Dad clicked and clicked with greater and greater urgency, unwilling to concede mechanical defeat.  \n\n I love those slides. I try to take care of them, all the images I have of my family before it fractured. The 8 mm film was transferred to video, the slides have traveled from a box to plastic sleeves and back to new and better storage that makes casual viewing a breeze. \n\n Dave has a stack of slides too, from his childhood and his own life up until he made the switch to digital around the time that Fluffy was born. \n\n Now, we have many thousand of digital pictures of Fluffy. He may well be, as my sister, says, the most photographed child on the planet. We have stacks of video as well. I even have audio recordings starting from about a year. It IS something to go back and listen to his high and earnest voice but I have the feeling that not even Fluffy is going to want to wade through all this data. \n\n The thing is, we don\u2019t see the pictures. I tried to cull through the batches and print out a handful each time, put them in albums so we could see them. But that didn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t stick with it plus, how often do we sit down and look through a stack of photos together, Fluffy and I? For whatever reason, it doesn't hold his interest for very long. I tried putting books together as a project, an RDI activity, but no; tried making smaller simplier books for Fluffy to look at himself, pictures of him doing this or that, or being with this person or that person, to give him a view of his life, himself, to help encoded positive episodic memory, or autobiographical memory over time. No. \n\n Then I attended  John E. Robison\u2019s  reading of his beautiful book,  Look Me In The Eye,  a few weeks ago. I was struck by his response to a question by someone in his audience. John had been telling us about the time during which his father was dying, a time when John asked for help in  finding some positive memories of their relationship. A flood of memories came back. The person in the audience asked, how can John be sure the memories, these and others that resurfaced during the writing of his book, were really his own or ones that he took on from these and other conversations. And he answered with an astounding fact: he had recently uncovered a box of slides from his childhood years, slides that had been packed away during the talks with his dad and during the writing of the book. These slides captured many of the memories that John had unearthed. He said he thought these memories were recalled so clearly, in part, because they had been reinforced by having seen them during slide shows when events were discussed and given attention. \n\n How wonderful to have discovered those slides.  \n\n I realize that many of my memories of childhood come from our own family slide shows, the pictures themselves and also the memory of those family nights, rich with their own sensations and evocations. \n\n Dave and I had been puzzling for a while on how to  be with  the pictures of our life, how to have them around with Fluffy's sense of continuity and self.  Dave's screen saver runs a continuous slide show from the thousands of pictures on his iPhoto library; he sees us all day while he draws and putters and writes in his office. But we don't. Yet, I didn\u2019t think the formality of sitting down for a viewing in some regimented way would work. The very reason Dave's screen saver appeals to him is because he can look up and catch moments as he goes through his day.  \n\n Now, thanks in part to John, we\u2019ve found a way that\u2019s working: \n\n This digital frame .  \n\n We mounted it on the wall by the dining room table where we all sit at least three times a day. The frame displays a slide show of images that we change about once a week. Fluffy\u2019s been watching it, casually, with interest, every day. He\u2019s relaxed. He\u2019s getting a steady influx, a steady review of what he\u2019s been doing in his own life, week by week. \n\n I like to think these images will splash across Fluffy's eyes and travel down the optic nerve, settle into his very skin and bones so when the truck arrives to unload the pallets of digital recollections taken by his overindulging hovering parents, they can rise up and meet the ones he sees again, joining past and present, making connections, strengthening his inner ground. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jerobison.blogspot.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Look-Me-Eye-Life-Aspergers/dp/0307395987/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-0893374-6880005?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193510169&sr=1-1", "http://www.digiframes.com/related/1028-4255/Digital-Picture-Frames-Weekly-Special/PixiModo-Digital-Picture-Frame-ClearView-12.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/slides-and-imag.html", "title": "Slides and images and memories"},

{"date": "October 28, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nDetail from the window to the Art Room at the Eric Carle Museum; Today. \n\n \nWe\u2019ve had a whirlwind weekend and I have the pictures to prove it! I feel like one of those parents you meet for the first time who, when asked whether they have kids, whips out a tome-size photo album beginning with shots of their pregnant belly.  \n\n On Friday, we ventured out of state for a birthday party to celebrate my RDI, homeschooling, Enki-ite pal  Harvest Mom\u2019s  son Jacob\u2019s turning seven. How\u2019s that for a sentence. It actually contains an untruth as she is no longer using RDI since her son effectively  \u2018graduated\u2019 from the program . Isn\u2019t that grand?  \n\n But she  is  my pal and a fantastically energetic and creative homeschooling Enki-using mom to her two wonderful boys and since Friday is adventure day, she held the party at a relatively nearby pumpkin patch/hay and corn maze/petting zoo. It was perfect. Fluffy petted the piglets that raced about uncaged, even the very one that Harvest Mom bought THAT DAY to add to the growing menagerie on her own small farm. He did some running with the kids, ate cake, wrestled on small mounds of mulch, explored the maze, and had a raucous hay fight with dear B., a fellow Aspergian. Fluffy, that is, not the pig.  \n\n Friday night was movie night: 101 Dalmatians. We\u2019ve been doing this for a few weeks now and it\u2019s a favorite in our house. I insists it\u2019s, (1) nothing scary and (2) a narrative so Fluffy can practice following a story and staying emotionally regulated in the face of the characters\u2019 sometimes strong emotions. Plus, it\u2019s darn fun.  \n\n Saturday afternoon we headed to the  Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art  for a puppet show of Leo Lionni\u2019s,  Tico and The Golden Wings  which was exactly the right length, lovely to look at, and performed at a refreshing snail\u2019s pace--a visual massage.  \n\n This morning, Fluffy tackled the wall. Not the wall of his internal mind but the mighty wall of the Northampton Athletic Club that soars close to 40 feet in the air. No lie. \n\n \nFluffy, looking very small, gazing at the wall. \n\n \nIt was the first time he ever did any rock climbing and he handled it like a pro, at first, staring up at it and then wheeling around on his heels like a cartoon complete with head lolls and a smattering of siren sounds.  I\u2019m a little scared , he said. OF COURSE YOU ARE, I wanted to shout, but instead I mentioned the safety harness and stressed he need only go as high as he felt comfortable. They harnessed him up and he started to climb.  \n\n \n\n The class was a one-time event offered through a local center where Fluffy takes gymnastics and where we attended the family dance last month. Today, it was all boys, all boys, it seemed, with Aspergers. We had the space for 2 hours which gave every child as many opportunities as they wanted. \n\n The first time, Fluffy went up about ten feet and then said,  I\u2019m ready to come down . The second time, he went up a bit more and each time, more and more until he got to the top. The very top! \n\n \nMy Fluffy!!! \n\n Every move he made was his own decision. It was a phenomenal OT activity--balance, motor planning, proprioceptive, vestibular, simply the muscle exertion required to make it to the top was nothing to sneeze at. I know. I tried it. The first time, I didn\u2019t make it to the top either. And I did something Fluffy  didn\u2019t  do--call down every few seconds to the sprite who was holding my safety line,  Are you sure you have me?  Seriously. She looked twelve. That's her to the right of Fluffy in the first picture. Ahem.  \n\n Once Fluffy scaled Mt. Everest, we zoomed back to the Eric Carle for a Halloween event: David Costello sang and played ukelele and read from his book,  Here They Come!  and then created a creature right before our eyes as hoards of kids from the eight-and-under set called out characteristics as fast as they could. Behold: \n\n \nFluffy\u2019s contribution was, you guessed it, the Rocket Feet. \n\n A trick or treat treasure hunt followed that took us to the bookstore, the library, the auditorium where we saw a short movie, the art room where we made our own fantastical creatures \u00e1 la Tony DiTerlizzi\u2019s illustrations in  The Spiderwick Chronicles  currently on view in the gallery, and finally the cafe where the goods were delivered. \n\n What I loved about it was the mix and match art making, David Costello\u2019s made up monster, the collage in the Spiderwick style: gluing human legs to giant eyes, monkey heads to bug bodies, adding in pencils and markers. \n\n \n\n There was no wrong way to do it. I think that\u2019s why Fluffy dove right in. \n\n It inspired me to schedule in a weekly trip to the museum. It\u2019s ten minutes away, the art room is free, and the library has one of the most beautiful collection of children\u2019s books around. \n\n That\u2019s my report. Birthday parties, classes, holiday events, and art. Huh.

All of it: that bound for the dump, for recycling and, should we have it, the compost pile as well.  \n\n On the day in the above photo, the entire load was gathered at our house the week after our move when many boxes were empied, sliced open, and flattened. He came early and walked around and around the piles with a big smile on his face. \"It's like a math problem\" he said, \"I'm going to solve it and fit it all on.\" And he did. And then he road 3.5 miles to the dump that in a medium grade wind.  \n\n I was floored. I love this guy. Being a Pedal Person is a full time job for him.

We are really at a place where practice is key. That is huge progress for us. HUGE. And now I must find the practice partners. I know a lot of what Fluffy struggles with is sensory related and much is attributed to the realm of his own version of the Asperger's mind, but I also wonder if a portion of it is simply not having been around other kids, really, ever. Our attempts were pretty disasterous or confusing or scary for a long time and as a consequence, I really have no idea what kids are like, what kid interactions look like, and neither does my son. It's been a long dry spell and we emerge from the autism remediation cave rubbing our eyes, blinking and clueless.  \n\n Fluffy has no experience being one  among ; he's been the  one and only  for his whole life. He really hasn't had a chance to form an identity as part of the group. Now, maybe he's not ready; maybe it's not realistic? For him to feel that, to see himself as belonging to anything other than his own nuclear family? I don't know. I only know, now that we're more settled in this new place, this new grade, this new rhythm, it's time to add more players. The how is up in the air. But I am taking a  Secretized  position and will simply ask, envision and then await its manifestation.  \n\n Myabe it's like being a pedal person: arrive, encircle, envision, and ride off into the wind with your bounty piled on high. \n\n \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pedalpeople.com/", "http://www.thesecret.tv/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/pedaling.html", "title": "Pedaling"},

{"date": "October 01, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Art is still a tricky thing for Fluffy so when he spotted the new 31-color set of glue pens and wanted to make a drawing for me, I whipped out the pad and let him go to town. When I came back ten minutes later, he had created this: \n\n \n\n Beautiful; energetic; full of color and the entire contents of 23 of those pens. \n\n What could I say? He is not a bit by bit guy; he\u2019s an everything at once guy. He eats like he\u2019s just be sprung from Dachau. He drinks like a guy who barely made the Saharan crossing. Hugs are head locks. Every story  is recounted at top volume.  \n\n He\u2019s also a guy with some characteristics of a foster care kid. He\u2019s a hoarder. Everything goes in his special cubby. He guards his own food. He needs to have a hand on the community bowl at all times. He\u2019s very concerned with having more of whatever it is that we have that he just discovered and now can\u2019t possibly live without, can barely complete the exhale until he\u2019s gotten us to promise we will always have at least one of those, whatever it is, in the house. He\u2019s approached store clerks with the same request, interrupting sales to get an assurance that Stop and Shop will promise to always carry the Fayeh Greek Mix It Yourself Yogurts, in Honey, Strawberry and Peach. It\u2019s not that they have to promise; he can handle a no. But he  must  ask. \n\n When he saw the pens he asked me,  Will you get me more of those if they run out?  Yes, I think I can get more of those if you like them, I answered. That was before he emptied them out on ONE piece of paper. \u2028 \n\n No matter. He\u2019s drawing and stamping and baking and sewing! And falling asleep on his own which means that one day soon, I can conceivably go out for an entire evening! Maybe even an overnight on my own! Imagine that! I can not but help the exclamation points! They leap onto the page! Look! Another one! \n\n We started homeschooling 1st grade and I tell you, I feel so supported by our daily and weekly rhythms, I shake my head in giddy disbelief. I\u2019m using  Enki Education  as our curriculum and I love love love it. It\u2019s developmentally based with a strong sensory-motor foundation. It\u2019s not concerned with teaching skills or academics but more with the child integrating their senses, in sinking into their world, in experiencing their own emerging self and competence and I am seeing that reflected in Fluffy. We still have a toe in RDI and I\u2019m sure we will soon return to dive back in to the whole pool but the sensory piece is large and complicated and has long sticky fingers that reach into everything, into all that is perplexing and challenging and so, my focus must be there through Enki, our new OT, and  HANDLE , with a dash of swimming and gymnastics thrown in. \n\n Dave, the trooper, joins us for circle every morning. Thank the lordy lord because last spring it was hard to keep my pecker up as I tra-la-la\u2019d in a circle, skipping around  by myself  in the living room while Fluffy tried to pick the lock to my office door to snatch a little extra computer time. Circle time now, at the start of our 4th week, is coming together. Fluffy joins us for nearly the whole time and only crashes into us once or twice.  \n\n I will happily post more details as we go although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s tea cup. I could talk about it all day; it feels so good to be in the flow, to feel a bit as if I know what I\u2019m doing, as if the day unfolds--dare I say it--quickly, to feel energized and relatively calm by 5 o\u2019clock when Dave stops drawing his cartoons and comes downstairs to take over.  \n\n And now for some pictures. \n\n Every Monday, we bake. We've been apple crazy lately: apple muffins, apple cake, apple pie, and today, apple sauce.  \n   \n\n I can't recommend that apple peeler/corer/slicer enough. We use it all the time.

Step,  hop , step,  hop  and try as he might, the results were a sort of lurching bird through mud, and I say that with the utmost respect. I wondered if my attempts to help were making it worse because,  can  one break it down?  Can  one get in there and connect the midline crossing wires before their time? \n\n I dropped the coaching and concentrated on our movement activities and our alternate hand clapping games. Last week, the new fantabulous OT told me that skipping usually bursts onto the scene spontaneously around age 5. Okay, I thought, we're not so very behind.  \n\n And then a few days ago, *poof* he's skipping! To the car, down the hall, around and around with Dave and me during our morning movement circle!  \n\n Skipping! Fluffy is skipping! And I'm skipping with him.

{"date": "September 29, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t When I make a movie about a family raising a child with Asperger\u2019s, I will end it with a scene at a family dance straight out of the event we attended last night. It will be the scene when the parents are experiencing a kind of community and kinship as much as the kids, where the parents look around at the jumping and twirling and giggling kids, at the formal \u2018tween in his blue sports coat snapping photos as arm\u2019s length, at the other parents who never dreamed this is where they\u2019d be on a Friday night and this is where they love being, in the small, dimly lit facility that could really use a handful of benefactors to beef up the supply closets and dig a foundation for much-needed expansion. \n\n The dance was held at the center where Fluffy takes gymnastics, a center where special needs and NT kids participate in small classes together under the guidance of a lovely instructor who is, so far, the perfect mix of boundaries, high kicks, and good cheer. It was the first time we had been out for such an evening and Fluffy was thrilled. I could feel his excitement and anticipation as we loaded into the car, at 7:30 in the pee em, under the indigo sky, clear but not yet gleaming with any stars.  It\u2019s so dark out!  he said to our headrests.  \n\n When we pulled up to the center, he raced to the window; the thumping of music and feet reverberated through the glass. He grabbed my hand and pulled me in through the front door, the hallway, and into the gym where a group of about fifteen kids jumped and squealed and rolled around. We began dancing immediately.  \n\n We danced and jumped and rolled and cartwheeled with bathroom breaks and a quick trip to the snack table where Fluffy gleefully scored two chocolate chip cookies. Back on the dance floor, a boy about Fluffy\u2019s age hovered nearby, and every so often, zoomed perilously close on his way to crash into the floor mats hung up on the wall for this very purpose. Just before we left, he raced up to Fluffy and engulfed him in a passionate embrace. Fluffy smiled.  \n\n After dancing for about a half hour, Fluffy said,  Is it time to go?  which meant, yes and so we left but not before saying goodbye to his gymnastics teacher whom he passionately embraced. In the car on the way, Fluffy brought up the boy who continually crashed into the wall mats nearby, the boy who later hugged him and smiled close to his face. That\u2019s his way of saying hi I said.  I know that,  said Fluffy.  I noticed he was watching me.  I think he was interested in you, I said.  Yes, mommy, I think so, too,  he said.  You know, mom, if he had said to me, hey, do you want to dance with me? I would have said yes.  \n \nBy the time we got home, the sky was a deep blacky blue and the stars were wide awake, Cassiopeia clearly visible, its lazy W stretched out on its side. We brushed teeth and got into pjs, read the first chapter of The Wizard of Oz with  Lisbeth Zwerger\u2019s  exquisitely fanciful illustrations and after one last piggy back ride to the bathroom for one last pee of the night, it was lights out.  \n\n I put new glow-in-the-dark stars on Fluffy\u2019s new bedroom ceiling. We snuggled under their soft light and listened to the whale calls in the reiki cd we listen to each night, but only for a short while because Fluffy\u2019s so big now, he can fall asleep on his own. We talked about it the night before, this bigness he has now, this place inside him where he can feel calm and peaceful all by himself. He says it\u2019s  fully operational.  He says, all he has to do is  go completely into his break section  and he can fall asleep without me. The place that knows how to calm down when he\u2019s upset  is not so operational,  he told me, that place still needs me,  that place is still developing.  That\u2019s okay, I said, it will grow, just like the bedtime place.  \n\n Goodnight, I said, giving him one last hug and kiss.  Will you stay and cuddle a little more?  he asked. No, sweetheart. Mommy has to do other things now. You can fall asleep on your own now. I\u2019m so proud of you. You can call me if you need me.  \n\n And I left. \n\n And did other things. \n\n And he didn\u2019t call for me.  \n\n And he woke up this morning happy and strong, marched outside to the new driveway and drew two beautiful stick people in thick pink chalk--near, but not next to, each other.  \n\n Six years and eight months of laying by my son or under my son or half under and half beside my son until he fell asleep, feeling at turns, glad I could provide that safety and comfort and entirely trapped and enraged by my own inadequacy in the realm of creating healthy infant/toddler/child sleep habits.  \n\n And now he has them. \n\n Yes; let's dance. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Oz-L-Baum/dp/1558586385/ref=sr_1_1/102-2898949-6954567?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191087610&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/09/sleeping-and-da.html", "title": "Sleeping and Dancing"},
{"date": "October 04, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy, showing the gap from his very first lost tooth! \n\n Remember back when I spent hours pressing Fluffy\u2019s gums? Pressing and massaging until I was certain his teeth would crack and tinkle into my palm like tiny icicles? Because of the planters warts that were digging into his heels, arch and toes?  Grapefruit seed extract --that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Grapefruit seed extract and  HANDLE  exercises. Those babies are gone gone gone. \n\n The HANDLE exercises are hard to pass along; they really need to be suggested by a trained practitioner. We go to the New Jersey facility to see Judith Bluestone. She was the one who made the connection between his mouth discomfort and the warts in the first place and it was dead on. She was also the one who recommended grapefruit seed extract. Within a month, the planters warts on his right foot had disappeared. A week later, five more even nastier ones had bloomed on his left foot. They took longer but we kept at it, 15 drops of GSE in a dixie cup, a drop of water, mix with Q-tip and apply to washed and dried wart area--dab dab. Presto. Poof. \n\n We\u2019ve switched to  this  as a daily vitamin. And  this  as a daily oil. We give a teaspoon of  this  at bedtime. Other than that, we\u2019re not doing anything special in the food and supplement category. I still wonder from time to time if we\u2019re missing something but my gut says no and there\u2019s no pattern that I can pick up to support otherwise.  \n\n The one thing I try to do is make sure Fluffy gets a meal/snack that includes some protein every two hours.  That feels critical. It\u2019s always one of those slap myself in the head moments when I realize he\u2019s falling apart simply because of low blood sugar. That\u2019s when I really GET that food is chemistry, if you\u2019ll allow me that poor sentence. And it\u2019s one of the reasons I have any lingering questions about food intolerances at all. In fact, I had a dream the other night that I took Fluffy to see a world reknown autism/asperger expert and he concluded that there was nothing WHATSOEVER wrong with Fluffy other than bad parenting and a poor diet.  \n\n Ahem. \n\n I\u2019m putting my money on the sensory piece. We may not be pressing gums anymore but every night for a few months now, Fluffy wipes saliva on his eyes. I want to say he does this a little compulsively but how do I know what it feels like to him? I mean, yes, he has a fascination with saliva that goes above and beyond the typical, but he says they feel hot. He says they feel sore and stingy. He says the saliva cools them off. And I'm listening.  He says he sometimes puts his finger in his eye because that sensation distracts him from the hot sensation. Poor guy. He's literally poking himself in the eye to feel  better .  \n\n We\u2019re scheduled to have a comprehensive evaluation by a eye guy next week. I\u2019ve been reading about vision therapy and ambient vision and it\u2019s role in understanding meaning and intention in social situations. I know Fluffy's focal vision is good but this ambient? I don't know from the ambient.  I just hope this eye guy is good. \n\n That is all.  \n\n Good night and may your eyes stay cool all the night through.   \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vitacost.com/NutriBiotic-GSE-Liquid-Concentrate-Grapefruit-Seed-Extract", "http://www.handle.org", "http://www.vitacost.com/Alacer-Emergen-C-Jr-For-Kids", "http://www.vitacost.com/Carlson-FISH-OIL-for-KIDS", "http://www.herbalremedies.com/kids-calm.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/little-updates.html", "title": "Little updates"},

{"date": "October 09, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nMy pals flanking me. My sister, far right, who really needs to liven up.  \n\n \nThank you, dearest  Drama Mama , for your beautiful words of friendship and support!!! \n\n My birthday was Sunday. I turned a whopping 48. We were in Rhode Island for the weekend where it was so unseasonably mild, we tromped to the beach, across the sand, and into the warm waves of the Atlantic ocean. It felt invigorating and soothing and easy. I did not want to get out. So I didn't. Dave splashed around, Fluffy jumped around, and Beegu paddled around but then they all left and I stayed and stayed, rolling and diving, like a seal, a mature seal with skirted, polka-dot suit.  \n\n I saw friends and family and received good wishes and some lovely treats; I scored at a yard sale--Eileen Fisher full length velvet coat for a mere five dollars. But best of all, Fluffy played with his four year old and nearly six year old cousins downstairs in the playroom for a good thirty minutes. Unsupervised. I sat upstairs witih the grown ups who encouraged me not to go down, even when screams and cries rang out from the youngest one. \"She'll come get me if it's serious.\" her dad, my step-brother, kept saying.  Okay,   I replied.  \n\n And then more was said, stressing the importance of not going down, how VERY ready they felt Fluffy was to be more independent, how OVERDUE it was for him to have this chance to work it out on his own and I smiled and nodded along, full of the growth in him and in me and also a teeny bit annoyed because you know what? There's a certain thing you know when you have a kid like Fluffy, and you know it from years and years of living with it. That's all I can say. Trust me on this.  \n\n The funny thing was, it wasn't difficult at all for me to sit there with the grown ups. I wasn't fighting the urge to race down there and rescue him. I reveled in our new patch of freedom which has come, incidently, in large part  because  of what others interpret as overprotection. At one point, I started to say a few things about social development and readyness but then I stopped. I don't need to explain or defend. I never did. But I'm 48 now. It's well over time for me to deflect  heat  and soak in  warmth , something I'm entirely ready to do, even if it takes a little acting as if to get there. \n\n And much cake--the cake that my talented step-mother and father cooked up: \n\n \n\n As Fluffy would say,  Crazy Baby! \n\n We're home now. Fluffy is next to me at his own desk, having computer time. Soon we'll pack up and go to gymnastics where he reports his teacher blurts out, FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT! several times a class.

{"date": "October 05, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy, flying; August, 2007. \n\n \nI\u2019m feeling insane the last two days, like creatures are blowing up balloons in my head, like I am being poisoned, like my hormones have been sequestered in the deliberation room too long without a break and are now repeatedly slamming the double doors behind my mind with an unwieldy tree trunk. \n\n I know. Too many metaphors. That\u2019s what happens when you lose your mind--a metaphoric overload. \n\n To top it all off, the improvisation class I signed up for that was to begin tomorrow has been cancelled. Not enough people signed up. I am crushed. It was to be the first risky step in my year of life, a return to a passion of my teenage years. I fell in love with  Keith Johnstone , father of improv and creator of Theatresports, Maestro Impro, Gorilla Theatre, and The Life Game after reading Impro at  Drama Mama\u2019s  brilliant suggestion and went online to stalk him one night to discover this new improvisation class out of Boston offered for the first time ever in Northampton starting October 6th. It felt very  Secret,  very meant to be. I was thrilled and signed up immediately and then spent the next four weeks fantasizing about how liberating it would feel to be in the moment, to stand up without a script and see what the other guy throws me, to say yes and yes and yes again. \n\n I graduated from an acting conservatory in 1980. I moved to New York City to become an actress but then lost my nerve not in the out loud,  I\u2019ve lost my nerve  sort of way but in the,  I\u2019ll waitress and go to acting classes and never audition but pretend I\u2019m trying to get an acting job  kind of way. My ex-husband was the kind of wounded artist himself that said things like,  When are they gonna wake up and realize they\u2019re not going to make it? When are they gonna give up?  about people I knew who kept putting themselves out there, kept trying. And soon I sidled over to his corner of the couch where we both pretended we were grown up but what we really were was scared. \n\n What we really were was hiding. \n\n And in a way, I've been hiding ever since. That was 1985, the year I got married the first time and moved out of the city and into an administrative assistant job, the year I made pots of coffee and typed 90 words a minute and smiled when I really didn't feel like it and felt simultaneously like my legs couldn\u2019t breathe and that my eyeballs could if tried hard enough, the year my teeth itched and I saw a picture of myself with a coworker and was flabbergasted to note that the crocheted sweater I wore to work on a regular basis was not stylish and sophisticated but in fact, completely see through; I might as well have been changing the copy filter in a black bra and nothing more.  \n\n Now, as I\u2019ve discussed quite a bit on this site over the last couple of years, Fluffy was a high needs baby; we\u2019ve struggled over the years with issues of regulation, sleep, and sociability to be sure. I feel good about tuning into what he needs and doing my best to honor that, to provide the comfort and support he needs to grow and become. The very nature of that journey has been a kind of crucible for my own growth and becoming and for that, I am grateful. But I have been also hiding here, in this role of mother, hiding in my mothering. \n\n I\u2019m not talking about anyone else here, anyone else\u2019s journey or choice about parenting style or outside the home, inside the home, working or not working, hiring nannies or doing it all alone. I\u2019m talking about me. It\u2019s not a simple thing. It\u2019s subtle and complicated and therefore, there are no easy things to say, like, yes,  Well! Get yourself out there! Enroll your son is school! Take more time for you!  because the shift is an internal one; it will drive the action. Dragging the furniture around a room won\u2019t change the footprint of the house. I know some swear by the acting oneself into a new way of thinking and although I have a sprinkling of that, I've never been an outside-in sort of gal, always an inside-out one. I guess that's why I went for RDI and not ABA. \n\n My step-father gave Fluffy a pleasure flight in a tiny 4-seater at the end of the summer. Fluffy sat in the front, next to the pilot. Dave and I sat in the back in seats that made commercial plane seating look like king size beds. I love flying. When I was a kid, I asked to sit on the wing. I took lessons in my early thirties but ran out of money in the middle of Take-Offs and Landings so my last time in the co-pilot seat, we circled the runway only to land as soon as we were airborne.  \n\n On this flight with Fluffy, I couldn\u2019t relax until we were halfway through the trip. I kept asking about Fluffy\u2019s door.  Is it shut? Tight? Shouldn\u2019t you check it? Is it locked? I know I just asked but are you quite sure the door is completely secure? Okay. But do you think he\u2019ll fall out? Alright. Good. Don\u2019t want him falling out, tumbling, you know, all the way down. So, it\u2019s locked, right?  Fluffy was entirely relaxed. He talked into his headset and looked all around him. I like it, mommy, he said. I liked it too, although I felt a tiny bit as if I, alone, was keeping the plane from falling like a seed pod, whirling and twirling to the legoland below. \n\n It\u2019s not a good analogy because I don\u2019t want to fly so much as I want to  risk  and even  fall  just simply to get out of my comfort zone and in a funny way, mothering Fluffy, although certainly  not easy , is inside my comfort zone. I don\u2019t want to stop the mothering but I want to step into the center of more that\u2019s scary for me, step into my own scary, strap on the headset, listen to voices that say things I've never heard before but suddenly am sure I've always known, look out at all that\u2019s all around me and trust that the door will hold. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.keithjohnstone.com/", "http://likeashark.blogspot.com/", "http:www.thesecret.tv/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/flying.html", "title": "Risking"},

{"date": "August 09, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Going to the park was something that used to be tricky. It was best if it was deserted when we arrived. At the first sign of other kids approaching, you could set your watch for how long we\u2019d last--ten minutes if they kept their distance, three if they didn\u2019t. The problem was that I was Fluffy\u2019s playmate and that was magnetic to the other kids. I might as well have been wearing a sign: Surrogate Parent. Playground Sitter. Preschool Teacher in Training.  Hey! Wanna see what I can do?  they'd all shout.  Hey! Look! Look at this! You wanna play this?  \n \nAs much as I loved the other kids, I felt like  the giant chicken in that cartoon  who scooted the chicken hawk away with a kick,  Get away from me kid, you bother me . After hours in the playroom, I was nearly tapped out. I could get it up for my Fluffy but I had shark eyes for the other kids. \n\n If they didn\u2019t want me to watch every last thing they did or listen to every last thing they said or play every last game they could think of, they wanted to play with Fluffy.  What\u2019s he doing? What\u2019s his name? Why\u2019s he doing that? \n \nIn the early years, Fluffy ignored them completely. Then, he felt under siege. Just seeing another kid from a distance could set him off. You could see it in his body, the tension would fill him to the edge of his skin where it would quiver, looking for escape.  \n\n Yesterday at the park, I watched Fluffy watching the other kids and I noticed his body was relaxed, he was relaxed. He wasn\u2019t interacting but he was definitely engaged. There were two smaller kids he was drawn to, one boy about 18 months, one girl around two. He tried to strike up a conversation with the mom of the boy but she didn\u2019t hear him ( Hello!  he said, in his falsetto,  Your little boy sure was doing an incredible job on that big boy climber! ) \n\n I watched him watching. He was on the play structure; I was on the wood shavings. It\u2019s a habit for me to stand close by, to watch him move along the equipment, to move for a better view when he goes out of sight. For years, I stayed close enough to intervene when necessary and it was often necessary. I didn\u2019t want the other kids to get roughed up, pushed down, pushed off.  I didn\u2019t want Fluffy to get hurt by seeing himself as the scary kid, the bully.  \n\n These days I stay close enough, just in case, but mostly it's to hear and see the exchanges that demonstrate Fluffy\u2019s growing sense of safety in numbers.  \n\n At one point he held the side bars at a high opening and leaned his body way out, something that would have scared him not long ago. \n \nI like watching the other kids at the playground,  he said.  \n\n I see that, I said.   \n\n Did you like watching the kids at the playground when you were a kid?   \n\n Yes. I think I did.  \n\n Did you always wish you would have a son who would like to watch the kids on the playground, Mom?  \n \nOh, yes, honey. I did.  \n\n I like watching the smaller kids best, Mom. I like to stay close in case they need help so I can be there to help them. \n\n That\u2019s so thoughtful, honey. \n\n Do you love that I\u2019m thoughtful? \n\n Yes. I do. I love that about you. \n\n Later, he told one of the mothers that she  sure had a cute little baby  and asked about the toddler,  Does this one belong to you?  He leaned down to listen to her answer, exchanged a few more words with both mothers, and raced back to tell me all about who belonged to whom. He said he thought the two moms were friends and the reason he thought that was because he noticed they stayed near each other and talked a lot to each other. \n\n I think the girl was the better baby,  he announced with certainty. \n\n I forgot to ask him why. I was busy thinking about how my little guy is growing up. He took the stool away from the bathroom sink where it\u2019s stood for three years. He took the stool away from his bed where it\u2019s been since we set up that new frame. He doesn\u2019t need those supports. I suppose he doesn\u2019t need me hovering around at the playground. But I don\u2019t want to miss anything. \n\n I guess I\u2019ll have to get a  spy watch  of my own. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pbase.com/orangecones/foghorn_leghorn"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/08/hovering.html", "title": "Hovering"},

I've been reading it at the tail end of putting Fluffy to bed, after stories and songs and lights out and cuddling. I've been snuggling up next to him with my tiny book light and reading a chapter to myself as Fluffy flip flops next to me and finally falls asleep.  \n\n It's stage 1 in a multi-stage process of his learning to go to sleep on his own. I figure, Mommy reading next to him is not too terribly different than Daddy or Mama Mama or maybe even a beloved babysitter, right? And then, it's not too different than Mommy reading from a chair  next  to his bed and then from one  near  his bed and then, perhaps if I'm bold enough to say, from the other room as he peacefully descends into the dreamland on his own.  \n\n The thing is, right now, in stage 1, he's flat against my side, craning his neck to read along with me which sparks all sorts of conversation, not terribly soporific in nature.  What's a short bus? What's ADHD?  \n\n I told him the short answer about the short bus. He said a lot of things, as is his way, including this: \n\n Differences don\u2019t make you any worse than anyone else, whether they\u2019re good differences or bad differences.  \n \n\n I thought of saying something about the 'bad differences' part, something politically correct about how we aren't to judge a difference as bad or good etc etc but you know? As far as he's concerned, not being able to walk is bad and doing math well is good and what am I to say to that? Turns out, I didn't need to say anything because after he returned from his evening sprint to and from the bathroom, he splayed himself on the bed, breathless, suppine, and said: \n\n Everybody is as good as everybody else. Some people are better than others at some things and some people are worse than others at some things and some people are the same at things as others but everyone is as good as everybody else. \n\n Okay, then.  \n\n I'm at the final chapter of  The Short Bus,  a story of Mooney cross-country trip in a yellow school bus that onced ferried special needs kids here and there and in this trip, ferried Mooney and an assortment of people in his \"search to learn from others once labeled abnormal who have learned to live in beautifully original ways.\"  \n\n He's just met Jeff, a man about my age who lives in Davis, California. A man who has been called at times, autistic, Aspergerian, and mentally ill. A man whose behavior, Mooney felt after spending a day with him, fit the autism pattern but who answered firmly, No, every time he was asked if he considered himself autistic or Aspergian. Mooney says: \n\n \"There were two ways to make sense of my day with Jeff. Option A: Assume Jeff is just uninformed or in denial. Option B: Assume Jeff has the capacity to create his own truth about himself.\" \n\n Mooney selects Option B. \n\n Before their parting, Jeff selects papers from the personal notebooks he carried with him that day, makes photocopies, and gifts a collection he calls a 'book of wisdom' to Mooney. Some of these are reproduced in the book. I give you one of them: \n\n ALL THAT HAS \nOFFENDED ME I FORGIVE. \nWITHIN AND WITHOUT, \nI FORGIVE. THINGS PAST, \nTHINGS PRESENT, THINGS \nFUTURE, I FORGIVE. \nI FORGIVE EVERYTHING \nAND EVERYBODY WHO CAN POSSIBLY  \nNEED FORGIVENESS \nOF THE PAST OR THE PRESENT. \nI FORGIVE POSITIVELY \nEVERYONE. I AM FREE \nAND THEY ARE FREE, TOO. \nALL THINGS ARE \nCLEARED UP NOW \nBETWEEN US NOW \nAND FOREVER. \n\n Jeff attribues this to \"Dr. Ponder's Posterity Decrees Brochure.\" I don't know what that means but I don't have to. I only have what he wrote down, copied and gave to Mooney.  \n\n And that will last me a lifetime. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Short-Bus-Journey-Beyond-Normal/dp/0805074279/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2898949-6954567?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187143599&sr=8-1", "http://www.jonathanmooney.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/08/posterity-decre.html", "title": "Posterity Decree"},

He\u2019s removing a lot of supports. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the HANDLE exercises or RDI or just the natural course of development. I don\u2019t, anymore, prescribe to the notion of social developmental age. Fluffy is six and a half. Although he may be closer to a three or four year old when it comes to his ability to keep up with the rapid exchanges in play, he  was born six and a half years ago on a cold February afternoon and that will always be true. His mind is complicated, like all of ours. He does math like an eight year old, shares his toys like a two year old, process emotions better than most adults I know and dances like his dad.  \n\n There\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t buy anymore. A lot of the time, what looks in a child with ASD like withdrawing, to me is more about shifting for a better view. Fluffy has taken to climbing back and forth under the table of a booth in a restaurant. I let him. Sometimes he stays under the table for a while. It may look like he\u2019s protecting against sensory input and that may be, but the other day he offered up, \u201cI like to go under the table so I can watch the other people.\u201d \n\n I don\u2019t buy that those with ASD lack theory of mind, that they can\u2019t see from another person\u2019s perspective, get that you may have other thoughts, view, understandings than they have. It may be the case in  some  of those on the spectrum, but I bet, for a vast majority it\u2019s more of an energy issue. If your energy is used up trying to feel regulated, you don\u2019t have any left over to dip into your TOM pocket and wonder what the other guy is thinking. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t, it\u2019s a matter of priorities, it\u2019s like a hierarchy of needs. You\u2019ll get to that when some other more pressing concerns have been taken care of. \n\n I also think that IQ tests should be banned. I mean, are they really helping anyone? If someone tells me that my son\u2019s scores are off the charts, shall I sit back and fold my arms across my chest.  All done! He\u2019s going to be fine! Look! His verbal reasoning is through the roof!  Shall those who are told their child is mentally retarded throw in the towel?  Forget it, he\u2019ll never understand that!  The tests provide no real information for how to proceed with what\u2019s important in this world: connecting to oneself, connecting to others, feeling valued, having a place in the world, making a contribution, being seen. That\u2019s what matters. And if you want to know, I don\u2019t believe any of the IQ tests results for a child with what is called low functioning autism. I just don\u2019t believe them. How can you test? It\u2019s like testing for cognitive function in a foreign language.  \n\n Who am I to say these things? What do I know? Nothing. I really know nothing but, as  Dooce  has said, this is my website; I can say what I want to. \n\n Our kids are astoundingly capable. Does that mean they are all geniuses? No. And yes.  Human beings  are astoundingly capable. It\u2019s not a matter of how many words they have or the value of their IQ score or even what they, up until this moment, have done. It\u2019s all a matter of how well we see, because real seeing is about pointing our faces to what hasn\u2019t happened yet, what is on the way. Don\u2019t decide ahead of time or you\u2019ll miss it. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dooce.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/08/dont-decide-ahe.html", "title": "Don't decide ahead of time"},
{"date": "August 07, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t  In  The Other Mother , novelist Gwendolyn Gross tells the story of two women who would be described as being on opposite teams in the 'mommy wars'. Amanda is a successful Manhattan children\u2019s book editor, eight months pregnant with her first child. At the start of the book, she and her husband relocate from the busy city to the quiet neighborhood of Teaneck, New Jersey. Thea, a stay at home mother of three, lives next door in the house in which she grew up in an area that she, essentially, has lived her whole life. \n\n The two women meet the day of the move when Thea rings her new neighbor\u2019s bell with her youngest in tow and a plate of freshly baked brownies in her hands, unwittingly interrupting the very pregnant Amanda and her husband attempting to have sex upstairs on the floor of their 'box furnished' bedroom. Greetings are exchanged, brownies are consumed, women regard each other. Thea sees Amanda as a potential friend, a replacement for the girl who had once lived in this house and been Thea\u2019s childhood friend. Amanda sees her neighbor as so sweet and congenial as to be unreal.  \n\n They lurch toward a kind of friendship from there, drawn to each other but also made sharp and awkward by their different choices and the judgments that arise from them.  Within a month or so, Amanda gives birth to her daughter, Melena, the night after a storm. The following month, another storm sends a tree crashing through Amanda\u2019s house. The ensuing damage is so severe, the family takes refuges in Thea\u2019s basement.  \n\n Thea is torn by the offer, actually extended by her husband; Amanda is torn by the hospitality. Tensions rise. Amanda drips milk on the couch she begins to see as her own. Thea rearranges the dishes that Amanda loads into the dishwasher.  Amanda conducts interviews for nannies from Thea\u2019s living room. Thea brings the candidates freshly baked cookies. Finding no one suitable, Amanda takes Thea up on her offer to care for Melena temporarily so Amanda can return to work. Tensions continue to rise. \n\n Gross brings us into the inner world of these women with lovely writing. There are many passages that I related to. This from Thea, out in the garden stealing time for herself one evening as a storm thrashes her about. She looks up as the electricity in her house goes out: \n\n \u201cIt was unnecessary, the weight of worry I always carried right behind my breastbone. Worry for my children, that they wouldn\u2019t be safe without me, as if somehow my presence could keep the light on when the power was gone.\u201d \n\n And from Amanda, back at work while the new nanny, Carole, is back at the newly repaired home with Melena: \n\n \u201cStill, back at work, I looked at Melena\u2019s photo and traced her perfect tiny mouth and worried that, although Carole was confident and calm when I was around, it was an act. That once I left she was simply letting Melena sob in her crib. [...] She was slapping the baby, she was pinching her, she was stealing and suffocating and screaming, unable to take it, psychotic, angry.\u201d \n \nI liked the book but I wanted to like it more. I\u2019m not sure what the issue was for me. Maybe it was the similarity of the women\u2019s voices but perhaps that was intentional? A way to reveal the holes in the notion of the \u201cmommy wars,\u201d a way to underscore that we all struggled with conflicting desires, that we have more in common than the current hype would support? These woman led lovely lives with supportive husbands with whom they had frequent sex. Is it a sad state of my own life that I wanted to see the stress of either choice revealed in more cracks? Perhaps that was intentional, too. Perhaps Gross didn\u2019t want either choice to result in more strife, as if to say the Working Mother creates upheaval due to her absence or the Stay At Home Mom creates disharmony from her unrealized expression of self outside the home.  \n\n The Other Mother tells the story of these women in alternating first person narration, beginning in September of 2000 and ending September of 2001, a time that brought with it, for everyone, a whole new beginning. Ending with this dramatic event felt jaring, tacked on. But maybe Gross ends with this to say, that all we have is what\u2019s temporary, what\u2019s happening right now. And maybe that is enough to choke the oxygen from the flames of the mommy wars, if indeed, they do rage. Maybe what\u2019s she\u2019s saying is, why fight? We all need the air to navigate our own shifting internal landscapes. \n\n Gwendolyn Gross lives with her family in northern New Jersey. The Other Mother is her third novel. She\u2019s set up  writing workshop blog  where she offers steady encouragement for women to tell their stories. If there\u2019s a mommy war being waged in all mothers, it appears Gross has found a way for opposing sides to lay down their arms and break bread.  \n\n As usual, I have copies to give away.

Okay with me. \n \nNot only is he that guy, but he's also the guy who, despite his not really wanting to leave this home, the only home he's ever known, literally a block away from the hospital room from which he made his grand entrance into this crazy mixed up world, he wakes up this morning and says, cheerfully,  Mom, I wonder what adventures and other fun things today holds?  \n\n Adventures and fun things to be sure: trips to the dump, the donation center, the post office, the grocery store.

{"date": "August 10, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t We went to my dad's last night for a family dinner. My brother and his family are up for DC with their two adorable children, ages seven and three. The last time we saw the kids was in Mexico when Fluffy was not able to connect with his older cousin, E., the entire time we were there. In Mexico, there was much dysregulation and poking and jeering and other expressions of what I can only imagine is an overwhelming sense of feeling unsafe.  \n\n But last night, there was none of that. Fluffy and E. played together--more  side by side --but they  interacted , talking to each other about this and that.  \n\n After some time at the house, we made our way to the neighborhood park where we played baseball. Baseball! Fluffy hit a tennis ball with the bat! Out of the park! Which was really a small area of space! Marked off by small plastic red cones! That wasn't always abided! But who cares! We didn't!! It was the kids vs. the grown-ups and all I'll say is, the grown-ups never even had an At-Bat. Fluffy and E. swung and ran and stole bases and high-fived. They whooped our butts.  \n\n Back at the house after dinner, Fluffy stood beside E. as he explained the finer points of  Rush Hour . Then, very naturally, E. broke off to play with his older cousin, my sister's son, and Fluffy played on his own. This piece of self-regulation was key. He had been interacting in some form or another for two hours and he needed to recharge and recharge he did. A rousing game of bad guy/good guy ensued, acted out with the colorful clay Mexican Day of the Dead figurine collection that lives in the kitchen shelves. \n\n For dessert, we all walked to the ice cream in town. Although we're off corn--especially that devil popcorn--and trying to limit dairy, we're essentially eating everything these days which is very liberating. I love that Fluffy can stand in line with the rest of the miniature sugar and cream addicts and order up his ice cream soda, drinking and scooping the frothy sweet goodness as much into his mouth as onto his clothes. \n\n Once back at the house, E. and Fluffy flanked my brother at the kitchen table where they received a lesson in calculus, something Fluffy's been clamoring about for months and something I am wholey unable to provide on my own. But my brother! An economics professor! He did a beautiful job, speaking slowly and carefully, with phrases like \"Now, let's imagine...\"  \n\n As Dave and I gathered up our things to go, Fluffy and E were left alone at the table with pencil and paper. They drew their own calculus problems. They conferred and shuffled a bit from foot to foot, they puzzled into the air, breathing out sighs in Spanky and the Gang animation. Fluffy wrote and erased and wrote again, his unwiedly 2, backwards and tipping on its side but, by god, it  was  a 2 and Fluffy made it, 'by his own'. \n\n In fact, the whole social interaction had its moments of this number 2 so sincerely drawn, a bit backwards and tipping on its side but there was none of this screetchy vocalizing, no scrunching up of fists, no drunken falling and crashing into other people's personal space. Instead there was an overall feeling of safety that surrounded him. \n\n 2. Two. Two boys. Two cousins.

{"date": "August 20, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nI began  Alisa Kwitney\u2019s  novel,   Flirting in Cars ,  thinking it would tell the story of a single mother\u2019s journey to provide appropriate support and education for her elementary-aged daughter, newly diagnosed with dyslexia. The protagonist, Zoe Goren, a forty-one year old freelance journalist and single mother to her cheerful Maya, does embark on a year-long displacement, trading her west side Manhattan apartment for a rental in the boonies two hours north of the city in order to enroll Maya in one of the best schools available for teaching kids with this sort of disability. But the story is about Zoe\u2019s own education.  \n\n Zoe\u2019s plan is nip this dyslexia in the bud during the week, dash back to the city on weekends to keep her toe in the waters of culture and her cupboards stocked in food of Zabar\u2019s, and then return at the end of Maya\u2019s fourth grade year, situation solved. It\u2019s not that simple.  \n\n For one thing, Zoe does not drive. For another, the rental--contrary to what the real estate agent assured her, is not a short walk to anything. She\u2019s a brainy, slightly heavy, New York Jew, miles from her friends and the calming chaos of the city, estranged from her family since changing her name from Zehava and bold enough to have a child out of wedlock, something for which her father has yet to acknowledge or forgive. She\u2019s out of her element, in the country, surrounded by bucolic setting, squeezed between the snobby ex-Manhattanites and the local color, chasing her fat cat as he bats parts of a dismembered mouse around the wide-plank floorboards. Who\u2019s not going to root for her?  \n\n Enter Mack, a local, sexy, EMS volunteer, automobile gear head, and driving instructor back from the Iraq war, the kind of guy who\u2019s good with his hands, if you know what I mean. His strengths echo her daughter\u2019s who is more drawn to an intuitive language of horseback riding offered daily at her new school than to the written word in the world of Zoe\u2019s beloved books. \n\n Now, perhaps it is my weakness as a reader that I need to find a character to whom I can relate, place myself in the story, as it were. In  Flirting in Cars , it\u2019s Zoe\u2019s best friend, Bronwyn. Bronwyn is a lawyer back in the city who quit her job to raise her twin boys, toddlers who fuss and bite each other, endlessly soil diapers, fail to pass rigorous preschool requirements and send babysitters home before the end of their shift. Bronwyn\u2019s husband races off to work every five minutes and stays for days. On the weekends, he\u2019s off to work again to tie up loose ends or to the gym to blow off steam or on errands to purchase things that require complicated assembly leaving the mother strung out and isolated.  \n\n I\u2019m glad to say Bronwyn makes a trip to country later in the book.  \n\n Flirting in Cars  is a quick read, a summer romp like a night out with the girls or gathering around a wide screen TV, watching a good movie of the week, wine glasses in hands. It\u2019s fun to meet the characters, to be in on the local gossip, and to watch the romance unfold.  \n\n As usual, I have copies to give away.

{"date": "September 09, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t We rented this house in Northampton in the spring. It\u2019s a small house by the fairgrounds. You can walk to town on asphalt or through open fields on dirt roads to the Connecticut river.  Okay, it\u2019d be a  long  walk to the river, but you could do it.  \n\n We started coming up on occasional weekends. We packed a box of kitchen stuff, some toys, and tossed mattresses on the floor and called it \u2018house camping at the weekend house\u2019. We were sure to call it the \u2018weekend house\u2019 to distinguish it from our full time house back, our home, in Rhode Island. We planned to move full-time by the fall and wanted to be careful how we framed this transition for Fluffy.  \n\n But it wasn\u2019t only for him. As much as I knew southern Rhode Island wasn\u2019t giving me what I needed, I loved being near the beaches and my family. I grew up in Rhode Island, in Providence, about 40 minutes from where Dave and I bought our house. Much of my family is still there, though only my mom lives close enough to see regularly when she\u2019s in her east coast home and not throwing free-form pots out of Arizona clay in Tucson.  \n\n I\u2019ve moved a lot over the last, oh, forty some-odd years--not great distances but enough times to crave feeling settled, feeling home. Fluffy felt at home in Rhode Island. I\u2019m not sure I ever did but my time there was significant; the idea of leaving was a complicated swirl of feelings. After all, over the last seven years: I bought my first home, I became a mom, I fell into the warm abyss of adoration and joy, I discovered my son\u2019s autism, I felt more love than I ever imagined, I lost friends, I felt desolate and scared, I endured more sleeplessness than I thought humanly possible, I deepened my relationship to all my family members, I starting writing regularly, I discovered community in the blogosphere of all places, I connected more deeply to my instinctual self, I changed in a profound way from all my son has taught me, and, in a way that feels like the closing of a circle, I reconnected to two dear, lost friendships over the last few weeks. \n\n Fluffy was remarkably buoyant about moving to Northampton to \u201ctry out living in the weekend house\u201d.  He seemed steady as they go as Dave and I piled boxes all around him and (after much negotiating) taped notes to furniture indicating what would stay and what would go. I was insistent that both houses have enough in them to be workable, to feel comfortable, familiar.  \n\n Two nights before the truck came, Fluffy crumbled at bedtime. He was sad. He said he didn\u2019t want to go. He talked about how much he loved his home, how he was used to it, he knew where everything was. It all felt so neurotypical, his sadness. He expressed it in real language, honest and simple. There was no acting out, just this talking about his sadness as he cried. He said, \u201cMom, the weekend house is  different  than this house. It feels  different  there. Will  I  have to be different, too?\u201d \n\n An understandable concern.  \n\n We went over the fact that we were  trying out  the new weekend house. That we were  keeping  the Rhode Island home and would come back during the upcoming year and for the whole of next summer. I reassured him that he wouldn't have to be any different at the weekend house. \n\n The morning of the move, he woke up and sighed.  Ahhh. Well, today\u2019s the day . How do you feel? I asked.  A little wibbly wobbly. A little bit good and a little bit bad. I partly like that we\u2019re going and I partly don\u2019t. \n \nOnce the truck arrived and he had a chance to see the movers hook up their ramp and load a few items, we left Dave behind with his clip board and color-coded lists and spent the day playing. We stayed overnight at my mom\u2019s and drove up the next day.  \n\n The house was transformed. Boxes were stacked in corners but our own things were set up in every room and Fluffy\u2019s precious cubby was stocked with all the items no one can touch without his permission.  \n\n Fluffy ran from room to room.  Oh! It looks different! I like it. Can we live here? Mom! I didn\u2019t want to live in a weekend house. I wanted to live in a home.  \n \nAll this stressing of the weekend house. I thought we were helping.  It turns out, he\u2019s no different than me. He needs his  house  to be a  home.   \n\n So, we\u2019re all in this new home. Our old home awaits our visits. Our home schooling year begins tomorrow.  I have more unpacking and much preparation to do and I'm sure there will be more adjusting for all of us but I feel ready for whatever\u2019s next. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/09/not-yet-unpacke.html", "title": "Not yet unpacked, but ready"},

I didn\u2019t want him to feel as if this was something to hide. I wanted to open the dialogue about how people are the same and different, how everyone has strengths and challenges. I wanted to help him begin to understand himself and his world better and knowing about his autism, about this part of him, felt an important step toward that.   \n\n And then, of course, there was the  woman in the tile store  who practically shouted, IS YOUR SON AUTISTIC BY ANY CHANCE? (Why,  yes!  It's your lucky day!) I didn\u2019t want to tense up if such a thing happened again, wondering what to say, if Fluffy heard, what he thought.  \n\n It\u2019s a very personal decision. I certainly don\u2019t think not telling is about feeling ashamed of one\u2019s child or hiding something from them. I understand those who say, what right do I have to disclose my child\u2019s diagnosis to others without my child\u2019s consent? I do understand those who want to shield against the judgment and narrow views others may have of their child\u2019s worth and potential once the \u2018A\u2019 word is dropped. Why \u201csaddle\u201d them with that, they might say, when one can casually mention phrases like developmental concerns or trouble with transitions or issues with anxiety and leave it at that?  \n\n There are those who are remediating their child\u2019s autism, who have gotten to a point where there really isn\u2019t anything to say other than a conversation many years hence during which they may mention that extra help had been provided when they were young. And there are kids to whom the mention of these diagnostic terms would mean nothing, would be confusing, would be like reading a immunology research paper (I mean,  nobody  knows what the hell the immunologists are talking about) aloud to someone just beginning to express an interest in how one catches a cold. \n\n Who am I to say for anyone else?  \n\n Kids with autism get a bad rap. Not all the time but a lot. I know this is changing but it\u2019s changing sloooowly. Recently, someone heard a story recounted to a group of people about an incident in a beauty shop involving a woman and her son. The son was described as clearly autistic. The person mentioned several times how  badly  she felt for the mother, how  difficult  the child\u2019s behavior was, how  long  the scene dragged on. A man who was among those listening, a man  who works with developmentally disabled adults  broke in and said, \u201cOh, autistic kids are crazy. They\u2019re really just  crazy .\u201d  \n\n My mom was among the people listening to this. \n\n You know that phrase about how the personal is the political?  \n\n My mom was not silent. \n\n Telling Fluffy about his Asperger\u2019s was the right decision for our family. I don\u2019t know how he understands everything that goes on inside of him or around him and I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll ever know. How can I? A separate person? But I do know he\u2019s a happy kid. He loves his life. He has his struggles but he feels safe. He seems to feel exceptionally good about himself most of the time, reveling in his strengths, self-editing his challenges for image preservation like the rest of us, even going so far as to tell me he\u2019s good at dealing with his anger. Oh? In fact, he found my copy of  How to Take the Grrrr Out of Anger  in my office, scurried off to his room where he became completely absorbed in its pages and then bolted into the bathroom where I was blissfully peeing alone and announced,  Mommy! You need to JOURNAL! That will help you with your anger issues! \n \nTalking about Autism, about Asperger\u2019s, is the right thing for me. It\u2019s part of  bringing everyone out . It\u2019s part of being  aut.  It\u2019s part of  asking if there is anything we can do . It\u2019s part of saying, this, this too, is autism. Keep looking, keep listening. It is not simple story. It\u2019s nothing we can put in a nutshell. I won't go so far as to say it\u2019s something made of many pieces because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m on board with the whole multi-colored puzzle icon. I\u2019m more of a life is messy like an on-going construction site; hard, on-going, wonderful, always always becoming, but only if we\u2019re willing to talk about it, one individual experience at a time.  \n\n I guess that's harder to make into a button.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Grrrr-Out-Anger/dp/1575421178", "http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/12/aut-about-autism-159_03.html", "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2007/07/somewhere-another-mother-is-losing-it.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/08/to-tell-or-not-.html", "title": "To tell or not to tell"},

Maria Dahvana Headley, a single woman, decided to say yes to every single guy who asked her out, every one: old, young, fat, skinny, smart, dumb, rich, poor, homeless, homefull, all of them. The idea was to get out of her construct, perhaps her narrow construct, of who was attractive, interesting, worthwhile, to expaaaaaaaand her view.  \n\n Well, today is The Day of Yes. It\u2019s my experiment. I\u2019m going to say yes to everything that comes my way. We\u2019ll see how it goes. \n\n So far, it\u2019s landed me on the beach, on the nearly empty expanse of sandy shoreline with my friend Rosemary, walking briskly under the heavy clouds and then swimming, in the salty swells of the ocean.  \n\n I\u2019ve been trying to get up early for about twenty-five years now. I set the alarm; it goes off; I wake up, turn it off and go back to sleep. I wake up later, annoyed, rushed, and stack the pile of what I want to get done higher. Since Dave has his play time with Fluffy in the mornings for the past year or so, I can do this. But should I? No. I think not. The morning is like stolen time. It\u2019s like magic. I need that magic. \n\n So, this morning, I got up. This morning, I said yes. And I am HIGH, my friends, HIGH from it. \n\n It\u2019s the answer to everything: Get up early. And say yes. \n\n And Maria Headley? The Saying Yes woman? At the end of that year, after dating 150 different men, she met one whom she would not have previously imagined herself with but one whom she found she could not be without.

{"date": "August 03, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Normally, I don\u2019t go anywhere with Fluffy without an extra set of clothes, specifically, an extra pair of undies and pants. Fluffy has been potty trained since sometime near to his 5th birthday but when he is involved in a task or game, he will dance and squiggle until it\u2019s too late and then ignore the situation entirely. I\u2019m not sure if he doesn\u2019t realize what happened or he just doesn\u2019t care. \n\n Listen,  I\u2019ve  been known to wait until it was nearly too late, flying to the bathroom hunched over in my haste to make it before I need a change of clothes and I\u2019ve been at this potty thing for quite a while. So, maybe it\u2019s simply an apple falling close to the tree thing? I do know that the entire family has a combined bladder the size of a raison. Car trips are ridiculously slow. Every five minutes, Fluffy alternately calls out,  Can I have some water?  and  I have to go pee pee!  Both requests are emergencies. \n\n Yesterday, while doing an errand at a nearby shopping plaza we had an emergency of the latter variety and so we dashed to the closest known bathroom--the super fantastic toy store, three doors down. While there, Fluffy spotted a super fantastic spy watch and fell in love.  Can you buy me this?  he asked. No. Not today, honey.  Well, I can buy it myself with my own money!  he exclaimed, which he could since he has his own money, one hundred and thirty-two dollars and twelve cents to be exact, in his own passbook savings account. \n\n And he did. \n\n He loves this watch! He opened it and read the instructions. He leaned over his wrist and surreptitiously programed the alarm, spoke in sotto voice, observed various aspects of his booster seat through the magnifier, flashed the red laser light in his own invented morse code. He wore it for the rest of the day, through dinner and washing up, stripping down to watch our nightly episode of Planet Earth in nothing but his spy watch which was the only civilized thing to do given the recent east coast humidity.  \n\n After stories and lights out, we curled up for our nightly chat, Fluffy still in his watch but now also sporting pjs. He lay on his side facing me and pressed a secret button, illuminating the space between us. \n\n I like seeing your face when we talk , he said. \n\n I like seeing your face too. \n\n How\u2019s... \n\n What? \n\n Oh. Never mind . \n\n Oh. I\u2019d love to hear what you were going to say. \n\n How\u2019s your life going for you, Mom? \n\n Great. I love my life. \n\n That\u2019s great, Mom , he said, smiling at me in the fuzzy beam of light.

{"date": "July 31, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Warning: Bioidentical hormone discussion ahead. I may, though I\u2019m not promising, discuss my vagina. Consider yourselves warned. \n\n So, I\u2019ve been on the bioidenticals for three months. Three glorious months. As some of you may remember, I did a spit test at the outset to measure levels. We looked at DHEA, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. The numbers were sad. The best I can say is that I drew a frowny face next to them and presented them to my husband with a sort of shrug. See? It\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s my  levels.   \n\n Aside from a frightening dip into horrendous depression that coincided with our trip to Mexico (charming confluence, that) which I now believe was at least partially due to hormone re-adjustment since my sister experienced a nearly (bio?) identical thing at around the same point in her new hormones regime, aside from that run-on sentence fragment, I felt better right away. Within two weeks I had revisited the marital romping ground, a location I had been blinking at for months, potato chips in hand, puzzling and puzzling \u2018til my puzzler was sore, er, what  is  that? Don\u2019t tell me! It looks so  familiar.  \n\n Other changes were more gradual. Some fog cleared, the headaches disappeared, itchiness abated, a general widening through all body parts started to recede. I\u2019ve been doing my Yoga Booty Ballet tapes at least a few times a week which is a boost to the whole program but even so, I can\u2019t attribute the bodily shifts to exercise alone. \n\n I\u2019ve also been taking my beloved 5HTP so it\u2019s hard to say what, exactly, is helping with my overall mood. Sadness about no more babies aside, I\u2019m more energetic. My skin is softer, more elastic, if you will. I have no more heart palpitations from a short set of stairs; no more breast tenderness that used to drag on for half the month; no more pre-hot flashes, the sort of sudden wall of heat like greeting the tarmac in Costa Rica; no more peeing in the pants--oh wait, I do have that but I have less. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s true. The coughing and sneezing is still a problem.  \n\n Aren\u2019t you glad I\u2019m sharing? \n\n My hormone doctor and I had our initial visit in person. He reviewed my lab results, gave a presentation boiling down the culprit in our nation\u2019s ill health to one word: inflammation, and asked me all sorts of questions about my diet, lifestyle, general state of mind, life concerns, and physical health. He gave me a book about adrenal health, suggested I ingest gallons of cod liver oil and handfuls of vitamin C and called in my prescription for bioidenticals to a compounding pharmacy.  After three months, I was to do the spit test again and call for further instructions.  \n\n I called last week. All my new numbers were in. I\u2019m in the normal range on all counts. I don\u2019t know if the numbers will mean anything to you all but the progesterone, for example, went from a 7 to a 2,741.  I know it\u2019s silly, but I felt proud of myself. From a mere 7 to the thousands! When have I ever shown such improvement in anything in just a few short months? \n\n The Doc wants to hold steady on the doses. Apparently, the body is just getting back up to speed. He believes some of the discomfort I\u2019m still experiencing will lesson, if not disappear. I, however, asked for more testosterone. I felt a little like I was ordering, you know, restocking, talking to my Testosterone Guy. Yeah, listen, we\u2019re going to need more testosterone.  Lots more . I can\u2019t keep it on the shelves! Let\u2019s keep giving me the testosterone until Dave is waving  me  off, until I\u2019m pinching the lifeguard\u2019s rock hard glutes.  \n\n All in all, I\u2019m pleased. I will say, it\u2019s not cheap. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, but when The Doc asked what card I was putting our call on, I felt stunned, almost hurt. I had been leaning on the kitchen counter, cradling the phone, making stars and spirals and other decorative doodles on the back of a stray envelope, adorning the spot where I recorded my new vamped up hormone levels as if I had been chatting with a girl friend. You're  charging  me for this? I wanted to stammer. And how. $275.00.  \n\n No insurance. \n\n Well, a little insurance for the drugs but not for the chat, or rather, appointment.  \n\n So, I shall continue to pop my DHEA pill and rub the creams on my arms and legs but I may request the next results by mail. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/07/bio-indenticals.html", "title": "Bio Indenticals Part II"},
{"date": "July 26, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I picked up Jennifer Elder's,  Different Like Me: My Book of Autistic Heroes , last year at the Autism Society of American's annual meeting in the Jessica Kingsley Press (JKP) booth, a booth chock full of all manner of books on Autism and Aspergers. I loved the positive message, the notion that Autism and hero go hand in hand, though I don't think one has to be or do or accomplish to be a hero. Ask any parent with an ASD child; they're all heroes. Elder knows this. \n\n Elder's newest chldren's book,  Autistic Planet , has the same positive message told in pleasing rhyme beside bright and colorful illustrations.  \n\n In it, a boy sits with his autistic friend, a girl, at a small table, working with clay. The girl makes a 'perfect sphere'. The boy asks, \"Is that the moon?\". The girl shakes her head no, and says it's the planet where she is from. She goes on to describe that planet, one that may 'seem strange to some' but that makes perfect sense to her. It's a world where: \n\n \n          To our ears, talking sounds absurb \n         Unless we repeat every word, \n         When someone tells you, 'Tie your shoe,' \n         You answer back, 'Tie your shoe,' too! \n\n \nI read the book to Fluffy. He was intrigued, especially where he recognized himself: in the girl's love of potato chips and chess, in her dislike of \"itchy stuff like clothes with collars, belts and cuffs\". Where he didn't see himself, there was an opening to talk more on our running theme that people everywhere are the same  and  different and how we see that in ourselves and the people in our lives.  \n\n After the girl describes her planet, her friend asks if the planet is real. She says, 'Well, it's how I feel\" and that to me, this the heart of the book. The book brings none of the didactic discussions of autism but chooses to stay with the  feeling experience  of autism for this one child which brings the reader inside and opens the door for how it might be for himself or a friend or a sibling.  \n\n What happens in the book is simple: a girl makes something; her friend asks what it is and wants to know what it means to her. She tells him. He listens.  \n\n If we were all that simple in our inquiry, imagine the feeling of acceptance and safety we could foster. \n\n Elder is married to Paul Collins, author of, among others,  Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism .  Autistic Planet  is a wonderful addition to a growing body of work by a very gifted couple.  \n\n As usual, I have a copy of this book to share.

{"date": "July 25, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Every six months or so, we take Fluffy up to see our RDI consultant for an RDA, a three-day assessment that gauges Fluffy\u2019s developmental strengths and challenges, specifically, confirming the current stage and clarifying which objectives have been mastered and which are still on the table. \n\n As I reported back in February at the last RDA, there was a point during which Fluffy was being led through various games and activities in one room while Dave and I, in another room, watched the interactions on the video monitor screen. Every time Fluffy struggled, Dave would turn to me, deadpan, and say, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to make it.\u201d Every time Fluffy connected, Dave would turn in the same blank way and say, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d  \n\n He knew he was being funny. He knew he was being absurd. And I appreciated it, this short hand way of summing up our collective anxiety about our son\u2019s progress and future as well as our simultaneous acknowledgment that developmental, despite the brilliance and thoroughness of the RDI approach with its 12,000 measurable objectives, often charts its own circuitous course, that neurological expressions of \u2018okay\u2019 are not discrete destinations points on a map that one plots in a linear, premeditated manner. \n\n But as much as I don\u2019t think we, as human beings, ever really quite get there, we don\u2019t arrive, we aren\u2019t casseroles, timers don\u2019t go off signaling we\u2019re done, as much as I truly believe that we are becoming all the time no matter the age, moving toward inner and outer destinations, we parents want something for our children. We want them to have their own full lives. We need to know we are helping them get there, as close to there as they\u2019re going to get. We want and need to feel effective, competent. And to do this, one has to hold both the reality of who they, our children,  might  be as much as the vision of who we believe they  can  be. Because who can really know who anyone really is?  \n\n I think I know who Fluffy is, but do I? Or do I know some things and intuit other things and make up the rest? \n\n I don\u2019t know. I just know that what I\u2019m going through lately can be summed up by Dave\u2019s two sentences: He\u2019s going to be fine. He\u2019s not going to make it. I can flip back and forth several times in a day. When I\u2019m in the former, I\u2019m golden. When I\u2019m in the latter, I\u2019m in a mine field of my own anxiety. \n\n I\u2019ve come a long way from the panic mode of the early days. Life here at Fluffy Central is breezy by comparison. But I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I still struggle with my own worry, worry about Fluffy\u2019s future, worry about my own ability to give him what he needs and find others to provide what I can\u2019t. I struggle with staying in the present with what is actually happening, teasing out my own projection from Fluffy\u2019s very in the moment concerns and how to address them calmly and with confidence. \n\n The other day was hard. Dave was out of town.  Fluffy was dysregulated. All attempts to reregulate fell flat. The sitter came and left; Fluffy bounced off the walls, yelled and threw spit bombs. I strapped on our bike helmets for a late afternoon ride on the trailgater together. The tires were flat. I couldn\u2019t find the pump. Fluffy slammed the door open and closed, over and over. I began to feel panicky. He\u2019s not getting what he needs. What if I never figure out how to give him what he needs? I threw the helmets down, stomped into the house, upturned every basket on our shelf yelling, WHERE\u2019S THE GEE DEE PUMP? I\u2019M GETTING FRUSTRATED! FLUFFY! STOP IT! STOP BANGING THAT DOOR! \n\n Fluffy tore inside and went right to his room. I calmed down. He calmed down. He came out and we went to my mom\u2019s for dinner. On the way over, I apologized for yelling, said I lost self-control. He said, and these are all direct quotes because as soon as I got to my mom\u2019s, I grabbed pad and pen and scribbled it down: \n\n That\u2019s okay mommy, I have something called a Break Section.  I used that. Sometimes when you lose self control or when I\u2019m upset, I use my Break Section. It\u2019s a place in my mind. When I go there, I\u2019m a million miles away. \n \nWow, I said. \n\n Yes. I developed it when I was five. I didn\u2019t tell you about it. It wasn\u2019t as powerful then and I didn\u2019t have a name for it and I didn\u2019t use it as often. But I had it. \n\n Wow, I said again. I\u2019m so interested in your Break Section.  \n\n Yes. When I\u2019m in my Break Section, I do hear what you\u2019re saying but you want to know why I don\u2019t always answer you? Because I\u2019m busy being in my Break Section. Not talking makes my Break Section work more powerfully.  \n \nIs that where you go when you\u2019re in your room? \n\n Yes. I like to lie down on the bed. I can do it sitting up but it\u2019s more powerful when I let my muscles go, when I give in to gravity. I like to lie down so I don\u2019t have to work my muscles at all. It works better when I\u2019m very comfortable. \n\n When do you go to your Break Section? \n\n When I want to feel good or to calm down. Mom, do you have a Break Section? You should have a Break Section. It helps you get through life. You know what it does, mom? A Break Section helps you deal with what you\u2019ve got. \n\n Wow. \n\n There\u2019s only one sentence. I\u2019m gonna write it in the palm of my hand like the answers to a scary test question so I can look at it every time I get nervous:  Fluffy is going to be fine.  He\u2019s  already  fine.  \n\n But I\u2019m not going to make it unless I work on my Break Section.  \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/07/break-section.html", "title": "Break Section"},

We, and by that I mean organisms in general, are a sturdy resourceful lot and those who capture it all on film, who stand on mountains of bat poop while cockroaches crawl by the hundreds into their tyvek suits, inspire and impress and somehow make it easier for me to tackle the hard things in my own much smaller, much less exotic life. \n\n At the tail end of last night's viewing, Fluffy let go of his  Bug Out Bob  and clutched his underwear, his penis held firmly between his hands under the white cotton hood of his big boy undies. And this is what he said: \n\n Look! My penis is sticking up. My penis is sticking up straight like a gun! Hey. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a bone in it! Huh. It\u2019s also like it\u2019s made of rubber. \n\n My son the observer, the experimenter, the reporter.

{"date": "May 26, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t This post of part of the Mother-Talk Blog Bonanza inspired by the book,  Parenting Beyond Belief , edit by Dale McGowan. Please go  here  to read more thoughts by bloggers on this complicated topic.  \n\n \n\n \n\n My parents didn\u2019t talk about God, to a fault. If anyone believed in God we snickered. It was considered foolish, weak. They did me a disservice in this area. But that's for a post for another day.  \n\n Today, I don\u2019t know what I think of God. No organized religion speaks to me as a foundation for how to live my life. The closest thing I\u2019ve found was described in  The Secret , the notion of putting out what you want to draw in. Because when I feel open, when I have softness, when I have wonder and optimism, I feel strong not weak; I have oodles to spare; I have generosity of spirit, and well, maybe that\u2019s my religion. I\u2019m not always in that place but it\u2019s what I strive for and what I believe in. \n\n I want to teach Fluffy about people, about the world, about how to live happily, fully, joyfully and peacefully in this world. I want to teach Fluffy about religions, about what some people believe, and not shy away from the issue of faith, of believing in that which cannot be seen, only felt. One of the best things about being a parent is learning as I go, the way I\u2019ve learned about space and the planets in our solar system orbiting around the mighty sun. I hope I am teaching what I keep learning, to be curious about the ways we are all different, to recognize ourselves in both what we admire and seek and what we judge and push away. \n\n Fluffy and I are having a ball lately. Despite our  rocky patch , we\u2019ve been kicking around like old pals, playing at home and in local parks, enjoying the warmer weather and each other\u2019s company as if we have all the time in the world, as if we\u2019ve been let out on summer vacation early. I\u2019ve been feeling remarkably present and grateful.  \n\n Maybe it\u2019s The Secret working in my life? The  bio-identical hormones ? The goddesses over at  Yoga Booty Ballet ? My  fish oil ? I\u2019m not sure. All I know is the 5HTP has been packed away for a couple of weeks and I\u2019m feeling so in love with life, it has me weeping with joy at Applebee\u2019s. \n\n I know. Applebee's. Need I say more about why we need to move? \n\n Fluffy says the french fries there are the best in town. He loves the way they fold the kid menu into a pocket and tuck four fresh crayons inside. He loves that he can order for himself: a side of fries and a caesar salad. He loves that I let him essentially drink the ketchup. He loves when I sit by his side. He loves to eat everything with his hands. Everything. He hasn\u2019t really mastered the use of utensils or napkins and so we sit on one side of the plastic booths at Applebee's, both of us draped in a jumpsuit of paper napkins. \n\n Earlier this week, as Fluffy slurped his ketchup, I sat beside him in a torn slit on that seat at Applebee's, surrounded by saddles and cheaply framed movie stills and street signs, under the hanging fake tiffanies and cardboard mobiles advertising frosty drinks and scary shrimp dishes, and I was awash in gratitude. I leaned over to kiss Fluffy on the head. I closed my eyes and got a lump in my throat.  \n\n The waitress walked by, singing along with the music and I cried, thinking, she has\u00a0a dream! The couple across the way, teens, on what looked like a first date, the girl fixing her dress when she thought he wasn't looking, seemed so vulnerable and dear. I cried. The group of ladies in front of us, four of them, old as the hills, ordered the special with the courage and zeal of those sampling monkey brains. I cried.\u00a0 \n\n Later that night as Fluffy and I were cuddling in bed he said,  Mommy, even though you sometimes make mistakes and sometimes we have a misunderstanding and sometimes you do things for no reason, the love I have for you can never get smaller. It can only grow.  Cried. \n\n I feel lucky lately. I feel moved by this life. Some things are still out of balance but I have faith. Is this my religion? This Secretizing? This willingness to ask, believe, receive? To not linger with my negative thoughts, including criticism of me and others? on how I\u2019ve felt let down? how I let myself down? the ways I bully myself? the tension about accomplishment? inviting the balance of letting go of achievement while allowing myself to grow to my full potential? \n\n I don't know. Maybe that's why I can't get on board with any ONE religion that tells me this and that about what to think or feel or believe. The movie, The Secret was silly in parts, goofy and flawed and overly concerned with lusting after necklaces and sports cars. It's true. But the message was powerful and guiding, for me, and it's one I hope to convey to my son, not just in my words but in how he sees me live my life.  \n\n Simply this: a willingness to say yes, to keep one\u2019s heart open, if you will allow me this cursive flowery image, to be like a planet, orbiting the brilliant sun or like a sunflower, turning its blossom up, tracking the fire across the sky.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.parentingbeyondbelief.com/", "http://mother-talk.com/wp/?p=72", "http://thesecret.tv/", "http://www.amazon.com/Ageless-Naked-Truth-Bioidentical-Hormones/dp/0307237249", "http://www.beachbody.com/jump.jsp?itemID=79&itemType=GATEWAY", "http://www.vitacost.com/Carlson-Norwegian-Cod-Liver-Oil-High-In-EPA-DHA"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/my_parents_didn.html", "title": "Parenting Beyond Belief"},
{"date": "May 29, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t It made me think of how our culture is scared of the sadness, the grief, loss. We tolerate it for a short time, sometimes even lean into it, let it lean into us, and then it's time to get over it, let it go.  \n\n But can and should everything be let go? Completely? I think of Peggy Orentstein's beautiful book,  Waiting for Daisy , and how we have no word for the children we never birthed, for those miscarried and aborted. I know some may bristle at the mention of those two outcomes side by side but they both represent something real: a child that was going to be and then wasn't. There is loss in both places even when one happens to you and one you choose. I have much more to say about her book; it deserves a read and then a reread; it certainly deserves its own post.  \n\n My friend needs to be sad today, to step into the grief. I know the feeling. I don't think I'll ever get over not having a second child. I wish that weren't the case and I'm open to feeling differently one day. Though the hurt swells and recedes, it is always there. \n\n It's odd that what we lose stays with us. Sometimes I wish it  could  be let go,  could  disappear like a balloon on a windy day but even then we would all be left holding the strings that were once attached to what we had and what we never had.  \n\n My friend is holding her string today. I think these little strings are part of the whole package, like those DO NOT REMOVE tags or errants threads at the seam of a handknit sweater. I don't need her to let it go. She's too far away for me to get to her side, but I want her to know I'm over here and I'm holding my own string.  \n\n It's with me as I watch my niece and nephew. It's with me as my friend mentions trying for her second. It's with me as Fluffy and I meet siblings at the playground. It's with me as I type this.  \n\n I think it's getting smaller as time goes by but I can't say for sure. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1596910178/bookstorenow79-20"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/a_friend_of_min.html", "title": "A friend of mine is sad today"},

I've been using the time I normally alot to the internet for other things like: reading a real live book I can hold in my hands, pawing through my Sunday New York Times, attempting to log 10,000 steps a day on my new  Omron Walking Style pedometer , shaking my thang to the bongo beat of the goddesses of  Yoga Booty Ballet  and the project I feel the most enthusiasm for--staring off into space while sitting on the couch.  \n\n So far, it's everything it's cracked up to be.  \n\n I will be back with reports on gardening and various other Fluffy-related stories and updates. \n\n \nIn the meantime, pluck this nugget of wisdom from my own foolish experience: Do not read  What's Smaller Than a Pygmy Shrew  at bedtime.  \n\n There are some books that calm and soothe, that prepare one for quieting the mind in preparation, for turning off the churning soup of imagination and musings on the mystery of life and the universe. This is not it. \n\n Fluffy and I tucked ourselves in and opened up this book and read about how all things in life are made of atoms which are mindblowingly tiny and comprised of electrons zooming around a central nucleus housing protons and neutrons which are the stuff of even smaller particles called quarks which tiny as they are, happen to be 600 times LARGER than the circling electrons which need space, man, I'm telling you, SPACE and since atoms, like the infinite space we on planet earth are falling through at a pretty fast clip this very instant, are mostly MADE of space, so much space that if an atom were the size of a house, the nucleus around which it would be swirling would be smaller than the size of a grain of sand. \n\n La la! \n\n Okay then, goodnight, sweetheart!

{"date": "June 22, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Last night, Fluffy invited the neighbor kids to toast marshmallows with him over our solstice fire in the new fire pit to celebrate the start of summer. \n\n I\u2019ll let that sink in for a minute. \n\n MY SON INVITED THE NEIGHBOR KIDS OVER TO HIS HOUSE. \n\n It was entirely his idea.  \n\n For those of you following along at home, you'll know this is huge. For others just tuning in, this is the first time my six and almost a half year old son has asked to be have another child come over for any length of time, ever. \n\n We were finishing up our dinner. Dave dashed to the store to buy marshmallows for toasting. I thought it would be a perfect thing to usher in the summer evenings. I love sitting around a fire, watching the dancing flames, the embers pulsing, listening to the sounds of night falling as the wood crackles and snaps. Fluffy had never toasting marshmallows before and he was excited.  \n\n He chewed his last bite of pizza and then looked pensive. \n\n \u201cMom? I\u2019m going to go next door and ask O. if he want to come join us and toast marshmallows.\u201d \n\n O is almost eight. He and his sister, going on eleven, live in the house next door.  Oh!  I exclaimed,  Great idea! \n\n Fluffy was pantless, as he can often be. As he flew to the front door, I called out to him,  Put on some pants!  OKAY MOM! he shouted. I\u2019ve never seen him find pants in his dresser so fast, that and shoes for his feet. He was down the steps, through our gate and crunching across the gravel on our driveway like superman out of the phone booth, down the street and into the air. \n\n I spied through our trellis. Sound carries easily between our yards. He knocked. He knocked again. I saw him look in and then look near the door and find the buzzer. He rang it. O. and his sister came to the door.  \n\n \u201cWould you like to come over and toast marshmallows on our solstice bonfire, O.?\u201d \n\n They said they were eating dinner. \n\n \u201cWould you like to come over after you\u2019re done with dinner? \n\n They said they would. \n\n \u201cHow long will it be before you\u2019re done with dinner?\u201d \n\n They allowed that it would take about ten minutes. \n\n It was a plan.  \n\n \u201cE, you can come, too!\u201d Fluffy said just before he tore home and reported in.  \n\n We filled the new fire pit with wood from our little wild back marsh. Fluffy helped me light the crumbled paper balls. Dave cut small branches, widdled the ends into a point and seared the tips in the flames.  \n\n The guests arrived. Fluffy\u2019s guests. Fluffy\u2019s solstice party guests. \n\n The kids toasted marshmallows. Some of them caught on fire, the marshmallows, not the kids though we had one close call. Another sailed off the deck and landed in a sticky blaze on our snow tube, abandoned below. Marshmallows dripped on some hair, a shoulder, the edge of the pit but most of it went in mouths. \n\n Yup. My son has some kids over.

You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity: Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond. A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  \n\n A review of the Department's files shows that no permits have been issued. Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Pennsylvania Compiled Laws, annotated. The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream locations. We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted. The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2006.  \n\n Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff. Failure to comply with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action. We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter. \n\n Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions. \n\n Sincerely, \n\n David L. Price District Representative and Water Management Division. \n\n \n\n \nAnd here is the response sent back by Mr. DeVries: Re: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec. 20; Lycoming County: \n\n \n Dear Mr. Price,  \nYour certified letter dated 12/17/02 has been handed to me to respond to. I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget Lane, Trout Run, Pennsylvania. A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood 'debris' dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond. While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their skillful use of natures building materials 'debris.' I would like to challenge your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic. As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity. My first dam question to you is: \n\n (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers, or \n\n (2) do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request?  \n\n If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued. Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Pennsylvania Compiled Laws, annotated.  \n\n I have several concerns. My first concern is, aren't the beavers entitled to legal representation? The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said representation -- so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer. The Department's dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event, causing flooding, is proof that this is a natural occurrence, which the Department is required to protect. In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling their dam names. If you want the stream 'restored' to adam free-flow condition please contact the beavers--but if you are going to arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter, they being unable to read English.  \n\n In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water flows downstream. They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy Spring Pond. If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams). So, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more elevated enforcement action right now. Why wait until 1/31/2006? The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.  \n\n In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention to a real environmental quality, health, problem in the \narea. It is the bears! Bears are actually defecating in our woods. I definitely believe you should be \npersecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone. If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! The bears are not careful where they dump! Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. THANK YOU. \n\n Ryan DeVries & the Dam Beavers \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/06/dam-funny.html", "title": "Dam Funny "},
{"date": "June 11, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy and I went to the beach this afternoon. The sand was warm under the streaming sun as it stretched out to hold the bay in the dampened crook of its elbow. School\u2019s still in session; the summer crowds have not yet descended and so we camped in a lazy and scattered way, our blanket next to the freshly painted life guard throne, our basket ten feet away, our shoes tossed off one and then the other still more feet ahead, our toys spilled out of mouth of the plastic crochet sack by the lip of the sinking wave.  \n\n  A mother and daughter we met on the beach last year arrived by chance. The girl ran to Fluffy, inviting him to make turnovers in the sand. Fluffy was momentarily intrigued and followed her to a freshly dug hole filled with salt water. He looked and, seeing nothing edible, returned to his game, his solitary game, of pushing mounds of wet sand into hills of dry sand with his hands splayed and touching at their heels to the soundtrack of missiles and exploding bombs. \n\n The mother sat down with me. I learned her daughter is completing her first year at a private preschool where they don\u2019t tolerate anyone stepping out of line. Her daughter began the year scribbling wildly across and page and now colors neatly in the lines. Her daughter has befriended the meanest girl in the class, a feisty four year old who tells her, you\u2019re the stupidest girl in the class; no one likes you; you\u2019re the only one here who has no brothers or sisters. I can\u2019t believe they start so young with that, the mother said, shaking her head.  \n\n Soon, the mother\u2019s father arrived and the three of them left to walk the length of the beach which, at the northernmost point, is interrupted by a river that churns and swirls the water in confused tides near the nesting place of piper plovers.   \n\n Fluffy continued his game as Dave arrived. In a fit of uncharacteristic recklessness, he had purchased an electronic hair buzzer in the middle of his work day and mowed off his hair without so much as a cursory glance at the instructions. We have no hand mirrors. There were gullies and patches of longer angry looking hairs jutting out at the back and around his ears. He was grinning ear to ear, like he was heading towards his parole officer, thinking up an excuse for his latest infraction. Fluffy looked at him and said, Who are you?  \n\n The beach was glorious,  like a tonic  a friend of mine would have said. We stayed and stayed and when we got hungry I fetched take out which we ate on the blanket as a woman in a peach colored bathing cap swam laps parallel to and about a hundred feet from the water\u2019s edge.  \n\n When it was time to go, Dave and I gathered our things, leaving the bagged sand toys next to Fluffy\u2019s shoes for him to carry. Time to go, we said again. Fluffy was running after seagulls, tossing sand and small pebbles at their retreating dangling feet. Eating dysregulates him, Dave said. I wish someone would fly down and tell me what the fuck I ought to feed him, I said.  \n\n We waited for him to notice we were almost to the ramp leading toward the parking lot. He was crawling around now, looking up. We motioned toward the bag and he ran off in that direction but on his way, dropped to his knees again, looking down in the sand.  \n\n I tell you, this is Stage 2 stuff. He ought to be coming along with us, I said. Kids need to run around, blow off some steam, Dave said. I know but he\u2019s not even checking to see where we are, I said. \n\n We waited. We watched. We started walking up the ramp, still waiting and watching. Finally he looked up and raced toward us, saying something. We pointed to the bag. He ran back, got the bag, put on his shoes and tromped to where we stood.  \n\n Mommy! Mommy! I got you this! I found this for you! Did you wonder what I was doing? Why I was taking so long? Well, first I was throwing sand at the seagulls and then I was throwing rocks at them and then I got the idea to look for a rock, for a special rock to take home and then I thought of finding a rock for you, a heart shaped rock for your rock collection that you could always have because I know you love them and then I found this one and it isn\u2019t exactly a heart but it\u2019s almost one and here it is. It\u2019s for you! \n \nThere I was, analyzing and fretting while my son was busy living.  \n\n I took that heart shaped rock in my hand and my beautiful boy in my arms and strode to the car with my dangerous ex-con husband. \n\n Sometimes a run on the beach is just a run on the beach. \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/06/sometimes_a_run.html", "title": "Sometimes a run on the beach is just a run on the beach"},
{"date": "May 03, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t 1. Fluffy got the shot.  \n\n 2. Dave got the medication.  \n\n 3. I got the bra. 34D. \n\n 4. Preliminary blood test results look very good. \n\n 5. Ages ago, Dave bought  The Trailgater , a phenomenal contraption that attaches adult bikes to kid bikes and makes a sort of bicycle built for two. Fluffy still has to pedal and hold on, but it allows us to go virtually anywhere with little worries about safety.  \n\n 6. Today, Dave took it off. Fluffy rode his two wheeler with training wheels to the neighborhood park and back.  \n\n 7. Dave said he fell a number of times. Each time, he climbed back on. \n\n 8. One of the falls took him off the curb, over the handlebars and onto the pavement.  \n\n 9. He cried a bit. And then got back on. \n\n 10. !!!!! \n\n 11. During one of their sessions, the Asperger Specialist asked Fluffy if he had a best friend.  Does it have to be human?  he asked. No, she replied.  Then, it's my dog, Beegu , he answered.  \n\n 12. A couple of months ago, we made \"Break Cards\" for everyone in the family. Dave drew cartoons of each of us, relaxing. Fluffy and I cut them out, laminated them and stuck a dab of velcro on the back. They hang from a velcro strip above Fluffy's white board in the upstairs hallway.  \n\n 13. Last night, I was monster mommy. It wasn't about Aspergers per se; it was simple mommy fatigue. I JUST WANTED THE DAY TO BE OVER. At one point, I yanked my break card from the board, announced, \"I'm taking a break!\" and charged into my office, slamming the door. Fluffy immediately ripped his break card off, said, \"I'm taking a break, too!\" and charged into  his  room, slamming the door.  \n\n 14. A few minutes later, I came out and knocked on his door. \"Come in!\" he sang from the bed where he was studying his new notebook, the ones we bought at his request. \n\n 15. I said I was feeling much calmer after my break and apologized for getting mad, for slamming the door. I said I was having a hard night. He said he was too.  Mommy? We were like two pit bulls growling and trying to bite each other. \n \n\n 16. We snuggled in bed and read a chapter of  Friendship According to Humphrey . \n\n \n\n It's narrated by Humphrey, a classroom pet hamster who worries about the kids in his class, struggles with his feelings of jealousy over the new classroom pet, a frog named Og, and records his thoughts in a notebook he hides behind the mirror in his cage. Fluffy loves this book.  \n\n 17. When it was time for lights out, he said,  The reason I used to not like having so many thoughts was because I couldn't write them down.  He asked if could write something in his notebook right then. Writing and drawing are still very hard for him. Every time he asks to do either, I try to say yes.  \n\n It took a while but he came up with two sentences. I sounded out the words. The letter-making and spelling were entirely his own. Here's what he wrote:  \n\n BEEGU IS THE GRATEST DOG IN THE WRLD. \n\n EVN ON A HARD DAY, IT CEN BE NIS. \n\n 18. Last night I felt worried and weepy. \n\n 19. Tonight I feel as sappy as they come, wanting to sit by my son's bed and gaze at his sleeping face all night, wanting to soak it in, soak all of it in. \n\n 20. We're off to Mexico. Hope y'all have a great week.  \n\n Here's to soaking it in; wherever you are. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wheelies.co.uk/accessories/accDetail.asp?accID=112", "http://www.amazon.com/Friendship-According-Humphrey-Betty-Birney/dp/0399242643"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/twenty_things.html", "title": "twenty things at nearly ten"},

{"date": "May 17, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Thank you,  MOM-NOS , for the Thinking Blogger award. However, I certainly don\u2019t feel like much of a thinker. I\u2019m not the intellectual type, not an academic. I\u2019m more the gal who posts pictures of her butt crack on the internet to the soundtrack of beer cans being crushed on foreheads.  \n  \nI think that about sums me up--I\u2019m going up and down the slide of life, weee! weee! over and over again, flashing my rear to the world while you all, er, progress from pool to pool. Okay, the metaphor doesn\u2019t hold up, but you know what I mean.  \n\n According to the rules of Thinking Blogger, I am to nominate fellow bloggers for this award and include links to the posts they wrote that made me think. I can\u2019t do this. Not because I haven\u2019t read thought-provoking posts on other sites, no no! Quite the opposite! There are far too many of them! So many bloggers are out there, writing moving, scathing, riotous, fiercely independent and brilliant posts, bloggers writing books, bloggers publishing books, bloggers reading books! And me? It takes me a full 5 minutes to read the labels on my syringes of bioidentical hormones each morning to make sure I don\u2019t grow a beard on my eye where it might interfere with the crushing of beer cans. \n\n I can\u2019t figure out where y\u2019all are finding the time.  \n\n I keep thinking I have to put writing aside until Fluffy goes off to Rocket Pilot School in 12 years. I don\u2019t seem to be able to write and parent and remediate the autism and cook and keep up with household tasks and stay somewhat in touch with my husband or whomever that is snoring in the bed and flushing his sinuses at the sink or is he snoring at the sink and flushing his sinuses in bed? I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t keep up.  \n\n I applaud those of you who are able to parent and write and publish and post and read blogs and find new blogs and add those to your list of reads. And there seem to be many of you. Me? I find I have to turn the computer off at around 9:30 when Dave jogs by me with the Fluffy baton and stay off until sometime after Fluffy\u2019s sawing zzzzs, around 9:30 pm because if I don\u2019t? I\u2019m not really here, I\u2019m not really present. I\u2019m checking to see who\u2019s posted or who\u2019s commented or who\u2019s emailed me another Viagra ad with an even sneakier subject line.  \n\n So, thank you again, MOM-NOS. You certainly have broadened my view, time and time again. As have  Estee  and  Marrit  and  Julie  and  Bee  and so many many more of you.  \n\n And let\u2019s not forget laughing--in my book, even more important than thinking. Thinking doesn\u2019t boost the immune system; thinking doesn\u2019t mend a broken heart.

{"date": "June 13, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Tonight Dave and I went on a date. Four hours. Movie and dinner. It was the longest date we've had since last summer. \n\n We saw  Knocked Up . I love that Judd Apatow. I got knocked up once.  It took me twelve years and a team of specialists and this gal did it in one crazy drunken night but hey, a baby is a baby and seeing this one come out made me cry just like I always do regardless of how silly or slapstick or realistic the movie portrayal of childbirth is. This one was pretty darn good. They even had a real live shot of a baby crowning.  \n\n In any case, when I told Fluffy that Daddy and Mommy were going out on a date for some special time to see a grown up movie and he was going to have special playtime and a dinner out with my mom, he seemed pleased. Huh. As we were leaving, he raced to the door and called out,  I hope you have a great time at the movies, Mommy! \n\n We did have a great time at the movies and then we went out to dinner and had a great time there. I stared at my husband's face as he talked, occasionally stealing glances at his newly shaved head which is very chemo and not at all  Jack Johnson  which is what he had hoped for although he looks adorable even with a five o'clock shadow on his melon because how could he not?  \n\n I didn't check in with my mom once. \n\n When we returned, Fluffy raced to us.  How was the movie? Did you have a great time? What did you see? What was it about?  I told him, which led to discussions about his birth and babyhood and where did he sleep and did he cry and cry a lot when he was little and didn't yet know how to talk and tell me what he wanted? Oh yes, I said. He smiled and said,  I'm so glad you have a good time at your movie, Mommy . Later, while brushing teeth with Dave he said,  It makes me feel happy inside to think of you and Mommy having fun at the movies.  \n\n He and my mom had a ball. At the restaurant, Fluffy kept peering over the edge of the booth to observe, flirt, and report in on the kids there. No sneering or jeering, just curiosity and interest, typical kid stuff.  \n\n Tomorrow, we're all off to a 3-day  Enki Education  homeschoolers workshop called  Rousing Intuition . It's 3 hours away in New Hampshire on a lake. Dave will be on child-care duty and I will rouse my intution with the other homeschooling grown-ups.  \n\n And now, I must get ready. It's meant to be blazing hot and freezing there with sun and rain expected so all I need to do is tip the house sideways and pour the contents into a bag. There (hands slapping together). All packed. \n\n Back on the weekend when I hope to post about a phenomenal documentary I saw at the Newport Film Festival called,  Autism: The Musical . It's a beautiful film. I hear 10% of the profits will go to Autism Speaks. Maybe this is a chance for them to redeem themselves, re: Autism Every Day.  \n\n   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.knockedupmovie.com/", "http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/main.asp?page=bio.asp?NavId=9", "http://www.enkieducation.org/", "http://www.enkieducation.org/html/event_alternative_education.htm#20070613a", "http://www.autismthemusical.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/06/tonight_a_date.html", "title": "Tonight, a date"},
{"date": "May 16, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Last night, Fluffy called our dog, Beegu, a \u201csoft piece of darkness\u201d. That\u2019s what he said as he brushed by her black curly form in the nighttime of his bedroom on his way back to try one more time to settle down for sleep.  \n\n And what can a mother say about that? What could be wrong when your son utters phrases that describe something real and something metaphoric, something simple and so profoundly true about life?  \n\n That is what I am looking for--not a way to dispel my darkness but to find the soft places it holds within.  \n\n Some pics from the vacation: \n\n \nMy generous mom who treated us to this wonderful Mexican adventure, with us at the dolphin swim experience. \n\n \n \nFluffy, riding the mama dolphin. He was the only kid in the group and he did a phenomenal job. \n\n \n \nMy mom and sister on their way to secure a grass umbrella on the soft sandy beach. \n\n \n \nMe, climbing into thin air. At first, it was exhilarating, then terrifying, then thrilling, and finally... \n\n   \n\n the flight was over and I was back to exhilarated. \n\n Speaking of exhilaration, one of the many pools at this resort had a water slide that Fluffy adored. This one was not as tall and terrifying as similar ones in a larger pool that we both flew down the first day there, not realizing they were meant for MUCH older kids, adults, really,  but it was big enough to make us scream every time we rode it and one day, that was about thirty times.  \n\n Truly.  \n\n We climbed the stairs fashioned like an Incan ruin, inserted outselves at the mouth, shaped like the neck of a giant serpent, slid along the slick stone, emerged from the hissing mouth and plunged into the water over and over again. Fluffy went on his own once or twice, with me at the bottom, treading water, ready to rescue him from the depths if necessary, but mostly we went together, Fluffy on my lap.  \n\n After a while, people were looking over, watching us pull ouselves out of the pool and make our ascent. Yup. That's my son, I was thinking, the enthusiast! I was feeling proud of him, wrapped in that wonderful feeling of involvement and joy and fun. Again! again! again! After a while, Dave joined us and we all went up to our room to wash and change for dinner. I turned to the kitchen and Dave said, honey? I think I'm seeing more than I should be seeing. And then he showed me this: \n\n \nA brand new suit. Couldn't take the Incan heat. \n\n And lastly: \n\n \n\n We foolishly forgot the stroller, a must I'd say, for traveling in the airport, waiting on custom's and security lines. On the way home, I nabbed this luggage cart. I highly recommend it for those of you similarly braindead parents. In fact, I could write a small book on how to survive a 13-hour travel day, door to door, and top on the list would be a stroller. Also, a hat, an iPod, earphones, portable fryolater, ketchup drip, and the sense to ask every line tender to let you go ahead of the masses because of your child's special needs. We did this on the way home and it was a life saver. It caused a few heads to turn, a number of gasps and tsk tsks, and even one person to clutch their bosom and say,  oh! it makes you thank GOD for your own kids!  as they sadly shook their heads. No matter. Let them think what they will. My Fluffy had his wheels, his fries, beloved ketchup and teeny tiny movie screen thanks to the newest iPod that Dave had the sense to buy before we left. \n\n There were many more pictures, some adorable ones of my sister's son who made me laugh more than I have in ages, and some lovely ones of my brother and his beautiful family. I may post them later once I have permission. \n\n It was a fantastic treat with many more soft places than not, but yes, some darkness too. Somewhere along the way, it feels like it's not okay to say things are hard, that one must either be signing onto devastation and nightmare or writing in flowery cursive about life, about autism, about anything.  \n\n If there's anything I hope to get from writing here in this blog, it would be reclaiming the whole picture, allowing myself a place to write about the good, the bad, and the messy, not for sympathy, not for applause, but simply because when I read it, hear it, and see it around me, I feel like we're in it together, like a cross-country bicycle trip. I don't need to be up ahead the whole time; I need to be in all the places, cheering you on, broken down on the dusty roadside, red-faced and pushing my damn bike up the hill, happily chatting as I pedal right in the middle of the pack, yanking off my gloves and quitting forever, rallying the troops, crying as I nurse my blistered heels, all of it. And I need to look around and see all that in my fellow travelers. I just do. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/a_soft_piece_of.html", "title": "A Soft Piece of Darkness"},

Staring at a blank monitor isn't working nor is harsh self-talk, putting my nose to the grindstone, ignoring it completely, or running in tight circles. I'm blocked and that's that. \n\n Could be I'm simply sad. Sad sad sad that I'm not having another baby. My husband, though game for child REN  when we first married, changed his mind soon after Fluffy was born. I've been trying to change it back ever since. I've spent the last six years debating, arguing, cajoling, performing, understanding, waiting, plotting, fantasizing. I even wondered allowed to my sister--Is it WRONG to get hormone injections at the Infertility Clinic without your husband's consent? Is it honest and truly immoral to give him the blow job of his life, race to the bathroom, spit back into a sterlized olive jar and then dash off in the car on a just remembered errand? ie off for a quick insemination? a sort of drive through jiffy lube?  \n\n The husband is firm. No more kids. No more IVF cycles. No adoption. No foster care. No lap dogs in tiny bows and sequined jackets. No  frightening dolls . No. \n\n I've had my hands full the last six years. It's true. I haven't had an enormous amount of time to devote to another entire human being. Lord knows I'm barely keeping up with my own needs. I've tried to use that as salve enough. Who am I kidding, right? What with the writing and the remediating the autism and the plucking of facial hairs, I mean that  alone  is like a full time job.  \n\n But it hasn't worked. As much as I've worked it through intellectually, I've hung on to the hope that somehow, SOMEHOW, it would happen. I'd get pregnant. Some fluke, like those menapausal grandmothers that burst with one last beautiful blossom in their fifties; a change of heart--my husband would hand me a card and lo and behold, a handmade certificate would gently helicopter down to the floor by my feet, the words: This Coupon Redeemable For One Last IVF Attempt gleaming, lifting my chest by its heavy hands and gliding it through the scented air; a sweep of largesse from the gods and one day I'd sip my coffee, blanch at the taste, the smell, and stagger to the sidewalk to retch in front of the family of five, the mother and I locking eyes and smiles,  Congratulations!  she'd say with her knowing eyes; or perhaps a shift of possibility, a bolt of lightening in our front yard, our infantile japanese maple split impossibly, neatly in two at the moment that my husband drops his glasses and THEY crack, and then he lifts them to his face and shakes his head no, no, this doesn't fit, this can't be right, where are all the children? the children that should be slamming our front door screen on this summer day as they run in and out and in and out, breathless with reports of fireflies or some injustice? \n\n But no. None of it happened. And in less than three months I will be 48.  \n\n My motherhood has been blocked.  \n\n Motherblock.  \n\n Writer's block.  \n\n No more creating for me. \n\n I know. I'm too dramatic. I'll come out of it. But for now, I lay barren. I look out the rim of my eyeballs and I see flat, dry lands, my halved heart framing the landscape. \n\n I'm sad. \n\n I'm thirsty. \n\n Cheers. \n  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://walkthewine.blogspot.com/2006/04/writers-block.html", "http://collectdolls.about.com/b/a/081847.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/07/blocked.html", "title": "Blocked"},

{"date": "May 17, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I was thinking about choking on the way home from the aquarium with Fluffy. I wasn\u2019t thinking about it, as in, hey, I could really go for some choking. It was more my usual, what if Fluffy suddenly started choking as we were speeding along the highway? What would I do? \n\n I took the First Aid course at the hospital when I was pregnant with Fluffy. I learned about the Heimlich and the two-finger swipe. I turned that baby doll over like a champ, slapped it on the back, turned it back over and, yup, clean as a whistle. \n\n See, this is the thing: it wasn\u2019t a REAL baby. It wasn\u2019t a REAL child dummy. There wasn\u2019t a real  human being in sight during that whole 45 minute class, other than the very nice man with the bandaids. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be okay dealing with a knife wound, a gun shot, a blow to the head, even a broken bone, but choking? It puts me into a panic every time I even think about it. \n\n Especially with my son. He\u2019s not a big chewer. Things go down pretty much the way they look on the plate. I make sure to cut what I can but a sandwich? I use soft bread and thin interiors. I\u2019m only just now giving him access to grapes off the vine. I used to cut them, lengthwise, of course. My husband recklessly cuts them across the waist, producing two kid-size throat plugs with every slice.  \n\n What I wondered today, as we zoomed by the spring trees awash in lush hues of green, was why don\u2019t we get to practice on actual people? I don\u2019t mean members of the audience, bending this way and that, miming the gestures of one gagging on a chicken bone, I mean someone ACTUALLY choking? Then I could learn how to truly save the choker's life. That would go a long way toward quelling my anxiety around feeding my son food and being near him while he eats it.  \n\n We do a lot of noshing in the car. I pass back a steady stream of snacks at 60 mphs. Fluffy thinks all Drive-Throughs looks like the space between the driver and passenger seats. If he were to suddenly turn blue, I  know  I could get to the shoulder without causing an accident; I\u2019m  sure  I\u2019d be out the door and by his side in a heartbeat;  you can bet  I\u2019d have him out of his belt and booster and in my arms in no time, but then what? Run around in circles? What I do now in those moments of near choking is drop whatever I\u2019m holding and scream, DAVE! But there? Alone with my son? By the side of the road? Even if he had the stereo way down, I doubt Dave would hear me. \n\n So. Who would these people be? These choking people? Hmmm, if  only  we had a group of people, amassed  somewhere , in the same general  location , maybe even with the same sort of  job , coming together on a regular  basis  so we could easily sweep them up, say, during staff meetings? In an office, say, an egg-shaped office, er, what shape is that really. Oh, yes! Oval! We could sequester them, and slip things in their wide open mouths, you know, as they said things, non-sensical things about home security and freedom, intelligent design and gas prices, etc. etc., just plop things in--chunks of apples, ragged pieces of steak, improperly sliced grapes, foot-long hot dogs--and let the training begin.  \n\n THAT would be a public service. \n\n Then mothers like me across the land could feed our children pigs in a blanket on the interstate and hum along with our purring Subarus. What could be more American? \n\n \n\n   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/an_first_aid_id.html", "title": "A First Aid Idea?"},

{"date": "May 21, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t i was making dinner. it was 4:30. fluffy and i had just returned from our afternoon at the playground and a trip to the grocery store for dinner supplies. dave was outside, spreading the mulch. beegu was lurking, licking all available surfaces. french fries were in the oven. fluffy was on the rug, a pirate puzzle pieces strewn about.  \n\n the phone rang. i answered it.  \n\n what was i thinking? \n\n i rarely answer the phone when i\u2019m with fluffy. it just doesn\u2019t work. but today, i did answer it. happily, it was my dear friend,  kim .  \n\n kim had a story to tell. fluffy interrupted in a steady stream. the timer went off. i paused my conversation to check on the fries. fluffy wanted them  right then , assuring me  they were ready . i said, close but they needed three more minutes. i reset the timer, said i\u2019d be off the phone when they were done and went back to patient kim. when i turned around, fluffy was pulling at his fingers and the oven was now set for 10 minutes.  \n\n i paused the conversation again to deal with this breach of behavior and the exasperation mounted as fluffy whipped out every verbal trick in the book--he really IS a supreme negotiator (which made me remember my 6th grade teacher who called me f. lee bailey) AND i let myself get caught up in the whole, complicated discussion rather than pull down the sash of mommy silence and wear the serious expression of thin lips and high eyebrows.  \n\n the timer reset again to now two minutes, i returned to the ever-saintly kim only to see fluffy, from the other side of the kitchen island, fling an opened bag of grated parmesan cheese to and fro like a cheerleader, sending a pound of romano down in a three-foot radius, like lusty italian snow.  \n\n i lost it. \n\n GOD DAMN IT! i yelled, hanging up on kim and ushering fluffy and beegu, now under a coat of cheese, out the front door. i shut the door and stormed back to the scene of the crime, sticky beige footprints trailing behind me. i could hear fluffy outside, yelling something to dave.  \n\n a few minutes later, he appeared on the back porch, nearly in tears.  \n\n it turns out, while fluffy and i had been arguing about the oven timer, beegu had wrangled the bag of cheese off the counter and was helping herself to slobbery mouthfuls. fluffy saw it and snatched the bag out of her mouth, inadvertently showering the house with its contents. it also turns out, the front door latch turned when i shut it. \n\n let\u2019s recap: my son rescued our food from the dog's filthy mouth. i swore at him and then locked him out of the house. \n\n proud times. \n\n we\u2019ve been talking about swearing a lot lately. now, i LOVE to swear but i\u2019ve been miraculously restrained in front of my son and therefore, the only swears he knows are god damn it (dave) and hell (unknown). he didn\u2019t even know hell was a swear word. he thought it was a place. well, it is a place, i said. and then he learned some words could be swears or not, depending. perhaps the most exciting thing that came out of that conversation was that one CAN say, \u201cGod  damed  that man to hell\u201d but one CANNOT say, \u201c God damn  that man to hell\u201d a distinction fluffy\u2019s gone over many many many times. \n\n the events provided a juicy opportunity to talk about everyone\u2019s point of view, what it looked like from my side of the counter, what it looked like on his side, what it might have been like for beegu, how it felt to my son when he thought i purposely locked him out of his home, how it felt to me when i thought of him on the other side of the door, trying in vain to gain entry. i apologized and apologized. we laughed about how shocking the whole thing was, even for poor kim whom i called back to offer explanations and more apologies. \n\n the good news? fluffy was remarkably flexible through it all and the Family Swear Jar was born. it sits on the counter in a dusty patch of cheese, two shiny quarters it its belly. my penalty. \n\n the end. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iamprettynyc.com/index.php"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/me_the_idiot.html", "title": "me, the idiot"},

Jennifer  launches a new column,  A Little More  at Parent Trap and in this first article, she writes bravely about fear. They are connected, of course, fear and bravery, as Vicki mentions here in  her blog .  \n\n It's a big theme lately. Maybe it always is. It's coming up a lot in my life right now. \n\n You know I've been swept up by  The Secret  phenomenon. You know I am a bit self-helpy. I just finished reading T. Harv Eker's,  Secrets of the Millionaire Mind  and say what you will but that guy knows a thing or two. He may have catchy phrases and corny workshop titles but he gets the emotionally undercurrents that drive so much of our behavior and beliefs, conscious and unconscious. I've subscribed to his weekly Millionaire Mind tips and this week it's on, yes, fear.  \n\n T. Harv says, \"Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.\" \n\n Since I attended a workshop on starting a Son-Rise program when we first found out about Fluffy's autism, I get announcements from the Option Institute from time to time. This week it's about an upcoming seminar called Fearless. \n\n Lastly,  MotherTalk  will hold its first MotherTalk Blog Bonanza tomorrow: Fearless Friday, to spread the word on Arianna Huffington's  \"Becoming Fearless\"  in which she (and here I quote from MotherTalk's annoucement) \"eloquently writes of women coming into our own and overcoming the anxieties and fears that can stand in the way of our happiness, our health, and our ability to fully participate in our lives, our relationships, our families, and in the public life of our communities and nation.\" \n\n Phew.

Bloggers everywhere will write about overcoming fear in a host of styles and situations. Go  here  to learn more about Blog Bonanzas and to find out how to participate in future events. As Miriam says, 'the more the merrier.\"  \n\n The message is clear. We must step out of our comfort zones in order to grow. I ask Fluffy to do that every day. It's my turn. \n\n I plan to do something scary and write about it for my Fearless Friday post. I don't know what that will be yet.

{"date": "April 29, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t (Tomorrow: an update on our HANDLE appointment. I promise. I needed a week or so to let it all sink in and simmer.) \n\n \nToday was the Autism Imagine Walk, an event announced in  the flyer  Fluffy read with rapt interest a few weeks ago, the day he vowed to participate. I know it had something to do with wanting to be with his people, but if the truth be told, cotton candy was the biggest draw. The boy loves cotton candy, which he insists is  very natural, Mom, made with only one ingredient, PINK sugar.  He refuses to acknowledge that the pink got there by any means other than mother nature. \n\n He\u2019s been talking it up for weeks. He told everyone he was going to the Autism Imagine Walk  where there\u2019d be kids with Asperger brains like his, smart brains that make some things easier (math, reading) and some things harder (letting go of thoughts).  He reminded us that he would eat cotton candy  although normally he only eats cotton candy once a year at the Big Apple Circus when it comes through town in July. But this year, he would have it twice, only he\u2019s have to share it with Daddy since he could only have half a portion with some protein so that the sugar wouldn\u2019t race through his blood like wild cheetahs. \n\n Everyone heard the same things. Many times. \n\n Unfortunately, Fluffy got sick. It started out vague: his head hurt, he was feeling not right, not balanced. He couldn\u2019t go on the morning walk with Beegu, our newly  sleek and styling dog . He didn\u2019t eat Dave\u2019s famous homefries, so good they don\u2019t even need ketchup. He ate three blueberries and beat me in three successive board games while I packed a lunch, for three. By the time we piled into the car, he seemed okay--subdued but okay. \n\n \u2028We arrived once the walk was underway, parked and joined in at the end. There was quite a crowd. Fluffy rode in the stroller the whole time, a new sunhat with a ten foot-wide brim on his head. It wasn\u2019t sunny but he kept it on. A wide brim provides security. It certainly cuts the view down to a more manageable size.  \n\n By the time we completed the walk and arrived at the jumpy castles and petting zoo and made our way to the retrieve the delicate pink confection, they were sold out.  \n\n Sold out.  \n\n WHAT? I wanted to shout. HOW CAN THIS BE? But you know, I looked down at Fluffy, peering out from under his tophat flying sauce, and he was remarkably docile.  \n\n It turns out, he was about to pass out.  \n\n Dave and I, always a model of proportion and reason, stood in silouette, our hands held high against a firey sunset and vowed to get him a cotton candy if it was last thing we did on this good green earth. Or rather, we whipped out the cell phone, secured a bag at a local grocery store, zipped over there and soon our son was plucking handfuls of pink pillow stuffing and placing it on his tongue where it melted into a pool of chemical wonder. And then he fell into a coma. \n\n Not really. But he did sort of collapse. Turns out, he has 103.5 fever. But he got his cotton candy, that boy. It was like crossing the finish line at his own private Iditarod. He made it and then he was down for the count. \n\n The sickness thing is upsets me. Fluffy is never sick yet since mid-February, there\u2019s been only a handful of weeks when he\u2019s felt right.  \n\n Once the Motrin and Tylenol had been dispensed, I called the pediatrician. She seems to think it\u2019s nothing, a fluke, a \u2018bad\u2019 spell but she wants to do  blood tests to rule out a few things, Lyme Disease, among them. That was all fine. She\u2019s a very casual, hair flipping, everything\u2019s going to be fine kind of a gal. But partway through the conversation she said,  Well, now that he's in school, etc.  and I said, No, he's not. He's home with me. We\u2019re homeschooling.  \n\n Pause.  \n\n Dr.: Homeschooling? OH??? REALLY? You didn't tell me that.  \n\n Me: I'm sure I did. (I mean, what do we, get together regularly to chat? I see the woman once a year for a 6 minute check up.) I thought I mentioned that. \n\n Dr.: No. You didn\u2019t. I would have remembered that. Well, he certainly gets together with other kids, right? \n\n Me: Not that much. \n\n Dr.: But you have lots of kids in your neighborhood. He\u2019s outside playing with them, yes? \n\n Me: Um. Not really. \n\n Dr.: But, what DO YOU DO? How will he get a chance to learn how to be with other kids? YOU MUST SOCIALIZE HIM. You have to work on the social piece!!!!! \n\n And here\u2019s the thing. Astoundingly, for all, I tried something new. I ignored her completely. I paused. There was silence on the line, and then I said, Okay, so you're telling me that other kids have had this on and off sickness this winter? With fevers and all? And that it\u2019s most likely nothing to worry about? \n\n It was amazing! It\u2019s taken me 47 years to realize the power of ignoring. Wow. I didn\u2019t have to explain or defend or educate or anything! So liberating! \n\n One day, I may write this woman a note about Autism and Aspergers and encourage her to educate herself so she can better serve her patients. I don\u2019t mean a nasty note. I mean a well thought-out note about what I\u2019ve learned through our real live experience with the Aspergers in our house. \n\n But right now, my Fluffy is playing with Dave. The fever is down. He has real food in his belly.  All is well. \n\n The day was a success. I had the chance to see a woman in person I had previously only \u2018met\u2019 on the blog. We met at the Autism walk, she with her husband and two beautiful daughters, one of whom has ASD. They were so very lovely, all of them. It was an honor and a pleasure to spend part of our morning with them and I hope to keep our real-life connection going whether we stay in this neck of the woods or not. \n\n I have some more things to say about the event as a whole, about how maybe it\u2019s impossible to pull off the perfect set up when you\u2019re dealing with so many people but I will say that next year I want to be on the committee and here\u2019s what I\u2019ll suggest: \n\n Put the compressors for the bouncy castles AWAY from the animals. Loud noises frighten them. \n\n Put big cans over the compressors and attach looooooooong extension cords so they can be placed far far away from the ASD kids. Loud noises frighten them. \n\n Order a dozen bouncy castles so no one has to wait in line.  \n\n Estimate the attendance and then add another 40 % to that number. \n\n And bring in truck loads of cotton candy. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/autism_imagine_.html", "title": "We Walked, Sort of..."},
{"date": "May 02, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy\u2019s been sick, on and off, since February. It\u2019s not a constant thing, but a recurring thing, something I guess is called cluster febrile episodes if I\u2019m to trust the google results, which means one has a fever, then it goes away, and then it comes back after a random period of time of more than 7 days.  \n\n I called the doctor to ask about it. I called on a Sunday because he had just fallen into another 103.5 fever out of the blue and I was worried. I\u2019ve been writing things down since the beginning of the year, looking for patterns in behavior that might have to do with food or sensory input. I read through and discovered that since mid-February, Fluffy\u2019s had five of these illnesses.  \n\n The conversation  was annoying with her unsolicited advice about socializing my son. Now, if I may be so bold, unless socializing will affect my son\u2019s internal body temperature, SHUT UP.  \n\n This doctor doesn\u2019t get it. She has never gotten it, since Fluffy\u2019s 4 year check up when she waved the just completed evaluation results from the Asperger Specialist (who gave us the diagnosis) in the air and said, \u201cWell, I saw  all this \u201d with a roll of her eyes, a sort of,  get a load of this crap , tone.  She\u2019s of the,  kids are kids  crowd!  They\u2019re all different! They\u2019ll grow out of it!  \n \nI considered leaving the practice at the time but didn\u2019t. We were doing our Son-Rise program, having weekly Floortime play sessions, just beginning to learn about RDI.  I had already left one practice after being told that my son was not having colic and I ought to get him out of my bed and into a crib, for goodness sake. Uh huh. YOU come over at midnight and hold an inconsolable baby for 6 hours and then tell me he doesn\u2019t have colic, AND, I\u2019ll sleep in the same bed as my son until he gets married, okay? And then I\u2019ll sleep with the two of them. How do you like them apples? \n\n This other doctor had always been supportive of my decision to delay and forgo a number of vaccines; she's good enough; she was close by. Fluffy was always robustly healthy aside from one urinary tract infection when he was three that revealed his pelvic kidney. So, why bother? \n\n She suggested we do a blood test to rule out infection, Lyme, and a few other things. She never once asked questions about it, about the specifics of the last couple of months, specifics about his fever or other symptoms. I had the impression that she consider me a silly woman, a neurotic who sees meningitis where there is a head cold, autism where there is a chatty kid.  \n\n I set out to do the blood test the day before yesterday but even though I had talked a lot about the procedure ahead of time, Fluffy had a severe panic attack. We had to abort. The phlebotomist, meant to be \u2018so great\u2019, said impatiently, I\u2019ll call upstairs for a nurse to come and hold him down. I demurred.  Ah, no. We\u2019ll just come back tomorrow.  If we have to hold him down, I want to prepare him and have it be by people he knows and trusts. I thought I saw her making a face. Maybe not. \n\n Fluffy was devastated. He cried in the lobby, in the car, in the grocery store where we went to buy a chocolate pop, and on the way home. I held him a lot and assured him that we would all brainstorm, find a way to help him hold onto a good thought and get through it.  \n\n We came up with a plan: cotton candy. Dave would dole out cotton candy pinches at each step. In the door, the lobby, the chair, when the elastic was put on, when the needle went in at which point it would become a steady stream of lusciousness and then a big dollop when the whole thing was done. \n\n We went back yesterday morning. We went in the door, the lobby, the hall, the chair. Cotton candy was dispensed.  We're back! With reinforcements and reinforcers , I said with smile. Oh no, you can\u2019t give him that, she said. He can\u2019t have anything to eat. Regulations.  WHAT?  Yes. Nothing to eat. Choking hazard. \n\n That was it. Fluffy went into another panic. The woman got exasperated, mentioned again, getting help from upstairs and then the room at the hospital where they strap kids down on a table--IN FRONT OF FLUFFY she was saying this. We aborted. Fluffy was terrified. She seemed irritated, with him, and with us. \n\n She knew about Fluffy\u2019s Aspergers. She had no other patients in the whole place. Cotton candy MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH, FOR GOD\u2019S SAKE. \n\n As Dave consoled Fluffy at the car, I went upstairs to the pediatrician\u2019s office to ask about the possibility of a mild sedative? Just curious. Did they ever do that? I left that message with reception and went back to my boy. \n\n A few hours later, Fluffy and I came home from our outings. He was happy and calm, talking about how the blood test lady  threw us a curve ball when we were ready for a regular pitch . Dave greeted us with the news that he had found a guy who would allow consumption of cotton candy but he was closing in 15 minutes. We rallied, got there in time, came into the room and Fluffy panicked again. \n\n The thing is, he needed the blood test. Of course he was scared. The first time we tried, I knew I needed Dave\u2019s help. The second time, I knew I needed someone more understanding to take the blood. This time, I knew we would have to hold him down.  \n\n And we did. I locked his legs between mine. I held one arm. Dave held the other straight. Fluffy fought for his life, as if he was getting an amputation with a dull blade. We cooed reassurances, all of us, including the technician who called him brave. I tried to hold gently but firmly, my face hot, my heart pounding. Once the needle went in, he relaxed. He realized it didn\u2019t hurt and then it was just a waiting game as the tubes were filled. I counted down outoud from 30, gauging the timing by watching the blood stream into tube after tube. The needle came out; we all let go. A super cool bandaid covered the little hole. The end. \n\n We were all greatly relieved. \n\n We got home to a message from the pediatrician, disdain dripping from her voice. No. There was no sedative she would give. But she would be happy to send over a couple of nurses to hold my son down.  \n\n This is one of the times I see how invisible Aspergers is to so many. He looks like a regular kid. He IS, but he\u2019s also NOT. \n\n Having this blood test was a blip, especially when you compare it to the many tests and procedures countless other ASD kids have endured. I\u2019ll hold my son down if and when it\u2019s necessary but let\u2019s not forget, it\u2019s HIS BODY, and, HE HAS AUTISM. His anxiety is real and it must understood, respected, and worked with.  \n\n At the end of the day, I want him to be healthy in body but I also want him to be healthy in mind. I want him to trust his parents; I want him to be in on the plan; I don\u2019t want him to have to LEAVE in order to endure; I want him to stay, in his mind AND in his body, because he feels safe.  \n\n Because it's obvious to me that when we are small, how we are treated is how we will treat ourselves.  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/blood_test.html", "title": "Blood Test"},
{"date": "April 27, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nThe cover of Arianna Huffington\u2019s book,  On Becoming Fearless in Love, Work, and Life , has a picture of a woman in a bathing suit, swan diving into the air. We can\u2019t see the pool where she is ostensibly headed but we see her, confident, strong, arms reaching out, head held high. It\u2019s a beautiful image, this woman soaring like a human star. It\u2019s how I would like to be in my life.  \n\n It\u2019s not that I aim for banishing fear from my life. Fear is part of the package. I like to think of it as I do anger; it\u2019s a map. It gives you information. If I\u2019m angry, I don\u2019t need to push it away; I need to look at it more closely to find out what it is telling me. It\u2019s usually about something that\u2019s important to me. Once I zero in on that, I can redirect my energies to honoring that thing, that goal, that value, give voice to what feels disregarded in me or in someone else. Fear has information too. It tells me something feels dangerous.  \n\n But is that danger real? To be heeded? Or is to be observed and given a respectful pat on the back, a sort of \u2018thanks for sharing\u2019 as I carry on, doing \u2018it\u2019 anyway, whatever \u2018it\u2019 is. \n\n I have a friend who talks about the committee that lives in her head. The committee is loud. There are a number of terrified kids on the committee who jump up and down in their seats and climb all over the table. They don\u2019t have all the information; they don\u2019t have the long view; they are a bundle of raw nerves and a tangle of BLACK and WHITE emotions; they panic at the slightest hint of danger as if their very lives were at stake. Things are not worth the risk according to them. Things are either GOOD GOOD GOODIE! and BAD BAD BADDIE! \n\n She\u2019s not going to get rid of the kids but she\u2019s certainly not going to let them make the decisions. The tricky thing, she says, is in being able to tell when they have the microphone. Things get chaotic on the committee-- Robert's Rules of Order  are out the window as everyone talks at the same time. It takes practice to identify the speaker. \n\n I have the same sort of kids on my committee but they\u2019re sneakier. They\u2019re dressed as grownups and present themselves as reasonable and informed. I am trying to learn how to listen and do \u2018it\u2019 anyway, not in spite of them, but  with  them, not by being  afraid  of them, but by bringing them along. See? I can say to them as we go along, This isn\u2019t so bad! See? We can do this.  \n\n It\u2019s like what I\u2019m trying to do with Fluffy and the world of social interactions. I\u2019m trying to help him build memories of success, encode more and more episodic memories of himself trying something that feels scary and in the process, discovering pleasure, strength, confidence.  \n\n It\u2019s easier when it comes to my son. Of all the 12 step meetings and therapy sessions, the Bradshaw workshops and self help books, the meditation and yoga classes, of all the conversations and journaling I\u2019ve done over the years, the single thing that has helped me most in feeling the fear and doing it anyway has been mothering Fluffy. When it comes to what he needs, everything that can be gained is more important than the fear. Everything. I can\u2019t even call myself fearless so much since the fear fades so quickly, I don\u2019t see myself as stepping ahead of it as moving forward with only a vague sense of murmuring in the distance.  \n\n Me? What am I afraid of in my own life? Succeeding. Failing. Missing out. Being mediocre.  \n\n I\u2019ve given up a lot in my life. When I was a kid, I wanted to play the piano. I did for a while and then I gave up. When I was a teenager, I wanted to be an actress. I starred in high school plays, got accepted at a prestigious acting conservatory when I was 18, completed the 2-year program and moved to New York City, bound for the stage. And then I gave up. I pretended I didn\u2019t but I did. I waitressed. I slung hash with the best of them. I made my co-workers laugh. But that\u2019s as far as I took it. A few years later, I took some writing classes. I got the attention of my writing teacher. I enrolled in college, I took more classes, got more attention and then I gave up. I picked it my writing here and there but I never let myself finish anything. \n\n For some reason, Fluffy\u2019s autism forced my hand and I began to write again.  I have movie scripts in my mind, one woman shows tickling my wrists, a memoir waiting in my throat. And I'm getting to them, little by little, one plunked key at a time. This blog, begun as a lifeline during the early days of swirling fear when Fluffy's eccentricities and various difficulties were first attributed to Asperger's Syndrome, has become a portal through which I can reach my long arm back to the writer I was in my twenties and touch her hand.  \n\n She was a beginner. I'm still a beginner but guess what? Every time I sit down to post, I start, I middle, and I finish. I know, that's not grammatically correct, but screw it. The creative process has all three parts: gemination, intiation, and completion. I was always good at the first two but without the last, without finishing, you build no momentum. I'm building momentum for the first time. And so far, I'm not giving up. \n\n The actress in me still stands in the wings, waiting for the chance to walk out under the lights, wondering if everyone will see my heart beating through my neck. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll bomb. But so what? What if I bomb? What if I suck? What if all of you reading this laugh into your sleeve? WHO CARES? What matters is finding out who I am. I must be one of those  kinesthetic  learners--I learn who I am by DOING. \n\n My son has made me stronger, braver. I'm on   his  committee. What shall I do? Jump up and down on the chair? Climb on the table? Shout NO NO NO when I'm scared about what's hard for him? Not take the risks that can show us what he can do and be and have?  \n\n Mothering my son has shown me the only thing to do is pick up that whole committee, in the midst of their shouts of fear disguised as wisdom, disguised as apathy, disguised as reason and even as friend, suit them up and dive off the highest platform, risking and wishing, like a handful of shooting stars.  \n\n Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! \n\n \nThis post is part of a Blog Bonanza hosted by MotherTalk and brought to you by a score of blogging women across the land.

{"date": "May 20, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nFluffy and Dave in Mexico. See Dave's tongue? He's the Micheal Jordon of shuffle board.  \n\n \nI\u2019m not trying to cure my son of his Aspergers but I am trying to get rid of aspects of his Autism that make things difficult for him. \n\n I call it remediating the Autism. It\u2019s the way  RDI  looks at ASD and it\u2019s the way that makes the most sense to me.  \n\n Some have taken issue with that word, remediate. They claim, remediate is the same as fix and so, yes, I AM trying to CURE my son. They say, I can\u2019t profess to accept someone as I simultaneously attempt to change them.  \n\n I went down that road, that debate road and I ultimately decided that even though the discussion itself stretched me, my view and intention held firm. I love and accept my son  and  I\u2019m still trying to remediate his Autism. You can agree with me or be outraged by me or dismiss me all-together. I don\u2019t care. Autism brings with it some pretty major challenges. I\u2019m all for diversity and inclusion and acceptance but I\u2019m also all for teaching and providing and shaping. That\u2019s what parenting is. That\u2019s what our kids deserve. \n\n We\u2019ve been in a holding pattern with our RDI program since the beginning of the year when Fluffy began to hunker down and slip around the illness slope. He gets far too dysregulated by sickness, even the seemingly mild kinds like a winter cold, to have any energy left over for the \u2018work\u2019 of therapeutic play. I felt worried about it, worried we\u2019d lose ground, worried about my own ability to engage and guide him without it becoming rote and tense but somewhere along the way, I surrendered to it being a time of floating, floating down the river.  \n\n Since we\u2019ve been home from Mexico, the floating has taken on a more lively feeling. I look over at my son and instead of seeing his body still and supine, his head back and eyes closed, I see him on his belly, paddling around, his head up, his eyes focused. \n\n And so we\u2019re back to working on our RDI objectives, back to videotaping every couple of weeks, back to our regular phone conferences with our RDI consultant.  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s resistant but you know, he\u2019s always been resistant. He\u2019s a FIGHTER. He\u2019s a BELLOWER. He\u2019s got a very strong mind of his own. I love that. It\u2019s more challenging for me. It\u2019s not like I say, Let\u2019s do so and so and he says, Okay! It\u2019s like he\u2019s a mid-westerner, like he\u2019s from the \u2018Show Me\u2019 state and I\u2019m the slick city girl. He needs to be convinced or at least, to feel as if it was his idea, all his idea. He\u2019s on to me in a heartbeat. He can sense right away if I\u2019m playing to the camera, if I\u2019m after a particular THING. \n\n I am, by the way, after a particular thing. I have objectives. I am working on them. My goal is to help him learn these objectives. For example, I want him to care if I like his idea or not. I want him to enjoy when I change the rules in a game, even prefer it. I want him to notice if I\u2019m bored.  \n\n It can seem like there are two camps in the community of parents with ASD kids: those who embrace the Autism and those who want to cure the Autism. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s that simple. I think there is a much wider, more diverse and more complicated set of thoughts, drives, and opinions, perhaps as wide and diverse as the expression of Autism itself. I can\u2019t pretend to know anyone else\u2019s reality but my own. But I will say, it bothers me to hear it broken down into this: my child is in diapers and bangs his head in the corner so he must be fixed while your child talks and uses the potty and knows calculus so he just needs a Microsoft job application.  \n\n We all have visions for our kids. You don\u2019t have to fall below a certain criteria to get permission to provide for your kids, to broaden their world. At least, not in my book. \n\n \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/remediating_the.html", "title": "Remediating the Autism"},
{"date": "May 03, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t In two days, we are going to Mexico. It's a gift from my mom; she's taking the whole family: my sister and her son, my brother and his family, and the three of us. We are all thrilled. Think of that tropical air! That clear blue-green water! The in-house spa with mud packs and hot rocks waiting to walk up my spine! \n\n A few things need to be taken care of before we board the plane Saturday, at the crack of dawn. Blood and urine test results for my Fluffy, who seems much better in body and mind today than yesterday when I think we were dealing with post-traumatic blood draw syndrome; Dave's mysterious cluster of spots polka-dotting his shoulder and back (he's at the doctor right now. His skin looks like a spider battle ground.); Beegu's transport to the lovely gal who'll keep her company for the week; PACKING, oh my! the packing!; and the purchase of a decent bra.  \n\n What are you all wearing on the boobies? Will you send me your favorite style/make please? Swing by and bring me to the lingerie department and help me sort through all those, ah, racks?  \n\n Yesterday, I was up in the big city, attending the parent-only, post-assessment meeting with the Asperger Specialist. The FINAL meeting; all other assessments, testings, blahberdidi la la was done. Fluffy was with a sitter. I had one hour to scour the mall and score a bra.  \n\n Nordstrom's was my first stop. What's your size? asked the lingerie specialist who materialized from behind a thong display. I don't know, 36B? She stared at my chest, sighed and shook her head. Moments later, we were in the  dressing room. She locked the door, whipped out a tape measure and told me to pull up my shirt. I wondered should I turn around and face the wall? Close my eyes or leave them open? What does one do? It turns out, she was done with me in seconds. 34 D, she announced. WHAT? When did THAT happen? And how have I been wearing the wrong size all this time? \n\n And how did they get so large? Is it the slow but menacing affects of gravity? Is it that they aren't so much  bigger  as  taller  and  wider ? stretching from shoulder to solar plexus, sternum to armpit? They aren't so much a delicate  bosom --more of a formidable  blockade .  \n\n She brought me handfuls of bras, cross back, push up, pull down, flatten, poke out, front clasp, back clasp, thigh clasp. She brought me 34 D, 36 C (sister sizes, she explained), 346 D, 34 DD, for god's sake. The Ds, remarkably, fit well enough in the cup but while the 34s were like vises, the 36s hung like loose skin. Where are the 35s???? Nothing worked. I looked at my watch. 20 minutes left. \n\n I dashed to Victoria's Secret. After getting some less than enthusiastic help from the staff, I ended up, topless, one hand over my heaving chest, the other rifling through drawers, whipping bra after bra behind me like confetti. Again, nothing. I ran to Gap Body. Who are they making bras for over there? Thirteen year olds? My six-year old son? \n\n As I sprinted to Macy's, grabbing a couple of tacos from the Food Court on the way. I shoved them down as I checked the time and ended up bent over the trash bin, choking on a piece of shredded iceberg. \n\n Good times. \n\n There is something wrong when a grown woman can't even buy a friggin' bra without racing through stores as if she has a heart for transplant in her purse. Clearly, I need more help.  \n\n Nothing at Macy's. And I was late getting home. \n\n Ah well, who needs a bra in a Mexican resort? Maybe I'll give my enormous chest a vacation from bondage and let them frolic. It'll be their choice: bathing suit, spa bathrobe or silky summery pjs. Ahhhh. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/05/bra_shopping.html", "title": "Bra Shopping"},

The trees whiz by in a blur, the sun streams in and warms your lap, the air whirs its pleasing hum as it streams in your window and then suddenly--SLAM, you are in a clog of cars, bumper to bumper, a dead stop?  \n\n You search your mind, flipping past the day, the date, the time, the season, your location with regard to the local roads. Are you passing an arena? A ball field? Is the President in town for a tutorial on the art of telling lies with a youthful smirk? Is there an accident? You crane your neck for a better sight line, tune your ears to the frequency of sirens. Or could it be construction? Any telltale orange cones? A clutch of seven guys huddled by in observation of the lone rookie with the only available shovel? \n\n No. There isn\u2019t any reason for it. It just IS. It crawls along. At first, you don\u2019t mind. You were making good time. It\u2019s a beautiful day. You\u2019re alive. You can see things more clearly at a snail\u2019s pace. It makes slicing your pear with the plastic knife not an act of the reckless but one of the refined, the prepared, even the cultivated. \n\n And then you begin to get concerned. How much longer is this going to go on? What IS going on? Where did all these cars come from? \n\n Hours into it, you are beside yourself. You\u2019ve been through all the radio channels, the tapes you found under the front seat and all the other sticky and hairy surprises you found under there as well. You\u2019ve eaten everything you can get your hands on, drunk all the water and now you have to pee. Your pants are unbuttoned, unzipped. You're driving with one foot, the other is crammed up under your crotch. You can\u2019t stop on the side of the road. You can\u2019t even get off; the next exit is 9 miles off and god only knows when you\u2019ll reach it at this rate.  \n\n You just want to get out of first gear.  \n\n YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. \n\n And then just as suddenly, inexplicably, it opens up. *Poof*. \n\n That is what has happened over here with Fluffy, for Fluffy, between Fluffy and us. For the last couple of months, we\u2019ve been bumper to bumper. And then today, it opened up. Clear as day. I can see it in his eyes. I can feel it in the air. I can sense it all around him, like a field of charged particles that used to jut out tensely to where they stopped, rigid and intertwined. Now they flow, slowly but still, you can see the movement, back and forth, back and forth. Vrooom.  \n\n What happened? \n\n I have no idea and I don\u2019t care. Just like with the traffic, I know it will happen again, sometime, somewhere, but for now, I revel in the movement, the erumpant feeling, the very SPRING experience of, WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, we\u2019re through!!  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s back, my friends.

I try to be hip and techno-savvy but it\u2019s so, well,  boring.  \n\n \n\n Really, I\u2019m a middle-age white girl who\u2019s very 1950s when it comes to computers. HONEY? I call, clutching at my neck, It\u2019s doing that  thing  again.\n\n \n\n I\u2019m also very middle-age white when it comes to Hip Hop Abs, my new dvd from  Yoga Booty Ballet . I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m down there, shakin\u2019 it every morning. You see, April is not just Autism Awareness Month, it\u2019s also cellulite awareness only I\u2019m not FIGHTING autism and I AM fighting cellulite. I want to make a video called, Cellutite, Every Day but I don\u2019t want to offend anyone. So hard, the not offending, but I don\u2019t feel DESPERATE about autism. It\u2019s not a nightmare. But my butt is.\n\n \n\n I\u2019m behind on updating but know this: We had our very first home Passover seder last night. Fluffy helped me make the charoset, pulsing that cuisinart button like a pro.    The Passover Seder  by Emily Sper a great book for beginners, something Fluffy and I both are. Dave too, I might add, though Jewish. He\u2019s all, seder? huh. I\u2019m happy to report, it was a tremendous success! We washed and dipped and blessed and ate a delicious but frighteningly unhealthy kugel I baked. I reenacted the whole Passover story with wooden dolls and colorful swaths of silk--must haves for the river Nile and The Red Sea. Dave and Fluffy were enraptured. We threw open the door for Elijah and ran through the house searching for the Afikomen and then had traditional Passover pull back car races down the hall. Shalom! \n\n \n\n A few things that really deserve their own post:  \n\n I read  this  memoir, A Long Way Gone; Memoirs of a boy soldier, by Ishmael Beah. You must, also.\u00a0 It\u2019s a compelling and astoundingly moving account of a boy besieged by the civil war in Sierra Leonne and describes, among other things, his time as a child soldier. Triumph of the human spirit doesn\u2019t even capture the devastation and drama and eventual salvation of this boy. I read it straight through with gaping mouth and a pounding heart. I couldn\u2019t even cry, it was so overpowering. Until the end, that is, when I sobbed for ages. Beegu came galomping over with a tissue in her mouth to see what the trouble was. She didn't exactly  hand  me the tissue but she did interrupt her consumption which was a terrific show of empathy. \n\n \n\n And this: We finally watched  An Inconvenient Truth . I know, I know. I\u2019m woefully behind the times on this one. But no matter. If you haven\u2019t seen it, rent it immediately. Al Gore is a full-fledged superhero. It\u2019s acutely painful to imagine what this country--no, this world, would be like today had this man been allowed to take the office to WHICH HE WAS ELECTED. To think, we have such a baffoon in office, a guy who was doing jello shots and shooting recklessly into the Texan brush while deliquent from college courses and his OBLIGATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES while this man, this passionate, articulate eruidite man, painstakingly brought the issue of our globe\u2019s failing health to the attention of those in a position to do something right, something moral, something profound.\n\n \n\n It\u2019s a great film. Brilliant. I cried at the end, too. I felt like the earth was my child who ran into a collosal porcupine. I wanted to hold her in my arms and gently pull out every quill, dap on ointment, bring down the fever, protect, soothe.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n \n\nI\u2019m committed to do what I can. Please go  here  and grab a quill. \n\n \n\n We must pull together. \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Booty-Ballet-Complete-Workout-System/dp/B000H1RG6S/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5705581-8750443?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1175617010&sr=1-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Passover-Seder-Emily-Sper/dp/0439443121/ref=sr_1_1/002-5705581-8750443?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175617099&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/Long-Way-Gone-Memoirs-Soldier/dp/0374105235/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5705581-8750443?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175617278&sr=1-1", "http://www.climatecrisis.net/", "http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/various_before_.html", "title": "Various before my computer fails again..."},

I resisted the urge to ride in the rocker sticking out of the trailer. \n\n We walked inside and discovered it was still a construction site: debris sprinkled like rain, painting half done, a space where the fridge ought to be, doors off their hinges, etc. etc. \n\n We all secretized, borrowed a vacuum, unloaded into a single room, unhitched our trailer and hightailed it out of there to a hotel. With pool. And rooms that allow dogs. \n\n By the time we rehitched the now-empty trailer, we had splished and splashed, fed the horses, rode the carousel, visited a new children\u2019s museum, and hiked in great open fields by a country airport as little planes took off and landed like giant, whisper-quiet bugs.  \n\n But most of all, we rediscovered our trust in the landlady. Apologies were extended and received, financial adjustments were made, and hands were shaked (?) with sincerity. We\u2019ll just try it again, you know, when the house is really done. \n\n We were home in time to set our reiki-ized carrots and milk for the Easter Bunny. Fluffy had a hard time going to bed such is his enthusiasm for candy and magic. As we lay there in the dark, donning our eye masks, the music low and chanting, he said to me,  \n\n Mommy? If a car fell on you, I\u2019m sure I would be able to lift it so you could get out. \n\n I\u2019m sure you could too, honey. \n\n (Silence.) \n\n Mommy? If you were to die, my life would take a sharp turn. For the worse.  \n\n (I consider this for a second and feel like I\u2019m falling down a well.) Oh. \n\n Yes. Some things would be a little better but a lot of things would be much much harder.  \n\n Well, I\u2019m going to live for a very very long time. Look at my mom, Mama Mama. I\u2019m already all grown up and living in my own house with a husband and my own child and she\u2019s still alive. \n\n Yes,  he said, greatly relieved.  \n\n (Silence.) \n\n But at some point, you will get very old and then you will die. \n\n Yes, I said, staring wide-eyed into the dark pockets of hemp and lavender.  \n\n Last weekend, Fluffy asked about the Easter story. I sketched it in but he wanted the skinny. But how did Jesus die?  he asked me.  \n\n Well, I said, trying to sound light and breezy, they nailed him to a cross.   Nailed?  he asked.  \n\n Yes! I said, brightly, through his hands and feet and so on.  Wow. That must have hurt,  he said.  \n\n Yes!  \n\n But, how does that kill you?  he asked.  \n\n I began thinking, Jesus, what a gruesome story! Shall I talk about the vinegar and the beating with thorny sticks and all? I opted for simplicity. Well, I said, they didn\u2019t give him anything to eat or drink and it was really hot out there so after a while, he died.  \n\n Oh.  he said.  I bet God was mad when they killed Jesus but I bet he was glad when Jesus flew back up to see him.   \n\n We were in the car at the time.  \u00a0 After hearing the whole story, about the dinner and the cave and the rock, he looked blankly out the window at the trees flying by and I worried slightly for him, for how it was all taking shape in his mind. He exhaled loudly and then turned to me.  Mom? Do you think the Easter Bunny will bring me Pez like he did last year? \n\n All is well in Fluffyland. \n\n In fact, starting with my marathon drive to score bio-identical hormones all of Thursday right through a weekend full of chaos and uncertainty, ending with a holiday of family and free-basing candy, Fluffy has been amazing. I forget sometimes that this sort of stretch would not have been possible two or even one year ago. We simply wouldn\u2019t have attempted it. \n\n As I loaded the pictures onto my computer this morning I was struck with one in particular. You know when you see other people\u2019s kids and one day they\u2019ve suddenly crossed over into BoyDom? The beginning of those elementary years when their bigger kid features seem to rise up out of the round earth with more, what? definition? maturity? shadows of their adolescent selves? It happened. At least in this one picture: \n\n \n\n\n Last night I watched a slide show of Fluffy\u2019s life from the day he was born until now. The feelings of joy and longing, delight and grief, bloomed inside and then drifted away like ghosts. I wish Fluffy could be all those ages again and always, and yet, I reach and reach for each new age he becomes, his growing awareness, pride, confidence, and also, it's true, his struggles because they are about his  becoming .  \n\n These births and rebirths; it's more than I can hold at one time. It always has been and I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d rather try and try and try to do. >\n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/births_and_rebi.html", "title": "Births and Rebirths"},

Judith, the founder of the  HANDLE Institute  and the author of  The Fabric of Autism  in which she talks of her  H olistic  A pproach to  N euro D evelopment  L earning  E fficiency (and her own sensory issues including what she now believes was her own struggle with autism growing up), is the most present and calm practitioner I\u2019ve ever met. She gives the impression of having nothing else in the world to do other than be right there, with you, in that moment for as long as it takes. There was no rushing, no checking the clock, no referring to checklists or questionnaires. There  was  observation and conversation and long pauses during which she sat on the rug, bare-footed, and alternately watched, and interacted with, my son. \n\n I love that. \n\n The bare-footedness is not a groovy thing, it\u2019s an information gathering thing. We all ended up barefoot that day, Dave and I because it was finally warm and we wore flip flops, Fluffy, Judith and the intern who worked with her, because the sock eating frog puppet couldn\u2019t help himself. Judith needs to see the feet, to study the feet, to look for clues, and she hit on one immediately. \n\n Plantar\u2019s warts. Fluffy\u2019s got a nasty cluster of them on his left big toe. We\u2019ve been trying to get rid of them for a while now, trying Compound W, caster oil, and these days,  duct tape , to no avail. Hmm, she said, How long has he had these and did I notice if he started asking for the mouth massages around the same time these appeared? \n\n You know, it could be, I said. \n\n It turns out, the spot on his big toe is directly connected to his upper jaw. She wondered if the pressure in his toe caused by the warts could in some way be disturbing his mouth.  \n\n Huh. \n\n The assessment was Friday morning. Fluffy did puzzles, double-doodled with his eyes closed, experimented with red/blue glasses, and set up an elaborate pattern with little wooden blocks. We were in a small room and had to keep moving here and there in order to reposition the video camera to capture all the activity. He did great but understandably got antsy after close to two hours and spent the last 10 minutes trying to hurdle the camera and escape to the outer room where a big yoga ball beckoned him. He was ready to leave, tired of the new toys, having explored them all, tired of all the talking, simply tired of the whole scene.  \n\n We took a delightful and long lunch break and returned in the afternoon for feedback and to learn the recommended daily exercises to try for the next 6-8 weeks, exercises that would hopefully help Fluffy take in and integrate sensory information more completely and effectively. Judith and the intern took turns going over the notes they accumulated after reviewing our paperwork, the taped morning session, and their own observations. They got Fluffy, spot on. They also got some things I\u2019ve never noticed, for example, that he protects his fingertips when he plays on the floor; he either rests the heel of his hand on the rug, lifting his fingers in the air, or curls them under and rests on his knuckles therefore missing all that information.  I never knew that. But he uses those same fingertips like mad when he\u2019s on the computer or manipulating his playmobile, I said. He\u2019s most likely blocking during those times, Judith replied, shutting down input in order to do those tasks.  \n\n Her approach is all about looking at how the child takes in sensory information, where they may be blocking, where they are strong, where they are weak, and then design simple ways to wake up and strengthen these core systems in order to support the whole body. She also looks at how the many systems are communicating and works on increasing the internal exchange of information. So, she wants the child (or adult) to be able to use available means of taking in the world, and maximize the ability to use that information in an integrated way in order to allow for the most success back in the world where they can continue to take in more information. In other words--in order for them to be in the world without bracing for survival some or most of the time. \n\n She says, Fluffy attentional priorities are at odds: his intellectual interests and natural curiosity is thwarted when survival needs overtake him. This makes perfect sense to me when I watch how he changes when kids are around. There is no physical ease. How can he be free to observe and experiment?  \n\n I don\u2019t have a handle on HANDLE yet. The best I can do is say it\u2019s similar in style to RDI in that it seeks to strengthen core systems in order to increase connections so that, at some point, the body/brain can get back on track, on a more 'natural' developmental pathway.  \n\n One of the things she wrote on Fluffy\u2019s sheet was that he expresses concepts more than feelings. I hesitated, thinking of all the amazing things he\u2019s said about his feelings, metaphors and connections he\u2019s made. But then I realized that Fluffy really doesn\u2019t express his feelings, his harder feelings in the moment. Fluffy may be a master talker but he\u2019s not a master communicator. He can explain things, some very complicated things, in marvelously creative ways but when it comes to something basic, like,  Stop that, or I don\u2019t like that, he\u2019s stumped. He becomes immediately dysregulated and overwhelmed; he lashes out.  \n\n How could her exercises, things like tapping his skull in a particular patterns, wiggling his fingers, rolling a ball on his back, stomping his feet, affect the way he\u2019d respond if I started singing silly words to a familiar song and he didn\u2019t like it? How would he say something simple like the not quite three-year old I watched in the park the week before say to his mom when she started playing a game of \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you!\u201d that he wasn't up for: \u201cStop it!\u201d He said, his hand up, \u201cThat scaring me!\u201d \n\n I used to think his difficulty in this area was related to not mastering Variations (old stage 4) in  RDI , that is was about impulse control, that it had more to do with not yet being comfortable with flexibility, making necessary repairs in order to stay in a pattern with another person. After listening to her, I began to wonder if it was due to miscommunications within his own sensory system.  \n\n Judith described things like interactions among the fluid in the inner ear in the vestibular system with the fluid system of the lymph system with spinal fluid that runs up and down the back, the neck, and all around the brain. She talked about the sensitivity of the tiny but significant trigeminal nerve that connects ears, eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, and jaw. She talked about how if one was blocking the information coming from the fingertips than one will have poor self-help skills; we need to use the tips of our fingers for dressing, brushing teeth, washing hands and face, putting on socks, zipping and buttoning.  \n\n We spent a whirl-wind weekend in New Jersey and New York City, interspersing our activities with our best stab at the assigned exercises. We returned Monday morning to make sure we had them down, got some pointers, and then set off for home. \n\n It\u2019s been a week and I tell you, I think it\u2019s making a difference:  \n\n \u221e There\u2019s been no request for mouth massages the last two nights at bedtime. \n\n \u221e There\u2019s been no aggression with other kids. In fact, he asked two kids he\u2019s never met before if they\u2019d like to play a game with him? He had his transformers, noticed they each had toys on their laps. Did they all want to play a game together? \n\n \u221e Yesterday, he requested a notebook for writing his thoughts. Today, he opened it and wrote, entirely on his own, \u201cI Lov Mom.\u201d with the period and everything.  \n\n \u221e The plantars warts are fading. \n\n \u221e A few days ago, Dave said something that annoyed him and instead of hitting or growling or shaking his fist in the air, he marched out to the kitchen, saw me and said, \u201cI\u2019M IN A BAD MOOD! DON'T BOTHER ME!\" I nearly fell down.  \n\n He\u2019s been saying that sort of thing more and more. \u201cI FEEL LIKE HITTING YOU!\u201d but no actually hitting. \u201cI DON'T FEEL HAPPY!\u201d \u201cI DON'T WANT TO DO THAT!\" \"I DIDN'T LIKE THAT!\" \n\n \u221e Aggression, overall, is WAY down.  \n\n It\u2019s huge. And it's only been a week.  \n\n How does it work? Where are the balance boards and trampolines and hippity hops? All the various tasks to incorporate throughout the day, the push/pull/lift/carry? I don\u2019t know. I guess what they say is true: there really is more than one way up the mountain.  \n\n We may look into a more traditional sensory integration program down the line, but for now, we\u2019re sticking with HANDLE. It's simple, it's portable and if it's really behind the changes I'm seeing, behind what looks like my son's increased sense of clarity and safety and self-expression, I say Hooray! and, I wish we'd tried this sooner.  \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://daysixtyseven.blogspot.com/", "http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/163083_bluestone04.html", "http://www.handle.org/", "http://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Autism-Weaving-Threads-Cogent/dp/0972023518", "http://www.octanecreative.com/ducttape/hmo/index.html", "http://www.rdiconnect.com"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/handle_update.html", "title": "HANDLE Update"},
{"date": "April 25, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Yesterday, Dave took Fluffy to his horse-back riding session while I had a two-hour meeting with Dr. Asperger Specialist for the final piece of the many MANY part testing/assessment required for the upcoming IEP meeting. Fluffy and I will go see her together twice this week for in-person play and observation only. I hope. I hope we're done with the sitting at the little desk portion, looking at the little pictures and answering the little endless questions.  \n\n The results of all the previous testing were sent to her ahead of time: the three meetings with the school psychologist, the three meetings for education piece, the two meetings with the speech and language pathologist, the two with the OT and the final word seems to be (sit down) \n\n Fluffy is a very bright kid who has trouble in social settings with peers and could use some extra support with his pencil grasp. \n\n Shocking. \n\n To be fair, there was something in this whole thing that has been helpful, aside from how proud I was of my son during the whole process, his focus and stamina, for one. I don't know if I could have sat through all that, literally SAT for that long being peppered with questions about Sally's Aunt and Jeffrey's ballgame, putting together variations on  The cat is fat. The cat is soft. The cat jumped onto the fence.  into one sentence for 15 minutes at a stretch. WHO CARES?  \n\n It turns out, his scores were through the roof, testing up to the 9 and 10 year old range in most cases and in some cases, no ceiling was found. It also turns out, two separate things are going on for Fluffy--he has Asperger's AND he's 'gifted'.  \n\n I've always known he was bright but now I see that his cognitive strengths mixed with what is challenging about his Aspergers can make for a tricky situation at certain times like now, when he is waking up to his own self-image and looking for where he fits in. There is a pretty wide gap between what he knows, what he can figure out, what he can understand and what he can DO and I think that is contributing to the frustration and dysregulation we've been seeing in the last months.  \n\n Take the flickering thoughts. Fluffy struggles with turning off his systems at night. One of the things that bothers him is when his thoughts jump back and forth, when he can't 'let them go'. He also has what he calls 'bad thoughts' that stream into his head unbidden. I found a small box that we keep on his nightstand and told him that he could put his flickering and bad thoughts in the box. How? he asked. I showed him how he could wipe them out of his head by putting his hands on his temples, swoop them together, and then flick them into the air at the center of his forehead. He could them catch them and put them in the box or let them go. The box was able to hold them in as long as he needed. In the case of flickering GOOD thoughts, he could tap the box into his hand in the morning and they would fall back out. The BAD thoughts would NOT come back out. Due to the magic of Whatever You Say Goes that is the realm of childhood, the BAD thoughts would STICK in the box, even as the box was tapping out GOOD thoughts. \n\n This has all worked beautifully. But I've noticed that he's been wiping his hands across his forehead a lot, and not just at night. We'll be out and about and he's  Wipe Wipe ; In his booster seat, looking out the window,  Wipe Wipe, ; during dinner,  Wipe Wipe . He won't tell me what the thoughts are. This is entirely new for me, my son having thoughts he doesn't want to share. I've tried in my best, \"it's okay not to tell me voice\" to find out what those thoughts are but to no avail. I've gotten this much: they're not about him and they're not about me or Dave. But then, what ARE they about? \n\n So, here's the thing: his thoughts have no end. They come and go about EVERYTHING. They occupy him, puzzle him, fascinate him, intrigue him, scare him. And just as it seemed to me in an entirely intuitive way when he was an infant and toddler that he had no physical filter, than sounds, sights, feelings, temperatures, energies assaulted him from all sides, it seems to me that his MIND has no filter for all these thoughts, thoughts, thoughts.  \n\n Now, he is six. He wants to share some of these thoughts and he tries. But he doesn't notice that the boy he's next to at the park is barely navigating the very ground he's walking on because he's not yet two years old. He just dives in to share about Darth Vadar or the wild inventions of Alien Gromit who can travel at 10 billion times the speed of light. And the boy looks up, picks his nose, points to something off in the distance and says, DEEB! DEEB! and lurches away in his frankenstein walk and Fluffy feels slighted and that interaction is unsuccessful. \n\n Or he wanders near some boys his age playing tag and he gets a series of BAD thoughts and he wipes wipes wipes at his head and even though I'm grateful that we came up with this strategy for dealing with bedtime flickering, it does look, well,  unusual . The boys his age notice and snicker and run away and Fluffy feels slighted that he's been left on a patch of grass alone and that interaction is unsuccessful. \n\n And I tell you, he notices. If not the actual scene and series of cause and affect, he notices the  energy  of the scene and that each time, he is left alone.  \n\n This giftedness is wonderful. I embrace it. And I embrace his Aspergers as I continue to look for ways to teach him what he doesn't easily or naturally know. I can use his cognitive ability to help teach him things, maybe more than I've been doing. But I don't want to go from the outside in. I want to go from the inside out.  \n\n That is what RDI is all about. That is what Enki Education is all about. That, from what I understand so far, is what HANDLE is all about.  \n\n This mothering is about so much straddling, straddling like a great bridge between one land and the next. We stand firm but flexible, ready to make these adjustments, all the while keeping an eye of where they are, these children of ours, where they're going, where and what we need and want to guide them towards.  \n\n This Aspergers and now the giftedness require their own bridging because Fluffy is straddling too, the great divide of what he knows and what is completely mysterious to him. And so we go, waddling and straddling, the two of us, hoping the shorelines get closer, and the particulars of the topography more distinct and readable. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/more_results.html", "title": "Straddling"},
{"date": "April 14, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t The hormones! I'm talking about them nonstop lately. At least once a day Dave chimes in with, \u201cHow do you make a whore moan? Hmm?\u201d I just ignore him, poor guy. Which is part of the issue. \n\n One day I read Suzanne Somers\u2019s book,  Ageless . I was never a huge Suzanne Somers fan. Aside from Three\u2019s Company, the last time I saw her was on an infomercial (some of you know about my infomercial weakness) when she and an obscenely buff dude talked me into buying a Body Row. When it\u00a0 arrived, I hopped on and enthusiastically rowed for about three minutes and then it sat in turns, in my office, in front of the TV and in the basement where it collected dust and knocked me in the ankles whenever I tried to walk by. Its final resting place was the street in front of our house where snow fell and collected on the FREE sign a year ago Christmas until some hopeful heavy gal hauled it into the back of her sedan.  \n\n But after reading her book, I can say without question, Suzanne is a hero. It\u2019s not the most eloquent read; she desperately needs an editor, one with a big fat red marker. She says the same thing over and over--the book could be about half the length. But no matter, the message is important. Women need bio-identicals and they need them fast.  \n\n Why do certain things take our country so long to get? Why only now are bio-identicals becoming available when women in France, for example, have been on them for the last fifty years? The same woman who are NOT dying of cancer at the rate of the menopausal counterparts in this country from the one-size fits all synthetic hormone replacement therapy that doctors have been prescribing along with a patronizing pat on the back for ages? \n\n I\u2019m not qualified to go into the medical details, to tackle the financial complexities of our prescription drug dealings but I will say that since bio-identicals by their very nature are individualized for each woman based on her own very specific hormone levels, there is no way for the drug companies to make a big buck. What it takes is old fashioned time and attention among the doctor, the patient and the compounding drug companies, a fine-tuning that involves testing and communication, retesting and more communication and the most critical piece of information comes from the patient, the woman, when she describes HOW SHE\u2019S FEELING. The goal? For her to feel great. Not passable. Not okay. GREAT. \n\n I have not been feeling great for the last few years. I went to my doctor but she was no help. Why test your levels, she asked? You\u2019re not going to have any more children (ouch) so what\u2019s the point? The message being, once you cease to be reproductive, your body\u2019s chemistry doesn\u2019t matter. Unless or until, of course, you get heart disease or depression or sleep disturbances or cancer and then POWIE they jump in with medications galore. The biggest being anti-depressants. You don\u2019t feel well? Take zoloft or paxil. \n\n Now. I\u2019m not anti anti-depressants. I took zoloft during my recovery from my divorce twelve years ago and I tell you, I blessed those little pills each time I set them on my tongue. They saved my sanity. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who\u2019d disagree they can be overprescribed. \n\n So, I read Suzanne\u2019s book. It made sense. It provided information and most importantly, solutions. I found an Anti-Aging doctor (that\u2019s what they\u2019re called--not the best name since they\u2019re not AGAINST aging, simply FOR aging in a healthier way),  dribbled spit into my little tubes,  drove a million miles to see this guy, read my current hormone levels, fell off the chair, got back on and went home and sat on the couch, waiting for my delivery the way Beegu watches Dave and Fluffy play in the yard when she\u2019s been disallowed participation.  \n\n They came. They\u2019re in a lotion form. I\u2019ve been slathering them on for three days. I\u2019ll keep you posted. I\u2019m to use the current ones at the current doses for two months and then retest--or, re-spit.  \n\n I will say this. The test revealed what I knew. My levels are low. low low low. All of them. When I talked to my dealer, I mean, my doctor, he said, No wonder you\u2019re not feeling well. Let\u2019s take one: Testosterone. Now, I\u2019ll wager a bet that my old Testosterone levels were, er, high. Not that y\u2019all want to hear any details, but I will say, I\u2019ve always been a big fan of sex. The \u2018normal\u2019 level for Testosterone can be as high as 55. Mine is 12. TWELVE.  \n\n No wonder my libido is out the window. I like the IDEA of sex but in actual practice? I\u2019m in bed with my book and Dave comes sidling in and I look up with maternal warmth and some concern. Oh. Hello dear. Aw, you\u2019re sweet, I say with a platonic tousle of his hair and then, Okay, bye bye! and back to my book I go. I can't help it. I\u2019m just, well, sort of Barbi doll down there, all pink plastic and not much else. Not ALL the time. but more than I\u2019d like. Certainly more than Dave likes. \n\n How do you make your man moan? \n\n Um. I\u2019m  reading. \n\n But now! Now that I\u2019m taking the magic hormones! I\u2019m making a chart for Dave. Each time my levels go up, so do the goodies. He can climb on at 20, at 30 I'll bring in motion and sound, and at 40, he\u2019s in for the blow job of his life. I'll spare you the details after that. \n\n As much as I\u2019m looking forward to revisiting the bedroom romps of my pre-perimenopausal days, it\u2019s not all about sex. Estrodiol is involved in over 300 processes in the body. There are more Progesterone receptors in the brain than anywhere else in the body. As for Testosterone? The heart = receptor central.  \n\n How do you make Kyra moan? \n\n Pass the hormones and I'll get back to you. \n\n I\u2019m aiming for overall vitality. It\u2019s my vision. I\u2019m  Secretizing .  \n\n And slathering.  \n\n What about you? Where do you need to Secretize? I\u2019d love to hear.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Ageless-Naked-Truth-Bioidentical-Hormones/dp/0307237249"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/lets_talk_hormo.html", "title": "Let's Talk Hormones"},

{"date": "April 19, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t We\u2019re off to see Judith Bluestone at the  HANDLE Institute\u2019s  New Jersey facility today. Our appointment is tomorrow. She will assess in the morning and then give feedback and recommended exercises in the afternoon. We then go off for the weekend, practice, and return Monday morning for a check-in. \n\n The fee includes the full day Friday, the check-in Monday morning and follow-up check-ins for the next 6 months. I think she figures on seeing us every 6 weeks--not terribly realistic. I\u2019m hoping to see her three more times, every two months.

If it feels like the right fit, I\u2019ll want to keep up with it; if not, I\u2019ll want to know why and what we can do to adjust and amend. \n\n Over the weekend, we\u2019re having a little family fun: Saturday in New York City for Dave\u2019s book signing at  this children\u2019s book store  for  this new book  and a visit with my dear friend, Kim, whom I haven\u2019t seen in two years, and her sweet son. On Sunday, a New Jersey adventure and a visit with another dear friend, whom I haven\u2019t seen in three years, and her two sweet children. \n\n We\u2019ve been talking about seeing Judith for months. Fluffy knows her as the expert on how to help the brain and body talk to each other. At night, during the mouth massage, while I\u2019m applying 300 pounds per square inch of pressure to Fluffy\u2019s teeth and gums while he fidgets with the eye mask and flips to and fro like a fish in the bottom of a boat, I say to him, I think Judith may be able to help us with this, with the yucky feeling in your mouth, honey. He usually says nothing, too busy directing and repositioning my hands  just so, HERE, mommy, do it like this, dun dun DUN,  he intones as he slides my fingers to the front and back, ending at the underside of his incisors, his sharp incisors.  \n\n The jaw. The jaw. I hear it's the power center of the proprioceptive sense which is like the motherboard of the whole sensory system. It's certainly a key area for Fluffy with the chewing at his shirt and the impressive production of saliva and the pressing of his mouth and face against things and people and the salt he craves and even the wide open mouth sounds of every nature that burst forth throughout the day.  \n\n I\u2019ve been doing my best to help him with this piece but it feels like one of those bad movies where you run and run and the hallway distorts and telescopes away and away and the destination remains just out of reach.  \n\n I\u2019ve taken Fluffy swimming every week since he was three, to the OT for the last year and half, horseback riding for the last 5 months; we\u2019ve got a trampoline, a sit and spin, a ball pit with 800 balls shining brightly; we blow whistles and suck through straws and eat crunchy, chewy, stringy, hot, cold, salty, sweet things; we have playdough and moon sand and obstacle courses and hippity hop races and walks on the beach, movement and verse circles and lavender oil massages; I\u2019ve read  The Out of Sync Child  and  The Out of Sync Child Has Fun  and even the lesser known,  The Out of Ideas Mother Takes It Out On Her Husband  and still, I  know  like I  know  like I  know , there is sensory confusion and disorder that clouds the scene for my son and drowns out the view and the sound from without and within. \n\n I\u2019m not pinning ALL my hopes on this one visit but I do wish for some clarity, for our approach and most of all, for Fluffy\u2019s comfort and success.  \n\n Wish us luck. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.handle.org/index2.html", "http://www.booksofwonder.net/home.jsp", "http://www.amazon.com/Another-Day-Milky-David-Milgrim/dp/0399245480", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399523863/bookstorenow57-20", "http://www.amazon.com/Out-Sync-Child-has-fun/dp/0399528431"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/04/the_sensory_hun.html", "title": "The Sensory Hunt"},

{"date": "March 11, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I've been thinking of what  Amy  said in her comment on the last post about being anti-school. Maybe I'm anti-school, rather than just Auntie Kyra. I never thought of myself that way, but I never had a school-age child on the autism spectrum before.\u00a0 Maybe it's just public school that I'm anti, if that's even a sentence. Maybe it's because I went to a small, private school and got used to the slightly off-beat being commonplace.  \n\n See, I find it infuriating that the school systems make things harder for some families, for the parents and for the child. I wonder if it's that they really don\u2019t see what the parent is  saying , what the child is  needing  or that they  won\u2019t  see it since seeing would require something new from them, truly new, and not the same old rearranged on the plate. \n\n In some cases, it would require fundamental changes, a whole new way of SEEING and BEING.  \n\n It's disappointing to me that the special education team is so often unable to see that our children\u2019s challenges may be present opportunities for THEM to grow and learn and expand the way it provides us, the parents, the same opportunity. And I\u2019m glad for it. It can be hard work, yes, but it's so gratifying, to become more, to gain perspective and understanding, TO CHANGE and in the process be better able to help, provide for, and guide your child.  \n\n I wish the public school system was up for that personal challenge. I wish they welcomed the chance to be in the dark, to sit still and listen rather than fly around flipping switches, so sure they\u2019ve dealt with this before, so sure there is no new learning required for them. \n\n And listen, I'm not anti-teacher. I consider myself a natural teacher. I loved my years as a Music Together teacher. My mom taught elementary school before she left to work with kids at the state psychiatric hospital.

It's a photograph he took of the rug made into a negative image while still in the camera and then loaded onto photoshop where many modifications were made. Voil\u00e1! He calls this,  Untitled. \n\n Has anyone seen our rhythms?  \n\n We're entering our fourth week of testing through the school system. To be fair, we asked that the assessments be spread out to avoid Fluffy feeling too overwhelmed but I wonder if they simply are overwhelming no matter how you slice it.  \n\n Fluffy gains a lot of his sense of self and worth through  what he knows . He's been sitting in that blue room at least once a week, peppered with question after question, a lot of them for a child many years older than his sweet six years. He doesn't know all the answers. Even though they tell him, WE tell him, this is okay, more than okay! My goodness, some of those questions are much too hard for mommy and daddy! Still, I can see he feels bad about  not knowing .  \n\n Yesterday was part one of the psych. I liked that gal who administered the questions. I did. Even though she didn't hear Fluffy a few times, even though he said, wood? in his high little voice which was the right answer as she blithely moved to the next question. But no matter.  \n\n I can't tell how he did on one portion of the test; I couldn't see the pictures. But the first part was all word association. Here's what Fluffy said:  \n\n How are wood and bricks alike?  You can cut them both? \n\n How are mountains and ponds alike?  They are both made from nature? \n\n How are bees and butterflies alike?  They both fly.  Anything else?  They both gather nectar? \n\n How are water and salt alike?  I don't know. Can you guess? They're both in the ocean? Is that right? What IS the right answer? They're both part of life. Oh. \n\n (ah, WHAT?) \n\n How are revenge and permission alike? They're both things that you can give to someone else. \n\n How are apples and bananas alike? They're both things you can eat. Anything else? They have skins? \n\n How are mice and cats alike? They both walk on four legs. Anything else? They both have fur? \n\n In the middle of this, Fluffy interrupted her and asked,  How are carbon dioxide and dry ice alike? \n\n She was stumped. \n\n He enlightened her.  \n\n And now for a question of my own:  How are salami and assessments alike? \n\n I'd answer but my mouth is full. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/has_anyone_seen.html", "title": "Has anyone seen our rhythms?"},
{"date": "April 12, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t My computer is still on the blink, photoshop has failed me and my folder of over 8,000 family photos is missing. Now my word processing program is kaputz, and my email program is aggressively spitting back messages from others and tossing messages from me into the cyber-abyss. I can almost hear the wicked cackling in the distance.  \n\n Meanwhile, our RDI program is affectively stalled and has been since January. It's not that we don't do things, RDI-y things in our own RDI-y way. We do. It's not that Fluffy doesn't make any RDI-y progress. He does. But this stage 4 (if it still is stage 4 given the new Operating System) of variations is a tough one, a VERY tough one. We may be here for a while. \n\n It's not straight forward. Fluffy is wonderfully flexible in certain areas. Schedule changes don't give him a moments pause. Move things around the house (except for his 'special cubby'. Whoa, step away from the special cubby.) and he doesn't bat an eye. Look! We're eating on the floor. Fine! Oh! Our chairs are all rearranged. Cool! Hey! How did the table get in the hall? Silly! I can play roll the ball with a giant yoga ball, a marble, a pit ball, a grapefruit, a nut, an egg, a jar; I can play it backwards, shift all around the room, fast slow middle, two different items at once. He's game.  \n\n We cook together. He kneads dough, licks his fingers, tries everything. \n\n He loves novelty. \n\n But game rule changes? It's all over the place. One day, we're playing baseball with pool noodles and then blocks and then invisible balls; we're sliding into the ball pit, climbing onto the table, crawling toward a stuffed animal that we've suddenly made home base. It's not SEAMLESS but it's going. The next day we're playing Chutes and Ladders and I say, let's make up some silly rules and he says MOMMY NO! NO! I WANT TO PLAY BY THE REGULAR RULES! And singing? I launch into silly words to a familiar song and he growls and slugs me. I suggest kooky ways to get to the car and one day he says, let's go like we're running through spagetti! and the next day he says, I DON'T LIKE THAT! MOMMY! GRACK! and darts off in a way that clenches my chest because, after all, we're in a parking lot. \n\n Then there are times like last night. I was sweeping the floor in the kitchen and Fluffy was in his room, getting into pjs. He came leaping in, proud of himself for getting ready so quickly just as I sort of muttered under my breath, geez, I can hardly see what I'm sweeping here because I don't have my glasses. I had no ulterior motive. I wasn't TRYING to get him to do anything. He dashed out of the room saying, Wait Wait!  I heard him going from room to room, ending in the bathroom where he moved the stool around, climbed up and returned triumphantly with my glasses in his hand. Here are your glasses, Mommy! He called. He was beaming. Wow! I said. That was so thoughtful! Thank you! When my pile was ready, I said, I've just got to clean this up and he tore off again, calling over his shoulder, I'll help you! He came back with his dust pan and brush and we cleaned up the pile together. It was smooth as silk. Textbook RDI. \n\n And yet. And yet. We spend the morning in Boston yesterday, at our RDI consultant's office and it was an unqualified bust. From the moment we arrived until we left, Fluffy in tears. We managed to salvage the day, he and I, at the Children's Museum. But that morning? It wasn't full of challenge. All the games were things he has done before.  \n\n I'm trying to tune into my gut on this and it's not easy. Shall I back off? Stick with it? Push through? Leave it alone? There's a lot of static but I THINK what it's saying is SENSORY PROCESSING DISORDER. The weekly OT sessions he's been having for the last year and a half are doing SOMETHING but they're not getting to the heart of the problem.  \n\n Our HANDLE appointment is a week from tomorrow. If that doesn't do it, I will immediately begin looking for someone who can address the sensory difficulties that feel like they're in the way. It's like hair in the drain. For the last two years, the water's been flowing but the hair's been collecting little by little and now, the drain is full, clogged; the water cannot get through. We've got to clear the drain and my gut (I think) is telling me this is the way. \n\n I think we're going to stay in this stall, this holding pattern until the sensory piece gets the attention it needs.  \n\n And my computer? The clogs and stalls? Is it part of some master shift that must take place? Some master unclogging? Rerouting? Maybe. Until then, Dave will have to get back under the hood and I'll keep hoping that my messages will get through, somehow. And if you don't hear back from me?

{"date": "March 15, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t It is 7:30 in the morning. My hands are washed and dried. I am poised over the edge of the plastic container and I am spitting into a test tube. Spit spit. I am not allowed to drink water or eat anything, not even a tiny sip of my coffee.  \n\n I\u2019m not a big fan of saliva although I\u2019m pleased as punch to have it as I understand it plays a critical role in a number of my favorite things: eating and talking, not to mention digesting which I adore when you consider its close link to nourishing the body for living. I love living. I think I\u2019d bring it in as all time favorite thing. Living. Not living is so much less, well,  fun . So much so that I don\u2019t even have one memory of it, of when I wasn\u2019t living. So, clearly living is better, brighter, more colorful! \n\n I will be spitting into another test tube at noon, again at 4 pm, and one last time, before bed. Tomorrow, I will gather all my frothy tubes and mail them off to a laboratory for analysis.  \n\n Hormone analysis.  \n\n It\u2019s quite something to be perimenopausal and raising a smallish child. Add to that, raising a child on the autism spectrum, wait--homeschooling a child on the autism spectrum and what you get is one continuous surge of adrenaline, or cortisol, and the accompanying cascade of hormone production, cessation, and confusion. I think it\u2019s like gathering a crowd and then shouting conflicting directions to them through a megaphone: some speed up, some slow to a jog and say, 'wha--?', and some slump down on the curb and cry.  \n\n I\u2019ve been reading Suzanne Somers\u2019s book,  Ageless . If you are female and nearing or past 40, I think you should too. Say what you will about Three\u2019s Company, this gal has done her homework. She\u2019s smart and educated and experiencing robust health and well-being as she enters her sixties. A lot of people have slammed her for what she\u2019s says, for her outspoken views on bio-indentical hormones--not the synthetic hormones that doctors have been passing on to women for decades that have made them sicker, given them cancer and accelerated their stumble out to pasture, the new, potentially even life saving ones--but I stand up and cheer.  \n\n The health of a woman past her prime has never been sexy news. She brings concerns of poor sleep, irritability, joint pain, dry itchy skin, weight gain, and low or absent libido to her doctor and she gets sleeping pills, antidepressants, Advil, a bottle of Lubriderm, a couple of tummy crunch exercises and a doleful expression or a simple shrug. That\u2019s the way it goes.  \n\n I remember going to my gynecologist a couple of years ago and announcing,  I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m\u00a0 perimenopausal. What can we do for me?  And she said, how do you know? And I said,  I\u2019m moody, I have joint pain, I\u2019m down to a 23 day cycle, my skin is itchy, sex is a nice  idea , and I don\u2019t feel right, I don\u2019t feel well and I\u2019m used to feeling well.  Stare. Blink blink.\u00a0  I want to feel WELL,  I say.  Can we test my FSH? Find out how many eggs I\u2019ve got left? As an indicator of how close to menopause I really am?  Why? she intoned. You\u2019re not planning on trying to get pregnant so why would you want to know that information.  Uhm, because it will tell me something about my own body and I\u2019m interested in my OWN BODY.  Duh. \n\n She didn\u2019t help. And I put the whole thing on hold. I stepped up my Cod Liver Oil, I kept taking my multivitamin, evening primrose oil; I kept dripping Flaxseed oil in my oatmeal and yogurt fruit shakes, but I felt the same--not RIGHT. \n\n I still don\u2019t feel right, in fact, in some ways I feel worse. I think I\u2019m beginning to get night sweats. The other night, I was climbing around on Fluffy\u2019s bed, changing his wet pjs, layering towels on the mattress and I started to feel dizzy and warm, like someone had instantly set our thermostat to SAUNA just for a gag. I sat back on my heels and promptly fell off the bed. My hip. I couldn\u2019t support my weight, my expanding weight.  \n\n After reading Suzanne\u2019s book, I still feel NOT RIGHT but I also feel EMPOWERED. Did you know that the female body begins to shut down once it gets the message it is no longer reproductive? It\u2019s a cute little thing nature cooked up. No longer reproductive = no longer necessary. It affects every system, not just the endocrine. Our bodies quite literally, begin to slowly kill us off.  \n\n Well, not  this body . Not so fast.\u00a0 I\u2019ve found a great anti-aging doctor and I\u2019m gonna get hopped up on some bio-identical hormones, as soon as I finish spitting into these tubes. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Ageless-Naked-Truth-Bioidentical-Hormones/dp/0307237249/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-7828456-6529542?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173966425&sr=8-2"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/im_buying_the_b.html", "title": "I'm Buying the Bio-Identicals"},

We're at a plateau. \n\n And it occurs to me that now more than ever is not the time to be looking for anything. It's a time to be, to be Fluffy's mama.

{"date": "March 23, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Life is messy. I remember hearing a comic say after watching his wife give birth that he wanted to shout, DON\"T THROW ANYTHING OUT to the entire hospital staff. There was so much, well, stuff; how could he be sure there wasn't another baby mixed up in that mess? \n\n I  know  this about life. I'm often yammering on about it, about the important of getting right  in there , rolling up shirt sleeves, etc., how one can't really expect to get anything done unless you're willing to get some of it on you. But when it comes right down to it and I look down and see the mess? I feel a little panicky.  \n\n Here is the mess today: \n\n In my vomit-induced haze, I saw a comment on another blog signed, This Mom. I was a little taken aback, studying it at first thinking, hmm, when did I write that? Given it's capitalization and well-formed sentences, I quickly realized it wasn't me but another This Mom. Huh. I opened my typepad account and wrote a quick post about all of us throwing up into our silver mixing bowls and ended with the news of another This Mom and my slightly begrudged reaction and then crawled off my chair and down to the basement in search of more videos for Fluffy who was propped up on the mommy/daddy bed like the King of Siam, clamoring for more more more TV! \n\n I mean, what do I,  own  the name This Mom? Anyone can call themselves anything in this crazy mixed up world, what does it matter? Then again, I've been blogging under This Mom for a little over two years and I felt a bit proprietary, wrong or right. A little later I went her site and introduced myself, saying essentially, HI and I'm over here at This Mom dot com and I worried this might all get a little confusing and then crawled off to get Fluffy a cup of Tummy Comfort Tea, stopping every few feet to rest on the cool wood floor. Ahhhh, the floor... \n\n When I checked my email later, I saw one from the other This Mom saying Oh! she hadn't known and sorry and she'd change it and I wrote back saying, Thanks so much! But isn't it silly? and Who am I to say anything and I don't OWN the name, etc. etc. and I thought, oh good. All solved. There were also lots of comments from you all, mostly words of sympathy for our ill health with some words of support for my This Mom moniker, saying I was the only This Mom for you. Aw, heck. I felt cheered. \n\n This morning, coming back from another round of school assessments, I checked the email and found the other This Mom had left a very hurt and stung comment on my site. I felt terrible.  \n\n I sent a couple of emails to her but they bounced right back. I wrote my own comment in response but then just took the whole thing down. It's become a mess, not the kind of  look through to find the baby mess  but the  misunderstandings and miscommunications have occurred so just scrap it and start again kind of a mess . \n\n So. Let's start again. \n\n A woman started a blog chronicling her life with her ASD kids. She called it This Mom's Life because that's what occurred to her. She wasn't stealing. She picked a name that appealed to her. I'd say she has pretty good taste. I imagine she was looking for the same things I was looking for when I started to blog: connection, community, self-expression, meaning, a record of her life with her kids, their struggles and triumphs. Though no one meant to, after reading the comments section here in my last (now deleted) post, she ended up feeling unwelcome, ridiculed and pushed aside, and for that, I am truly sorry.  \n\n I said in my (now deleted) comment, COME BACK! COME BACK, formerly This Mom! Come back in any form you want! You don't have to come back to THIS site, though you're more than welcome. No one meant any harm! There is room enough for everyone! We are all here, with open arms and eager hearts and minds. We need your voice, your perspective, your stories! We do! \n\n And so, dear This Other This Mom, Please accept this post as the hand of friendship from the entire community. It's not presumptuous. I KNOW I can speak for everyone whose blog I read when I say, we need you and we want you. \n\n So sorry about any misunderstandings and hurt feelings. I have had such isolation and loneliness in the last couple of years. I would literally stand outside in my underwear with my bic held high, my little flame burning through the night if it meant you would come on back and blog away.  \n\n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/messy.html", "title": "To The Other This Mom"},
{"date": "March 17, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy\u2019s been talking about Autism and Aspergers a lot lately. I think it\u2019s part of his growing self-awareness, a need to understand himself, to make sense of his world, to find his place in it.  \n\n A few days ago, we got a flyer in the mail announcing the Imagine Walk, a family event for raising awareness about Autism, sponsored by the The Autism Project in our state. Fluffy saw it and immediately asked about it.  What\u2019s that? What\u2019s  Autism ?  \n\n Oh, my! I think as I see Dave stop short in the hallway and look in our direction. Ever since we had  the conversation , he's brought up his Aspergers but we've never connected it to Autism. Well, I begin, trying to find a simple, helpful way to answer--this is a teaching moment, after all, and I want to do right by him. Autism is a word that describes a kind of brain that kids and grown ups have but it isn\u2019t just ONE kind of brain. You know how we say that everyone is different but everyone is also the same? Well, there are all  different  kinds of Autism but  most  people with autism have stronger brains in the same ways and find the same sort of things more challenging.  \n\n Oh. I have Autism!  he said, brightly. \n\n Yes, I said, startled by his clarity and obvious delight. Or was it relief? Recognition? You do, I said, moving away from where I had been tidying up a few feet away in the kitchen area to sit down at the table beside him. You have a kind of Autism called Aspergers. Some kids with Autism have Aspergers and some have a different version of it. It\u2019s like a color. There isn\u2019t just one kind of blue, there\u2019s a whole range of blues, from the very light to the very dark and all the mixtures in between. They share a blue-ness but they are all a bit different.  \n\n How can you tell if a kid has Aspergers? \n\n What is an Imagine Walk? What will they imagine, mommy?  \n\n What\u2019s it like to have a regular brain? \n\n What\u2019s harder for an Autism kid? \n\n I did my best to answer, to talk about this without making proclamations that might limit him and his image of himself or his possibilities, without making Autism a thing to get rid of, to get OVER, to get past, without making everyone with Autism the same and better, without making everyone without it the same or better. He listened without judgment, as far as I can tell. He doesn't have a long history of what it means to be different, of what \u2018hard\u2019 means. He has this burgeoning self awareness and even as it is tender and new, it is not as fragile as I may think. In fact, at one point, he hurried me along with an impatient wave of his hand,  I know, I know, mommy. The brain is always learning no matter what. It is always growing and changing. \u00a0  \n\n Well,  he said, thoughtfully,  part of what makes it hard to sleep is the Aspergers. But part of it is just the way my thoughts come in to my head. You see, mommy? Some of the flickering is the Aspergers and some of it is just the way a brain works.  \n\n Yes. I see what you mean. \n\n Mommy, read this,  he said, pointing to a blurb about a summer camp for ASD kids. I told him it about it, told him that there are some programs that are just for kids with Autism, all different kinds. He made a delighted sound and said,  Yes. Yes. I would like  that kind of a place.  Oh, I said, making a mental note to call and get details. LOTS of details. \n\n And that?  he said, pointing to the blurb about the walk itself, the festivities, the balloons and petting zoo and COTTON CANDY. That\u2019s about the event itself, for the whole family.  Do they all have an Autism kid?  Not everyone but a lot of them. Big smile again.  Yes.   Yes, mommy .  We are going there that day. \n\n He needs his people!  \n\n We need our people! \n\n It isn\u2019t as if I\u2019ve never called out before. I\u2019ve been looking for community, real, in-person community since the start of our Autism journey. But something about this moment feels different. It\u2019s a little Field of Dreams-y, a little Secret-y, and I\u2019m open. I\u2019m ready to  imagine  feeling home out there in the world, regardless of where Fluffy with his Aspergers, in it, out, remediated, entrenched, whatever. I ready to see my son reach out his flickering hands to take hold, to connect, and see himself as part of a larger world than the one inside his home.  \n\n He needs it. Now that he's ready, will 'they' just come? Or do I need to clear some corn fields? \n\n Or maybe I've cleared enough. Maybe all I have to do is keep walking and keep imagining:  My son is at home here, out there.

{"date": "March 16, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n My hero; March, 2007. \n\n A few months ago, Fluffy was sick enough to be in bed all day but not sick enough to nap. We read and read and read some more, flipped halfheartedly through a few of the shows we tape: Little Einsteins, Peep and the Big Wide World (my personal favorite), Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and then spied the movie adaptation of  Watership Down  Dave picked up from the library sale room.  \n\n I love  the book  by Richard Adams. I read it again when I was pregnant with Fluffy, looking forward to when I could read it to him at bedtime, chapter by chapter the way my mom read Bambi, Charlotte\u2019s Web, Born Free and a long list of others to my sister and me. It\u2019s a memory I cherish, her expressive voice, her warm body, her cigarettey breath.  \n\n It\u2019s a long story, full of beautiful language. It\u2019s still too soon to try it with him but the movie? Sure, why not. I slipped it into the VCR and settled down to watch with him. \n\n Be forewarned: There is a prologue, a kind of creation myth that is pretty scary. It\u2019s done in gorgeous animation which tones it down some, but in it, the rabbits many predators gnash teeth and flash claws and leave behind splotches of crimson blood when they attack.  \n\n When I first saw it, I sputtered out my tea and leapt to the controls, quickly fast-forwarding to the start of the riveting and gorgeously done yet  much  less graphic story which begins when Fiver, the runt rabbit with a keen sixth sense, urges everyone to leave the warren to escape a certain but unclear doom. The doom is  Man , in his greedy clumsy pursuit of MORE at the expense of nature, mother earth, or  Frith , as it is called here.  \n\n Fluffy loves this movie, loves this story. We\u2019ve had lots of pretend play with paper cut outs of all the main rabbit characters. He\u2019ll bring them up out of the blue, engaging them in conversation, showing things to them, and occasionally asking me questions about them and the movie. Yesterday, standing under the shower at the Y, after practicing his snorkeling and flipper assisted laps from one side of the pool to the other, he said,  Mommy? Why MAN? \n\n What, honey? I said. \n\n Why do they say MAN? Man this and Man that? Why do they say Man made boat? Man lives here? Why Man and not ever Woman? \n\n I realized he was talking about Watership Down, a movie about trusting your inner voice, living free and close to your true nature, about friendship and creating community across cultural and species lines. \n\n Well, I guess because Man has come to mean human beings.  Man kind is another way of saying  Human kind. \n\n Does that mean someone could say Womenkind? \n\n I guess. But that would make most people think you were talking only about women, not men and kids. For some reason, people say Mankind when they mean all people. \n\n I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, mommy,  he said, looking off from under the spray of hot water, his hands held over his little belly.  I will say Humankind because that is what we all are--human people. \n\n That\u2019s right, my boy, my feminist, my hero. That  is  what we are.

Yes, the goat dog has my heart too. I soak in the view and the wide awake sky. When I'm there, I feel lucky to be alive, almost drunk on life like I might pull strangers in close to my bosom, embrace them fiercely, and shout, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL! DO YOU KNOW THAT?

Sadly, I can no longer find the exact site, having cut and pasted and then printed out, so I'm unable to attribute. My apologies to the original source. \n\n Hamentaschen  (This dough must be refrigerated overnight or AT LEAST a few hours.) \n\n 2/3 cup butter (we used soy margarine 1/2 cup sugar 1 egg 1/4 cup orange juice, no pulp 1 cup white flour 1 cup wheat flour 2 tsp. baking powder Various fruit preserves. We used raspberry. \n\n Preheat oven to 350.  Blend margarine and sugar. Add the egg and blend thoroughly. Add orange juice and blend again. Add flours, 1/2 cup at a time, alternating between white and wheat. (Note: I had to add at least 1/2 cup more flour to get the right consistency.) Mix well. Refrigerate overnight or at least a few hours.  \n\n Roll out the dough as thin as you can. (We rolled between heavily floured sheets of wax paper.) Cut out circles. Put a dollop of filling in the center (use a heavy hand!). Fold three sides to make a triangle, overlapping so that you get a nice seal at the corners but not so much that you can't see the filling poking through. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes. \n\n Remove from oven. Remember to use mitts. Try eating before cookies have cooled. Sputter and spit out. Try again after a few minutes like a normal person. \n\n \n\nHappy Purim! \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/hamentashen_to_.html", "title": "Hamentaschen to come..."},
{"date": "March 03, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Heart-shaped rocks on my windowsill; March, 2007. I love Star Wars. I\u2019ve seen the first one and the second one, I think, and perhaps bits of the third but after that, things get a bit fuzzy for me. I know the first one is really the fourth one and the last one is actually the first one. I think. We have some of them on dvd as Fluffy likes to do some (supervised) scene selections but things get very confusing when he makes a request to watch Episode IV. Oh, you mean the fourth one? I don\u2019t think we have that one, honey. We do? Oh. For me, there is only one Star Wars, the one where Debbie Reynold\u2019s daughter wears hair donuts on her ears. Anyway, I love that movie, camp and all. I sit next to Fluffy where he perches on back of the couch, way up there like Snoopy on his doghouse, and within minutes, I\u2019m crying. I'm a crier, one who cries. Last night, I read the last two chapters of Charlotte's Web to Fluffy at bedtime and blubbered away. Fluffy kept straining around to look at me, trying to figure out why I sounded so squeaky and quivery.  What IS it, mommy?  he queried, alarmed. I'm just sad, honey, sad that Charlotte died.  I'm sad, too, but I know that all the babies are going to get born and then Wilbur will be surrounded by HUNDREDS of spider friends.  He's already mastered  The Secret . There is a part of the first movie, Star Wars, where Obiwankanobe and Luke are trying to find transport for C-3PO (or, See Threepio, if you can believe it) and R2-D2 (Artoo-Detoo). The plans of the Death Star have been stored inside R2 by Princess Leah and he\u2019s been programmed to find Obiwan so they can bring this valuable information to the Rebel base in order to train for attack on the one vulnerable spot that could mean destruction of the Death Star. The impenetrable Death Star.  Now, I'm a fan but not a FAN so I don't have an encyclopedic grasp of what happens when and where to whom, but I do remember a scene where Obiwan and Luke are looking for transport--it's right before they meet Mr. Solo and his hairy friend. Storm Troopers are everywhere, looking for R2. The entire galaxy is looking for R2. One such officer stops Obiwan, Luke, and the droids to question them. R2 is in plain sight in their hovering air car. Obiwan gently and ever so slightly waves his hand in front of the Trooper and says, \u201cThese aren\u2019t the droids you\u2019re looking for.\u201d Instantly, the Trooper says, \u201cThese aren\u2019t the droids we\u2019re looking for,\u201d Obiwan tips his wrist again and says,\u2019You\u2019re free to go.\u201d The Trooper says, \u201cYou\u2019re free to go.\u201d The force.  That is the way I understand the secret, the Law of Attraction. Of course, Obiwan\u2019s been at this longer than I have. He\u2019s a Jedi, a master. But he knows all he needs to do is ask, envision. His belief is so secure, receiving is automatic and instantaneous. Ask  Believe Receive And the way to get there is through a combination of gratitude and visualization. Trust. Trust your feelings. If you are feeling good, excited, lifted high by the image in your mind, you\u2019re on the right track. I am so sold on this. I know it is true like I know I am typing on my little iBook G4. I know it is real like I know the fingers doing the typing are part of me.  \n\n How do I know? I'm seeing it everywhere. Remember when I was feeling friendless? Now I am feeling friendFUL. Sandpapering dry about time? I suddenly realized I have all the time in the world. Confused and unsure about where to live? We've rented a house in Northampton! Never seen the drowsy but not asleep phenomenon in my child? Seen it two nights in a row. \n\n And because of  my new friend , Drama Mama, I bought Fluffy a sleep pillow and I tell you, three minutes under its soft silky weight of flaxseed and lavender blossoms, and he is asleep. I returned to some evening yoga with  these cards , added in a  Bongers,  kept the massage and the chanting music and lo and behold, I saw droopy lids and muscles tiring of their firing. OH! And the best part! A box for the thoughts that cause flickering! It's just a simple brown, earing box but you should see the ceremony with which Fluffy opens it, pulls the thoughts from his head, secures them between his prayerful palms, and taps them inside. He must have put three or four loads of thoughts in last night, asking if they could spill out (certainly not!) and reached for the box first thing this morning to gathering the thoughts back up and into his head they went, with one grand sweeping gesture, as if he were slickin' on the hair gel for the revival of Grease. \n\n Last, but certainly by no means, least, I extend the warm and tingly blogo-hand of friendship and thanks to Liesel of the great  Dante's Inferno with Children , for listing this blog as one of the blogs that makes her think. I was honored to be included in  her list  and touched by the ways in which the virtual community of fellow bloggers has truly come to be a meaningful and enriching part of my REAL life.  \n\n You know, Newsweek and the Today Show can say what they like; every time one of you swings by this mom's front porch, it's the law of attraction in action. And for that, I am sincerely grateful. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thesecret.tv", "http://www.amazon.com/Kids-Yoga-Deck-Poses-Games/dp/0811836983", "http://www.bongers.biz/", "http://blog.dantesinfernowithchildren.com/", "http://blog.dantesinfernowithchildren.com/2007/02/several_days_ag.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/all_hail_drama_.html", "title": "All Hail Drama Mama, Liesel, The Secret, and Every One of You"},
{"date": "February 27, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Birthday decorations, still up; Today. \n\n I\u2019ve never seen the drowsy but not asleep stage so often discussed by those counseling the parent on when to put the child \u2018down\u2019 for sleep. We\u2019ve had a consistent nighttime routine with Fluffy for ages and a looooong wind-down period and things have improved a thousand fold over the last couple of years but still, bedtime is a time of wild movements and tense muscles punctuated by explosion and various machine noises.  \n\n And also beautiful and fascinating discussions about god and the universe and energy.  \n\n And sincere and slightly off-key singing. \n\n And legs thrown over mine and arms slung around my head and fingers twiddling strands of my hair. \n\n And sweet breath. \n\n And soft sighs. \n\n And sometimes startling questions like,  Mommy, do you know Italian?   \n\n Fluffy often asks me to press and massage and scratch and push on him, follow an itch that begins on his back and then jumps around, up, down, over, and now here on his arm and then down, down down, no! DOWN! which means up and then on his hand and then finger,  scratch my finger, Mommy, scratch it right here.  He needs his hands pressed and his arm pushed and then his mouth hurts and he needs a gum massage. A couple of months ago, he started asking me to press my hands over his eyes and hold them there. He often falls asleep with my hands over his eyes, as if I were shielding him from some large or frightening inevitability. \n\n A few weeks ago, I started a bedtime massage routine. After stories and lights out, I start at his feet and work my way to his head, taking a break to wash my hands of the lavender massage oil so I can return and massage his gums and press my hands over his eyes. I thought this might help, for him to know everything would get attended to, in some order, so anxiety wouldn\u2019t build, so he could anticipate relief and begin to relax. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s helping but we\u2019re still at it. \n\n Tonight, about halfway through he said to me,  Mommy, how do Asperger people go to sleep at night?  We\u2019ve barely discussed Aspergers since The Talk a few months ago, so it surprised me to hear him mention it out of the blue. Well, all sorts of ways, I said. They may take big ocean breaths or maybe have a little massage, they might listen to soothing music.  And get Reiki?  Yes, get Reiki and maybe by cuddling with their mom or dad or favorite stuffed animal. \n\n Oh,  he said with a sigh.  It\u2019s hard for me to let go of my thoughts, Mommy. During the day, I like being able to grab onto thoughts but at night, I don\u2019t like not being able to let a thought go.\u00a0 Sometimes thoughts go back and forth and sometimes moving pictures go back and forth and when they do, they sometimes flicker like this  (flicking the fingers on both hands)  and it won\u2019t stop and it hurts my eyes. That\u2019s why I want you to press on my eyes, Mommy. Sometimes I want you to press really hard even though that could hurt my nerves but it does stop the pictures from flickering. \n\n So I pressed my hands over his eyes and he asked if I could feel the flickering.  Yes. It\u2019s still there but it feels better with your hands there , and then he went on to tell me exactly how I ought to hold my hands over his eyes with the soft sticking up part  here  and not  there  where it makes a tent like this,  do you see? because that way makes a little air pocket over my eye and the air doesn\u2019t create pressure like your skin does. \n\n I wonder what it feels like to be so small with all those thoughts and moving pictures. I wish I could help him more with the flickering. For now, my hands will have to do but I wish they were magic hands that could draw the thoughts up through his tender lids, scoop them out and place them in a beautiful container by his bedside and in the morning, all he\u2019d have to do is open the lid and peer inside.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/02/flickering.html", "title": "Flickering"},
{"date": "March 06, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n A photo Fluffy took and adorned for me; March, 2007.  \n\n Fluffy's sick, poor guy. He's in bed right now, watching a Magic School Bus. He loves Miss Frizzle. Dave and I spent countless hours 'being' Miss Frizzle in conversation with Fluffy. That was back when we thought we had no choice. Whole days would pass with us talking in the high, excited voice of the Friz, in the store, at the playground, driving hither and yon, even though we had, truthfully, grown tired of it hours before. We didn't know we could say, oh, honey, I don't feel like being Miss Frizzle right now, or, I'm bored. Let's think of something else we can do, together. Isn't that funny? Something that simple didn't occur to us.  \n\n We're a little slow sometimes. \n\n This morning, Fluffy woke up doing math equations. Mom, is 100 times 6 equal to 700? I love that. I love when he proposes a math problem and gets it wrong.\u00a0 I love his brain and I'm awed by his strengths but I don't want him to be scary smart. Smart is enough. He already tries to engage one year olds about the Pluto situation, you know, whether or not it's a dwarf planet or legit. He doesn't really get why they don't weigh in.  \n\n Now that he's six and has an existing IEP, he's going through a new round of testing--educational, speech and language, OT, pysch, the works. The two he's had so far have lasted longer than expected because they couldn't get to his ceiling. They were going through parts of the test they'd never given before, stalling to read the instructions. I sat outside the partition and listened, feeling a mixture of pride and concern.  \n\n The law says we must have this testing. The school wants the information for the upcoming eligibility meeting. The name is irksome: eligibility meeting. The 'team' wants to determine if he is eligible for services. \"Just because a child has Aspergers, doesn't mean he needs services from the school.\" they said at the last meeting. Uh huh, I thought. Show me one child with Aspergers who doesn't need ANY services. Show me. But out loud I said, what you are talking about is a very subjective thing. The vision I have for my child is a critical piece of this discussion. The services I believe he needs are there to support his education, his moving toward this vision. I'm not interested in him getting through the school day. I'm interested in him thriving through the school day. And right now, that's happening at home. \n\n What concerns me is that the school sees his 'performance' during the testing as evidence of his ability to be in a class of fifteen other children. I say, scoring high points during an educational assessment, one on one with a adult for an hour means nothing about a child's ability to thrive in a classroom setting with peers over the course of a school day.  \n\n Ah well. On we go. The testing will continue. The meeting will be convened. I'll advocate for my child as I've done all along and if the school won't provide OT services and support for our RDI program, we will smile and excuse ourselves and continue to do just what we're doing on our own.  \n\n Just don't tell me the school is providing INDIVIDUALIZED services for each child, because they're not. At least, not in this district. \n\n What do they think? There's going to be a run on parents who want to homeschool their ASD child? Ahh, I don't think so.  \n\n The director said to me the other day, Some parents aren't advocating for their child, so we have to do it. But you, you Kyra. Every child of yours will be WELL advocated for. That is clear. \n\n It's nice to be recognized, even if it has the slight ring of a jab.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/sick_day.html", "title": "Sick Day"},

Tonight, we'll eat\ndumplings and noodles, loooooooong, uncut noodles as superstition has it, cutting noodles can shorten your life. \n\n Against Chinese new year recommendations, Fluffy and I wielded scissors in the making of our mini paper lanterns and hung them from a string of holiday lights. In keeping with tradition, we hung our good luck \"Red Couplets\" made from a combination of homemade paper, tissue paper and downloaded Chinese characters. Ours say,  Si Ji Ping An  (May you be blessed with peace and safety in all four seasons) and  Chu Ru Ping An  (May you be blessed with peace and safety wherever you are).\u00a0 At least, I hope so. What do I know from Chinese? \n\n We broke out the Family Fun recipe for fortune cookies. I made the first and, decidedly, most hopeless looking one.

He was his own little factory. We brushed them with water, sprinkled colored sugar, red of course, and baked them for about 12 minutes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n I read that some believe the first words spoken to you on the first day of the new year are significant, that they can bring messages of your year's fortune.

{"date": "March 09, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I took Fluffy to the school for round two of his Speech and Language testing. The sessions are held in the \u2018blue room\u2019 on the first floor of the public preschool a few miles from our house, the same building where he sees Miss S. once a week for OT services.\u00a0  \n\n I said my goodbyes in the hallway and watched as my son walked away with Miss. D., over the green, blue, and yellow square tiles, barely noticing their pattern. When we waited in this same hallway for Miss S. to take him down to the playroom last year, he\u2019d barely look up. Instead, he\u2019d hop and jump from square to square, racking up points, gaining extra guys, losing shields and ammo depending on where his foot landed. I can see why. Anyone can see the floor is really a game board. \n\n A few minutes after they disappeared around the corner, when I was sure they were tucked behind the divider, behind the blue square of paper that read, Testing Room, I followed.  \n\n I could hear everything from the other side, next to the file cabinets, beside the copier, on the window sill that looked over the enclosed play area built in honor of a four-year old boy that died from complications surrounding his epilepsy. I could hear Fluffy\u2019s high voice, answering questions in earnest. I could hear him noticing the paper on which the tester was recording zeros or ones or even fours. I could hear him asking,  Was that the right answer? Why are you putting an O here? What does that two mean? \n\n I could hear him asking for clarification, for definitions, for snacks, for a new shirt when he spilled a drop or two of water on the one he was wearing. I could hear his anxiety and tension, his\u00a0 fatigue and boredom. I could almost hear his exasperation, or maybe that was my own, when they asked him  What two details would the boy, Rick would need to get from the motel clerk he telephoned in a different town when he was looking for rooms to accommodate his team for the upcoming tournament, at his coach\u2019s request? \n\n HUH?  \n\n Every other word was new territory for him.  What\u2019s a motel ( he knows what a hotel is, but this? motel? ) What\u2019s a coach? What\u2019s a tournament? What do you mean, detail? What team? What does accomdy mean?  \n\n They assured me part two would be short; twenty minutes, thirty, tops. At fifty minutes, I knocked and came in. How\u2019s it going? You guys have been in here for almost an hour! Big smile, territorially approach to my son as I produced a snack bag of veggie sticks and some water. Only seven more questions, they assured me. Okay! I said and retreated to the hall and continued listening. \n\n When he spilled his water and took off his shirt, I knocked again, territorially approaching my son as I produced a replacement shirt. This time, I stayed. There may have been seven remaining questions but they were each multipart, reading comprehension questions. \n\n The thing is, I know the testing is part of the package. I know they need to find ways to measure and assess, track progress and isolate trouble spots. But it all feels tedious and meaningless to me. They were testing way above his level. Why? Because they wanted to get to his ceiling. Why? What does that matter? What will that tell them about what he needs in order to feel safe and regulated in the presence of his peers? Are they all going to be making a lot of motel reservations in the near future? Why the compulsion to go and go and go? Why not dip the thermometer in and out for a quick read? \n\n The \u2018desired\u2019 answers mean nothing to me. Fluffy\u2019s answers do. Take this, for example: \n\n You want to call your friend up and invite him to a party you\u2019re having at your house. What four details do you have to make sure to let him know? \n\n Fluffy\u2019s answers: \n\n 1. What kind of party it will be. 2. What kind of things will be at the party. 3. What kind of cake there will be. 4. What kind of frosting will be on the cake. \n\n They wrote down a zero.  \n\n But in my book, he scored off the page. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/the_blue_room.html", "title": "The Testing Room"},

{"date": "March 07, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy has an imaginary friend. Ssss, I ought to say, since there are many hundreds of them. They are hot air balloonists and they set out to fight the bad guys in record numbers from every location but always beginning their journey in the cupped palm of my dear son. We will be walking in the neighborhood and Fluffy will bend down on one knee, sometimes in the middle of the street, lay his delicately cupped hand down on the pavement, the filthy sticky wet with who knows what pavement, and send them off. One, two, maybe several at a time.  Pfetew pfetew pfetew , he calls, looking up and down, and then he\u2019s upright and reporting in on the state of the attack or the wind or the clouds or whatever else has caught his eye. \n\n The balloonists appeared a few weeks ago. At first, I thought they were merely floating around, pulsing their jets to gain height and perspective or sink down for a more intimate view. In the last week or so, I\u2019ve discovered they are sent out to look for bad guys to battle. There are very specific rules and props involved. The balloonists are tiny. About ten or so can fit into a basket. The baskets seem to be no bigger than a walnut. The baskets will grow as Fluffy\u2019s hand grows, he tells me, and so therefore, will be able to fit more balloonists as time goes by. Each basket is equipped with four things and four things only: a tent, a laser gun, binoculars, and a flashlight. \n\n A few days ago, I remembered that I had an imaginary friend as a kid. It occurred to me in a jolt, like a truck\u2019s sudden backfiring. It wasn\u2019t a person but an animal, a moose, a tiny moose with impressive antlers that lived in a small cardboard matchbox that I carried around with me everywhere I went. I loved that moose. I spent many hours wishing it would come to life, actualize in all its miniature splendor. I told it everything. It protected me but it wasn\u2019t a fighter. Its very presence had a insulating effect. He slept by my bed, tucked inside the slip-out base. He wasn\u2019t able to chase the boogie men from the darkness underneath the dust ruffle but he kept them from venturing out.  \n\n I told Fluffy about Moose. He listened with much respect and interest. He asked a lot of questions:  Can anyone else see Moose? Can Moose go through actual walls or just imaginary ones? Could he jump down from up here without getting hurt? How about from up here? Did you get rid of Moose or did you just one day lose interest in him?  I answered them all and then on Sunday, during our afternoon nature hike, I suddenly saw Moose, sitting contentedly inside the collector pouches Fluffy and I made last fall. Oh! Here\u2019s Moose! I said. He must have climbed down from the attic and slipped in here when we weren\u2019t looking. \n\n Fluffy was thrilled! He insisted Moose come along and watched as I set him down on the path. He kept turning around to track Moose's progress. Moose scurried behind us, a bit clumsily yet energized by the brisk air, the thawing ground, and the balloonist launching everywhere around us. Fluffy cautiously asked if Moose would like to be launched in one of the balloons to accompany his friends in their search for bad guys. Sure, I said. I can call him when we get back to the car. And so, up up up went Moose as we made our way to the reservoir with Beegu who was ever grateful to be out with us for the second time that day. \n\n The reservoir had a thin coating on ice on the shoreline, extending toward the center for about twenty feet. We have a shallow marsh behind our house that Fluffy and I have scouted to each end, through thick and prickly brush, over fallen logs to stretches that open up like quick inhales. We\u2019ve slipped and slid and searched for embedded leaves and other sunken treasures, kicking up the surface with heavy boots, sure of its strength and our safety. \n\n So it didn\u2019t really surprise me when Fluffy stepped onto the ice and started to walk toward the deeper part of the reservoir but it did quicken my pulse. Dave and I jogged to the edge and scooted him off, explaining that the ice was too thin, the water too deep and cold. He understood and moved away with us, repeating,  I did not get hurt, I did not get hurt , and even though he abided us and is not one for taking physical risk, I wasn\u2019t sure he got how dangerous it was to traipse on thin ice. But I didn\u2019t have time to press the point home because as soon as we had moved him back to the path, I saw Beegu submerged to her shoulders. \n\n She didn\u2019t make a sound as she pawed frantically at the small chunk of ice beneath her slipping front paws. I ran for her but couldn\u2019t reach. Dave held to me as I inched over the ice, not sure where, exactly, the bottom began its sharp decline. Dave held me and I grabbed Beegu\u2019s leash, a bit of rope we leave tied to her collar so we can wrangle her back to us if she\u2019s made a game of not coming when called. I worried it would snap off, either become unclasp or slip over her head as I pulled, hard enough to lug her back onto the ice but not hard enough to hurt; it was yanking on her neck, after all.  \n\n We got her out and onto the ice and once we had all moved to the grass, a bit breathless and stunned, she began to dance around, leaping up, barking at the air and I wondered if she knew how close a call it had been. \n\n\n\n Moose was waiting by the car when we got there. I\u2019m not sure how it went with the balloonists and the bad guys. I assume the ones Fluffy launched are still out there, patrolling the woods, keeping a watchful eye for threats, in all her disguises. I hope there are a few hovering near the reservoir. At least until spring has arrived.  \n\n My rendition of Moose. Taken by Fluffy; March, 2007. \n\n Fluffy's rendition of his hot air balloon.

{"date": "February 02, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Tomorrow is Fluffy\u2019s sixth birthday. We\u2019re having a party. With kids and everything. \n\n Up until a week ago, we didn\u2019t know what we were going to do. In some ways, we\u2019re at the same place we were a year ago. Fluffy doesn\u2019t hang out with any kids. He doesn\u2019t have any friends. He doesn\u2019t really have a concept of what that is--friends. At the tail end of his therapeutic horseback riding lesson earlier this week, the instructor asked,  Who\u2019s your hang out buddy at school?  I\u2019m homeschooled, Fluffy answered.  Okay, but who\u2019s your best buddy then? Everybody has a best buddy, a pal they do things with? Who\u2019s your pal?  And maybe he was tired or just cold but up until that point he had been animated and proud after his first time riding in the new indoor arena, trotting around the perimeter and then once around in the sun on his way back to the barn, but as she continued to ask him, he stared off and said nothing.  \n\n I was walking alongside them, also saying nothing but on the inside I was wringing my hands and saying all sorts of things, like, okay, enough about the friends! Who needs friends! What\u2019s the rush? Oh, dear. Is he feeling bad? Is that why he\u2019s looking down? Wait! What about T. from the kid gym at the Y? Isn\u2019t he a friend? Sort of? Okay, it\u2019s okay. She can ask that. He isn\u2019t saying anything because there\u2019s nothing to say! He\u2019s fine! La la! Look at THAT horse! That\u2019s a new one I bet!  \n\n We thought of having family only but several people were to be out of town. Then we thought of doing something special with just Fluffy but that didn\u2019t feel special enough. I mean, all we do is hang out together. It\u2019s lovely but it isn\u2019t much of an  event . Finally, we landed on a party with my two friends and their two kids each: Two six-year olds, and their two younger siblings, both three. Fluffy knows them better than any other kids around and the families are understanding and low key so we can be ourselves which really means I don't have to vacuum or pretend I'm not fat or act like having a birthday party for our son isn't an extremely big, wonderful, slightly nerve-wracking deal.   \n\n I asked Fluffy what he wanted to do.  Oh, mommy. I am not sure.  I told him, we were thinking of inviting these kids who would bring presents, they\u2019d all play some games and then we\u2019d eat cake. He nodded and said,  kids, cake, presents. Yes, mommy. That sounds good  and then carried on making rocket sounds and flying his toilet paper rocket through the air. \n\n Dave whipped up an invitation and we sent them out and then sat around, picking our noses, waiting for the party fairies to show up with a rockin\u2019 theme and fabulous cooperative games and cool party favors and snazzy decorations and a plump cake until it dawned on us YESTERDAY that We Must Be Our Own Fairies, something I plan to slap on a bumper sticker right next to No One Died When Clinton Lied just as soon as I finish frosting Fluffy\u2019s cake. Fluffy\u2019s rocket cake. \n\n Ta da! We don\u2019t need to search for a theme! We have one, right in front on our noses. Rockets! Fluffy loves rockets! His clear career goal is to become a rocket pilot. He\u2019s saving up for it. He gets a quarter every time he manages to pee in the toilet and I mean IN the toilet, not in the general area of the bathroom. Which he can easily do, if he goes to the bathroom when he realizes he has to go to the bathroom and not hours and hours later when the pee literally explodes from his pores like a human lawn sprinkler. He doesn\u2019t want to miss anything and there\u2019s the irony. Do you see? \n\n So, it's after midnight and I'm still up, cutting and pasting and hanging. It turns out, many parents  plan  parties, sometimes as long as a week ahead, with paper products and so on.  \n\n Wish us luck. Lift off is tomorrow at 3:30.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/02/lift_off.html", "title": "Lift Off"},
{"date": "February 05, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Well, I don\u2019t think it was a mistake to have the party, necessarily. Not a  mistake . I don\u2019t think. After all, Fluffy wanted a party. He wanted to have kids. He wanted to have a celebration. And why wouldn\u2019t he? Why wouldn\u2019t he want to mark this wonderful day, the day he came into the world, the day he set my life on this trajectory as I spin through deep dark space on this big ball of rock. But, as his Uncle Steve said to me, some things are more fun to  have done  than when you are  doing them  and I think that sums it up beautifully. \n\n Fluffy awoke on the morning of his birthday to a gift from mother earth, a world of shimmering white, the fat snowflakes still falling outside, silently. Inside, there were balloons and colorful cutouts streaming from the ceiling and presents awaiting in the living room. After presents and playtime, he bundled up for an extended frolic in the snow, a morning of sledding, topped off with a breakfast of his beloved home fries smothered in ketchup at a local restaurant. \n\n Fluffy\u2019s mood was dear. He played with us and with his toys. He took obvious delight in his surroundings and special treats. He remarked on everything in the most spontaneous and natural way.  Wow! Those balloons look great! Wow. Look at those things hanging--they\u2019re cool, mom. Wow. That cake looks great! I love it, mom! Thanks for making such a cool cake. Wow! A frisbee! Oh thank you so much, mommy! Thank you! Thank you! I was wanting one like this! \n\n But as the day went on and the party time approached, he got dysregulated and revved up. I don\u2019t blame him. He wanted to have kids but he doesn\u2019t know these kids; he doesn\u2019t know ANY kids. These were the ones he sees the most, the ones he hears me mention the most, the ones that have invited him to their parties, the ones that enthusiastically call out HI FLUFFY! when they see him.\u00a0 But for him, they are small bodies that move fast and talk loud and want things that are ever changing and unclear. And then there is the recognition factor--the inability to recognize faces of those he doesn\u2019t relax enough around in order to see and take in.  \n\n That said, everything was organized, set up for maximum fun and minimal conflict. The staff over at Family Fun would have been proud. We took the cooperative game sentiment and stuck it all over the space theme like so many flour and water soaked strips of newspaper covering the balloons we used for the rocket pi\u00f1ata. I don't want to bore you with the details but let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019re planning an astronaut/space/rocket party for a five to seven year old, I\u2019m your go-to gal. \n\n There were official astronaut badges and Rocket Building Stations where paper rockets we made and sent 10 feet into the air on alka-seltzer fizz at the Rocket Testing Site. Downstairs at the Astronaut Training Base there were six rotations where every manner of OT activity was converted to some critical facets of mission preparation. And then it was back upstairs for the mission itself: finding the stranded rocket ship and rescuing its cargo. Clues were gathered; riddles were solved. Basically, the riddle said, la la la and blah blah blah, the rocket ship is downstairs where you all just were but to them it was ancient Greek and they hooted and shrieked with glee at the their masterful code breaking powers.  \n\n I manned the doorway and let them down one at a time to avoid a pileup on the stairwell, Fluffy first of course, since he was the birthday boy. The rocket hung in full view. They tore over and stood beneath it, and jumped up and down.  There it is! There it is!  This was one of Fluffy\u2019s shining moment as he had arrived first, took hold of his string, and waited excitedly until everyone joined him, reaching over to hand the last string to the smallest one there to make sure she was included before they all pulled on my  Ready, Set, Go  and sent the party favor cargo to spill onto their heads in a cloud of brightly colored stars.  \n\n Now, when the first guest arrived, Fluffy opened the door, called out GO AWAY and then slammed it shut, victorious. But they\u2019re coming to your party, sweetheart, I said. Oh, he replied, looking confused. When the last guest left, he was in our room, watching the tail end of a Curious George video on his own. In between, he seemed, at turns, excited, overwhelmed, contented, anxious, relieved, and very very stressed.  \n\n I don't want to say a lot about it because after all, this is HIS life I'm discussing and I'm acutely aware that I am making decisions about what to say and how to say it and I don't want to do him wrong. But as I watched and intervened and redirected, I thought to myself, had I been overtired, hopped up on caffeine and cake batter, deeply perimenopausal, headachy, and confused about what others were asking of me and what I was meant to do to at any given moment, I may have done the very same things, right down to reaching across the table to pinch someone\u2019s mouth closed to get a little peace.  Shut it.  Or screamed blah ralliiiiaheee plaaaaaaaaach just to hear myself think or poke-poke-poked at a nearby hand that  may  have been inching closer to my ice cream just to clarify some boundaries.  \n\n Oh, wait. I was those things. Tee hee. No no! I was fine. All was fine. It was some of what you thought  might  happen and some of what you knew  could  happen. It's like assisting a rock down a bumpy hill, you can plan all you want but once the thing is in motion, you must be too, shifting this way and that, trotting ahead, near and in between, doing the great human buffer dance. I'm glad to say, everyone made it to the bottom in one piece. \n\n Next year, we\u2019ll try it again but I think we\u2019ll do it first thing, when we all have our best energy. We'll find flatter ground and move \u2018em in and out before noon.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/02/well_i_dont_thi_1.html", "title": "The Party"},

Add a few leaf shapes at the end. \n\n Let dry. \n\n Cover with contact paper.  \n\n Voil\u00e1! A rainstick!

{"date": "February 09, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Okay. It was a mistake to have the party. Fluffy was overwhelmed. Many of you have said that even the NT child can be so overdone by the whole party thing they may spend the entire time screaming from under their bed. That helps. There is no hope whatsoever. Birthdays are to be ignored. Tee hee. No. I mean, we will put the whole thing away until next year. By then, I will be much older and wiser. At least, older.    \n\n At least Fluffy wasn\u2019t traumatized by the party. Just his parents. And Beegu, a little, since she divided her time between outside on the tundra and inside in lockdown.  \n\n The cake was divine. I must say. I cut and pasted with a square and a round layer and made a remarkable rocket, glued the pieces together with raspberry jam and topped the whole thing with homemade butter cream. It was a geometry challenge and as I got a big fat D in geometry in high school by the old fart who called me Medusa that whole year, it was sketchy at first but I hung in there. Once I figured it out, I was so excited I double frosted the thing--a bottom crumb coat and top smooth coat with a flourish of stars and cursive writing. It was a feat for me. Normally, my cakes looks like I got into the shit. the stash. the smack. I'm so street, aren't I? \n\n We are going through a minor storm lately, a storm of turbulent feelings and zero self-control. At times like these I am so very glad we homeschool as I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like for Fluffy to have to deal with this, whatever this is, and a classroom of kids as it\u2019s hard enough to deal with me saying, no, you can\u2019t have a chocolate pop for breakfast. We\u2019ve had trips to the Reiki Master and the health food store for Kid Calm, a magnesium supplement, not to mention new supplies for the \u2018mad place\u2019 and what amounts to ropes tossed across the choppy waters to help him across or at least, help him know we're still here, still with him.  \n\n I think of all the press out there about aspergers and bad tempers and I know, I just know in my gut in doesn\u2019t so much have to do with a  fault  in the brain as it has to do with particular  strengths  and how they set one apart, farther apart from others because of what works  so well . There is this great divide between where their mind takes them, way out in the stratosphere, and the demands that require being back on ground. They can see things out there but they can\u2019t always find their way back home. And this must be incredibly frustrating and confusing. The anger comes because of,  after , not  before  and certainly not  first . \n\n That said, I will share the following: \n\n The other day Fluffy said, laughingly,  Mommy, I can tell what the hour hand says and sometimes the minute hand but I can never tell what the second hand says because the second I figure it out, the second has passed! \n\n At Christmastime, Fluffy\u2019s cousin was teaching him how to play a hand-held computer version of Connect Four. The computer and he kept having a draw, something I gather is called A Cat, or Cats Game. Tonight at dinner, he brought this up and again, laughingly recalled it to us adding,  I kept getting so many cats, I couldn\u2019t hear myself think because of all the meowing! \n\n Last week, I took Fluffy out to lunch to celebrate his birthday. We went to one of his favorite restaurants, Applebees, because they make the best french fries. As we were eating, Fluffy said to me,  Mommy, I know there are 60,000 nanoseconds in a minute. How many nanoseconds are there in an hour?  Geez, I don\u2019t know! I said, trying to stay away from fact gathering mode.  Well,  he said,  we could figure it out.  Oh? I said.  Yes. Write it down, mommy. Write down 60,000 nanoseconds in a minute times 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.  So I did. And then he wanted to know how many nanoseconds in a day.  Times it by 24 since there are 24 hours in a day.  And in this way, we figured out how many nanoseconds there are in a year, each equation dictated to me by Fluffy. \n\n I thought we were done, but he wanted to know how many years we\u2019d have to go in order to end up with a quadrillion nanoseconds. He loves the number quadrillion. It\u2019s a passion of his. He said,  would it be a century or a millennium?  I was caught up in the mathematical fervor by now and I said, after writing out our number, well, we\u2019d need 15 places after the one to make it a quadrillion and here\u2019s our number so you tell me, how many years? And he looked and looked and then said,  a century plus and millennium  and he was right.  \n\n So, as Fluffy often says,  correct me if I\u2019m mistaken , but I believe there are 3,144,960,000,000,000 nanoseconds in 10,000 years and now I am off in search of a pair of sock that could comfortably and continuously stay on my dear son\u2019s foot for an entire morning and $3,144,960,000,000,000 is about what I'm willing to spend if I find them.   \n\n\n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/02/a_love_of_quadr.html", "title": "A Love of Quadrillion"},

We\u2019ve read books about the water cycle: the freezing, melting, evaporating, and precipitating. We\u2019ve read books that say the molecules in water are older than the planet itself, dating back to the moments of intergalactic pre-earth swirl and tumble. \n\n But last night he asked me something and I was stumped.

{"date": "January 25, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t THIS:  A 16 year old boy with Aspergers  recently stabbed and killed a classmate in a school bathroom. \n\n Fluffy is thin skinned. He feels things very deeply. He also has an explosive temper, at times. The pain, confusion, and deep wounding he feels when he thinks he\u2019s been wronged or treated badly washes over him and he is submerged, for a time.  \n\n Last weekend, we went to the new home of a local Waldorf school for an open house. The building was lovely, bright, inspiring. All the rooms were beautiful, especially the Kindergarten room, the largest and most fascinating for me with chunky maple blocks and tree blocks and hollow blocks and a lovely kitchen corner and the sand table and a gorgeous arched bench used for storytelling. I wanted everything in the room. I wanted Fluffy to be in that room with the other kids. I wanted his little pair of shoes to keep a place on the edge of the dear blue circletime rug alongside the other colorful pairs belonging to his classmates. \n\n I saw a woman there I know peripherally, someone I haven\u2019t seen in at least two years. She has twins ready for Kindergarten who were there with her, peering into my eyes, asking questions, wanting to build things with Fluffy.\u00a0  How ARE YOU doing ? she asked me, pointedly, it seemed to me.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t sure what she meant, exactly. Had she heard something about my son? Did I look a fright? Was she just feeling terribly emotive? I answered that we were doing great.  Are you thinking of coming here?  No, I said, not for a while at least. Are you thinking of this for the twins?  Oh, yes! They are so ready for it! They are just so engaging! Wherever they go! They make friends with everyone!  Or something like that and it was true, from what I could see.  They\u2019re so much like their father , she said, smiling. Yes. I used to think I could learn about the parents through the children. I used to think it was that simple. \n\n We kept it short for Fluffy. There were delicious snacks in the front room and toys to play with in each room. It was not crowded and the building was bright with natural light. But it was hard for Fluffy, I could see. He was pinging and careening around until he found the sand table in that last room, the K room, and then he settled in for some sand rocket play with Dave that seemed to ground him.  \n\n Soon after, we left through the door that led to the outside play area. Every classroom had such a door so the kids could come in and out of their own classroom without having to line up and wait and trudge through long hallways. Winter had finally arrived the day before and it was freezing. The ground was torn up as the landscaping was incomplete and blocked in, the school only in use for a few days. It was hard everywhere, wood chips frozen, sand mounds like rocky boulders. There were two other kids plays in a strip of ice, an older girl taking a running start and then falling to her knees to slide the distance, her younger brother repeatedly hitting the surface with a big stick, trying to crack through. \n\n Fluffy was drawn to the ice but didn\u2019t quite know how to organize himself. He gets like that, sometimes, as if he has been in his body only a short time and isn\u2019t sure how everything works, as if the earth is a boat on a rising wave and he\u2019s waiting for his sea legs to kick in. We tried coaching him to join the sliding ice game but he didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he stood in the girl\u2019s line of play and wouldn\u2019t budge. The little boy continued his work with the stick, bang bang, closer and closer until he accidentally bumped into Fluffy and hit him in the foot with his stick.  \n\n Fluffy hit back and hit again and began to push. He was holding a stick too at this point, and my fear, as I slipped on the ice to get to him in time, was of that stick and the ice and the little boy\u2019s eye. By the time I reached them, the boy\u2019s father had scooped up his son and was saying over and over,  are   you okay are you okay , never looking up at Fluffy or us. I said the usual things about how hitting isn\u2019t okay and please say you\u2019re sorry to the boy and he didn\u2019t mean to bump you and other things, like, oh, look at that? and here\u2019s another block of ice, I wonder if we can break through this. \n\n But the boy was on his mind. And later, after making his way near him again, the boy hit him on the foot with his stick, softly, on purpose this time. Fluffy exploded, arms and legs everywhere and this time, we had to pick him up and move him away, which only furthered his anguish, his feeling of being at the mercy of an unjust world.  \n\n I think of his fury, the intensity, the density. I think of the longing it seems to come from, the desire for connection, the urgency and confusion about how to start over, to be friends. We were on the other side of the play area and the boy was still around. I notice with a sinking feeling that he was moving toward the wooden boat play structure, as we were. Dave and I had been talking about how one can start over, move past the rough patch, how sometimes people can get off on the wrong foot and all it takes is a moment of starting new. Fluffy said, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, which suddenly paved the way for him. He latched onto that, saying he had forgotten that and that maybe  his  forgetting seeped into the little boy and then the little boy forgot too! He brightened and climbed on to the stern of the boat and began quickly explaining this theory to the boy, the little boy, the not quite two year old boy, all the way on the ship's bow. \n\n I think of him trying to talk it out with the boy, the boy\u2019s silence, the dad\u2019s silence, our coaching, the ice all around us, as he clammored after him on the boat, in and out of the covered cabin where the steering wheel lay, wooden, smooth, immobile. Finally, Fluffy said simply, he wouldn\u2019t hit the boy next time he saw him and the boy (after some coaching) said the same and Fluffy\u2019s face, tearstained, relieved, proud, beamed into the stiff air.  \n\n And I think of the 16 year old boy who stabbed his classmate and immediately said,  I did it, I did it.  And then,  Is he okay? I don't want him to die.   \n\n These are very different stories separated by many miles and many years and I know, a boy died and that is beyond tragic but I ache for the boy, the 16 year old boy who said,  Is he okay?  and I feel haunted by it, by the whole thing, by his innocence and rage, packed together like that torn up ground and ice. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.berkshireeagle.com/headlines/ci_5051489"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/01/packed_together.html", "title": "Packed together like that torn up ground and ice"},

I'm feeling snarly and bitter and at the end of my rope, like I'm walking around clutching a sad, fraying edge. I want to hold it on high and make a growling sound, shake it in the air and push out my lips and lower jaw at anyone who comes near.  \n\n This is the state of mind of one of the women who lives in my body.

{"date": "January 08, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy and I have some of our best conversations in the darkness of his room at bedtime. Even though I always have high hopes of accomplishing something once he\u2019s asleep, my body instantly downshifts the moment I stretch out on the bed beside him, my muscles surrender, my voice slows, my eyelids droop. The same does not happen to my darling son although some sort of switch is tripped as this is when he can be his most philosophical, especially about his alien world, the world of Alien Gromit and Invent Master, both of whom are part-dog aliens that reside in a galaxy hidden within Sun H. \n\n Last night he said,  Mom, nature is more powerful than people and God is more powerful than nature and Invent Master is more powerful than God. After all, Invent Master was never born and can never die and doesn\u2019t need food and can move faster than the speed of light and can invent anything.  Maybe God can do all those things too, I said.  Yes, but God needs people to build his inventions and Invent Master can do it instantly. \n\n Rock on, Invent Master. \n\n I really have to write all of these things down since this world of Invent Master and Alien Gromit is so very specific and incredibly detailed in his mind. Exactly where they live and what they invent and all the rules that govern this land, this universe, must reveal more than just his imagination. They talk to him. He talks to them. Sometimes he looks wistfully away and says with a sigh,  Oh, I wish I could meet them, Mom.  \n\n That\u2019s his dream; meeting Alien Gromit and Invent Master. Actually, his dream is to share this very home with me, Dave, Beegu and those two alien half-dogs for the rest of his life. That\u2019s what he told me, his arm slung over my neck in his signature strangle-hug, his hand gently playing with my hair as we both rotated in space in his own private universe, under his glowing stars and planets, his new moon light casting its waning beam across the room. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/01/inside_sun_h.html", "title": "Inside Sun H"},

{"date": "January 10, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t   \n\n \n\n \n\n Fluffy at Christmas; seeing things his way. December, 2006. Eating fresh pineapple + sipping strong coffee = unpleasant taste.  \n\n Fluffy is homeschooled but we have an IEP through the school district, one that\u2019s covered his weekly OT sessions for the past year and a half and our RDI consultant services since March. I\u2019ve called for another meeting this month because the Director of Special Education, a strong advocate for what we are doing with Fluffy, has left the state and there\u2019s a new gal in charge, someone I\u2019ve never met and someone who doesn\u2019t know much about RDI. \n\n We had an informal meeting earlier this week and she seems supportive. I\u2019m gathering material to drop off tomorrow, progress reports from the last fifteen video tapes we\u2019ve sent our consultant (15!), two of the actual video tapes--one from March and one from December--so they can see a bit of the Fabulous Fluffy Show themselves, and a list of goals to insert into the IEP so we can, hopefully, check them off as met when we reconvene in January, 2008.  \n\n I gather there haven\u2019t been any goals in the IEP since March and you know how the school systems feels about goals! and progress reports! To be fair, of course they need them. Every two weeks, we review our objectives with our consultant and set new ones. Every week, Dave uploads the footage and we watch it on his expansive monitor screen, paying as much attention to our own level of connection and responsiveness as Fluffy\u2019s. Nothing captures the truth like your own home movies. Believe me. \n\n I\u2019m putting in all RDI goals. I reworked the language a little, you know, put it in English so my tender head wouldn\u2019t throb. I\u2019m going up to the end of Stage 7 even though I hope that Fluffy will be at Stage 8 and working with a dyad partner, a peer, a friend! But if he is solidly at Stage 7, Caring For Others, generalizing all the stages up to and including that point, I will be thrilled. Here is what that would mean: \n\n He enjoys variation, from the subtle to the wild, slight shifts to out and out absurd rule changes and role reversals; he adjusts easily to unexpected shifts in his schedule; he references, adapts, and makes corrections to stay coordinated with other person; he plays an equal part in adding changes to a game and is able to let it go if he notices the other person can not stay with him; he makes repairs to stay together; he values getting the approval and seeing the enjoyment of the other person more than achieving any specific endpoint of his own desire in the game; he remains at our side without prompts, reminds or physical contact while walking together in every day settings--the other person doesn\u2019t have to do more than 50% of the regulation to stay side by side; he references to ensure the other person is having fun; he stops, limits, or modifies his actions when he notices the other person is feeling upset, bored, confused, or annoyed; he recognizes that he may have a different emotional reaction to something than his partner; he, in other words, uses the other persons reactions to prior action as his reference point for choosing further actions. \n\n Huge. \n\n The thing is, I\u2019m already thrilled. He is already more interested in playing with us rather than playing on his own, even when that means playing the game I want to play and letting go of his own. He makes adjustment and corrections to stay coordinated, which simply means, he\u2019s motivated enough and regulated enough to be more of an equal play partner. He likes variation and doesn\u2019t mind shifts in his schedule. He\u2019s beginning to make corrections and notice when I\u2019m confused or upset or having a hard time with something. He sometimes asks,  what do you want to play?  when the babysitter\u2019s arrive. He\u2019s interested in other kids enough to move toward them and not away.  \n\n It\u2019s my 2 year blogaversary. Things have changed so entirely around here, when I think back, it\u2019s like looking through the wrong end of a telescope at stilted figures moving within a tiny, fuzzy circle. The most significant change is this shift from saying,  Mommy! No no no!  And it\u2019s all coming from Fluffy, from his growing feeling of competence which reveals his underlying motivation which flows along with his excitement and willingness to step into the unknown.  \n\n Two years ago, rolling a ball back and forth was too terrifying, confusing, hard. But in the video from last month, I said, Let's roll the ball then bounce it then throw it and then toss it aside for a nearby balloon and I know! Let\u2019s play soccer which morphs into holding that balloon between us, stuck to our bellies without letting it drop to the ground, then, Hey! Let\u2019s bat it with sticks, and then bat it with pool noodles, then, Oh! Let\u2019s carry it aloft, together, between the ends of our noodle swords. Oh no! It\u2019s a bomb! Quickly get it to that cave over there and drop it in and now race to the other side of the room and take cover as it explodes into a smithereens.  \n\n Yes yes yes, Mommy!

{"date": "January 04, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy has sensory issues. I have sensory issues too. Some are always there like my irritation with tags and intolerance of certain fabrics. Very occassionally I feel I may explode if the radio isn't turned off or if I don't move my body or stretch, feel my muscles holding onto the bones. I'd have to be admitted to the ICU if I spun on the tire swing the way Fluffy does regularly and a host of other things I could mention. Mine are very mild, but still, I really get how this can take over the show. And I feel a sense of urgency when I watch Fluffy in the throws of what looks to be sensory overload or sensory underload. It may look bratty to someone else but I know it's about him not getting some very basic and critical needs met. And I hate that--the idea of him not getting his needs met. Who's going to meet them, if not us. Him? The NT kid can do it naturally. Fluffy cannot.  \n\n My sensory stuff comes and goes; when it's with me, it's a slight pulse, like the TV screen intermitently going blank for a split second. With Fluffy, I imagine a wildly flashing screen with\u00a0 alarms and strobe lights and maybe even wiggly things randomly flying around in the air.  \n\n He\u2019s been having weekly OT sessions with a wonderful woman for the last year and a half. He loves those sessions and I know they\u2019ve been helpful but it\u2019s not scratching the whole itch. It's like, ah ah ah ah ahhhhhhhhhhhhh? Umf. It's still there.  \n\n We have an appointment with Judith Bluestone from the  HANDLE  institute in Washington state. She comes east every few months to a place in New Jersey. We\u2019ll see her in April. Her approach is very holistic and maybe some would say woo woo but she impressed me in person at the Annual ASA Conference this summer and I know of two other people who've taken their ASD kids to see her with good feedback so, on we go. \n\n Fluffy has the basic issue=sensory processing disorder. I see it affect everything for him. When he gets over stimulated or overloaded (too much going on, too many people in the room, too bright, too dark) or even underloaded, some part of him shuts down and he reverts to what looks like naughty behavior: doesn't listen well, crashes into things and people, chews on his clothing, licks things, wants to bite things and people, acts drunk/silly/wild. He has vestibular issues, proprioceptive issues, maybe some eye tracking issues? although reading is not a problem but I've heard it can affect other things.  \n\n He can NOT recognize faces. He's got ours down (although that wasn't always the case a few times in crowded unfamiliar settings). Think of how this impacts social interaction. If he can't recognize a face, why spend a lot of time looking? His referencing with us is good but I'm afraid some difficulty he has with generalizing coordinating actions and possibly co-regulation (when we get to that point--stage 6) will be due to this challenge more than anything. Why look if you can't tell which kid was the one that just asked you to play or just socked you in the leg or just ran around playing that fun game with you a few minutes ago?\u00a0 I know this is an issue for some kids on the spectrum, specifically those with Aspergers. I know there have been studies that illuminate the differences in this part of the brain, the back part, the part you touch when you clasp your hands behind your head and lean back in your docksiders to congratulate yourself on your strong team spirit and choice of brushed cotton trousers.  \n\n The Enki homeschooling curriculum has a strong sensory-motor component and I've seen how much the songs and movements we do at circle time help but, what can I say? We need more. \n\n There are times when Fluffy seems really in a good place, much more so than ever these days. I can see the balance and integration on his face, a crispness, a calm, his EYES alert,  seeing , you know? Then there are times when he is bathed a light fog, out of sync with his body like the fused Lily Tomlin and Steve Martin in  All of Me , his eyes are glazed, his pupils dilated.

{"date": "December 19, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t 1. Fluffy is no longer obsessed with any toy or activity--not computer games, videos, or even (drum roll) magnatiles. Nothing. Oh wait--words. He does love to tell loooooong stories about Alien Gromit and Invent Master. But is that an obsession? I think not.  \n\n 2. Last night, Mama Mama put Fluffy to bed. Dave and I were puttering about in the house, but still! That was a mile-high-stone.  \n\n 3. On family day, we went to the tree farm where Fluffy selected an eight foot Canaan Fir. He gave it Reiki before it was felled by a couple of hulking teens and what looked to be a nail file.  Do you want some Reiki?  Fluffy asked and asked and asked again. Huh? Ahhhh, no. I\u2019m all set, said one but the other shrugged his shoulders and said, Sure, and then dispensed a jolly rancher as thanks.  \n\n 4. Said Reiki-ized tree is up. Fluffy, Mama Mama and I decorated the whole thing. You can tell where Fluffy focused his efforts. The boughs nearly touch the floor, such is the weight of the multiple ornaments sharing one branch. So cute. I only moved one thing. It was glass. I knew Beegu  wouldn\u2019t be able to resist . \n\n 5. Happy fifth day of Hanukkah. \n\n 6. Are any of you celebrating the Solstice?  \n\n 7. Issues of global warming aside, hasn\u2019t this fall been dreamy? \n\n 8. Is it okay for parents to feel worried or even devastated when they first find out about their child\u2019s autism? Or will the word police come issue a summons. DIS IS NOT ALLOWED! NO DEEFEECULT VEELINGS HERE! YOU VILL ONLY FEEL HAPPINESS AT ALL TIMES! \n\n 9. When Fluffy takes hold of the scissors, it\u2019s all hands on deck. He uses both hands and snaps wildly at fingertips, noses, etc.. I added  My First Book of Cutting  to our morning  Handwriting Without Tears  and he has made giant strides in just two days. Each page has a cutting \u2018game\u2019, although that term is used very loosely as far as I can tell since some games involve cutting along straight fat lines past pictures of snakes and then...that\u2019s it! That\u2019s the game! As you make your way through the book, the games get harder and more interesting and at the very end, you get a Certificate of Achievement. Fluffy flipped through the book yesterday with genuine excitement, muttering things like,  oh, wow, that one looks cool!  When he put the book down he was visibly flushed and exclaimed with fist in the air,  I can\u2019t WAIT to get that certificate! \n\n 10. Have you heard? Newly elected Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he would support a \u201cshort-term\u201d increase in U.S. troops in Iraq. The gals at  Code Pink  have asked us to spread the word. I take the following from their email: \n\n Please take a moment out of your busy holiday schedule to call, email or FAX Harry Reid and tell him this just isn't acceptable. \n\n Call: 202-224-2158 -- Democratic Leadership Office in DC (If that doesn\u2019t work call his scheduler: 202-224-7003) Email:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Susan_McCue@reid.senate.gov (chief of staff) Fax:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 202-224-7327 -- DC Office You can use the sample letter below or write your own: Dear Senator Reid, The November 7 election was a voter mandate for peace, not for escalating the war in Iraq. Your recent remarks supporting the sending of more troops in an ill-conceived effort to \"pacify Baghdad\" is an affront to the voters who put your party in power. We passionately oppose such an ill-conceived escalation that will only lead to more dead and wounded American soldiers, and more dead and wounded Iraqis. It will not lead to peace, but only intensify the cycle of violence and inflame anti-American sentiments throughout the region. After the historic November 7 election, this is no time for caving into the Bush war agenda. It's a time for honoring the peace sentiment of the American people. We call on you to oppose any escalation of US troops and firmly demand a timetable for bringing our troops home.

We lit thirty eight candles. Fluffy and I counted. You got your advent candles, Hanukkah candles, solstice candles plus a handful of extras for all those dancing shadows. Nick, the nicest guy in the universe brought to us via New Zealand, is here tiling our kitchen and addressing the other miscellany of house upkeep that accumulates every few years. While we were upstairs in a circle of flames reciting verse and singing  Neesa Neesa Neesa , he emerged from the basement with his headlamp beaming. Oh. Hello. He was very kind and blas\u00e9, but he beat his retreat so hastily, I half think he was worried we were going to start stripping down.  \n\n Which reminds me of the checkout gal in California who told my husband to strip down.  Excuse me?  He stammered and stared, sort of shocked but also a tiny bit flattered, kind of reaching for his shirt button with a side look to me. The card. In the machine, sir. It goes strip down. Oh. \n\n Fluffy and I went for an adventure this afternoon to collect whatever nature tossed in our path for the making of the Earth Mother and Sun Child for our solstice celebration. We came home with twigs, stones, pine cones, leaves, and some grass and within minutes Fluffy announced,  I already know how to make the Earth Mother!  Once she was assembled with the aide of our trusty glue gun, he ran upstairs to tackle the Sun Child. He called down,  Mom! Is it okay if the Sun Child is taller than the Earth Mother?  Sure! I said. And down he came, his design a clear picture in his mind. He art directed the whole project. My only role was dispensing hot glue. \n\n I give you, Mother and Child, Fluffy style: \n\n Lean Sun Child on the left; Stout Earth Mother on the right. \n\n \n\n The picture doesn\u2019t do it justice. I can\u2019t take a close-up to save my life. Trust me on this, they are amazing.  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s asleep in his room, candles safely keeping watch from inside glass containers. I\u2019m typing by candlelight in my tiny office. It\u2019s like the olden days, you know, back when my foremothers updated their blogs by the flickering flame of the votives. \n\n So, now that Nick has left the building, my son is dreaming of tomorrow evening when the final Hanukkah gift will be tucked inside the Hanukkah pouch, and the sun has turned her firey face back our way, I may steal that checkout girl's line and go find my husband. \n\n Happy Solstice. May we all strip down. \n\n \n\n Our Reiki-ized tree. \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/12/solstice.html", "title": "Solstice"},

{"date": "January 20, 2007 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy and Mama Mama reading; December, 2006.   \n\n I don\u2019t know how to write in here anymore. I\u2019ve said that before, I know. It\u2019s all part of a growing sense of confusion or maybe it\u2019s a transition? A transition out of crisis mode which is where I was when I started this blog, and into something else. \n\n I\u2019m not in a crisis anymore. I don\u2019t feel that swirling panic or entrapment or fear. I don\u2019t have that unicycling in and around the red cones while juggling flaming balls feeling. I don\u2019t feel like my son is having a neurological equivalent of a heart attack while professionals blithely glide by, alternatingly offering dire predictions for his future, sure pronouncements about the static nature of his deficits, and flip assurances that he\u2019ll grow out of it. I don\u2019t worry, OVERLY, about his happiness or the possibility of his having a full and meaningful life. Not OVERLY. \n\n I have this map about how to provide for my son\u2019s needs. I have this space in my heart that knows what he needs, this mother space. I don\u2019t KNOW if it\u2019s absolutely right. I can\u2019t be inside my son\u2019s head; I can\u2019t know what he feels. All I have to go on is my ability to hear, see, and feel this mother space as I hear, see, and feel what is going on in front of me, day to day, with my son, what he says, what he does, how he looks.  \n\n Our day to day seems to be working. We have our ups and downs, days of dysregulation, patches of tall grass, but that is life, right? Things don\u2019t progress along smooth graph lines, steadily climbing up with smiley faces stuck here and there. Life is messy and unwieldy at times. But a large part of why things are working is because Fluffy is able to communicate so much to me. He can listen and answer. He can make his needs known. He can reason and imagine, project and remember, pretend and create.   \n\n When Fluffy was first diagnosed, I felt very alone. I didn\u2019t know anything about autism. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had an autistic child. The divide between my life and that of my friends grew wider as they sailed past in their mini vans on the way to playgroups and schools and grocery stores and weekends away with and without their children. I didn\u2019t relate to their lives and they didn\u2019t seem to relate to mine. They either blanched at the word Autism, or blinked in the face of it, looking at Fluffy who certainly didn\u2019t fit the stereotype they had in their minds of a \u2018lost and silent\u2019 child spinning plates in the corner, and back to me.  What\u2019s the problem? He looks fine to me! \n\n Once I started blogging, I found a community of mothers with children on the spectrum. I felt a kinship with them. I still do. But I also felt sideswiped by the wave of turmoil and debate that swirls in the autism community. Or rather, in the various spokes that emanate from that center word-- Autism.  \n\n I\u2019m not an expert on any of this. I\u2019m not an expert on what the mothers of autistic kids say or what the autistic teens say or what the autistic adults say or what the non-autistic professionals in the fields of education, psychology, neurology, developmental psychology, genetics, and autistic treatment and intervention say. I\u2019m not qualified to speak to a lot of what I see and read and hear. I\u2019m not even sure how much my voice matters in all of this, in my tiny corner of the blogosphere or anywhere apart from my own home and my own family where I\u2019m not the least bit shy about speaking my mind.  \n\n My son is on the spectrum. He has Aspergers. Some call it high functioning but I hate that crap, that functioning scale, and I don\u2019t use it. He has Aspergers. That\u2019s that. He has his own particular expression of it because he is a unique child, like all children; he is an individual. I say, each expression of Aspergers is unique; each expression of the spectrum is unique. Many seem to agree with that and yet they will say in the same breath that a child doesn\u2019t HAVE Aspergers--they ARE Aspergers. Oh? How can that be? If we assume all cases are unique, then how could a child BE the neurology? It doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\n So, my son is on the spectrum. I am raising a child on the spectrum. But just like a wise pediatrician once said about raising the typical child, not all parents have the same job. The same holds true on the spectrum. Even though all parents are doing their best to provide for their child in a way that holds the child\u2019s best interests at heart: Not all parents of ASD kids have the same job. \n\n So, I talk about raising Fluffy here, my Aspergers son. Am I perpetuating a stereotype? Since my son is eccentric, brilliant, and verbal? That all Asperger kids are this way? That all I have to do is guide him through the turbulent years of school, la la! and other odd and largely useless social conventions and soon he will step into the world and, like the many quirky and genius compatriots that came before him, make some brilliant but solitary contribution to the world like Einstein or Jung or Kandinsky or Mozart or Twain and on and on? \n\n Do I have anything to say or offer to those raising the nonverbal child on the spectrum? Do I understand what their day to day life is like? Am I qualified to urge them to try RDI or homeschooling or any other thing that we\u2019re doing? \n\n Do I have anything to say or offer to teens and adults on the spectrum? Do I understand what their day to day life is like? Am I qualified to urge them to see my interest in RDI and homeschooling is not about trying to make my son into a different person but about trying to allow for his growth and development? Does that have to be seen as an affront to them and what they do and don\u2019t do or like or feel or want? \n\n I like to think of myself as part of the neurodiversity camp. Everyone needs respect, understanding, acceptance. We all need to stretch as a society to widen our embrace, open our eyes, expand our minds. In order to do that, I contend, we have to face fears, whatever they may be. \n\n Kristina  said in the comment section of her blog,  Autism Vox , (and I paraphrase) she wished there was less time spent on trying to figure out what autism is and more time spent on how to educate our children. I say yes--more time spent on how to educate and support the children on the spectrum which means educating and supporting the adults interacting with those children. All of them. \n\n I keep thinking, this has to be, at its core, about fear. If there wasn\u2019t so much fear, there would be more curiosity, genuine interest in other points of views, ways of seeing, thinking, doing. Or maybe it\u2019s about a willingness to practice a kind of discipline in discussing differences. \n\n There are things I want for my son. There are things I would fight hard to protect him against experiencing. I\u2019ve been searching for a metaphor but it\u2019s tough. This morning I thought about sight. If my son\u2019s ability to see was threatened, I would do everything I could to keep him from becoming blind. Does this mean I don\u2019t respect blind people? Or believe their life is less than because they can\u2019t see? No. If he went blind, would I throw up my hands in despair, forever grieving his lost sight and longing for the chance to have a sighted son? No. But it is fair to say that not being able to see is something I don\u2019t wish on my son or anyone. Even though, CLEARLY, those who can\u2019t see deserve respect, understanding, acceptance, and adaptations in order to move through this world. Even though, CLEARLY, sightlessness is nothing to  recoil  from.   \n\n We don't expect our children to be born blind; we expect them to be born sighted. When they are born blind, they are born with a deficit, in the area of seeing, yes? This is a deficit even though they are not  defective . Those who are blind have as much of a chance at leading full, rich, meaningful lives as those who are sighted. There have been sightless individuals since the dawn of time. This sightlessness can be a result, among other things, of gestational quirk, disease, accident or medical intervention made possible through technological \u2018advancement\u2019 of our time.   \n\n When I hear someone say they are glad they\u2019re autistic, I think, they\u2019re saying they love and accept themselves. I love that. We should all be glad we are who we are. We should all love and accept ourselves. We are all deserving of that love and acceptance. But this is not an \u2018argument\u2019 against parents doing what they can to alleviate or eliminate the profound challenges a child\u2019s autism creates in their day to day life, in communicating needs, desires, feelings, in coping with sensory assaults, in leading independent lives where they may be able to make a contribution to the world that reflects who they are and what matters to them. \n\n I keep waiting for the day when the conversation is less threatening. Not waiting-- wanting . I  want  the conversation to be less threatening. It\u2019s like the writing. Let\u2019s approach the many threads of the autism discussion with an attitude of acceptance, as if it\u2019s already being blocked in for publication. Then we can put our defenses away and look at the individual expression to see where it works, where it doesn\u2019t and what it needs in order to for us to hear what each particular piece is trying to say.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kristinachew.com/", "http://autismvox.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/01/i_dont_know_how.html", "title": "Talking About Autism"},

Hmmm. I can't say I like the bitterness or disappointment. My life is so very good and yet I move through times of dissatisfaction that feel very uncomfortable. I don't want to be the dissatisfied woman. I want to be the zesty woman who has curiosity and optimism until the last breath puffs from my crinkly old lips.

It sounded SO OLD, it was almost laughable, like ladies who wore curlers to the drug store in broad daylight. Now when I see those ladies, I say,  right on , or,  what brand are those , or,  how would you compare the rollers to the curling iron? Now it\u2019s seven years past the year I once thought unfathomably distant and far off and I\u2019m truly baffled. How did that happen? Ah well. Even though I can\u2019t say I totally approve of 2007 or that I am feeling very zesty, I  am  feeling very  nesty . I want to whirl through the house, upending cabinets and flicking open drawers, clean out, give away, reorder, make room, spend the afternoon putting photos in albums, etc. etc., but it\u2019s not to be. At least not yet.  And so, my project for 2007 is simple: breathing. I resolve to breathe all the way in and all the way out. I read an article about how some believe that grief and inspiration are stored in the lungs, that a few sessions of deep, conscious breathing throughout the day can unearth both. I\u2019m for that.

{"date": "November 29, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t You could call it desert tall grass; February, 2006. \n\n \n\nI think we\u2019ll be at Stage 3 in RDI for quite some time. It\u2019s particularly challenging since one must learn to control impulses in order to coordinate with another person. If we are carrying this thing and I must AWAY! and dash ahead! the thing we are carrying will crash to the floor. If we are taking turns pouring bird seed into the container and I simply CAN\u2019T wait another instant, the bird seed will pile atop the other guy\u2019s hand and then scatter all over the living room rug.  \n\n More than impulse control, or lack of it, is the issue of Fluffy\u2019s mind. It is so active, so keen, so full of darting ideas and questions and curiosities and inventions, it gets in the way.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on coordinating actions in three basic ways: (1) doing the same thing at the same time, (2) doing the same thing in turns, and (3) completing a task where we have complementary but different roles. All this must be done in simple ways or Fluffy ges unsteady and in interesting ways or else he gets bored.  \n\n The other day Dave came to Fluffy\u2019s room as he was getting ready for bed. He brought one of those big yoga balls with the idea that having him roll on it back and forth may be a relaxing and regulatory thing to do and so he said, Hey, buddy. I have a game that might be fun for us to do. Fluffy took one look at that ball and said with a sigh,  What? We\u2019re going to roll that ball back and forth together until I get so bored I fall asleep? \n\n With Fluffy, not only do we need variety, we need to sort of  sneak  in the whole working on objectives thing. I call it going in the side door. If he gets one whiff that we are trying to DO anything, that we are after any particular result or engagement, he gets on edge. Now, RDI isn\u2019t about getting the child to DO anything; it\u2019s all about adopting a particular mindset that becomes a way of life. YET, it IS a program comprised of stages starting with one and going up to over thirty now, I think. AND the whole point is to help the child acquire mastery of each stage and then move on to the next. So, it\u2019s not entirely true to say one isn\u2019t trying to DO any particular thing with the child. These days, we ARE trying to teach Fluffy to coordinate with another person. And when I am going about my lifestyle activities with my wonderfully RDI-y mindset beautifully in place and I am in the playroom or in the hallway or in the market or in the playground and I initiated some interaction that is about being with my son but also working on doing something  together  and he gets a whiff of it, his tiny soldiers are wide awake at all posts. I can see it happening--ffrrrrooooooom.  \n\n It\u2019s probably about his level of regulation at that moment mixed with the way I present things. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s better for me to just start something, just roll the ball to him, rather than to sit down with the ball and say, I have a game! It\u2019s better for me to look at him, look at the curb and make an excited face and then we jump together rather than to say let\u2019s jump! It\u2019s better for me to look at the dishwasher and say, huh, this is so full then to say, let\u2019s unload the dishwasher together! It\u2019s better for me to say, wow, this is so heavy because nine times out of ten, he\u2019ll drop what he\u2019s doing and call out, oh mommy! I\u2019ll help you with that! \n\n I was thinking the other day that Fluffy\u2019s having Aspergers has given the whole family an opportunity to look more closely at that which is unsteady in each of us, to call that up and transform it. Looking at where Fluffy lacks competence requires a closer look at our own feelings of incompetence. Doing that, talking about that, struggling with that is the thing I find most interesting in life.

{"date": "December 13, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Family portrait; December, 2006. Taken by Mama Mama. \n\n I\u2019m trying to stay out of my husband\u2019s parenting and it\u2019s hard. Not because he\u2019s a bad parent. He\u2019s a wonderful parent, a funny, devoted--wait a sec-- HONEY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU GIVING HIM THAT NOW? I SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR LATER. YES. I DID. YOU WHAT? UH. NO. LATER.  Sorry--anyway, I think he is a gentle, loving, responsible dad. I think it has a little to do with my controlling nature and my--wait-- HONEY? I TOLD HIM YES ON THAT. YES I DID. DON\u2019T YOU REMEMBER? WHAT? NO, FLUFFY, DADDY MADE A MISTAKE. YES. MOMMY SAYS YES, YOU CAN. THAT\u2019S RIGHT. GO AHEAD ,  SWEETHEART.  Okay, anyway! Sorry! It has to do with my hyper-alert stance as Fluffy\u2019s mother, protector, playmate, activity planner, night calmer, day player, autism remediator, and all around knower of what\u2019s going on in his life and keeper of the family collective memory since his birth.  \n\n Dave listens to my thoughts and ideas and theories and plans and gives most of them the big thumbs up. He\u2019s totally on board with the RDI. He does his own RDI activities with Fluffy. He came to the RDI 4-day conference, participates in every phone conference with our consultant, and reviews and edits the video tape with me twice a week. \n\n It wasn\u2019t always like this. I mean, he was always on board with the RDI sort of like the big man is on board with what\u2019s going on in the mail room. Just send him bulletins every so often and he can dash his initials next to the date and send you out with a hearty slap on the back. Not quite. But sort of. I had to keep calling the meeting and renegotiating the terms. We had plenty of discussions that went sort of like this: \n\n Me: Well, tell me. Did you do ANY RDI with our son today? Did you? \n\n Him: Whha--? \n\n Me: Hey, buddy, you gotta get your fucking butt in gear and help remediate the autism. I NEED your help. \n\n Him: Whha--? \n\n Me: We have to do this every day. EVERY DAY. We have to be willing to make the necessary changes. I am. ARE YOU? \n\n Him: Whha--? \n\n I think it\u2019s safe to say that while I consider myself a loving, enthusiastic, supportive, open and respectful person, I can be an incredible bitch to my husband. And while he is a fun-loving, thoughtful, and integrity-filled humanitarian, he can be an incredibly spaced out self-centered slug. And I mean that in the best possible sense. \n\n The good news is that he won\u2019t be shocked by reading this. We tell each other everything. Every night. It\u2019s very liberating, even though Dave often stands in my office door after Fluffy's' in bed and says things like,  What god awful thing are we telling each other tonight?  It\u2019s liberating to be able to talk as frankly to your spouse as you would  about  him to your girlfriend. It takes the sting out of it. Eventually. It takes the weight out of it. Immediately. There are no secrets. It\u2019s all on the table. And you know what the crazy thing is? It makes us closer, softer, and easier with each other. The most alarming thing at first is not revealing my inner most thoughts and concerns, it\u2019s hearing he has the same complaints about me.  That's  shocking. But true. And truly human. \n\n So, I\u2019m learning how to butt out when I'm on or near the premises. When I'm out and about, I'm in the zone. I'm out; I'm fine. They're home; they're fine. Everybody's is fine. Fine fine fine! What's hard is when I am home and off the clock.  \n\n I'm learning. It\u2019s good. And it\u2019s hard. I ask and ask and ask for the help and when it comes, I can\u2019t get my sticky little fingers out of the game. It\u2019s horrible, really. It\u2019s quite something to see up close. And it has nothing to do with my HEAD. My head knows Dave is a star; He and Fluffy have their own relationship; I thank GOD for that relationship; I need the break; I love the break. It's not  about  the head. It\u2019s about that other thing that runs the show so much of the time.  \n\n There is something frightening about truly letting go. I want it. I\u2019m afraid of it. I need it. I don\u2019t know how to do it. \n\n But I\u2019m giving it my best shot. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/12/butting_out.html", "title": "Butting Out"},

{"date": "December 04, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t  \n\n This morning; first snowfall. \n\n We went to the zoo last weekend and for the first time ever, Fluffy was\ninterested in more than the french fries. He looked at where the animals were from, whether or not they were endangered, but most important, he took the animals in, remarked on what they were doing and laughed.  Along one loop, there was a section marked off with lines on the ground indicating how far different animals can jump. The lowly flea can jump FOUR FEET; the rabbit, six. The snow leopard, an impressive Thirty two! A bunch of kids were crowded in the space, testing out their jumping chops, announcing as they landed, \u201cI\u2019m a flea!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a rabbit!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a bear!\u201d Fluffy got right in there with them, navigating the swarming bodies, clearly enjoying the tussle.  His jump landed him between the flea and the rabbit and he said, excitedly, \u201cI\u2019m a fleabit!\u201d No one answered. He ran back to the starting line and did it again, landing about in the same place. He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a fleabit!\u201d he said again, this time to the little girl beside him. She didn\u2019t hear. He touched her, then held onto her arm. \u201cI\u2019m a fleabit!\u201d he said again, smiling. She yelled, \u2018Cut it out! Stop doing that!\u201d and yanked her arm away. She didn\u2019t know what he was talking about; she didn\u2019t get it. Part of me wanted to grab her by the other arm and say, ANSWER HIM! Another part of me knew it was a  tiny  moment, a nanomoment in the wild swirl of kid interactions. Not everyone hears you. Not everyone gets what you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s all part of the process called socializing. The thing is, I have no experience with this. It\u2019s nearly six years into this journey of parenting and I\u2019ve had only fleeting moments of being around my son as he is around other kids. I\u2019m clueless! In this new world where my son wants to play but isn\u2019t yet sure how, where my son is testing the waters, figuring it out, failing and succeeding, in other words, learning, I am a bit lost. In the old world, where my son ignored kids completely or pushed them out of the blue with little regard to whether they were on firm ground or perilously close to the edge of the high slide, I was quite sure what to do. But in this new, rather exciting world, I\u2019m a flutter.  We went to the second meeting of our new homeschoolers co-op and Fluffy spent most of the time hooking the other boys into half-nelsons and yanking them to the floor. He was very pediatric professional wrestling about it all. The other boys were good sports, cordially declaring,  I want to get up now , as Fluffy sat on top of them. To be fair, most of them kept coming back for more. There was something important going on. And even though I spent most of the time casting \u201cIs that okay? Shall I intervene now? No? How about  now? \u201d looks at my wonderful and wise friend,  Harvest Mom , it was all a million times preferable to Fluffy being down the hall playing by himself or singing songs of killing the kids.  What a wonderful new set of problems to navigate. I trust Fluffy and I will figure it out as we go along.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jacobs-journey.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/12/wonderful_probl.html", "title": "Wonderful Problems"},

{"date": "December 06, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t During this season when many of us are out roaming the malls looking for the perfect gift, consider  Reiki . It's truly the gift that keeps on giving.  \n\n I\u2019ve got a little problem with anxiety. Have I mentioned? The flashes of tragic and grotesque events that come out of nowhere and grab me by the throat. These images that make me shake my head in a spasm, casting them out--be gone, gruesome image! \n\n You know what\u2019s helping? Aside from the  5HTP  and the  Imago Couple\u2019s work  and  Cod Liver Oil  and exercise which is sadly, too sporadic to offer much stress relief. I mean, I don\u2019t care  what  they say, exercising three or four times a year doesn\u2019t quite do it.  \n\n What\u2019s helping is the Reiki. \n\n I went to the level 2 training over the weekend and, wow, it was like shifting from first into second gear. First gear is good. It's gets you going. But you know that sound? That revving grinding building tension sound and vibration that happens when you accelerate and forget to shift up? And the way it feels when you DO remember and get into second? I got that feeling, that relief, during the workshop. We all got attuned to level 2, learned three of the sacred symbols, sent and received Reiki, and held crystal pendulums as they swayed and circled over our chakras. Ooh la la!   \n\n Okay. I know I\u2019ve lost a bunch of you already. You're rolling your eyes or about to click to a hipper blog, but please! Take this with you before you go: get a Reiki treatment! Have a Reiki Master attune your child! Or your husband or wife or boss! It\u2019s fast and inexpensive. About a month ago, our local Reiki Master (doesn't everyone have one?) attuned Fluffy in 20 minutes for $35.00. Truthfully, the time spent on the actual attunement was more like five minutes but she graciously allowed Fluffy the time he needed to ask his many questions, scale the treatment table, slide along the top, hang over the edge, leap off, and slither on an around the metal folding chair like a giant snake.   \n\n Fluffy gives himself Reiki all the time. At least once a day. He give is to me, Dave, Beegu the goat dog. He sends it to various family members who live elsewhere. As we were leaving his weekly OT session, he ran back up the stairs to give Miss. S. a dose on her tummy. In the parking lot, he stopped and reached his hands out to a woman neither of us has ever seen before.  WHAT ARE WE DOING?  the woman asked, reaching out her hands too, all game, big smile on her face.  \n\n Sending Reiki, Fluffy said.  \n\n OH! SENDING RADAR?  she answered, apparently thrilled to the core at the idea.  \n\n No.  Reiki.  Fluffy said.  \n\n Hell, okay!  she said.  I\u2019ll send Raafey!   \n\n No. You can\u2019t. Fluffy said. You haven\u2019t been attuned.  \n\n I aint\u2019 WHAT?  she asked.  \n\n I stepped in to say, He\u2019s learned how to give a kind of energy, a healing energy.  \n\n Oh, baby! HEALING!  she said as she let out a loud sigh.  I  need  healing!   \n\n She closed her eyes. Fluffy leaned toward her, his arms still outstretched, his eyes closed in concentration. His hands landed on her solar plexus. I got a little worried he would creep his hands higher and clasp each enormous breast,  brrf\u00a0 brrf , and then waddle around in a deep knee bend all Harpo while honking his horn, but he kept them in place. The two of them stayed that way for a good 15 seconds and then Fluffy was on his way.  Thank you!  she called to him. Your welcome! Fluffy answered without looking back. \n\n Shall I be concerned that my son is handling strangers in the parking lot? Leaning into them to deliver healing energy? I wondered about it. We talked about not touching people unless they say it\u2019s okay (and I\u2019m there to supervise the touching!) but you know, what  would  happen if we ALL got attuned and stopped every stranger we saw to give them healing energy? I tell you what. Bush would be out on his ass, for one. Hmm. Maybe not. Okay, maybe. If he got round the clock Reiki, and I mean  ROUND THE CLOCK. \n\n I\u2019ve started  brushing  Fluffy every 2 hours or so. I\u2019m giving him Reiki each time. It\u2019s not just for him. In order for me to send it, I need to be still. I need to breath deeply. I need to open myself up and allow the energy to move through me. I need to believe that\u2019s possible. I need to let go. I need to trust. I need to find my intention.  \n\n It\u2019s a kind of meditation. A meditation in mindfulness. \n\n I see how it slows Fluffy down.  He  needs to be still.  He  needs to breath deeply.  He  needs to focus and let go. He already believes. He already trusts.\u00a0  \n\n It's enormously regulating and self-soothing. For both of us.   \n\n I love the Reiki. I\u2019m going for third gear. And then fourth. After that, I may shift into Master mode and take off down the energy highway at top speed. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://reikiinstitute.org/tri/indextri.html", "http://www.5htp.com/", "http://gettingtheloveyouwant.com/", "http://www.vitacost.com/Carlson-Norwegian-Cod-Liver-Oil-High-In-EPA-DHA", "http://www.pbbkids.com/the_wilbarger_brushing_protocol.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/12/driving_the_rei.html", "title": "Driving the Reiki car"},
{"date": "December 01, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Banner day at the Y!  \n\n We go\nto the open gym before swimming on Thursdays. There are usually a few other kids\nthere, ages two to fourish. The parents of the under three set stay but all the others take advantage of the friendly and free YMCA employees and hightail it to the workout room to return hours later red faced and visibly relieved. I stay with Fluffy.  \n\n Lately, I've been on\nthe sidelines as he bounces in the giant bouncy castle, climbs on the equipment, rolls the giant olive shaped thingy around. He's shown greater and greater interest in the other kids and briefly interacted here and there but mostly being with the group and not getting overwhelmed defines his progress. And progress it is. There was a time not too long ago when he would have opened the door, seen the kids, and turned the other way. \n\n But today! He and\nanother boy were COORDINATING ACTIONS! Woooohooo!!  \n\n Fluffy was rolling a big basketball around. Another boy played with a basketball that Fluffy wanted. But you have one, honey.  He's  playing with that one.  But his has a white part and mine doesn't.  Hey, guys! called the Y guy from a tangle of toddlers on the colorful foam climbers, Why not share it? Come on, roll it to each other! And then they did.  \n\n Now, one of the games we play at home is rolling balls back and forth. Thanks to fellow RDI mom,  Bea , and her wonderful suggestions, I've taken to rolling everything I can get my hands on to mix it up and keep Fluffy on his toes: oranges, muffins, tin cans, paper towel rolls, toilet paper, garlic heads,\u00a0 cherry tomatoes, soda bottles, nuts, lids, balloons (they don't roll!). We roll fast, slow, medium, sideways, spin them, try to bounce them, and even throw them, if appropriate (no flying cans allowed!). Sometimes we use two big yoga balls, each rolling to the other at the same time. They're huge. You really have to adjust your position after you've sent yours to the other guy or they crash in the middle.  \n\n Back to the Y: Fluffy rolled the basketball to the boy; the boy rolled it back. Fluffy rolled it back to him again. The boy returned it. They rolled it slow\nand fast and medium. They switched positions and rolled some more. Fluffy jumped up and dashed away and I thought, wow! That was fantastic! I guess he needs to regulate on his own some now. But no. He got the other basketball and ran back to the boy who sat, still holding the coveted white basketball. He sat across from him and the boy rolled his basketball to Fluffy as Fluffy rolled his new basketball to the boy, at the same time! They double ball rolled\nback and forth ALL OVER THE GYM, shifting their positions to be in line with each other, chasing the runaways, returning, adjusting positions and rolling again. They both laughed and giggled as\nthey missed or as the balls crashed midway between them. \n\n They both laughed and giggled as they played together.   \n\n I had been chatting with a mom I'd never met named Kendra (my sister's name) whose daughter Kyra (ahem) tumbled on the mats in front of us but I was watching the whole time, riveted. It was so thrilling, I almost cried! I wanted to whip out the cell phone right there and call Dave, GET DOWN HERE WITH THE VIDEO CAMERA, PRONTO! Instead, I turned to the woman and gushed,  I have to say, my son is playing so incredibly well with that boy! I am so proud of him!  The woman, who knew nothing of this milestone, smiled politely, a bit confused. \n\n What do you know? Just when I adjust to being in Stage 3 for ages, dear Fluffy\ngoes and  generalizes  beautifully with a peer! \n\n Rah Rah RDI! \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://dessimiracles.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/12/roll_that_ball.html", "title": "Roll That Ball!"},

Bummer. \n\n We\u2019re hoping for the best. We\u2019ve grown quite attached to her, with her shaggy rasta-fur and her vacuum cleaner snout. During the day, she sits upright on the porch chair and watches the neighborhood go by. When she comes inside, she goes directly to the trash, hoping to score tissue or a sanitary napkin. Seriously, what is going on in our house with the sanitary supplies? I half expect to find a stash of them in Dave\u2019s sock drawer as this would complete the sanitary insanity, or insanitary in the household.  \n\n Ever since I was little, I imagined when none of us were home, our pets would sit cross-legged on the couch, talk on the phone, have a bowl of cereal or something. In Beegu\u2019s case, I have to wonder what she\u2019d whip up. This is a dog that eats socks, paper, cardboard, rugs, molding, metal cars, poo poo, and FIVE GIANT LIGHT BULBS dangling from an electric cord. What was she thinking? After the first one? Uh, ouch. Blue no good. Red? Ouch. Um. White? Ouch. Green? Yup! Green yummy! Me want more green! And then she scarfed up the cotton balls and an entire loaf of bread and stood around looking at us, licking her lips, like, Yum! What next? Brillo soaked in tomato juice? Dessert forks tossed with olive oil?  \n\n Beegu. She\u2019s our goat dog and we love her. Pray for the goat dog. \n\n Paragraphs (Monica's friend Penn hired her to be his personal assistant. She's been running all over the city, doing his errands. The night before, a pipe broke in the apartment above her; the flooding was so severe, a chunk of her ceiling collapsed in her apartment.)   \u00a0 \u00a0It was good Penn needed me that morning. The workers were there to fix the ceiling. It was impossible for more than two people to be in that tiny apartment at the same time. \u00a0 \u00a0 I couldn\u2019t quite see what I was doing. My eyes were killing me, my contact lens felt like they were glued to my cornea, blinding me with some incurable infectious disease. I obsessed about how to get to a big mac, a slab of greasy cheesy pizza, chocolate chip cookies. I drank almost no water and sucked down a BLT while navigating midtown on the bike carting Penn\u2019s portfolio on drop-offs. The guy at the studio was unusually cool to me and I took it personally.\u00a0 My bicycle chain came off on the ride home and I swerved out of control. The portfolio pivoted in front of my face. I squeezed the breaks with my only free hand and flipped myself over the handlebars, sending Penn\u2019s images to skitter like low flying frisbees, swarthy leading man, quirky next door neighbor, sensitive older brother, angry gang member, swish swish swish, under taxies, climbing up the base of street signs, slipping through the gutter grates. \u00a0 \u00a0 At home, I crawled on the futon and stared out of my hot and oozing eyes. I saw shapes and colors. I heard sounds no more acutely than before but with a detachment that was disorienting. I let the muscles around my eyes go loose and my vision, already smeared like windows streaked with bacon grease, collapsed into an upwards extended funnel. I felt I was reaching back through that space, reaching through like a birthing but in reverse; an unbirthing.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_24.html", "title": "PPP Day 24 - Pray For The Goat Dog"},

It goes up up up to the fourth floor and stops at the front window, quivering a bit to and fro and then a body is seen, a head and arms reaching up, flashes of white silk and pink organdy and a face smeared with white clay shines with a grin too wide. He slides down the ladder, his six foot frame in the arms of the fireman, as if he were a toddler or a royal waif needing a quick flight over stray puddles of mud.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The firemen begin to bring everyone down, drag queens in kimonos and face masks, hair curlers, older czechs in sweater vests with stirring spoons still in their hands, dripping with the blood red of borscht soup they were making when interrupted and swept away. They fan their faces and fall into the embrace of the big butch firemen, getting extra attention and support on the street, stumbling back, both frightened and pleased. I watch, mesmerized.  \u00a0 \u00a0 I see Toby bending to talk to someone sitting in the middle of the street. There is no car traffic. The street is entirely clogged with the three fire trucks and the throngs of people and now another sound, another approaching emergency vehicle and it stops on the sidewalk. An EMS team in a white van. Swiftly, two workers clad in white uniforms and white clogs bound out and with them a stretcher that instantly hops to table height. They propel it to where Toby is standing and I see they are loading someone into it, someone small, someone lying on the ground and then they are back to the open mouth of the vehicle and the stretcher\u2019s legs fold beneath it as it slips out of sight. As they close the doors, I see Toby jog over with a walking stick outstretched.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_25_the_.html", "title": "PPP Day 25 - The Goat Dog Lives!"},

Post \n\n Dave and I are in the process of selecting tile for the backsplash in the kitchen that was remodeled  two years ago . We are such go-getters. We went to the store yesterday and brought Fluffy along.  \n\n He didn\u2019t want to come along. He wanted more time to play with his  theraputty  but the tile guy is slated to come next week and we need to give him something to slap on that bare wall over the spaghetti sauce and garlic and olive oil splatterings, so, come he did, with his theraputty and the lap board he uses as his landing pad.  \n\n The store is small. There was no one else there. It was the perfect arrangement. He happily played; Dave and I read the giant story book of tile until we made our selections and then he went back to work. \n\n I was at the counter, jotting down quantities, prices, etc., and Fluffy was still on the floor, engrossed in his play. It was all a bit out of character. But I was thankful the errand went as smoothly as it did. The owner of the store was elated, a well behaved five year old! \u201cHe\u2019s doing good, huh? He\u2019s busy, right?\u201d and I smiled.  \n\n Then it was time to go. I helped Fluffy pack up his theraputty. The woman who has been helping us started talking to him, Hi, How are you ? How old are you? Great hat! Where do you go to school? Do you go here or there or this other place? What grade are you in? Fluffy stared at her and then looked at me. I said, he goes to school at home. Oh! Homeschooled, she said.  I also go to a school to visit and play in a special playroom,  Fluffy offered. Huh, she said, and maybe she stared for a while? I don\u2019t know, but I think I felt her seeing us,  seeing differently . I turned back to the counter to grab a business card and while my back was to her and Fluffy was by my side, waiting for us to leave, she boomed, IS YOUR SON AUTISTIC, BY ANY CHANCE?  \n\n I froze. I turned around to see what Fluffy was doing and made a quiet,  we don\u2019t say anything in front of him but the answer to your question is yes  sort of face and gesture. It turns out, her son is autistic. Six years old, They\u2019re from California where services rain down like sun beams. This state is archaic, she said. It took forever to get her son ABA. He didn\u2019t speak until at all until they started. Now he\u2019s speaking in 5 word sentences. He\u2019s doing great, she said. \n\n Now, there is nothing I love talking about more than autism and my son. Those are top on my list. There is nothing I\u2019d love more than meeting another mom of an ASD child, especially in my area. But we don\u2019t talk about Fluffy's autism in front of him. He hears everything. Everything. He asks about everything. Dave and I can be in the kitchen and Dave will say to me, oh, I didn't know that was there. And Fluffy will call out from down the hall in his room, WHAT? WHAT WAS THERE, DADDY? WHAT ARE YOU TWO TALKING ABOUT?  \n\n Her asking was fine, innocent, even refreshing in how out there she was, almost like she wanted to know if I had change of a dollar, by any chance? She had no discomfort about her son's autism and neither do I. It's just that since Fluffy is so very alert and tuned in, when it comes to telling him about his Aspergers, we want to be mindful of what we say, how we say it, and when we say it. \n\n Dave and I have already discussed the  what  and the  how  of that conversation.\u00a0 I think it's clear, the  when  is upon us. \n\n Paragraphs \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Cecil snuck out of the apartment at every opportunity. He never ventured outside, even when the heat was pumping aggressively from the radiator and I opened the gates and windows, He would sit on the window sill and stare at the dank cement courtyard, at the one tree there, at the pigeons who fluttered in its bare branches. He never jumped down although it was only a short drop to the basement apartment below. No. He snuck out to slink through the halls and\u00a0 snaked his way up the stairs to his friend, the old guy with the long black coat. \n\n \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 His name was Uljana Oleynik, from Latvia, the former soviet Union. Actually, from Riga, on the coast of the Gulf of Riga, near the Baltic Sea. I got all this from Toby, the hairdresser poet in the front apartment. He was the unofficial den mother of the building; he knew everyone in every apartment, kept a watchful eye from his street side windows and corridor peep hole. He also did all the wigs for the drag queens in the building and there were quite a few. He told me about the guys in the apartment below me, the brothers who owned a recording studio. I was surprised, since the only sound I heard was the blasting TV from Meredith next door.

{"date": "November 27, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n The Fluffmeister; Spring 2006. \n\n Remember when the mostly nice saleswoman in the tile store bellowed, IS YOUR SON AUTISTIC BY ANY CHANCE? and I froze since my son was standing by my side and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable launching into a candid conversation because we don\u2019t talk about all that in front of him? A lovely commenter wondered if maybe not discussing Fluffy\u2019s autism in front of him may be sending him the wrong message, ie, that we think his autism is something to keep secret, that it is not okay. I wrote this in response: \n\n to be clear, we do talk about autism in front of fluffy all the time. it's a big subject with us so he hears it a lot. i have an autism awareness bumper sticker, pin, and books all over the house related to autism by autistic people and NTs. there are some conversations about autism that include disturbing things (like parents killing their kids which we certainly wouldn't say in front of him!) or confusing or very complicated things that i wouldn't say in front of fluffy since it's not age appropriate. most of our talk about fluffy's autism is centered around remediation through our RDI program, again, not appropriate for him since it breaks down lifestyle activities and games into the stages and objectives we are spotlighting and that would be just weird!   \n\n the conversation we need to have with fluffy is about HIS autism. i am not worried about what he'll think of this since dave and i have no shame about his diagnosis and i think he'll feel that, feel our love and acceptance. plus, we've had LOTS of conversation with him about what autism is, how everyone is different, how everyone learns at different paces, how everyone has things they are good at and things that are challenging. it hasn't been time for us to tell him about his aspergers yet. there hasn't been a reason to--up until recently. now it feels like the right time. once we have that talk, we will most likely continue to handle discussions of autism the same way, unless of course, he asks about it and then we'll openly talk to him about any of his questions or concerns or thoughts. knowing fluffy there will be LOTS of questions and thoughts expressed! then we don't have to worry about what anyone says in front of him. that was my concern. i didn't want discussions about HIS autism going on in front of him until we told him about his aspergers. i didn\u2019t want him to hear it that way first. What, mom? What do I have? What are you talking about?   \n\n Well, we had the conversation. It was a very short, very simple affair. Fluffy and I wore pjs. Dave wore his cartooning uniform: baggy jeans and a short sleeved pocket t. It went something like this: \n\n Me: You know how we say that everyone is both the same and different? That everyone has feelings and hearts and spirits and dreams? But that some people are lightening fast and some people can\u2019t even use their legs; some people are tall tall tall and some people are small-- \n\n Fluffy: Yeah, like that man we saw who has very short legs but a regular rest of his body. \n\n Me: Yes. Like him. And some people can\u2019t see and some people can hear almost like a super hero. Well, there are some people who have a special kind of brain that works in a special way and sees and understands the world in a certain way. You have that kind of brain and it has a name. It\u2019s called Aspergers. Have you ever heard that word before? Aspergers? \n\n Fluffy: No. \n\n Me: Well, there are a lot of people who have that special kind of brain. Kids and grownups. \n\n Fluffy: Will I always have that? Even when I grow up? \n\n Me: You\u2019ll always have that special kind of brain but the brain keeps growing and learning so some of the things you like to do will be things you\u2019ll learn more about and some of the things that are hard or confusing will become easier. \n\n Fluffy: Oh. \n\n And then he and Dave took Beegu the Goat Dog on the morning walk to the beach where blobs of brown cotton balls and brown bread chunks were deposited in the sand. Wow. That took 5 days. Is this normal? I mean, for those dogs who  typically  eat glass and then cotton balls and then loaves of bread on Thanksgiving eve? \n\n Fluffy took it in stride. I know there will be more conversations and lots of questions and that is good. I look forward to where ever this leads us. That brain. That beautiful brain. I tell you, I have so much respect for that boy\u2019s brain and heart and spirit and every carbon containing atom that is holding the whole thing together.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/day_27_the_conv.html", "title": "Day 27 - The Conversation"},

Every year, I end up putting half of Fluffy\u2019s gifts back in the closet until his birthday in February. It\u2019s too overwhelming. Frankly, his favorite gift is the one chocolate santa in the bottom of his Christmas stocking. The boy loves his candy.  \n\n This year, we\u2019ll celebrate solstice for the first time. I plan to put candles all over the house and use no other lights that night. We\u2019ll see how that goes! I\u2019m also planning to pull the table to the living room so we can eat dinner by the fireplace. We\u2019ll sing special songs, go for a lantern walk and maybe even make little figurines, the original mother and child--Earth Mother and the Sun Child, to put in a Sacred Cave that we\u2019ll build from found stones and sticks in the yard.  \n\n I was telling Fluffy about the ancient celebrations on Solstice Eve, about the lighting of fires and the wild all night dancing and singing. I was telling him about how grateful the people were that the sun returned and the days starting getting longer after that night. He said,  how did they know then? On the first night? How did they know the days would start getting longer until time had passed and they could see it? How would they know to celebrate on that first night?  I love the way he thinks. \n\n On family project day, we made lanterns for evening lantern walks. We followed the project directions from  Family Fun  magazine  here  and  here .

Worried instructor = worried mother. Ah well. We\u2019ll have to wait another week for another opening day. \n\n Fall is the time of letting go, of release. Winter is a time of \"motionless grace\", a time of embracing what is bare and true and underlying. Here's to the underlying shape of things in your life.

{"date": "November 22, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Day 22 of a picture, a post, and some paragraphs from NaNoWriMo 2006. Eight days to go...   \n\n \n\n Dog and duck at the horse farm; Yesterday. Taken by Dave. Yesterday was opening day.  Let me explain. Fluffy loves to save things. I turned one of his bedside shelf sections into a cubby and he filled it up with so many things, it was like an I Love Lucy episode everytime he tried to extract one of the items for examination. So, I cleared out an entire shelving unit and that became his new cubby. He exalted! He sashayed through the house! He told everyone we met! In the cubby was a Snap Rover, a panty hose foot taken from shoe store supply for barefoot shoppers, magic tricks from Grandad, a zip lock baggy with the contents of his broken airplane bank, and a host of unopened items that were not to be touched or unwrapped by anyone other than him under any circumstances: 3D glitter glue pens, twistable markers, stretchy guys purported to fly TWENTY FEET, a small bar of scallop shell soap, popcorn crystals rocks from the science museum, wicky sticks, a foam rocket shooter, mini balsa wood gliders (2) , maxi balsa wood gliders (3), and an assortment of feminine hygiene products: tampons, super and regular, panty liners, with and without wings. (These have long been some of Fluffy\u2019s favorite toys. Ever since a particularly tough negotiation, he is allowed to take one from my stash everyday. Thankfully, he forgets to collect them most days but he has amassed quite a mountain. Some parents steal halloween candy from their kids; I steal sanitary supplies.) Sanitary products aside, Dave and I have gently encouraged Fluffy to open these items so we could all play with them. A few of them were gifts but most were purchased for projects, you know, for us to open and use. But no.  What if the store that made the stretchy guys ran out and didn\u2019t order more? What if we couldn\u2019t find the 3D glitter glue pens again? What if the gliders got opened, built and then damaged during flight?  No. It was better to HAVE them. Wrapped. In the cubby. Safe and sound. For another day. Not this day. Then, yesterday, we went to a horse farm and Fluffy rode a horse. The OT who led him through the fields and into ring was brilliant. The farm was beautiful. The horse was magnificent. There were animals every where--Marmaduke-size dogs cavorting with smaller dogs and more horses and friendly waddling ducks. Fluffy took to it instantly. He beamed on the horse. He beamed off the horse. He beamed all the way home. He was full of such confidence, as soon as he walked in the door, he went straight to his cubby and began to open things. \n\n \n\nIt was remarkable. Packaging was strewn about his room, down the hall, on the living room rug, at the kitchen table, like bread crumbs in the forest only he didn\u2019t need to get back to anywhere because he was home. In his own skin. He opened them all, I tell you. And not in a frenzy. It was as if each opened package opened something in him and the opening longed for greater opening. He made glitter glue maps and marker drawings; he made a hot air balloon from the sticky sticks; we covered the popcorn rocks in white vinegar and set them in the science corner; we flew gliders, we regarded the shell shaped soap; we shot foam rockets; we shot off stretchy guys that actually soared MORE than twenty feet.  Opening day. We\u2019re going back to the horse farm next Tuesday. I can\u2019t wait to see the wrappers.  Paragraphs (Monica's depressed. She's spent the last 2 months eating cereal in the dark, sleeping, spending money indiscriminately, hiding unopened mail under her bed, and hanging out with her actor friend, Penn.

Her hair was tall, white, full of curls and what seemed like glistening stars. The lights grew dim around us; only she was bathed in glory. \u00a0 \u00a0 She led us in a guided meditation. We breathed in our peace and out our tension. We let go of the everyday and allowed for the singular, the divine. We dropped down down to the flowing river below, below our breath, below our heartbeat, below our marrow, below, to a place that was our beginning, was the  beginning of all that is now and was ever and will ever be. We came to that sacred place of no name and saw a small spark that grew and grew and grew so large is filled the air with a bright warm healing light. We saw ourselves step into that light and be bathed, cleansed, purified, reborn. We were deeply at peace.

And IT WAS! \n\n There is too much to report in the thirty seconds I have allotted to internet activity for the day. But know this: Fluffy is a whiz with a map. We had to wait on a looooooong line when we first arrived, like cattle shuffling to the feed station, moooooo, through the loop de loop roped off section. It's not exactly Fluffy's strong suit so after swinging on the metal bars and trying his hand at limbo I scurried off with him, leaving Dave to the big decisions like,  to be or not to be a member  and the delicate Butterfly Pavilion vs. Imax's ADRENALINE RUSH vs. the grotesque yet fascinating fillet of Human Body. We needed a bathroom, for one. Fluffy located maps for each of us and in ZERO seconds figured out where we were and how to get to the bathrooms where he brought me, map in hand, focus on his face. My Fluffy.   \n\n He held that map the entire day except for when he needed his hands for exhibits like the computer that recorded us making different expressions like this: \n\n Mad. \n\n and this: \n\n \n\n Scared. \n\n and this: Happy. \n\n while Dave chatted with a new friend: \n\n \n\n A day to remember.  \n\n And now on to 3,000 words for NaNoWriMo. Very behind. Very. Behind. I have no new words for you yet, so here are some from yesterday. \n\n xx \n\n Paragraphs \n\n (Monica is back upstate in the rented house that she and Marty used to share.) \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 I made my way to the bookcase on my hands and knees, crying. \u201cWhat happened to the 'Til' Death Do Us Part?\u201d I yelled. I sat up and began flinging books from the shelves in all directions, punctuating each toss with a shout, \u201cFucking Liar!\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 I must have left the front door open because I looked up and saw Stewart standing there, holding flashlight. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOh!  Stewart!  Come in! Do you want some coffee?\" I jumped up. \"I was just going through these books--maybe you\u2019d want some of them?\u201d  \u00a0 \u00a0 Stewart shook his head, a quick no. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cCome in! Come see what I\u2019m doing.\u201d I said and led him over to the table where my magnetic poetry was set up, wiping my nose on the back of my hand.\u00a0 \u201cMarty won\u2019t take my calls anymore, so I\u2019ve been writing these poems. It\u2019s sort of an  oracle . I close my eyes and concentrate on a question and then I select from the basket, here, and place them down there, without looking until I\u2019m done, and then I arrange it in the way it wants to be arranged, you know,  feeling  it out, and then I write them down on these index cards. Sometimes it\u2019s just a line, like this one,\u201d I quickly reached into my back pockets and many folded index cards fell to the floor. I picked one up and unfolded it. \u201c\u2019Shake About Mean Beneath The Bitterly Shine\u2019.\" I paused to look at him. \"\"I had it with me today, you know, to let it out, get the anger out.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 Stewart was watching me, watching my mouth move but I wasn\u2019t sure he was totally getting the implications, the full power of what I was telling him. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGo ahead.\u201d I said, enthusiastically, as if he were stopping by for a cup of sugar and not investigating nearby screaming in the middle of the night. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMonica? Are you okay?\u201d he said, looking worried, wiping his hand around his whole face. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat? Yes! Yes! I\u2019m fine! Listen, just try it. Think of something, some question or thing that you\u2019re wondering about, that you want to know, and then reach in.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI was actually wondering about whether or not you\u2019re staying past the new year--\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOkay, sure! Ask that!\u201d I said and eagerly stood by, flattening out my hair and wiping again at my nose, realized I needed a tissue or something. I looked around for my roll of paper towels, tore off a sheet, blew my nose into it and wiped my hands vigorously. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want anything? I just made this coffee. It\u2019s fresh?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAh, no. I don\u2019t normally drink coffee after 2 in the morning.\u201d  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_12.html", "title": "PPP Day 12 - the whole day"},
{"date": "November 16, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture \n\n Fluffy hiding in the couch pillows; April, 2006.  \n\n Post \n\n Some say the Indigo Children have come to take over the earth. Some say Fluffy is an Indigo Child. I\u2019m not a believer although it\u2019s clear Fluffy would like very much to take charge of dispensing the treats in the house and come to think of it, I\u2019m all for a new group stepping in to lead the planet since we\u2019re not doing such a bang up job.  \n\n Despite my dismissal of the Indigo phenomenon, Fluffy and I have been listening to the cd,  Indigo Dreams , at bedtime and I\u2019ve noticed Fluffy\u2019s been falling asleep faster and staying asleep nearly through the night. It\u2019s knocking me out too. I routinely wake up long after Fluffy\u2019s asleep and the cd is over, blinking my eyes as I climb over the bed guard. Dave\u2019s been putting Fluffy to bed a lot more these days (a minor miracle) and it knocks him out too. We both crawl around the house after Fluffy\u2019s asleep, whispering, \u2018...and so did... the bear .\u2019 If you get the cd, you\u2019ll be saying it too.  \n\n I don\u2019t know if there are subliminal messages being pumped through my son\u2019s brain, through the whole family\u2019s brain. How does one find out? Other than waking up to find oneself on the lawn of the white house with a pocketful of hand grenades. Kidding! I\u2019d use bombs. Kidding! secret service man, or CIA lurker! Bush is  so  totally great!  Totally.  And  super duper   smart ! \n\n Thankfully, I listened to it all the way through in the middle of the day when I wasn\u2019t in danger of being hypnotized by the slow, low, monotone telling the dull, pedantic, tale. It\u2019s harmless. It may even be good for Fluffy; the breathing techniques are simple and relaxing. It\u2019s nothing like the Reiki which Fluffy gives himself all the time now. He remembers when he gets upset. He does. I\u2019m standing there, all, Ah, what can we do to help you feel better? And he says,  I know! I\u2019ll give myself some Reiki!  And he does while I stand by, picking my nose. He even said,  Mommy, you need to get Reiki to even remember about Reiki!   \n\n Given the sleep issues in our house, I\u2019d be remiss not to mention this cd to you. Listen at your own risk. Watch for purpley-blue auras. And stay off Pennsylvania Avenue.  Paragraphs   (The sex scene. Vicki made me do it.) \u00a0 \u00a0 Paley took me back to his place, driving like a guy on a rough and tumble truck ad, bouncing high in his jeep seat, the plastic flaps slapping the door frame, taking turns on two wheels, hopping curbs, glancing over at me each time his hand cupped the knob of his gear shift, pausing ever so slightly before each thrust. \u00a0 \u00a0 The house was up a long circuitous driveway, round and round, like a cartoon climb up a mountain. It was a modern, low roofed, wood and glass, windows facing the Berkshire mountains to one side and sod fields to the other. Growing grass. But not this time of year. Growing ice. \u00a0 \u00a0 He led me in and then zipped up ahead to a panel of switches; the lights and music came on. Beyond him, I could see a room filled with windows, a cloth tarp on the floor and a set of tall adjustable lights, the kind you\u2019d see in a photographers studio. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAre you a photographer?\u201d I asked. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2018Not me. My buddy, Eli. This is his place. I\u2019m keeping\u2019 an eye on it for him.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 It was then I noticed the pictures, framed, on every wall, nude pictures of women everywhere, in every imaginable position, prone, supine, reaching, crouching, bent over with enormous and frightening labias hanging down. I felt his eyes on me, watching me look at these images. I noticed his fidgeting and his breath getting thicker. It was grotesque, twisted, carnival-like, mesmerizing. I walked slowly, my lips parted, my arms loose at my sides. And then he was behind me, his pelvis pressed up against my back. I leaned into him, my head falling back against his chest, the long ladder bones of my neck arching. I wanted his lips on mine, I wanted to suck on his tongue, suck it down my throat, I wanted my whole hand in his mouth.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 He tried to pull me around by I wouldn\u2019t let him. I found his hands and pushed them all over my body. I pressed back against him and he countered. We lurched forward; I braced myself, hands outstretched, face to the side, cheek flat against the wall, like a frisking. I managed to turn myself around, found his zipper and undid his pants; he sprang free.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Paley reached up my skirt, pulled down my tights and lifted me up against the wall. He gripped under my thighs and slipped himself in, his mouth open, his eyes droopy and lost. A picture to my right slipped down the wall and we stopped briefly. When it didn\u2019t break, we kept going. I knew how to move my body to get just the right friction. Paley was saying things like, Oh baby, my tomato, my ripe tomato, I\u2019m juicing you, or something like that, I don't know. I wasn\u2019t listening; I was looking down the hall at the white cloth on the studio floor, coiled like the train of a wedding dress.  \u00a0 \u00a0 When we finished, we sank to the floor. The forced air heat had been blasting and we were drenched in sweat, pools in our belly buttons. But we didn\u2019t lay side to side and walk fingers across our slick bellies; we didn\u2019t stumble to the kitchen, ravenous and half dressed to cook up a meal; we didn\u2019t softly stare into dark center of each other\u2019s eyes.\u00a0  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Indigo-Dreams-Meditation-Relaxation-Children/dp/0970863349"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_16.html", "title": "PPP Day 16 - Indigo Children My Ass"},
{"date": "November 14, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I'm  this close  to bowing out of Nablopomo; NaNoWriMo is close behind. We'll just have to see how the day goes... \n\n \n\n I\u2019m into cacti lately. I just am. Go figure.  \n\n I\u2019m writing a memoir and I\u2019m calling it  My Fat and Friendless Year or How I Learned to Love the Aspergers . How are those things related? Buy the book. It\u2019ll be right there, between the covers. \n\n Because I love the Aspergers because my son has Aspergers and I love the son. Love him! It\u2019s funny because I hear Dr. G.\u2019s voice in my head saying how much he hates those books with titles like, living and loving with autism or something like that since he believes so strongly that remediation through RDI is possible and when you put books like that out there you\u2019re putting those with autism into a separate category, a not human being category and that makes no sense to him. He says, these kids are not aliens, they\u2019re not from another planet, they\u2019re human beings; they want to connect, share, relate, feel competent, learn, grow, express thoughts and feelings and ideas, and feel comfortable in social situations and not because they\u2019ve memorized a long list of what to do and say or How To Tell A Joke.  \n\n I\u2019m with him on that. I\u2019m doing the RDI. I believe in remediation. I see remediation happening before my eyes with my son, with the children of people I know, all kinds of children, all along the spectrum. I\u2019m long past debating the term with anyone. I know what it means. It means teaching. Why would I debate the importance of teaching my son? \n\n But here I am, editing a book by parents of children on the spectrum. Isn\u2019t that putting \u2018them\u2019 into a different category? Well, raising children on the spectrum is not a typical journey. It just isn\u2019t. If it were typical, it wouldn\u2019t be called autism, right? I mean, autism describes an atypical assortment of behaviors and an atypical neuro-developmental pathway. All children on the spectrum are individuals though, being raised by parents who are all individuals. Meeting our children\u2019s needs requires something more from us as parents. Reading about that is important and interesting to me. \n\n I love the Aspergers because I\u2019m not afraid of it. I used to be afraid of it. Not because it was  different  and I wanted it to be  normal . I was never that interested in normal, never knew what that meant, have always been drawn to the quirky and off-beat person and view. I was afraid of the Aspergers because it was part of the person I loved more than anyone on the planet and I needed and wanted to provide for that person and  I wasn\u2019t sure how  and that felt like an emergency to me. I was doing everything under the sun and it wasn't working. I was afraid because it brought up my own feelings of incompetence, what if I\u2019m not giving him what he needs? What if I don\u2019t figure it out in time? When it comes to your child, there is nothing more frightening then not feeling up to the task.  \n\n And now that I\u2019m not afraid of it, it can be there or not. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter because we are remediating that which is in the way of my son feeling connected to himself and the world around him. As best as we can. In other words, I\u2019m parenting my child to the best of my ability, considering what matters to me and who my son reveals himself to be, so that he can one day leave us and move out into the world with his confidence and curiosity in tact. If he has Aspergers now, then, always, so what? The Aspergers isn\u2019t the issue. The quality of his life is.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/day_14.html", "title": "Day 14 - my fat and friendless year"},
{"date": "November 15, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture  (flying eyes in the butterfly pavilion) Post \n\n You guys are the greatest. I mean it. Every single word y\u2019all leave in the comments section is read and held dear. It is. As I said, this really IS my fat and friendless year--going on two, actually. I often wonder, does it make any sense to keep writing? to keep blogging? what is my tiny bit of internet real estate about, anyway? Hasn\u2019t everything already been said before and by those with hipper wardrobes and sleeker thighs and quicker wits? But then the minutes pass and I remember something Fluffy said that cracked me up or I\u2019m sad or excited or whipped up about something and I come running back to the keyboard and the screen and see that some of you have tossed me a cheer. I love that.  \n\n I\u2019m still behind but I haven\u2019t given up yet. It\u2019s not so much about NaNoWriMo, about meeting a word count on deadline. It\u2019s about sticking with what\u2019s hard because of what I want. I want to learn how to write. I must write to learn how to write. That is all.  \n\n It\u2019s easy to be  Art Linkletter  once you have kids, isn\u2019t it? With the congenial laugh and soft shake of the head,  kids say the darndest things . Nobody else cares what the hell our kids say but it\u2019s so compelling for the parent; we can\u2019t even stop ourselves. Even when you see the glazed look in the listener's eye, we have to say one last thing.  \n\n Today Fluffy said,  Maybe when baby Jesus died, his magical healing power lifted up into the universe where it hovered until it came back down again as Reiki healing power .  \n\n Okay, first of all, who\u2019s talking to him about baby Jesus? Not that I have anything against babies or Jesus for that matter but we\u2019re not exactly dressing up for church on sundays. Dave is Jewish. I am nothing. Fluffy was never baptized or circumcised or hermitized or sanitized. Dave did illustrate an adorable board book about  baby Jesus  that we must have read to him and certainly, we\u2019ve gone over Jesus et al around Christmas just as we\u2019ve gone over unlikely victories in battle and magical lamp oil at Hanukah. I guess Jesus made an impression. I think it was the magic. Fluffy loves magic. And invention. And the universe. \n\n I don\u2019t think Fluffy actually  talks  to Jesus but he does talk to his made up characters.\u00a0 He\u2019s got a whole slew of them but his favorite is Alien Gromit--or Invent Master--it depends on the day. They live in galaxies far far away. The details of how to get to their home planets are very specific. I\u2019ve heard them a lot. I\u2019ve written them down.  \n\n He talks to Alien Gromit every day. When he does, he balls up his fist, talks into the top part and then taps it to his forehead. When Alien Gromit talks to him, his fist taps his forehead and then his ear. The gestures usually go back to back and they are very swiftly performed. At first I thought it was a tic. I said, honey, are you okay?  Why, mommy?  Well, I wonder why you\u2019re hitting yourself in the head with your fist?  I\u2019m talking to Alien Gromit , he said, matter of factly and then went on to explain their communication system. Oh.  \n\n Alien Gromit is an inventor. He doesn\u2019t need food and he\u2019ll never die. He solves every human problem with science and magic. Most of them involve rockets and light beams. The Santa Catcher is a favorite.  \n\n I could go on about the other inventions and the underground laboratory but I\u2019ll stop there. For now.   \n\n Rock on, Alien Gromit.   Paragraphs \u00a0 \u00a0 (Monica has taken a new waitressing job. It's coming on Christmas. She's working doubles a lot, getting up and dressing in the dark, driving back home in the dark.)\u00a0    \u00a0 \u00a0I worked a double--breakfast shift with Ginger, lunch with Bea. If it had been the other way around, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have gone home with Paley. Ginger had sworn off men and campaigned at every opportunity for me to join her. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t need \u2018em. You don\u2019t. And they know it. That\u2019s why they act like such mother fuckers. They\u2019re scared shit.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 We were taking a break out behind the kitchen, ostensibly looking for the vat of croutons. Ginger was smoking a Newport. I didn\u2019t know anyone smoke menthols since the Bee Gees were hot.\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve got to wipe him outta your house. Go through it with a big plastic bag. Here\u2013\u201d she leaned down, the butt in her mouth, her lower lip jutting out to hang onto it, and yanked out a box of trash bags, \u201cTake these and do it tonight. Outta your house. Furniture, pictures, clothes, letters. Every. Inch.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 After the second shift, Bea tucked a strand of hair around my ear and said, \u201cAw. You deserve a little lovin\u2019. It might do you good to be held. Have someone loosen things up. Paley\u2019s harmless.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 I changed out of my uniform in the employee bathroom, just off the kitchen, making sure to lock the flimsy hook and eye. When I was done, I sailed by Five at the sink who clutched the spray hose suggestively, pumping it rhythmically up and down as he gave the coffee cups a once over. \u00a0 \u00a0 Out in the parking lot, Paley practically leaped over the hood of his jeep to open the passenger door for me. I climbed in and he leaned in close to grab the seat belt, pressing his face very close to mine as he buckled me in. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI want to make sure you get this on; we\u2019re going for quite a ride.\u201d \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2002-12-06-linkletter-aging_x.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/Little-Lambs-Christmas-Josephine-Page/dp/0439524644/sr=8-22/qid=1163550468/ref=sr_1_22/002-7979034-7573612?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_15.html", "title": "PPP Day 15 - baby jesus"},

{"date": "November 19, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture \n\n Fluffy pointing! October, 2005.   \n\n Post Look! Fluffy's pointing! You know, that thing the experts say ASD kids can't do. Like pretend play and eye contact and developing close attachments and caring for others and a looooong list of other fooey. I'm not saying ALL kids on the spectrum will and should do these things or anything. I'm just saying, the experts say some crazy shit.  \n\n We took this picture on a treasure hunt my dad set up for Fluffy over a\nyear ago. In it, he's practicing joint attention, bringing our\nattention to what he's seeing so we can share in that together. At that\npoint, we had been working with our RDI consultant a month after\nincorporating the basics with new vigor since my return from the 2-day\nConference in July a few months earlier. \n\n A year ago he told me, Mommy,  I'm the kind of personality that doesn't like other kids.  What if I said, okay, sure. I've read that kids with Aspergers don't\nform attachments in the same way as other kids so I guess that's just\nthe way you are. Instead of seeing it as part sensory and part developmental which is what I believe it is.  \n\n Last spring, Fluffy's OT pressed for another child to be added to his sessions because she felt it was so important for him to practice being social. What can I teach him alone? she asked. She had  just  finished telling me that when given the choice of what he could do that day, Fluffy asked her what she wanted to do, that they were taking turns pretty fluidly during games, that when Fluffy hurt himself, he came right to her for comfort and quickly re-regulated, that he was watching her carefully to find out what he ought to do next. I said, Miss OT! That's it right there! The learning how to be social! It's happening! What she didn't get is that if Fluffy's social developmental age was closer to one rather than five, all his behavior was right on target. One and two years old practice being social with their parents. There's an enormous amount of 1:1 long before there is any branching out with other kids.  \n\n\n\n The thing I love about the pictures taken from that day is Fluffy was NOT yet referencing. I am reading the treasures hunt clues, making sounds and expressions, directing my gaze, and he is looking everywhere but at my face. I love that because referencing is now second nature for him. I love that because it means things change,  he  is changing, what was once  not  happening  can  happen, the very things some say go to the heart of autism.  \n\n As we progress with RDI, I see it more and more and I trust it more and more. My son's heart will always be a juicy overflowing thing but the heart of autism seems to be contracting, at least the part that wants to dictate what is and isn't possible for him.  \n\n Paragraphs Monica arrives at her new apartment in NYC. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 I didn\u2019t have much to unload. There was a parking garage a block away but as luck would have it, a spot open up right in front as I turned the corner. I parked the car, fished the ring of keys out of my wallet, lifted Cecil in one arm, and walked up the steps. There was an old guy sitting on a plastic folding chair by the stoop in his hat, scarf, gloves, and long black overcoat. He looked ancient. He had on enormous glasses, like Jackie O. They obscured most of his face, but you could see he had a beautifully stenciled mouth.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLabdien!\u201d The little man said in a craggily east European accent. He smiled as he said it and shadow gestured a tip of his hat. \u00a0 \u00a0 I smiled back, unsure. Did he think I was someone else? Was he asking for something? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe is ill, your animal?\u201d The little man asked, still smiling, indicating Cecil with the end of his walking stick. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHm? Oh, yes. No. Not ill. He got hit. But he\u2019s okay. Just needs to wear this to keep from pulling at his stitches.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe should all be veering such a contraption.\u201d He said, taking off his glasses to look right at me with his small piercing eyes. His accent--I couldn\u2019t place it, couldn\u2019t tell exactly where he was from, but I loved his voice.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d I said, a bit too loudly.  `\u00a0 \u00a0 Once inside and down the hall, I opened the three locks to my tiny apartment. I pushed the door; it jammed against something inside. I was unable to get it open more than five or six inches so I threaded Cecil through, compressing the sides of his funnel hat, and then eased myself in like an Egyptian painting, low and at an angle. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_19.html", "title": "PPP  Day 19 - trusting RDI"},
{"date": "November 18, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture \n\n Fluffy with his new homeschooling co-op pals; yesterday!! Post \n\n Yesterday, Fluffy and I drove and drove and drove to the first meeting of our new homeschooling co-op. It\u2019s small, four families with five boys among us: four special needs, three on the spectrum also working with  RDI  consultants, and two of us using  Enki Education  as our homeschooling curriculum.    \n\n I knew one family, dear  Harvest Mom  and her two boys. Fluffy and I visited them together once before. I first met Harvest online, through the  connections center yahoo list  and then at both the RDI 2-day and 4-day Conferences. We've gotten together a few more times since and now will be seeing each other regularly! We met the others that day. I was excited. Fluffy was tentative.  \n\n It was a glorious day, more late summer than late November so after about forty five minutes in the house, we all went to the park. A great park! I loved this park! It had everything, including one of Fluffy\u2019s favorite things: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLook how he\u2019s referencing the other kids! One of the boys learned how to hop on as the merry go round thingy was moving. Fluffy did too, from  watching  him and the other boys who ran and hopped with ease. I could see he was proud of himself. I also could see he was  playing with  the other kids, coordinating with them, stopping and starting with them. It was the first time I\u2019ve seen him play with his peers for more than a few minutes in such a fluid and harmonious way.  \n\n I took pictures and a few short films with my digital camera. When I got home, I downloaded them and we all gathered around the computer monitor. Fluffy smiled and laughed and talked about what was happening, half remembering, half observing. He was so charged up by the day, it took a while to settle down to sleep, something, I realize, that\u2019s become more the exception than the rule these days. \n\n I loved the kids and felt an immediate connection with the parents. It was a true community experience for me. At last! After two years! For Fluffy too. He played on his own more than half the time but that\u2019s okay. He was happy. He was regulating. I could tell he felt a connection to the group, to seeing himself as  part of  the group.  \n\n That is so huge. So huge. If any of you have been following along, you know what I  mean . My god. We have many moments of  clarity  but there\u2019s been much  isolation . It\u2019s been the right thing, the only thing, given Fluffy's fear and confusion and great difficulty being around other kids but little by little it\u2019s becoming a thing of the past. Up until now, there hasn\u2019t been a way to practice being with other kids, to allow some of the developmental leaps to simmer and percolate out in the general population. Now, it\u2019s time.  \n\n Connecting is a beautiful thing. Witnessing the process is tremendously moving to me. I am so grateful to be on this threshold; I feel an overflowing admiration for Fluffy.  \n\n A group of boys climbs on a structure together; Fluffy joins them. A boy falls and hurts himself; Fluffy makes a sad sound and goes to him. The merry go round is turning, boys are run round and round; Fluffy watches, looking for a way in. He finds it, grabs the bar, pushes along with them, and then climbs on. It's going fast. It feels good. He looks around. He's not alone. \n\n Paragraphs (Monica, out of work and out of home, has packed her meager belongings, her recovering cat, her dwindling cash resources and is on her way to a sublet, a few hours south in Manhattan, where she once lived with Marty.) \n\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 I left the gentle rolling hills of upstate. I watched the sky turn dark around me, in stages, like softly played descending chords. The sky looked wild, peach streaked clouds, tumbling dark mountains of grays and blue. It was unseasonably warm for January. I rolled down the window to feel the air just as a raindrop hit the window, one plink like a bird dropping or the splat from a passing bug and then it started to pour. \u00a0 I stayed on the country road. I thought, if the rain gets too heavy, I can easily pull off to the side and wait it out. Then sky opened up and great bucketfuls descended. I crawled along, straining to see something a set of red lights in front of me? or headlights behind?\u00a0 Cecil was on the floor, his tail swishing back and forth in a disturbed jerk, his head encased in the clear plastic cone of his protective gear, like feline amber specimen. \u00a0  \u00a0 I started to sing to myself. A flash of lightening illuminated my surroundings. There were no other cars or buildings. It began to feel like a dream, like I was driving in a tray in the darkroom, moving through the gray and black of a photograph as it slowly appears on the slick wet paper. I hugged the side of the road, unable to see a shoulder, afraid to stop, afraid there wouldn\u2019t be enough room to avoid being flattened by another car or 14-wheeler.  \u00a0 \u00a0 I heard a sizzle, a peeling, a low crackle and then a thunderous boom followed by a flash that lit up what looked like hundreds of cows standing close to the road, staring out, a chorus line of cow heads, blank, enormous, waiting. I gasped and almost went off the road, heading for the city, heading for my new life. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com", "http://www.enkieducation.org", "http://jacobs-journey.blogspot.com/", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/RDI/RDISupportGroups.asp"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_18.html", "title": "PPP Day 18 - Homeschoolers Co-op!"},

He can barely tolerate them and all he has to do is swallow--something he's good at. I got Carlson's brand from  this place  at the suggestion of my mom who swears by its healing properties. Apparently some guy cured his mother's Rheumatoid Arthritis by having her drink a tablespoon of it a day. The catch: it had to be straight from the bottle, no chasers, and it had to be on an empty stomach, specifically, two HOURS before and after food or drink. \n\n I'm on day 3 of NaNoWriMo and day 3 of Carlson's. I've been getting up around 5 to drink a teaspoon of the stuff and tap tap away at my keyboard. I'm holding off on eating for the two hours after but I can't say the same for my coffee. I also can't say I drink it entirely alone. I stir it a short glass of organic tomato juice, slam it down and brace for the taste. But you know, it's not bad, not bad at all. Carlson Cod Liver Oil , lemon flavor. It's a great deal. Consider it the alternative novelist fuel. \n\n Paragraph \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0  A sound like the faint call of a fog horn wrapped in blankets of clouds called and I turned around. A tiny flicker of white was visible coming east from the scrap station in Albany, toward the Grange, toward me and beyond, to Boston. This wasn\u2019t a passenger track anymore; the only trains that came through were faceless, dreamless. The horn sounded again and I saw a plume of steam rise up for an instant before it was pulled back westward, like a movie. I felt like I was  on  a movie set and put my hands up in front of my face in two overlapping C\u2019s, the director, framing the shot. It was picturesque, bucolic, the perfect country scene: the rising Berkshire mountains in the far distance, the leaves of late October clinging to the nodes, the brilliant yellow of the Sugar Maples, the crimson red of the Burning Bush, the rusty brown of the Oak framing the old Grange in the foreground with its low roof and hand lettered sign, the narrow country road snaking up the hill, over the tracks and around the bend, branching off to the clapboard cottages ahead. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 The train was almost to me; I was standing too close. Had I been in the city awaiting the arrival of a subway, I would have been six inches over the fat yellow line, the spot from which the suction from the speeding train could pull me in and down to the spinning wheels. I wondered what it feels like, right before impact. I wondered if you would hear anything. I wondered if it would be warm, like hot metal arms that wrap before they rip you wide open. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vitacost.com/Carlson-Norwegian-Cod-Liver-Oil-High-In-EPA-DHA", "http://www.vitacost.com/Carlson-Norwegian-Cod-Liver-Oil-High-In-EPA-DHA"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_3.html", "title": "PPP Day 3 - Cod Liver Oil"},

The hands poised in the air, curled in tiny expressive gestures. I loved those hands. They were so warm and delectable, so scrunchy and real, and they could  suspend in mid-air  while the person to whom they were attached, slept. At least for the first two weeks.  \n\n I want another one. I do. I don\u2019t often step into the river of my longing but it\u2019s always there. It was there before Fluffy. It may always be there. Earth doesn\u2019t easily dry her springs.  \n\n My husband says, why would you want another? After all this? The sleeplessness and the autism and the isolation? You\u2019re always talking about needing more time. I know! I am! But, but, but? I feel like Fluffy, negotiating for dessert after every meal. Can I please have one more? Pleeeeeeeease? The babies! Those hands!  \n\n The time, she ticks. I turned 47 last month. It won\u2019t happen again for me. I have sweet memories of Fluffy and thousands of photographs. I wish I could lift the corner of one and slide in, cup the back of his small head in my palm, smell his milky breath, feel the power of his grip, the weight of his body stretched across my chest. My heart was always hanging open for him but I do know more now. My hands are more sure.  \n\n Bring me any baby. I am unafraid. I want a sibling for my son. I want another set of chubby legs. I want a louder house. I want another reason to need more time for myself. \n\n NaNoWriMo Paragraphs \u00a0 \u00a0 The kitchen sink was leaking but if you stuffed a folded paper towel in a bowl and slipped it under the faucet, you wouldn\u2019t hear a thing. That was my strategy. That or call Stewart, the landlord, who lived next door, which I didn\u2019t feel like doing.\u00a0 Outside, another blistering snowstorm thrashed sideways through the empty tree tops and pelted the windows with flakes the size of raisons. Why make him come out in this? For a little drip drip? \u00a0 \u00a0 The stove crackled; heat spread from the cast iron belly and suffused the room in warmth and reassuring scents of aged cherry and apple. Or so I imagined since those were of the varieties mentioned the day 5 cords tumbled from the back of a truck into a rising pyramid on our front lawn. \n\n (Later...) \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 I was staring sideways at Marty as he clicked around the stations, finding every show objectionable in some way. I narrowed my eyes at him. What was the matter with this man? This man with his three strands of hair he was compelled to grow long enough to braid? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat IS that?\u201d He said, looking sharply in the direction of the kitchen. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cA leak.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhaddaya mean, a leak?

Short out the water heater?\u201d He was across the room to the junk drawer, yanking it open with a jerk. The front panel ripped off and the contents streamed to the floor. \u201cOh! Beautiful. That is  just  beautiful.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJesus.\u201d I muttered. Usually, it took a while to rev him up to this level. He was flipping out faster and faster lately.

{"date": "November 05, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture Fluffy gnawing on the wrong end of the pacifier as was his way. Post Yesterday I took a class called Food 101 at the local yoga and wellness center. The teacher, the founder and owner of the center, is a striking and fast talking woman of passion and commitment to whole food and healthful living. I stared and stared at her. Her vibrancy was mesmorizing. Her energy was impressive, intoxicating, and  she doesn't even drink coffee . Her husband is the chiropractor I bring Fluffy to see, the same one I see whenever things get out of whack, which is thankfully a rare event.  The center is a golden egg in the center of our tiny town and it draws fascinating people from all corners of the healing arts in addition to holding ongoing classes in every kind of yoga, running the gamut from the frighteningly athletic kind, to pilates, the very new new new Nia, the super HOT, the vinyassa, all the way down to my personal favorite, the lying on the floor surrounded by stacks of blankets, cushions, blocks and every manner of prop for maximum support kind. It\u2019s also the place where I met Fluffy\u2019s naturapath, the new Reiki Master, and a fellow mom of an Asperger boy who does magical massage therapy, a stupendous natural facialist, and two different acupuncturists with whom I\u2019ve chatted while needles protruded from my body and dangled at odd angles.  I love that place.  The workshop was just what I needed, the kick in the pants to approach food with a bit of inspiration and renewed commitment to health. I have these great books like Annemarie Colbin's  Food and Healing  but I barely crack the cover. When I got home, I went through all the cabinets and cleared things out, got organized, was able to SEE what we have. Fluffy does pretty well with food but he\u2019s got a big salt thing going and I know he must be missing something--protein? Is there much protein in french fries, ketchup, potato chips, olives, pickles, oh and fruit pops? I think not. She talked of the energetics of foods among much else and I\u2019m on the path to slowly move his eating, all of our eating, to a more balanced place. It\u2019a quite a thing, preparing tasty, wholesome meals for your family. Even for a family of three. I have renewed admiration for my mom who was right on the cutting edge of food when we were growing up, making crunchy granola, bulgur meat loaf, leafy salads and a wide assortment of greens every night. We may have had garden variety dysfunction with a bit of a drinking problem here and caterwauling outbursts there, but we sat down as a family to a beautiful dinner every night. At least until my parents divorced when I was 17 after which my younger brother experienced a different sort of ritual, one where mom frequently ended up using the smoke alarm as an oven timer. But until then, food was plentiful, yummy, and lovingly prepared. It was a rare and enriching thing. Paragraph \u00a0 \u00a0 The sky was alert, blue, the sun shimmering on the snow drifts. Marty was downstairs, adjusting the burning logs in the stove. I could hear the rasp of metal handle to metal door as he closed up the belly, and listened again for the low thud of the flue closing down. I could feel the temperature rising up the narrow stairs, kneading the air back to a round shape of warmth, smoothing out the corners from the cool night. I could smell coffee.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHoney? Will you bring me a cup?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 He didn\u2019t answer. I went to the window. Stewart had already plowed the length of the driveway and there was Marty, dutifully shoveling out the last bit of snow from the truck. My guy. My hero.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Downstairs, wood had been stacked neatly by the stove, the basket of kindling overflowing with newly split and splintered logs. The Hingham News in a box, a box of matches on top. It looked like a spread for Wood Stove Living. Marty loves a presentation.  \u00a0 \u00a0 A heated loaf of bread was on the counter next to a sharp cheddar and stone ground mustard. My favorite mug sat by the coffee pot. I poured a cup and sipped it, standing up, looking through the back windows at the picnic table and the foot-high rectangle of snow atop. The stalks of dried wild phlox were hidden now, the wild roses looking like hulking furniture in a house closed up for the season. I smeared cheese into chunks of bread with my index finger and ate it.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Food-Healing-Annemarie-Colbin/dp/0345303857/sr=1-1/qid=1162736365/ref=sr_1_1/002-7979034-7573612?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_5.html", "title": "PPP Day 5 - Food 101"},

She\u2019s prompt, dependable, bright, enthusiastic, responsible, adores my son, and sincerely loves to play.\u00a0 Her favorite movie of all time is  The Lion King  and she has the key chain to prove it. Her license plate is MUFASA. The girl has a cotton candy machine in her house. That alone put her over the top for Fluffy who\u2019s favorite food in the whole world is cotton candy, hands down. He only gets it once a year when the Big Apple Circus comes to town. This fact is one of the first things he shares with those he meets. And shares and shares and shares. \n\n The other day he said to me,  Mommy, if you could have a meeting with God and ask him one question, what would you ask him?  I thought a long time before I answered, aware of his audience, pondering all the many many things I could say and finally came up with one of the things I think about: is it really true that once we die, we can look out from our spirit selves and see what\u2019s going on with everyone still wearing skin.  Oh,  he said. What would you ask?  Well,  he said, looking serious,  I would ask if cotton candy could be turned into the best thing you could ever eat for your body\u2019s health. \n\n I love that answer.

I walked towards the sound. It was a cloudy night, the kind of clouds that cling like whipped cream to the underside of a bowl: thick, round, pulled to the side by the wind to reveal the moon, waning now but still bright. I jogged toward the sound, stepping over landscaping, stones and perennials, patches of ornamental grass stubbornly upright. \u00a0 \u00a0 I got close enough to see into this family\u2019s evening; a circle of people sitting around a table, empty plates and glasses in the middle, gifts and children on laps. I was certain this family owned the animal hospital. I was certain the older guy was Dr. Bim, Cecil\u2019s vet, the guy who neutered him.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDr. Bim!\u201d I said, excitedly, running to the window. \u00a0 \u00a0 An outside light clicked on.

I started up the stairs but he stood in the doorway holding a set of keys. A young girl of about nine peered out at me from behind him. She looked at me, wide eyed.

In the words of  Ali G ,  Check it: Me am behind. Picture \n\n \n\n Post Last night I took a Svaroopa yoga class. This is my kind of yoga: four positions  lying  down, four positions  sitting  down. The end. There are piles of blankets to be used to support and drape over, blocks, cushions, and straps. It's prop heavy and all about release. \n\n It was heavenly. I fell asleep during the meditation. The instructor's voice, the warm room, the breathing bodies, the rhythmic music, the weight of my eye pillow, ahhhhh. I became aware of a sound. It was the instructor's voice calling us all 'back to our bodies' but in my dreamy mind, I was quite sure I was in the darkness of Fluffy's room, putting him to bed for the night and that he needed something.  What is it, honey?  I called out to the room.  \n\n Here is an excerpt from the yoga reading by Rama Berch:  The quality of your life is determined by how you use your mind, not by external events and situations. You can think yourself into exhaustion. Whatever you think, your body experiences as if it were happening. Your body can actually live through experiences that you will never have, all because of what your mind does to it. If you want to improve your physical condition, you must retrain your mind.  \n\n I believe RDI provides an opportunity for parents to retrain their minds around autism, what it means for their kids, what it means for the parents, and what it means for the household. It can be like transferring from a step aerobics class into a svaroopa yoga class. Not that there isn't any place for a driving beat and a few thousands leg kicks, but nothing beats the stamina born from a calm confidence. Not that doing RDI is like rolling around on a stack of blankets and not that doing RDI means never having worry or a time of great challenge. But I believe the philosophy and practice of RDI can take away much of the exhaustion that comes from looking  out there  rather than staying  right here .  \n\n Paragraph \u00a0 \u00a0 (Monica and her cat, Cecil, are home for Thanksgiving.) \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cecil was missing in action.

The last time I\u2019d been home, he had a fascination with flushing things down the toilet. If Cecil had any sense, he\u2019d stay under that bed until Fin was sound asleep. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Which would be soon. I was next to him in bed reading Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel. It was desperately sad. Mike and Maryann were unwanted, cast out, replaced by the diesel and electric machines, unemployed, no longer appreciated for their hard work. But Mike, bless his heart, did not give up on his Maryann. He washed and polished her, leaned up against her shiny red body and poured over help wanted section. He had balls. He had heart. He knew commitment.  \u00a0 \u00a0 When they got to the new town and began digging, I started to choke up. By the time they had finished, my voice was wavy and thin. The book slipped from my hand and flopped forward covering Fin\u2019s face \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAuntie?\u201d He said beneath the book.\u00a0 \u201cAuntie. Finish it. There\u2019s one more page.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 I read the ending and then lay in the dark with my nephew. Tears dripped down my temples and pooled in the tiny cup of my ear. Fin fell asleep with one leg flung over mine. I loved the feeling of his leg on me. His warmth. His innocence and vulnerability. I wanted to pluck it off and walk through life with his dear, tender leg stuck to my side. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.disbealig.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_10.html", "title": "PPP Day 10 - Svaroopa la la"},

He can also give it to me, Dave, the dog, anyone in the whole world, near or far, something he set about doing straight away. \n\n He gave Reiki to himself, to Myra, to me. He gathered a mental image of Dave that he held inside an invisible bubble and sent it through the air to Dave at work. He sent one even farther to Mama Mama in Arizona. He marched down the hall and gave Reiki to the receptionist, a passing yoga teacher, the scheduler. He laid his hands on Beegu\u2019s furry back upon our return to the house.  \n\n Each time he began by rubbing his hands together--an unnecessary step but one that I do before giving Reiki because it feels good and it gets me in the mood. He rubbed his hands together, closed his eyes and moved his lips as he silently declared his intention to give the healing energy. He then reached out and set his hands down, his eyes still closed, his whole body in focused quiet repose. After a minute or two, he declared,  Now you\u2019ll have that energy for the rest of your life. \n\n Could you die from the cuteness?  \n\n During the appointment, Fluffy reminded me of Gilda Radna impersonating a little kid at a Reiki attunement, had she ever done such a thing, a little kid in constant motion, hopping on one foot and then the other, clasping his arms in front of himself and shifting from side to side, climbing on the table, sliding the blanket this way and that, inching to the edge on his tummy, twisting on his back to hang off drip by drip while peering up at the skylight, all the while asking and answering questions, stopping every now and then to look at Myra square in the face and smile or consider what she was saying or ask one of his many questions:  How do you control the energy? How far can you send it? How long does it last?  The concept was never in question, though, that one could harness and direct healing energy from the universe to a person or even a thing. It was matter of fact. Energy has always been one of his favorite topics. \n\n Myra invited him to her monthly Reiki circle open to all who\u2019ve been attuned to at least Level 1.

{"date": "October 25, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I wish Ann Douglas had written  Sleep Solutions for Your Baby, Toddler, and Preschooler; The Ultimate No-Worry Approach for Each Age and Stage  six years ago when I was teetering around in my third trimester looking suspiciously like a tic. Or even five years ago when I was a new mom, tripping over my pendulous breasts, trying in vain to log more than 30 consecutive minutes of shut eye. \n\n To say Fluffy wasn\u2019t much of a sleeper would be a little like saying the equator isn\u2019t much of a down hill ski resort. We careened through colic, night terrors, and years of night wakings so numerous you wouldn\u2019t believe the numbers, but I have them, written down, in a stack of coffee-stained journals and sleep logs that are thankfully now, blowing around in the attic, far far away. \n\n I\u2019ve only recently staggered off my sleep deprivation battle field. I have truckloads of sympathy and compassion for anyone still slogging through their own sleep issues but beyond a gnarly,  Whoa, duuuuude. Bummer about the sleep thing!  and a gazillion stories from my own wakeful wreckage, I\u2019m no help to you. \n\n Enter  Ann Douglas  with the Mother Of All Gifts, her unparalleled ability to gather, organize, and present volumes of research and anecdotal information in a fun, easy to read, fantastically helpful, and might I say, comprehensive book on sleep. The only teeny tiny suggestion I might make is that her book ought to be called,  Sleep Solutions For Your Baby, Toddler, Preschooler And  YOU  because discussions of you, the mother, your sleep realities, needs, and strategies for approaching satisfaction, are finally part of the whole picture.  \n\n Let me say right here: I love Ann. Unabashedly. She writes clearly, intelligently, generously, and with a stunning bedside manner about all things motherhood. She is funny, smart, informed, and passionate about community. What do I mean by that? I mean, she is all about parents helping other parents. This mother of four is a one woman dynamo, a public speaker, teacher, author of books conception, pregnancy, choosing childcare, parenting, writer of articles, columns, weblogs, as well as wildly successful The Mother Of All Books series and this book, the first in The Mother of All Solutions series.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n Sleep Solutions begins with an overview of what is covered in each chapter. It is wonderfully easy to navigate, something I would have required had I picked this up during the months of my bone-crushing fatigue when my powers to problem solve and think creatively were miles away, a tiny dot in the sky like a balloon yanked into a strong wind. Poof. \n\n This concise and handy chart enables you to zero in where you most need help. Do you need a primer on the \u2018physical, emotional, and relationship fallout of sleep deprivation\u2019? Tips for maximizing your chances for getting much needed rest and support? A list of on-line resources and further research in the field of infant sleep? Or do you need to dive right in to one of the \u2018Real-World Guides\u2019 and start solving your child\u2019s sleep problems straight away?  \n\n During the years of our sleep issues, I read every sleep book I could find. How is this one different?\u00a0 In three important ways:  \n\n (1) Ann focuses on the mom and her need for sleep, what happens when she doesn\u2019t get it, and how she can maximize her own rest and minimize her stress. HUGE.  \n\n (2) Ann dispels the one size fits all solution to sleep issues. She stresses there is no ONE way to get the baby to sleep. A surprisingly revolutionary concept.  \n\n (3) Ann promises no guilt and she delivers. This book provides information on sleep science, sleep strategies, sleep research, sleep resources, tools, charts, sleep logs and most of all, quotes from other real life moms out in the \u2018sleep-deprivation trenches\u2019.\u00a0 You pick what is the best strategy given your child, your temperament, your family, and your parenting style.  \n\n Ann interviewed over 200 families while writing the book and many of the mother\u2019s voices are sprinkled throughout the book on everything from the resentment toward the peacefully sleeping spouse one mom admitted, caused her to bounce on the bed like a trampoline when she returned from tending to the wakeful baby in the night to frank discussions on the hot topic of sleep training and everything in between. \n\n I love that. Hearing from the other moms is so important. It breaks the isolation, provides perspective and spreads the wisdom. Like this tidbit from Marie who says, \u201chigh needs babies are high needs 24 hours a day.\u201d Yes! Thank you, Maria.  \n\n And from Sarah who says, \u201cSleep is for the baby parent set what little league scores are for the school-age parent set and what college admissions are for the teenage parent set and I think it is unfair for the kids and the parents.\u201d\u00a0 Amen.  \n\n In the section called Strangers in the Night, Ann talks of how hard it is for parents to find time to connect, \u201cparticularly if your baby is still quite young or the child\u2019s sleep problems are either extreme or long-standing.\u201d Bingo the last two. In this same section, mom Stephanie reports that she and her husband \u201cstruggle to find some quiet time to talk. If we need to speak about something important, we often do it with a quick email or a phone call when one of us is out.\u201d Yes. We are still doing that over five years into this! \n\n Aside from discussions with my sister-in-law who shared my parenting style and the experience of mothering a child that did not release the nipple, roll over and fall into a deep sleep in the family bed as Dr. Sears promised would happen as we were humming Kumbaya, I felt utterly alone and baffled by the sleep issue. I was beaten down. I felt like a failure. As Ann mentions, there is nothing more controversial than this issue of how do you deal with the sleep, no other topic that draws more conflicting and unsolicited advice, warnings, and judgments from everything you read, everyone you know and everyone you pass in the street. \n\n But Ann doesn\u2019t judge! She\u2019s here to help, ladies and gentleman. And help she does. Page after page. She provides information, information, information so that parents can make their own choices. There is no one way set in stone; there is only your way which may change as your baby changes. She writes, \u201cyour thoughts and idea about sleep may change once you\u2019re dealing with the reality of nighttime parenting as opposed to just the theory\u201d and, \u201cExperiment with a variety of different sleeping arrangements until you find the one that results in maximum sleep for everyone.\u201d Isn\u2019t that brilliant? In retrospect, it seems obvious. But I\u2019ll wager a bet no sleep expert has ever before said such a beautiful, inspired and helpful thing. \n\n \u201cRemain as calm and relaxed as possible about the sleep issue\u201d writes Ann in more than one place. I wish I could turn the clock back for that one. I know my stress was felt by my son. We were a sleep panic circle. I'm convinced I would have been spared a lot of that if I had Ann\u2019s book back then. No other book gave me the place to find that calm. They all played into the high stakes intensity of that time. You MUST DO IT THIS WAY OR ELSE. Or else what? Your child will be perched on the bell tower, picking off the neighborhood one body at at time? Your child will be institutionalized from lack of adequate REM?  \n\n We were a mess over sleep issues in our house. We had colic and high needs and six months of thrice weekly night terrors before Fluffy was even a year old. The exhaustion was profound, even comical. I never knew one could be so bone crushingly tired and not be dead. It was mind boggling and for a long while, there was simply no end in sight. The situation now is much improved, unrecognizable given where we came from. I only wake up once a night to help Fluffy get to the bathroom. but I can quickly return to that time. (Shudder.) How I wish I had this book then, a one-stop resource that lays out the goods and treats you like the unique, intuitive, and trustworthy mother that you are. \n\n  If you are having sleep concerns or know of anyone about to bring a new baby home, stop by with a sesame chicken and  this book . \n\n\n\n There are many, many links I could provide to learn more about Ann. For starters, go  here ,  here , and  here . \n\n Normally, I raffle off my copy of the books I review, but I'm keeping this one. There are a few strategies in the preschooler category that hold real promise for our household. I'll keep you posted.  \n\n In the meantime, happy reading and sweet dreams. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solutions-Your-Toddler-Preschooler/dp/0470836334", "http://www.having-a-baby.com/author.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Solutions-Baby-Toddler-Preschooler/dp/0470836334", "http://anndouglas.blogspot.com/", "http://www.mothershock.com/blog/archives/2006/10/to_sleep_percha.html", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HV3S535RZ3CW/ref=cm_blog_pdp/104-4736499-6307148"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/sleep_solutions.html", "title": "Sleep Solutions: MotherTalk Blog Book Tour"},

I had to keep at it. It's the only way to find out what's next.  \n\n I did have one great moment. It was after midnight. I was standing at the kitchen island eating everything, feeling dull and stupefied, hiding from the computer as if it were a garrulous guest, and then I nearly laughed out loud thinking to myself,  what? Do you think you can postpone the writing until it isn't hard anymore? Do you think there will be a time when sitting down as a beginner to do the first draft of a novel will not be challenging?   \n\n The clarity! It's only in the WRITING and WRITING and WRITING SOME MORE that it becomes less hard, or the hard parts become less scary or unsettling because experiences of getting beyond it have been logged. If I stop now, it's like stopping the RDI with Fluffy when we hit a snag. Stopping at the failure moment creates the memory of the failure moment.\u00a0 If I drop back, simplify, and reframe, Fluffy and I each have the chance to log the success.  \n\n So, I put down my salami roll-ups, squared my shoulders and said to my new NaNoWriMo coffee mug (thank you,  Vicki! ),  Mug, I\u2019m going back in.  \n\n Paragraph \u00a0 \u00a0 My mother, Adele, had a new boyfriend and so was feeling optimistic about life, about her future.

Let us take care of you for a bit.\u201d She said on the phone a few days earlier, cracking into a carrot presumably the size of her couch. I don\u2019t know how she could be so loud, so unbelievably loud all the time but especially when eating. It was hard to imagine lasting an entire meal let alone the marathon consumption event that was thanksgiving but I couldn\u2019t be alone in the house for another moment. \u00a0 \u00a0 I didn\u2019t go upstairs anymore. I\u2019d shoved the futon down the stairs and inches from the wood stove. That\u2019s where I slept, or rather, stared. I couldn\u2019t sleep. My mind would not shut off. It didn\u2019t crank out plans of retribution or salvation. It was like some sort of neurological bookkeeping had to be sorted through before shut down. But there was never a shut down. The program ran and ran, churning through computer codes, spinning, looking for matches and patterns.

{"date": "November 06, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture Shocked Dave in front of blue door; out west, 1998. \n\n   Post The tall grass for me is when there isn\u2019t resonance between my external and internal worlds. It\u2019s when I can\u2019t see where I\u2019m going or the path to where I need to go isn\u2019t clear, or rather, cleared. There was a lot of tall grass when I started this blog, in January of 2005. We knew about Fluffy\u2019s Aspergers even though the diagnosis would not come for another couple of months. We had known since the previous fall when he got kicked out of preschool and all the things I was seeing and wondering about came into focus after one long night on the internet.  \n\n That night was in October. School testing began in November, the month the builders broke through the external wall in our kitchen and began clunking and banging and yanking out cabinets. I went to the Son Rise Institute in December. We had a playroom for Fluffy by January, when the addition on our house was finally completed. We started our Son Rise program, hired a helper, and played with Fluffy all day.  \n\n Toward the spring, we began neurofeedback and weekly play sessions with an Asperger specialist who was meant to be coaching us on Floortime and RDI. By that time, March-ish, I was disappointed with the lack of specific support and guidance from the Son Rise Institute--there was a lot right with their staff and belief system but a lot wrong with parent training once you left their grounds; they left us hanging.  \n\n By the beginning of the summer, it was clear Fluffy\u2019s Asperger doctor wasn\u2019t really sold on doing RDI with us. She had a cockamamie notion that it would work better for Fluffy when he was older. At that time, we were doing a modified Son Rise with a splash of Floortime and a drop of RDI.  \n\n I was winging it, relying on my instincts. I felt like we were  dangling , living the  abynormal life . I needed real guidance and support. I don\u2019t mean to sound inflated or ungrateful, but those who claimed to know about autism, including Fluffy\u2019s doctor, did not impress me. I would listen to them speak and it wouldn\u2019t take root because the language about \u2018these kids\u2019 seemed to be about keeping them separate.  \n\n RDI was different. It made sense to me. I was excited about it. I wanted MORE. I bought  the   books  and read them greedily. I tried incorporating the basics at home, reducing language, increasing non verbal communication. By May, I quit taking Fluffy to his weekly play sessions and signed up for the RDI 2-day training in July. That\u2019s when the grass started to recede.  \n\n I still have challenging and perplexing times, but not that lost and wandering feeling. I have a map I can hold that corresponds to the map I hold in my heart. And the map is, RDI and Enki Education. We are still working on meeting Fluffy\u2019s sensory needs. His OT is wonderful; the Enki program has a strong sensory-motor component but we need more, something more comprehensive and underlying, a frame to lay our own style and specifics atop. That\u2019s what the RDI and Enki provide for us. A strong framework.  \n\n I wish I had gone directly to RDI that fall. I don\u2019t have to wonder where we\u2019d be. I know where we\u2019d be. At about stage 7 rather than stage 3. And that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll get to stage 7. I wish we had started with RDI sooner because it is a way of being with my child, of moving through our day, the world, his developmental path. It\u2019s not a therapy; it\u2019s a parenting style. As soon as I discovered Fluffy\u2019s behavior had to do with his differing neurology, I needed to adjust my parenting to slow down, to see the path more clearly, and frame things so my son can see more clearly too. \n\n I\u2019ve gotten a few emails lately from parents who are interested in RDI but feel overwhelmed about how to get started. I write back, blubbering away with my enthusiasm and experience, hoping something I\u2019ve said has hit the spot. I\u2019ll keep doing that for anyone, so, please feel free to email.  \n\n If you're interested in RDI but feel a bit at sea, I'm planning to post my \u2018getting started\u2019 suggestions tomorrow. I wish I could direct you to my list of RDI-related posts but I'm waaaay\nbehind in organizing my entries. Eventually, you WILL be able to click on my archives section and select the RDI catagory. In the meantime, my friend,  Harvest Mom , is doing a fantastic job of breaking it all down in her chronicle of her RDI home program for her adorable son, Jacob.  \n\n And don\u2019t forget the  RDI connection center site .

That\u2019s enough for today! \n\n If you are following the unfolding NaNoWriMo story of Monica and Marty, continue reading below. \n\n Paragraph \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Marty\u2019s head was out the car window, yelling to the roof guy, \u201cHey, you back it up, buddy! I\u2019m at the end, here. Come on, man! Back it.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 My teeth started chattering. Wildly, like I was playing the vibraphones. Chatter chatter chatter. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMonica. Man. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat's WRONG? You leave this note and then you ask me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLook at you. Go back in the house. You\u2019re freezing.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m freezing? I\u2019m UPSET.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLook. It\u2019s better this way. You\u2019ll see. We can still get together.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cGet together? Like a date?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYeah. Sure. If you want.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIf I WANT?\u201d I screamed. I could not stop repeating his words. I sounded like a movie but I couldn\u2019t help myself. My words were sucked into the air, up into the brilliant rays of November\u2019s hovering sun.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The roof guy honked at us. We looked up and saw him waiting on the near side of Mill, waving his hand impatiently in a circle. Marty looked at me. I did not move. He pulled out of the driveway and turned left, off to the far side.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cJesus! Are you LEAVING? Are you LEAVING ME RIGHT NOW?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 Marty didn\u2019t answer. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhat is going on? Are you fucking made of ice? Don\u2019t you love me anymore?\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 Marty made a small face, the kind of face you make when your burp brings back something sour. He looked away, out the window. Silence. That\u2019s when the steel bat came out from behind the tree and slammed me in the gut. And I bent over, emitted an strangled, involuntary sound. A groan or a gasp or gargled choking sound. I dropped his note, his pitiful explanation for why he was walking out on me after ten years of marriage. Ten years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAfter ten years. That\u2019s it? See ya later like I\u2019m a friend of the family?\u201d  \u00a0 \u00a0 He paused. \u201cYou know, ten years. I don\u2019t know what that even means.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t know what that even MEANS?\u201d I was incredulous. I whipped around. I was now up on my knees, leaning over him, my mouth agape.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 I felt sick. The pounding in my chest took on a tribal resonance, like there were ten of them, hundreds, and it wasn\u2019t just pounding, there was a kind of trembling, a feeling of real danger, terror, as if my heart was about to burst through my bones and escape through the window in a single violent beat, dodging in and out of the snow drifts like a retreating fox, unstrung and full of my hot pulsing blood. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll call you. Monica. I will.\u201d he said.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Neither one of us said anything. The turn signal clicked mindlessly. I don't know how long it was since the clock in the truck had never worked and I don\u2019t wear a watch. But I know I began to feel surprised that I could just sit there, still breathing and blinking my eyes, all without a beating heart.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Autism-Aspergers-Relationship-Developmental-Emotional/dp/1885477708", "http://www.amazon.com/Relationship-Development-Intervention-Young-Children/dp/1843107147/sr=1-3/qid=1162821380/ref=sr_1_3/002-7979034-7573612?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://jacobs-journey.blogspot.com/", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_6.html", "title": "PPP Day 6 - some thoughts on tall grass"},

{"date": "November 07, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Picture \n\n Fluffy on the beach his first summer; 2001. Can you believe the cuteness? \n\n Post Before I launch in, I must urge you all to vote! Vote once! Vote twice! Vote thrice and then again! \n\n Okay, getting started with RDI is actually much easier than you think. I mean, the concepts are easy and readily employable. The practice of it, well, takes practice. It's one of those uncomplicated but hard to do things since you are breaking habits and starting new ones, becoming more conscious of your pace and communication style, working to slow things down so your children have more time to process. They need it. \n\n And they need it in a low pressure setting. You cannot underestimate how much that will be felt by your child or how much the pressure to do, be, or say has had on them. I believe kids on the spectrum are all far more sensitive that the typical person, with a much thinner filter. Everything affects them far more than we realize. Things can easily be felt as a BOMBARDMENT.\u00a0  \n\n Disclaimer: I am NOT an RDI consultant. I am just this mom, weaving RDI into my household, modifying it along with our consultant, to best suit my own individual guy, my Fluffy. The things I am about to say may come as a shock to you--no! no! That\u2019s from another story. The things I am about to say here are what I\u2019ve said to parents who\u2019ve contacted me, wanting to know what they could do to get started. They like the sound of RDI but they are saving up for a conference or are on a waiting list for a consultant or are completely overwhelmed and isn\u2019t there anything I can say to help them find some footing? \n\n Well. Yes! And here it is. \n\n SLOOOOOOOOOOW DOWN For us, this was the most important thing BY FAR.\u00a0 Slow down. Slow down the pace of interaction, the rate of speech, the amount of things you are attempting to accomplish, and the length of time in which you are attempting to accomplish said thing. Become an under acheiver, in this regard. \n\n SIMPLIFY Simplify routines. Cut out all therapies/trips/ outings that don't feel essential. Simplify the home setting or at least one room or one section of a room so you have a place to play simple games with very little that distracts. TALK LESS This is huge regardless of how much language the child has. It's as critical for a child with few words as with guy like Fluffy with thousands. Use less words and utter them more slowly.  Don't feel you must turn into an automaton or speak\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 like\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0this\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 in\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 an\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0odd\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 way, but notice just how fast you might be speaking and how much you might be saying and try slowing it down as much as you can and still sound like yourself. Pause before you  begin  speaking. Add pauses  as  you speak. Before you answer a question or launch into an explanation (for those with more verbal kids) think about it, literally. Say, Hmmm, or, Huh, or, Ummmm. Make a face of thinking about it. Consider a way to answer the question or convey the information in the shortest, simplest way. Or even don\u2019t answer the question even if you know. Find the wonder in the question and respond from there. How does the freezer make ice.  Huh! Hmmm. I wonder.  Let there be space. See what happens. Don\u2019t fill in. \n\n Try looking at the clock and spending 15 or 20 minutes and resolve not to ask ONE question, just to see how it feels, just to see what other ways you could express what you want. It's not that asking questions is against the RDI law (!) but paying attention to how much of our communication IS imperative will help us shift to a more INVITATIONAL and less demanding mode of interaction. One substitution that I use a lot is the phrase, \u201cI wonder\u201d. I wonder what we could do next, or, I wonder how that works, or, I wonder if there are any sticks over there.  \n\n RDI is all about taking a child through the social developmental steps and stages they missed. It relies on years and years of research in child development and neurobiology. Our kids are DELAYED. If we can look at a child's social development and say, this 5 year old is socially at a 2 year old level, why not the same thing with communication? \n\n I know from listening to other RDI parents of nonverbal or very low-verbal kids that they make a true leap of faith when they switch to or start RDI since RDI doesn\u2019t \u2018teach\u2019 language. We didn\u2019t have that issue since Fluffy never stopped talking but the truth is, communication is not about how many WORDS a person has. You can watch an interaction between a parent and a one year old and see how much is communicated long before words are spoken by the child.\u00a0 One needs to see how language develops in the typical infant and toddler: tone, prosody, expression, gesture--these all come first, then receptive language, then a word or two, then syntactically INcorrect 2 or 3 word sentences. And all this happens gradually and, this is the most important part as far as RDI is concerned, it all develops in the CONTEXT OF RELATIONSHIP. Brain research has shown that this is extremely important in the laying down of new brain pathways, that is happens more dynamically, more quickly, more organically when it is done in the context of a  relationship .  \n\n NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION Use non verbal communication as much as possible without it being overly weird or creating undo anxiety. Nod you head for yes or even smile or thumbs up; shake you head or make a BIG frown for no; shrug shoulders for I don't know; make a VERY puzzled face when you aren't sure; open wide your mouth for surprise or astonishment. Overall, exaggerate facial expressions and body postures. Now, not ALL THE TIME like you\u2019re having a three stooges-a-thon, but throughout the day. This is a way to heighten the moment, refocus the attention, plant it back IN THE RELATIONSHIP between you two rather than in the WORDS being said or information being conveyed. \n\n EXPERIENCE SHARING LANGUAGE Shoot for about 80 % Experience Sharing language versus 20 % Imperative language, the ratio in typical kids and adults. Imperatives are any kind of communication that require an answer. Here are some examples off the top of my head: \n\n (1) What color is that?  (2) This boy looks.....? (for him to fill in the blank) (3) What's that?  (4) Tell me what you\u2019re doing?  (5) What did you do today? \n\n Experience sharing (ES) language is any communication that is about sharing an experience together, when you are talking about what matters to you, where what you are creating together is more important than a particular answer or outcome. So, in the above examples, ES alternatives might be: \n\n (1) I love that color!  (2) Gee, I wonder what that boy is feeling.  (3) Hey! That's cool!  (4) Wow. I am so interested in what you're building.  (5) This morning, I took a walk on the beach. \n\n That last one is a biggie. Fluffy often didn\u2019t answer those sort of questions, what did you do this morning, or this weekend, because he didn\u2019t remember or he wasn\u2019t sure what you meant, when this morning? What part of the morning? What part of the weekend? That\u2019s an eternity to a kid, especially one with autism. His perfectionism made it hard to answer because he didn\u2019t want to be wrong, or more to the point, because accuracy is important to him and if he couldn\u2019t be accurate, he ignored it.  When you share from your own life, it opens things up for him to share from his own life, and then  there can be no right or wrong. \n\n Remember that all sorts of short sounds and words are examples of Experience Sharing language. Uh oh! Hmm. Oops! Wow! Ahhh. Cool! Whoa! Yipee! Tadaa! And often, one of those is all the words you need.  \n\n PRODUCTIVE UNCERTAINTY Begin to think about the concept of productive uncertainty, which really means, acting in unexpected ways from time to time,\u00a0 doing the silly or goofy or 'wrong' thing to create moments of pleasant surprise and an opportunity for facial gazing, a self directed desire to look at someone\u2019s face to share pleasure or to get more information. You can have an OOPS! moment or a OH! SILLY MOMMY moment or Uh Oh! that's not what I meant! moment together.  \n\n Productive uncertainty example--at the grocery store, putting items from your cart onto the conveyer belt. You pass things to your child, he places them on the belt. (Or you pass things from the shelf to your child safely seated in the cart, he tosses them behind him in the basket.) After you have this pattern established, you do something unexpected, like casually hand him your shoe or your wallet and then, hopefully, he will stop, look at it and then at you and then you can hold his gaze in a silly moment of , oh, no, that's not right! maybe say, Oops! and then go back to handing him items from the cart. If all that sounds way out of your league at this point, just think of unexpected things you can do. Get in the back seat of the car with your child and pretend to drive, answer the banana when the phone rings, put your shoe on your head, put on your coat, call out Bye Bye and walk into the closet. \n\n It's the kind of thing you can play by ear, get the sense of what works for your child. For Fluffy, I had to make it seem as if sometimes I really did make a mistake, did and said the wrong thing, forgot something, used a spoon to cut the bread, etc. which helped him with perfectionism, helping him be around others doing things imperfectly so it took some of the sting out of his own need to do it all perfectly or not do it AT ALL. Sometimes I let on that I was being silly and it was just about sharing a laugh, but be careful that you don\u2019t get into entertaining FOR rather than sharing a moment BETWEEN. You also don\u2019t want to overdo the uncertainty and cause anxiety. The goal is to keep your child at his edge, on his \u2018toes\u2019 but in an alert and engaged way, not worried and off balance and certainly NOT afraid.\u00a0 My take on it is that it woke up Fluffy\u2019s OWN DESIRE to perk up to what will happen next. Little by little, and I do mean little by little, Fluffy is developing a tolerance for the unexpected, learning to not only be okay with it but to actually enjoy it, look for it, and create it himself. \n\n ANTICIPATORY MOMENT Look for ways to spotlight the anticipatory moment. When I first heard that I was all, wha--? But it\u2019s actually very straight forward. Spotlight just means underline, pull a moment out and help it to be noticed, slow down, pause, exaggerate your expression. The anticipatory moment is simply the moment BEFORE something happens. The moment BEFORE you pull the item out of the bag, the moment BEFORE you turn the page in the book to find out where the funny rabbit is going, the moment BEFORE you blow the bubbles, the moment BEFORE you let go of the balloon and send it flying through the air. Think of how you are naturally with an infant. Think of your pace, your tone, the way your voice lilts and hesitates. Think of the way you use repetition, as pattern formation and not as STATIC systems, you do almost the same thing but not quite, there is variation but subtle, like a sweet, slow moving game. Think of the faces you make, how big they are, how long you hold them, think of the way your simplify your body language and your movements. Think of playing This Little Piggy and the moment BEFORE the last little piggy goes wee wee wee all the way home! \n\n Now, I\u2019m not saying you ought to be doing this  exactly  with your child, as if they were an infant. But just  think  of it. There is a reason we all do the same thing with infants and toddlers. We are naturally going at the pace they need to take it in, to learn about patterns and relating, about communication and back and forth of interaction.  \n\n I  am  saying, very simple games are wonderful ways to work on the basics of RDI. Hide and Seek, Peek a Boo, This Little Piggy, any lap songs where you sit your child on your lap facing you and do something that has a surprise in it that you can slow down and help them anticipate. Fluffy and I play a game I got from an RDI mom. We call it,  Here Comes .\u00a0 You sit face to face, or sit over your child as they lie on the floor facing up at you. You say, gently, expectantly, \u201cHere comes a...\u201d and DRAW out that moment, the moment BEFORE you say the next word, with a smile, raised eyebrows, soft inhale, letting him/her know something nice is coming, but...what? Keep the words and things simple and sweet. I do,\u00a0 Here comes a...kiss! Here comes a...raspberry! Here comes an...eskimo kiss! Here comes a...piggy all the way home! Fluffy loves it!  \n\n We also have races all over the house. I\u2019ll say, Let\u2019s race to the...(draw it out!) BEDROOM! and then we'd take off to the bedroom. Next: To the...FRONT DOOR! To the...BATHROOM! You can toss in a little productive uncertainty and say, To the...BATHROOM! when you are already standing right there. Oops! Silly me! We\u2019re already here! Fluffy loves to run so he was highly motivated to play this game when we first started and still is. It\u2019s worked through the stages too. Stage 1 is Emotion Sharing so it was all about having fun with each other. Stage 2 is Referencing so he had to watch me to know when to start--he could only go when I smiled or nodded my head. Stage 3, where we are now, is Coordinating Actions so now we try to get to our destination as a team, at the same time. \n\n RDI is really  a way of being  with your child. It's more about adopting a certain communication style then employing descrete moments of therapy, and when you do that, it builds trust. I don\u2019t know about anyone else, but whenever I focus on trying to get Fluffy to DO something, when I am attached to the outcome and TASK,\u00a0 it is a major NO WIN situation. He feels it and resists and I get more tense. We are at the threshold of a power struggle or at the very center of one. Now, there are times when you have to pull out the stops, safety, health, boundaries. Yes to all of that. But I\u2019m talking about putting the relationship first. Everything is done in the context of the relationship. That is where the action is, BETWEEN us, not IN the activity or the object or in the skill or script.  \n\n RDI stands for Relationship Development Intervention, after all.\u00a0 It is about slow and gradual change. They call it a marathon not sprint. It's hard to trust that at first when we want so much to see progress for our child but the thing is, you DO start seeing progress early on and that builds confidence and the motivation to continue. And then you can start to relax, to let go of the emergency, to rediscover your instincts and ground as a parent.   \n\n I know I\u2019ve said a mouthful. I\u2019ll stop now and leave you with this: start with looking at what you already do in your day to day life that you might RDI-ify. Everything can be done in an RDI way once you get that it is a mindset more than anything else. That\u2019s what we did, long before we started doing specific activities with Fluffy. And we could feel the change right away. \n\n Good luck. \n\n NOW, GO VOTE! \n\n Paragraph \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0I drove home in a trance--my head to one side, my right arm on the wheel, my left limp in my lap, like from a stroke. I felt nothing. I was beyond feeling. All feelings were under great walls of cement. I drove past Tabor Field and looked at the naked trees without blinking, the dark black trunks dancing silently against the grayish blue sky. The silhouettes stark, exposed.   \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Cecil was on the porch as I drove up. He watched the truck approach warily, tail twitching. It was just getting dark. Once inside, he jumped on the kitchen table and loudly meowed. I wondered if I fed him that day. Or the day before. I refilled his water dish.\u00a0 I grabbed his bag of food and unfolded the top. It slipped to the floor by his dish and fell on its side. Little brown and red X\u2019s scattered out. I left them there and walked up the stairs to crawl into bed still wrapped in my coat and scarf, not knowing if I\u2019d shut the front door. I didn\u2019t get up to check. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_7_getti.html", "title": "PPP Day 7 - Getting Started with RDI"},

This means I will be exposing my poo poo writings to you for thirty days straight. Why would I do such a thing? Am I hell bent on driving you all away to snicker into your collective and virtual sleeves? Well, er, no. But I believe it will take the heat off.  \n\n Really. It\u2019s about the writing, writing better by being willing to write badly. Sometimes very badly. I, for one, am loosening the choke hold of perfectionism and tossing her into the fiery flames or at least a few feet away so I can get a little elbow room. \n\n Picture \n\n Fluffy, mugging after eating Halloween candy. \n\n Post \n\n Yesterday... \n\n ...we baked pumpkin pie from scratch. Fluffy surprised me by eating his entire second piece with the fork he usually reserves for setting up catapults. \n\n ...Fluffy trick or treated and then came home to dispense candy, standing on the front porch with the door wide open, hawking our wares like so,  Hey everybody, come on over here! We have three jack-o-lanterns! We have scary music! We have a great selection of candy! You can take three each! I have already eaten my five candies for the night but Mommy and Daddy may let me have one more but they aren't sure yet but they're going to decide soon! \n\n ...I discovered there is a plan to make mastectomies an outpatient procedure. Yes. Drive-through mastectomies. Geez. It\u2019s not a friggin\u2019 chemical peel, people! WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING A BREAST! Go  here  and register your support to re-establish some sanity. \n\n Paragraph \n\n I was sure something woke me that first time though when I sat up to listen, there was nothing. Not the noises old houses make when the floorboards settle or tree branches scrape up against the single pane glass. Not even the sound of Marty breathing through the back of his nose beside me on the futon; he wasn\u2019t there. I didn\u2019t see the light on under the door to his study; I didn\u2019t hear him downstairs checking the wood stove or eating the leftover Portabella and watercress pasta standing up in front of the fridge. But, that wouldn\u2019t be his style. He\u2019d have to heat it up and set a place at the table, hold his fork in his left and knife in his right, cut and scoop, press the bite together with both utensils and deposit it into his mouth without ever stopping to switch hands. As they do in Paris. Not as they do in the Bronx, at least not while he was growing up.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vickiforman.com/", "http://www.lifetimetv.com/breastcancer/petition/signpetition.php"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_1.html", "title": "PPP Day 1 - The Kick-Off"},
{"date": "October 30, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n I love Halloween. My family always rallied beautifully for the art project, dad manning the paper mache station, mom at the sewing machine. We had some of the most elaborate costumes. I wish I had saved them. Dad would come out with us, dressed in some complimentary way, and then race home to pour puffed rice in his mouth, scotch tape his face into hideous wrinkles, tease his hair into knots, and club foot to the door where he would scare the pants off the little kids in the neighborhood.  \n\n Last year, I blew the dust off my sewing machine and made my best  Foo . I scampered down the block, delivering GFCF candy ahead of time so Fluffy could trick or treat with the rest of the kids. Everyone kindly did the sleight of hand and Fluffy was none the wiser. He raced around in his Foo costume, oblivious to his startling resemblance to a blueberry KKK-er and the missing ingredients in his candy stash. We raced behind him, snapping photos.  \n\n This year, I couldn't get a handle on Fluffy's costume idea: The Lifestar, the good guy version of the Star Wars Death Star. Each time I asked him about it, the complications magnified to such a degree that I fell into a fog until 15 minutes before we were due at the Halloween parade and cider bash (yes! we got invited to a party!). I can't say I did my family proud but I did manage to whip together a lab coat: Marshall's sale rack, construction paper and a glue gun. Voil\u00e1! Dr. Fluffy!  \n\n \n\n \n\n We're no longer GFCF so this year we're going to wing it. Wish us luck.  \n\n Oh, and Happy Halloween to all! \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/happy_halloween.html", "title": "Happy Halloween"},
{"date": "November 02, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t A Picture, a post, and a paragraph. Day 2. \n\n Hey! I'm doing it! I'm getting up early and writing. I haven't quite got my 3340--I'm up to 3305--but tonight is mommy's night out and I'm planning to glue myself to the keyboard and get ahead.  \n\n Picture  \n\n View from the car; out west, September 1999. \n\n Post I see differently now. I see a little one on the beach going round and round and round with his rake, entranced by the patterns in the sand, oblivious to his dad\u2019s efforts to join in. I see the child at the zoo, crouching down, holding his hands by his ears, begging to go back, go back, go back. I see kids at the park with that internal gaze, climbing like it was an item on their to-do list, walking through packs of kids, waving them aside as if they were a cloud of flies.  \n\n On my recent trip to NYC to see Kapoor's  Sky Mirror , my sister and I passed a boy slumped over his game boy. His mom called to him and he flew into a rage, jumping up, shouting about the level his was on, how he was this close to winning, etc. etc. My sister and I exchanged looks. Whew, what a brat, she said. Hmm, I bet he\u2019s got Aspergers, I thought. \n\n Maybe he didn\u2019t. Maybe I was wrong about the girl on the beach, the boy at the zoo, the kids at the park. Who am I to say? All I know is, after the last two years, I  see  differently. \n\n Yesterday, Fluffy and I went to park in a different township. It\u2019s a great park with lots of climbing structures, balance beams, ramps, and slides. We usually go through it together but this time, Fluffy ran up a big ramp toward two older boys playing a particularly elaborate game at the other end and kept running until he got to them.  What are you playing?  Fluffy cheerfully asked. They ignored him. I looked at the mom standing close, looking up at them. I recognized the pose. \n\n Fluffy passed them came down the slide and then something happened with the boys I didn\u2019t see. Fluffy asked something and the boy yelled at him. There was something about the tone, something sharp, something slightly out of the ordinary that I recognized. Aspergers, I thought. The mom immediately intervened, making a very exaggerated expression of no, a big frown, slow shake of the head, side to side. Oh. She\u2019s doing RDI.  \n\n Fluffy ran off again. The park was very busy, quite a few kids of all ages were gathered at the pirate ship climber, going up and down, sliding, crawling, racing, falling. It was wild and chaotic and Fluffy spent about 10 minutes running around, stopping, watching, starting up again, before he came over to me and said,  I\u2019m trying to join the game but I can\u2019t find a way in ! By this time, I had befriended the mom and discovered, indeed, her two boys 9 and 11, had Aspergers, and indeed, she had begun RDI in September. At her suggestion, her older son called to Fluffy and helped him  find a way in . And then I watched as Fluffy engaged with the pack for another 10 minutes of wild activity before they all began to disperse. \n\n Wait! What did I say?  Fluffy tried and tried to join the game and then played with the pack for 10 minutes!  My Fluffy. \n\n There was some roughhousing all around. Fluffy joined in but no more so than others. In fact, less than quite a few of them. I didn\u2019t get involved. I almost did but the other mom stopped me. They\u2019re okay, she said. She stood and watched with me. We traded stories and phone numbers, each breaking off from time to time until we again had our child in sight. It was nice to be with someone who got it.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n She saw differently too.  \n\n I realized, I have no idea how kids play together, from this perspective. I babysat scores of kids in my teens, taught tiny tots in music and movement classes, but when it comes to the day to day of what kids do when they\u2019re working it out together, what I am meant to do or not do as the mom, I am clueless. I\u2019ve had no practice. It\u2019s been the Fluffy and me show and that\u2019s all I know.  \n\n We\u2019re learning.  \n\n Paragraph \n\n\n\n \u00a0   I got to the tracks and jogged in place. I was wheezing, my side killing me, stabbing into my ribs like a hook. My face felt red, my nose was running. I was peeing in my pants. I should have stuck in a panty liner. What happened to me? What happened to my life? How did I get here so quickly? I\u2019ve been nowhere, done nothing except for that one trip to France with Marty that we\u2019re still paying for on a credit card that we\u2019re no longer allowed to use. That was our only decent vacation, making up for the honeymoon we never took but it couldn\u2019t live up to the time Marty was there alone, sewing his oats, going from town to town, the Romantic American, picking grapes for the wine harvest with the real country folk. I could never live up to that time. I tried to be European but mostly I felt farty and bloated. My glasses broke the first day there and I had to secure the temple with tape. White tape. I might as well have been carrying an oxygen tank with those long feeder tubes poking out my nostrils for how stylish and hip I felt. Oh Marty. He\u2019s all plans but nothing pans out. He\u2019s got a good brain and some good raw materials but it never gets formed into anything, like the prep plates on a cooking show without the beautiful pans they pull out of the oven at the end. Why am I waiting for him to do it for me? Why don\u2019t I just do it myself?  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.publicartfund.org/pafweb/projects/06/kapoor/kapoor-06.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_2.html", "title": "PPP Day 2 - Seeing Differently"},

I love the connection I've made with those of you who stop by from time to time and share your thoughts and stories. Every comment is a little party for me. Every single one is meaningful. I've made real friends, been directed to beautiful blogs, had lively email exchanges from out of the blue with all sorts of wonderful people, people I've 'met' for the first time when I open their mail, people who are out there walking in their own tall grass from time to time.  \n\n This morning I got an email from one such person, a musician named Jamie Manning who's put together the CD,  What Remains: Song about parents raising children with autism .  Jamie and his wife are raising a son with autism, a son about Fluffy's age. One of his goals in getting this music out there is to  raise money to \"help families get better insurance, more effective laws, and higher standards of care\" for their children.  We're lucky. Our school system, for now, pays for our RDI consultant and our weekly OT sessions. We have a bit of savings that pays for our current homeschooling curriculum and supplies, supplements, enzymes, vitamins, babysitting help and our past forays into RDI workshops, Neurofeedback, Floortime, and my initial week at the Son-Rise Institute. For now, I don't have to go out there into the workforce and rustle up some extra cash at night or on the weekends like many of the other moms I know. We have insurance that covers, essentially NONE of what we've done over the last couple of years. The premiums and out of pocket are through the roof; they raise them every other month with the same grasp on reality as Fluffy when we play grocery store and he charges me ten dollars for a single egg. But, okay. We have  some  insurance; if any of us need to be housed in intensive care being fed through a tube in our neck after being crushed by a fallen I-Beam, we're set, unless of course, the I-Beam clause has been voted out at the last meeting of pencil necks. But I digress. Go listen to some songs. I especially love  You Are Welcome Here .

It is a sign of changing times that we even attempt such a thing as Sunday family project time, that we have the focus to gather and rustle up something more than a pile of poopy undies. Up until very recently, a big project for me was getting the toothpaste out of my hair.  \n\n But there it is. We gathered again for the Sunday family project to make our door blessing. For Fluffy, it was all about the glue gun. He glued every item with relish and would have happily gone on, brandishing that glue gun hither and yon had it not been for the four foot cord. Oh. And the scalding hot tip.  \n\n We all selected a few items from a big basket of gathered items on the kitchen table, our altar, if you will. Dave put periwinkle shells from our trip to Maine above the corn stalks, dubbing them 'the eyes of adventure.' Fluffy sat a black puppy fashioned out of playdough in a pool of glue on a bed of flattented corn stalks. I made a plane, representing our big trip to Arizona last spring which Fluffy immediately took from me to amend. He said it looked like a shark (it did) and handed it back much improved. \n\n We glued moonstones, sea glass, and acorns; we hung a bean pod (from his weekly playdate friend!) a corn necklace, apple slices, and a spray of oak leaves. We stuck sprigs of holly from our front yard willy-nilly across the top and then piereced the whole thing with a bunch of seagull feathers from our many trips to the beach this summer.  \n\n No one was on the design team.  \n\n Fluffy hung it by the front door.  \n\n I think it has magic powers. Tonight, Dave put Fluffy to bed while I was in the house. Did you hear? While I was home! In the flesh! In my own office, typing away at my computer! There were no discussions or debates. There was no drama.\u00a0 It was just a daddy, going through the bedtime routine with his son. Brushing teeth, getting into pjs, reading stories, lights out, cuddling, songs and then zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Dave came out of the room with the widest grin I've ever seen, slapped his hands together, and said,  Yup. Put the boy to bed. Me. That's right. I did it.

{"date": "October 16, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t It took me a long time to get my bearings at Ground Zero. I never spent huge amounts of time that far downtown other than to make my way to teach the little kids in my Battery Park City Music Together class or shop at Century 21 or weave in and out on my bike, passing through on my way to the river.  \n\n I had been out of the city for over four years when the planes hit. I was 7 months into mothering my colicky baby, wondering what I would give Dave for his birthday the next morning. I was actually on the phone enjoying a rare moment of calm while Fluffy ate his fists and stared off into the seventh dimension. Dave came upstairs and said, A plane just hit the World Trade Tower, and I thought,  whatever, please, I\u2019m on the phone and our son isn\u2019t screaming! don\u2019t distract me with petty news of tiny planes getting tangled in roof top radio poles! \n\n And then he came back to say that a second plane hit the other tower. \n\n Standing at Ground Zero under the brilliantly blue sky in lower Manhattan on Saturday, I finally did get my bearings but the disorientation remained. I kept looking up. It was real life, digitally manipulated. The towers, those massive buildings. Gone. How could it be?  \n\n The entire area is now a construction site; work on the new structures and skylines officially began in August. Maybe because I didn\u2019t lose anyone that day, because I don\u2019t know anyone who worked or lived near those buildings, that\u2019s how it felt to me: like a construction site.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until I was inside the temporary home of the World Trade Center Visitor Center that I experienced the emotional impact of standing steps from that devastation. \n\n When you first enter the Visitor Center, you see a model of the twin towers, white, rising up. It stands in the center of the room surrounded by three murals depicting the sweeping views south, southeast and southwest--lots of sky and water, lots of open space. Images of people moving flow through and illuminate a horizontal section of the towers. There is some history, some footage from that day, some stills, a chunk of the building itself, and what looks to be a replication of the wall that became saturated with pictures and flyers posted by the relatives and loved ones of those missing in the days following the collapse.\u00a0  \n\n The exhibits are simple and beautifully done. There\u2019s a room, nearly empty save a floor to ceiling photo collage of the people who died that day and a center table graced with kleenex boxes. Another room has more kleenex next to pads of paper on which visitors have written and continue to write and draw messages to those gone and pin them to the walls. There were quite a few children\u2019s drawings of pierced and flaming towers, a stick figure calling from the ground,  I love you, daddy , and  I miss you, daddy  in a shaky talk balloons.  \n\n For me--I imagine for everyone--that those buildings fell to the ground and then effectively disappeared with all they contained is something I am unable to process. It is inconceivable. Even after five years of seeing the pictures and footage, the river of debris and smoke and pulverized material raging through the streets, image after image of shocked and terrified eyes looking through thick blankets of ash, bodies covered, the space all around them and up up up, white, gray, black. More than 200 stories of desks and phones and books and wood and metal and porcelain, thousands of people with flesh and bones and souls and stories, made particulate, replacing air, erasing the line between solid ground and sky above, suffocating the streets. \n\n\n\n There are many quotations interspersed throughout the exhibit, one by someone blown out of his shoes and hundreds of feet away when the buildings fell, one by someone likening the aftermath to the quiet covering of a snowstorm. They are all powerful but there was one that took my breath way, about the aftermath, about the dense material suspended and hovering in the air.\u00a0 I wrote it down to make sure I remembered exactly: \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe are breathing the dead \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 taking them into our lungs  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 as living  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 we had taken them into our arms.\u201d \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0 Hettie Jones, NYC Poet \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/ground_zero.html", "title": "Ground Zero"},
{"date": "October 20, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy\u2019s been singing up a storm lately. We all have. I\u2019ve been attempting to mark transitions in our day the  Enki  way, with songs and verse rather than announcements. I have a ways to go but I see Fluffy\u2019s already gotten the hang of it. He knows the blessing songs we sing at meal times, the verse before morning snack, the song to call him to our daily movement circle, the bell and song that announces story time, the rest time song, the tune I hum at dreaded teeth brushing time, our bedtime song, and a long list of others we are learning week by week from a few different sources.  \n\n A few nights ago, I was lying in the dark with Fluffy at bedtime, staring up at the glow-in-the-dark stars while doing my best to give him Reiki energy, as I do every night now since the Reiki workshop a few weeks ago, when he started to sing in his sincere falsetto: \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 If the people lived each life \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As if it were a song for singing out the light \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Provide the music for the stars \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To be dancing circles in the night \n\n I didn\u2019t remember teaching him that song. It felt mystical, as if he was channeling, the way  Neale Walsch  channeled God in the  Conversations with God  books or Esther Hicks channels the collective consciousness,  Abraham , in a whole series of books on, essentially, how each one of us is God.  \n\n He sang it a few times and then I remembered it was a Russian Peace Song from the  Naturally You Can Sing  series we listened to before dinner one night last week. A simple beautiful song, like a prayer. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0If the people lived each life \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As if it were a song for singing out the light \n\n Enki Education, the homeschooling curriculum we're using, talks about how children absorb everything around them. Everything sinks in. They are imprinted by their world, what they hear, see, feel, what WE feel. Fluffy is no different. For all the time he didn\u2019t look up or answer when spoken to or respond to his name or seem to notice what was going on right in front of his face, I am convinced that it all sunk in. All of it. Now that he does look up, answer when called, and reference in almost every situation, it\u2019s less of a stretch for others to imagine he\u2019s taking in his surroundings but he always was. There is a difference. I believe he is processing differently, integrating and using the information differently, and I think a large part of that has to do with  RDI . But I\u2019m sure it also has to do with Enki. \n\n There\u2019s something about the singing and simple movements, something that is happening within him and within our day that is both tangible and invisible. I keep stopping as I type right now to feel the air with my fingers, trying to find  it  so I can put it into words. It\u2019s like the singing and moving is creating a fabric, a lyrical structure and support that gathers and, sorry, but yes, aligns and directs vibration and information to seep in where it resonates and organizes. \n\n It reminds me of the difference between Fluffy\u2019s attempts at drawing and his whole demeanor when forming something in three dimensions, like clay or even beeswax which we used for the first time this week. This is a guy who still mostly scribbles wild rocket flames around and around the page. But when I warmed up our brightly colored wax, he coralled the clumps to private corner, saying,  Don\u2019t look! Don\u2019t look!  and then stepped back five minutes later to reveal this: \n\n \n\n By Fluffy; October, 2006: tiger, red robin on a tree next to a rock, white duck swimming on blue pond.  \n\n\n\n I think the singing and dancing is bringing things into more dimensions for him, so he can hold it, form it, make sense of it. Like that sweet song of peace, it seems to be providing the music for his own dancing in the night.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.enkieducation.org/", "http://www.cwg.org/main.php?p=Neale", "http://www.amazon.com/Conversations-God-Uncommon-Dialogue-Book/dp/0399142789", "http://www.halexandria.org/dward777.htm", "http://www.naturallyyoucansing.com/", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/singing.html", "title": "Singing"},

At times like those, it\u2019s enough to feel the embrace inside my chest and revel in his ease.\n\n \n\n We\u2019re still working on Stage 3, Coordinating Actions. At the farm, we marched together, raced together, rolled pumpkins together, carried our selections to the wagon, pulled the wagon, heaved our pumpkins on the scale for the great weigh-in and lugged them to the car. There was also time to watch the apple press but I noticed after Fluffy witnessed the full cycle of washing, loading, and cutting the apples, spreading the mush in layers and pressing out the juice, he said, \u201cOkay. I get it.\u201d and moved on to something new. There was a time when he would have been campaigning to camp overnight with that press or purchase it for his home use so he could study every mechanical turn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n This weekend we went in search of milkweed pods, the subject of one or our new circle songs. We found one, closed in on its own secrets and gathered it along with other fall treasures, all browning, opening, sending parachuted seeds into the Autumn breezes. We wove them into the twine of our very first nature frame. Behold: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n The best part of the weekend for me was after our hike at the marsh and before our family project, as we were leaving the playground, RDI-style. Fluffy and I ran to a picnic table, ready, set, go! climbed on opposite benches that flanked the table and walked to the end, staying synchronized and coordinated. At the end, we jumped off in unison and then raced to the next picnic table. There were seven of them in a long row.  \n\n\n\n We did the whole circuit; Fluffy stayed with me beautifully, looking over and making adjustments when necessary, but more than that, smiling up at me, laughing as we jumped and climbed and ran. At the end, we zoomed a zig-zag figure eight around pine trees and made our way to the big park sign, holding out our hands in front of us, our arms straight, preparing to touch all fingers on the cool metal surface. We did it! Yay! High fives! The \u2018exercise\u2019 was done and now it was time for Fluffy\u2019s favorite part--the race to the car. For the first time ever, rather than whiz by me to arrive alone and victorious, he slowed himself down to stay with me, to coordinate with me,  \u201cso we could get there together, Mom.\u201d  Doing it together was more important than winning.  \n\n Wow.  \n\n We may still be in Stage 3 but as I type this, Stage 4 is ready to peek its nose over the horizon. I can feel it.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/a_brief_glimpse.html", "title": "A bit of RDI"},

{"date": "October 06, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t  I love  this book . I opened to Mabon, the Autumn Equinox, and was immediately inspired by the activities. In keeping with our focus on rhythm, I've dubbed Sunday our weekly family craft day, when will focus on one seasonal project each week. Here's what's currently on the schedule: \n\n Corn necklaces  Door Blessings  Talking Stick Jack O'Lanterns Dream Pillow Nature Frame \n\n I'll try to post as we go. We made our corn necklaces last Sunday.  \n\n It was so easy! Buy decorative corn. There are some beautiful colors from which to choose: blacks,\nwhites, yellows, deep purples, reds, oranges. They look like garnets\nand other exotic semi-precious stones.Twist off the kernels (it helps to break the dried cobs in half) into a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, then let soak for at least a few hours. I did it in the morning and let them soak all day. When you're ready to string, dry them off and string away. We used dental floss for thread and special kid needles I purchased for Fluffy that are sharp enough to pierce but not exceptionally pointy. They look like short embroidery needles.  One hint : string the necklace longer than you need. The kernels flatten out as they dry and so the overall length of the 'beaded' section decreases significantly.    \n\n \n\n  Fluffy, adorned by his corn necklace, as he presents my birthday card. \n\n Today we made apple star prints using the simple directions at the back of the book,  Apples, Apples, Apples  (which by the way, has a delicious recipe for homemade apple sauce; we whipped up a batch last week and ate every bite). In the middle of stamping our halved and inked apple chunks, Fluffy veered off on his own project: making me a card for my birthday card which is tomorrow. This was huge for him, huge in so many ways. He came up with the  idea , the  design , and did  all the writing . HUGE! Perhaps the single biggest thing was that he allowed it to be 'good enough'!! Right there on the front were scribbled out mistakes. No matter. He raced about ( don't look! ) and handed the finished product to me in a red ( for love, mom ) envelope with M-O-M carefully printed across the front. The inside was inscribed with more letters and hearts and designs and a few games ( find the hidden letters! ).  \n\n \n\n Fluffy's card to me!  \n\n We also cut apple slices for drying to adorn our door blessing. I sliced; Fluffy did the rest on his own. He poked every hole, threaded every string, and tied every knot. Again, anyone who's been playing along will note this is like casually mentioning that I performed reconstructive surgery on my neighbor's fish-bitten ear. I didn't. Perform that. But he did. Get bitten by a fish. The neighbor.   \n\n \n\n Apple star slices drying . \n\n Last weekend while I was getting attuned to receiving the mysterious and healing power of the universe, Fluffy eagerly attended the local harvest fair with Dave and walked straight for the face painting table. Behold: \n\n \n\n Fluffy affecting a gruff tiger face. \n\n Last year, he barely endured the sensory challenge of having a minuscule green spider painted on his cheek--his choice. Once it was completed, he instantly began to panic and writhe, begging for it's immediate removal. This year, he stood quietly and patiently still as his face was  covered  in this sticky wet tiger face and then begged to  sleep  in it.  \n\n Finally, there is this: last Christmas, Fluffy's  Aunt Annie  gave him Ed Emberley's wonderful,  Drawing Book of Animals . We broke it out recently and leafed through the pages. Emberley shows you how you can draw little animals with only a few simple lines, letters, and shapes, and I do mean, A FEW. He lays it out, step by step, and arrives at sweet line drawings of birds, fish, worms, gradually building up to more complicated characters. I drew one of the simple ones, all the while modeling imperfection as I oops! made a mistake! started over! made due! went out of the lines! Fluffy didn't want a turn, but I noticed he started taking that book on short car trips, balancing it on his lap alongside his magnadoodle. \n\n The other day after  double-doodling  on our big blackboard in the playroom, he erased with a flourish and began to demonstrate, step by step, how to make a fish, Fluffy-style. Again, behold: \n\n \n\n Fluffy's instructions going right to left in orange; my rendition in green. \n\n I tell you, it's harvest time in our household. And the crop is rich and warm and good. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Celebrating-Great-Mother-Earth-Honoring-Activities/dp/0892815507", "http://www.amazon.com/Apples-Nancy-Elizabeth-Wallace/dp/0761451811/sr=1-1/qid=1160188755/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4736499-6307148?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.anamaria.typepad.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/Ed-Emberleys-Drawing-Book-Animals/dp/0316234753", "http://www.infinitematters.com/braingym.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/crafty_projects.html", "title": "Harvest Time"},
{"date": "September 22, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Last night we ate apple crisp by candlelight. We talked about saying goodbye to summer and welcoming fall. We drank chamo-mint tea, Fluffy\u2019s favorite, with a bit of maple syrup, and listened to The Spirit Song from  Sing a Song of Seasons . We put it on a loop at Fluffy\u2019s suggestion and the repetition was pleasing, the steady drum beat in the song low and rhythmic like a heartbeat. I carried a long stemmed candlestick to the bathroom where we brushed teeth by the flickering light then placed it on the bedside table when it was time for stories. \n\n Instead of reading, we talked about mother earth, about giving thanks, about what we might collect on the next morning\u2019s walk as an offering to her for all that she does for us.  \n\n We also talked about the Rosh Hashanah, at least what we know, which is pretty sketchy. Dave is jewish but, he\u2019s the kind of guy that got barmitzvah\u2019d and then ordered a BLT at the celebration lunch with the family. I think it goes without saying, we only have one set of plates and cookware. Fluffy was fascinated by being half jewish, even though he won\u2019t be considered really jewish in the eyes of the law. He said, \u201cDaddy, tell me everything you know about Jewish.\u201d It was a short conversation.  \n\n Fluffy's face was soft and calm as he watched the dancing light of the candle flames. \u201cWow. It's beautiful, mom. They look so cool.\"   \n\n Today we\u2019ll try our hand at corn necklaces, maybe even a door blessing. Tonight we\u2019ll light candles again, give thanks, eat the warm apples that Fluffy and I will bake. We\u2019ll sing Goodbye Summer from  this same book . We\u2019ll light two separate candles for the new year and blow horns from Fluffy\u2019s music box since, right now, we don\u2019t have any  shofars  handy. \n\n The Enki materials talk of rhythm as something that is there to support you in your day--not like a schedule that you impose from the top down, but a framework that grows from the bottom up. It is compared to the breath: there is an in breath, an out breath, and a pause in between. The in breath can be thought of as an expansion, the out as a contraction and the pause as a transition between the two. All three are necessary. They say, try breathing in in in or out out out or in and then out again and again without space in between and you will quickly feel what they suggest you are feeling when your day is out of step with your natural rhythms, with your need for open freeform movements, for focused, detailed work, and for transitions in between. \n\n I love fall, the colors and crispness, dressing in layers. I love summer, being wrapped in the sun\u2019s warmth, splashing in the sea, but I\u2019ve never marked the fall equinox before this year. I\u2019ve stepped from summer to fall without much more than a passing glance at the calendar. This time, I\u2019m pausing and none of it feels odd to me; it feels lovely and rich, like a space that was waiting for us to step into.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.naturallyyoucansing.com/books/seasons.htm", "http://www.naturallyyoucansing.com/books/seasons.htm", "http://www.holidays.net/highholydays/shofar.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/09/a_space_to_step.html", "title": "A space to step into"},

{"date": "September 21, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m trying something new. \n\n I\u2019m going to post every day on our emerging Enki rhythm. I\u2019m feeling my way around in the dark here. I have STACKS of materials and STACKS of notebooks on everything under the Enki sun but even though I\u2019ve read through it I\u2019m still all, huh? \n\n Not entirely but yes, somewhat. I mean, I can\u2019t suddenly turn all groovy and homeschooly, softly humming songs while I braid my leg hair and craft dolls out of sanity napkins. I can\u2019t put ON a persona. I\u2019m still going to be Kyra, singing,  \u201cThese straws are made for sucking. And that\u2019s just what they\u2019ll do. One of these days those straws are gonna suck all over you\u201d  while I cabbage patch around the table and Fluffy slowly slurps his yogurt fruit shake and regards me out of the corner of his eye. Why? Because it\u2019s in the movement and verse songbook? Because I\u2019m marking a transition? No. Because I\u2019m not spending enough time with the grown ups.  \n\n But also because that\u2019s just the way I am. Sometimes I throw away plastic bottles. Sometimes I don\u2019t scrub all the black bean smooze out of the bottom of the can. Sometimes I let the water run while I do the dishes. We have some plastic toys. I serve salami. I drink me the coffee.  \n\n Those are just stereotypes anyway--the homeschooling vegan earth mama baking bread while nursing and churning butter with her foot--the churning with her foot, not the\u00a0  nursing . \n\n Okay. So what are we doing? Two things to start: morning family walk and an after lunch rest time for Fluffy, on his own in his room. Two anchors in the day. When this was suggested, I did this sort of hiccup-snort. Fluffy\u2019s idea of a hike is hanging onto my arm as I half-drag him the 20 feet to the car. To be fair, sometimes he walks to the stroller where he climbs in with his toasted garlic bialey and a glider plane which he later directs us to fly this way and that. As for rest? Fluffy\u2019s idea of being on his own is climbing onto my lap while I\u2019m sitting on the toilet.  \n\n But you know what? It\u2019s working. The nearby beach has dropped its no dog restriction and so we all pile into the car with the hyperactive 6 month-old labradoodle puppy, Beegu, and walk along the glistening shoreline. And after lunch, I set the visual timer in Fluffy\u2019s room and he goes in there and listens to a book on tape. I started out at 30 minutes; we\u2019re up to 50. It\u2019s like a miracle. I get things done while my son is in my care. I cannot tell you how astounding this is! Sometimes I even crawl into bed and watch the ceiling fan make light patterns on the ceiling. I can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve had such a good time.  \n\n And my son has taken to this instantly. He\u2019s saying things like,  Mom, I\u2019d like to listen to this at my rest time,  and,  Is it time for rest?  and,  Let\u2019s do that after rest today.  It makes me feel a teeny bit like an idiot, like he's been on the phone with other kids, complaining about his inept mom and his formless days and his lack of adequate quiet time.  \n\n\n\n Today Dave is taking Fluffy on the morning walk while I go to the radiologist for a repeat mammogram--the left breast. This I hate. I hate getting\u00a0 a call from the radiologist. As far as I\u2019m concerned, what you want to hear from a radiologist is nothing. Not a peep. \n\n At rest time, perhaps our new storytape,\u00a0  The Third Ear by Johnny Moses , will have arrived and I can set that timer to 55.

{"date": "September 25, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy never crawled. He pulled himself up at seven months, let go at eight months and started walking at nine. At one point in our quest for better sleep--for him, for all of us, I took him to an osteopath, a dreadful woman who pronounced doom and gloom for his future based on this not crawling, everything from him being eternally perplexed by the equation 1+1= to his developing a mustache and a bristly, arrogant manner with his body work patients--oops! That was her!  \n\n Well, I guess she had a point. If anyone out there has a walking child who never crawled, I would start inserting fun crawling activities throughout the day straight away. If they\u2019re asleep, crawl in there right now a make hand and knee tracks all around the house. \n\n That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re crawling everywhere. We\u2019re crawl happy. \n\n This is per the new chiropractor. I\u2019ve taken Fluffy to see him for the last couple of weeks and it\u2019s scratching a huge sensory integration itch. He took after one look at Fluffy walking down the hall and said, \u201cDid he ever crawl? (pause) I thought not. It\u2019s big, you know that, right?\u201d\u00a0 My son doesn\u2019t swing his arms when he walks. He doesn\u2019t march, skip, or crawl. He does a mean spider walk on hands and feet but he gets going so fast, there\u2019s no cross-action. He doesn\u2019t cross the midline and so the two sides of his brains aren\u2019t getting much of a chance to catch up. \n\n The chiropractor does adjustments that are oh-so gentle but oh-so effective. It\u2019s funny to me that something so subtle could be doing anything at all but each week when we leave, there is a very obvious shift in my son.  \n\n Last week we walked out of his office and a few paces down the street to the health food store to get me a cup of coffee and him a treat. As I was sipping, Fluffy wheeled a kid's size shopping cart over and asked if it was okay for him to shop for some things on his own. This was a first. The store is very small, the people are very laid-back, and it was nearly empty in there, so I said yes.  \n\n I watched him walk up and down the aisles, considering things with great care, making selections. He chose things we would normally get: rice cakes, pretzels, veggies chips, carrots and some things he liked the look of: a strawberry vitamin drink, Soba noodles, a new variety of yogurt. After a good ten minutes, he steered over to ask me if what he got was okay with me. It was. He asked for some money, took it to the counter (saying, 'excuse me, hello? to the tall skinny guy in a knit cap behind the counter) put all the items on the shelf, paid the guy, got his change, and helped put some of the items in the bag! I was riveted. There was no zooming the cart like a rocket through space, no crashing into shelves, no piling the cart high with cookies and Newman\u2019s Own Peanut Butter Cups. It was an amazing series of beautifully regulated, self-directed, calmly executed actions so unlike anything I have ever seen Fluffy do before, I felt like I was in a movie. \n\n He was so proud of himself and told me so as we carried his bag of groceries to the car.  \n\n Now, was it the adjustment? Who knows. But tomorrow is our next appointment and you can be sure we\u2019ll be crawling back for more. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/09/crawling.html", "title": "Crawling"},
{"date": "September 20, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I am coming up from underground. I\u2019m not soaring through the air, but I am on what feels like solid ground for the first time in two years.  \n\n When I went through my divorce from my first husband, I read Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s\u2019s book,  Women Who Run with the Wolves . I think some people ended up mocking it but they were mistaken to do so. It was a beautiful book, full of power. It was a mooring for me during that unsteady time and I clung to its passages about solitary descents into the underworld and reemergence with new sight. I can\u2019t find my copy so I won\u2019t be able to quote from it but my journals from that time are scattered with her lines right next to long lists of what I never liked about my ex\u00a0 because you see, you have to remind yourself of that when you\u2019ve been dumped, when you\u2019ve been slapped off the table like a sundae that arrives with the wrong topping, splat, onto the hot dirty tile of the outdoor cafe. You have to remember so one day you say you\u2019re glad he\u2019s gone and you realize, you really mean it.  \n\n The main message I got from that book was how necessary loss of innocence is in the journey to wholeness, how this theme is embedded in fairy tale after fairy tale--the young maiden captured by the ugly mole and swept to the center of the earth. I don\u2019t compare getting dumped with finding out your child has autism, but the sudden shifting from one understanding to another completely different understanding and the isolation and struggle that came with the adjustment has been a kind of descent into the darkness for me. \n\n I once felt as if my son were having the equivalent of a heart attack, a sort of neurological cardiac arrest. All the professionals looked grave and agreed intervention was critical, that time was of the essence! and then ushered me to the end of a loooooong line where every few minutes, a breathy computer voice announced, \u2018the estimated wait time for support and services for your [AUTISTIC] child is...[ONE] to [THREE] years\u2019. \n\n I don\u2019t feel that way anymore. But when you leave that line, you begin a journey, an interior and exterior journey, and, well, some of the grass is tall. \n\n I don\u2019t mean this in a melodramatic way and maybe only those who relate this this will really get what I\u2019m saying. Maybe those people don\u2019t need to be told that I adore my boy, that I love being his mom, that I don\u2019t view his autism as a tragedy. Maybe those people have been wandering in their own tunnels, repositioning the rebar, repouring the footing, restructuring the foundation, the plans for the new building tucked under their arm.  \n\n I\u2019m not one who feels comfortable consulting my notes every five seconds. I need to be off-book in this life. I need to be connected to my instincts. I need to be running with those wolves, if you will. These days, I feel connected again; my little wolf feet are on the ground. I\u2019m not exactly running with a pack--it\u2019s still a bit solitary out here. Not everyone in my old pack came along for the ride. I don\u2019t know why that is, don\u2019t know why some people couldn\u2019t step closer or even stay near but I think it has to do with the descent--ours required theirs, not to the same degree but to a degree they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t do.  \n\n My son guides me through his infinite wisdom, the Enki homeschooling curriculum is providing a structure, the RDI is providing a map, the various movement/sensory-motor awareness and activities are providing greater communication between the two sides of the brain, but it\u2019s my own emerging understanding of how to weave this into the specifics and quirkiness of our whole household that is creating more balance. Things are still lopsided for sure--Dave and I lope about, crashing into each other from time to time. I need more time alone; we need more time together, we need more time with friends, there is a slight issue of time, not quite enough time, the time factor is still unsettled, time could be more plentitudinal, BUT the timING is improving; life approaches a recognizable and more pleasing rhythm.  \n\n It\u2019s got a good beat--easy to dance to.

Certainly, it looks that way to others who don\u2019t get the subtle ways his delays express themselves.  \n\n Take eating for one. He doesn\u2019t use utensils. Occasionally, he\u2019ll use a spoon for yogurt or soup and sort of spoon-slash-bathe in the food item but the rest of the time, he\u2019s very working class Elizabethan, grabbing and tearing with his fingers, wiping off on his shirt or his pants or my arm--whichever is closest. He always gets a fork at his setting which we suggest he might want to try like it\u2019s occurring to us for the first time, hey, you know what? That fork might work well with the salad! Dave and I continue to model appropriately, la la; I figure it will all come in time. But when food arrives too hot and he says,  blow on it mommy!  and I jump to in my own distracted way, I incur the sideways glances of others who silently tsk tsk.\u00a0  \n\n They\u2019re right to do it. Why must I blow on my son\u2019s food? His blowing capabilities are quite sound. It\u2019s probably even a good OT thing for him to work on, this blowing. I ought to dispense straws of varying diameters so he can blow at varying strengths into them and onto his food. I ought to give him whistles that make music and contraptions that blow not only on the food but also below a ball which is sent upwards to balance on air. But do I? No. I lean over and blow on his food, thereby communicating his helplessness. \n\n I suck. Or rather, I blow. \n\n I get embarrassed when things like that happen, when I do things for Fluffy that which he can do for himself.\u00a0 I\u2019m taken off guard like the joke about the mom who leans over to cut her boss\u2019s steak into little bits. I\u2019m so often in care-taking mode, I don\u2019t even notice and then I wake up to my son bellowing,  AN ITCHY! AN ITCHY! MOMMY SCRATCH IT RIGHT HERE!  as he desperately points to his forearm. ? Jeez, Scratch it yourself, honey, I say, irritated, as if it\u2019s his fault that he\u2019s gotten the notion it\u2019s not his own job to scratch where he can reach. Like a little bird, he often cranes his neck forward and opens his mouth for a bite of something, his arms limply by his side. Eeek. I plop the item in and then I wince. Not at him. At myself. \n\n So, it is with great pride that I announce, I stopped myself from jumping to when Fluffy wanted me to make a  Rube Goldberg  invention! It\u2019s his latest fascination, after having seen several with his Dad online. He started clamoring for us to make these while in Maine, grabbing fistfulls of stones and blueberries, racing back to the house with them, saying, let\u2019s make one with these! Oh! Gee, let\u2019s see...I stalled. Hmm...what would they do? What do you think? I asked. I let him ponder it, play with it, experiment with it and talked a lot of how most of Rube\u2019s inventions failed, how that was part of the fun, the discovery. \n\n And then the other day, he yanked out the container of wooden blocks and set to work on his own Rube Goldberg. He tried. And failed. And tried again. When it was ready to launch, he had me do the honors. Midway, it faltered. What did he do? Give up? Scibble the blocks to and fro? Yell? Stomp off to his room? Order me to FIX IT ?  No no! He chuckled and cheerfully said,  oh rats!  rearranged the set up and had me re-launch. And when it faltered again, and again, and again? More of the same! Smiles, ponderings, sounds of puzzling it out, and more launches. And then it worked! It really worked! A beautiful domino affect with a successful twist at the end. My eyes followed the swift action all the way and then his dazzling smile came into view. IT WORKED !  he beamed. \n\n Connected and Independent. Creative and flexible. Persistent and proud.  \n\n That, my friends, is progress. Huge, huge progress. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rube-goldberg.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/09/sing_a_tale_of_.html", "title": "Sing a song of progress, a pocket full of Rube"},
{"date": "September 08, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Today, Fluffy said: \n\n If one person can lift a stick, how many bacteria would it take to lift the same stick? Mom. I always thought that a planet or star had to be in one galaxy or another. I didn\u2019t realize it could be in the empty space between galaxies.  I don\u2019t think the universe is infinity big. Since it\u2019s expanding, there HAS to be an end to it; it has to have an edge. But the space the universe is expanding INTO, that\u2019s what\u2019s infinity big! \n\n And here is what I said in response: \n\n Huh? Huh. Huh! \n\n I wanted to tape record him in the car on the way to the doctor\u2019s where we discovered he has double ear infections. I wanted to tape record it and transpose it, verbatim. Not for the startling statements like the ones above but for the sheer volume. It really is remarkable. How does he do it? And never get hoarse?  \n\n He only coughs. And coughs and coughs and coughs. Last night, he coughed so hard he threw up. His mood is remarkably good unless it\u2019s 2 am and he\u2019s literally crawling all over my head, demanding that I scratch this and fix that and rub this and carry him hither and yon and help help! I need water! and my nose my nose! I can\u2019t breathe! and where is my cold care tea? Is it a double bag? I NEED A DOUBLE BAG! and can I watch TV? \n\n He\u2019s learned to blow his own nose but in keeping with his sight aversion issue, he can only use each tissue once for a delicate blow, the strength of which would barely rustle the wings of a fly. Then it\u2019s off to the mounting tissue pile by his bed with a flick and a gag, as if we are force-feeding him his own snot. Beegu picks up the scent and tip toes into his room and carries off the pile as if she has scored a Caribou.  \n\n While I\u2019m on the subject, my ear continues to ring. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiing. And I continue to cough, as does Dave. Although my cough is real and his is competitive. He says this isn\u2019t true but does he think I don\u2019t notice the pattern? That once my dry hacking turns barky, his stage coughing just happens to start in?  \n\n Remarkably, the schedule and the homeschooling are coming together, albeit very slowly. I am trying not to panic. I will post more details once we get passed this last stretch of illness. And my chest x-rays come back clean. I know. I\u2019m off the deep end. But that lovely Dana Reeves got taken down by the lung cancer and she was younger than me.

{"date": "September 04, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t The woman who used to live across the street in the house where everything was awesome, where children from miles around were drawn by invisible strands of a magic web to draw chalk figures on the driveway and toss softballs in arcs from mitt to mitt, where toddlers would shuffle their chubby legs through kiddie Flinstone cars, where infants would crawl, unattended, the expanse of a lush and verdant lawn to stop obediently at the sidewalk\u2019s edge to peer blissfully down to the gutter where their beach ball rolled just out of reach, where, in the midst of a thunderous blackout, theirs was the sole house pulsing with the golden warmth of electric light, that woman, the frighteningly fit and authentically friendly pediatric OT, has had her three kids on a schedule from the moment their bare bottoms hit the florescent air of the delivery wing. A serious, notes on a pad down to the quarter hour, oatmeal on Tuesday, bike ride on Wednesday, nap at 10:15, snack at 3:22 schedule. And her kids sail along the coastline. Sail sail sail. \n\n Her kids are all NT, super NT if you know what I mean, flying around with red capes flapping behind them. The place was like a camp, bustling with activity, whistles blowing, red safety cones coming out at regular intervals. Hordes of multi-aged children were supervised by one adult, usually the mother but often times too, the father, an incredibly affable and laid-back physician\u2019s assistant, very Flanders from The Simpsons, sort of an Okaledokalee fellow who said things like,  Hey, neighbor, need help laying down that mulch?  and,  Why put off for tomorrow what you can do today?  \n\n She moved. And the neighborhood is quiet. So very quiet. I miss the hubbub. I miss the show. I miss her exuberance. But most of all, I miss the opportunity to now march over there and pick her brain about that damn schedule. \n\n I used to scoff at it a bit. Frankly, I thought it was extreme. I mean, writing everything down; who had time? I knew kids like routine and need structure and some sense of what happens when and I thought we did that. Dave played with Fluffy each morning and we had meals at about the same time each day, the sitters, when we had them, came on regular days, our day\u2019s events were captured in colorful pictures velcroed to our daily schedule board. We ate dinner as a family every night since Fluffy was able to sit in his padded high chair and do performance art with mounds of mashed foods and hard bits of gnawed-on bagels. But we were also a bit freeform. Sleep issues were part of that. Sleep was the monster who was not to be tamed. I tried like a mother fucker to get Fluffy on a nap schedule but it was not to be. The heavens opened up and the universe shook violently with folly at the notion. YOUR SON? SLEEP IN SOME DEPENDABLE WAY! HA HA! TAKE THAT! and then I would be slapped to the ground. I threw my heart and soul into it but it was like deciphering chicken scratch. Even so, I did everything but methodically drill small holes in the side of my head to bring fresh air to the ganglia. \n\n I haven\u2019t accomplished anything in my life, really. I sort of missed the boat in so many ways, it deflates me to think about. I\u2019d have to pop 5HTP pills as I type in order to get through the list of what I didn\u2019t do, what I didn\u2019t finish, and what I foolishly spent time on instead. I\u2019ve had this pretty eager and jolly brain but it feels like I never even unwrapped the paper. It\u2019s just sitting up there in my skull, all shiny and stupid with its misplaced trust and optimism for its owner, still in its cellophane with a little tag, To Kyra, With Love From The Mystery of Life. \n\n But all that is about to change now. I\u2019m discovering the power of the schedule. I\u2019m making charts and writing everything down. Everything. Beside me is a paper that says, blog entry, 9:15-9:40.  \n\n I\u2019m pouring over my Enki homeschooling curriculum materials and making notes, selecting stories, brainstorming craft that coordinate, rehearsing movement and verse in front of my tiny office mirror. And that\u2019s not all. I\u2019m putting myself on a schedule too. Exercise: each day at 6 am. Writing: Tuesday and Thursday afternoons into evening when Dave and the sitter will divvy up child care. There will be evenings for dates, evenings for RDI review, evenings for lesson planning. There will be family adventure days and a weekly playdate. There will be family walks each morning and mandatory rest periods after lunch. I\u2019m buying a whistle and stop watch and a clip board. It\u2019s going to be Camp Kyra. \n\n It\u2019s already working. The day already feels like it has a shape and a rhythm, a sort of pulse. I\u2019ve been told a schedule can bring more room, a kind of freedom, that it can support and open things up, make more possible. It\u2019s a simple thing. For me, it\u2019s entirely new and it feels like it\u2019s full of promise.  \n\n I might open that brain yet.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/09/opening_the_bra.html", "title": "Opening The Brain"},

{"date": "September 15, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Beegu, coordinating beautifully with Fluffy; August, 2006. Taken by Dave. \n\n I want to talk about Stage 3 in RDI, or at least, my understanding of Stage 3 and why it\u2019s such a big deal, a monumental deal, in our house. \n\n It\u2019s called Coordinating Actions. On the one hand, it\u2019s just what it sounds like: Fluffy will be learning how to coordinate his actions with others in shared activities, like carrying a bag, tossing a ball, pushing a cart, moving our little cars through a track at the same time, staying with me as we walk down the street or through the aisles of a store without holding my hand, etc..\u00a0 This includes acting out complementary roles in pretend play scenarios, say, as shopper and store clerk, waiter and customer, and being able to switch parts with ease.  \n\n It\u2019s the kind of thing we do all day long--enter in and out of shared activities with others. We\u00a0 hold the door for someone, reach for our half-pound of salami at the meat counter, navigate carts through busy corridors, adjust our position in conversation so we can see what others are saying or doing or to read their expression. But how do we do those things? By intuiting what the other guy will do? To some degree, yes, in that we are making predictions based on tiny clues in body language and what happened in similar past experiences. By following some script? Not usually, although certain exchanges are learned, like, knowing the waitress is ready to take your order when she comes to your table poised with pen above pad. \n\n The deeper learning is all about making repairs, adjusting to what the other guy is giving you. If I cut down a tree with one of those old fashioned 2-handed saws, I exert a certain amount of force. It\u2019s either too much, not enough, or some degree of just right. I know by paying attention to what happens with the other guy and by paying attention to what happens with me. And it goes back and forth as we each make our stroke, each one affecting ourselves and the other. I make adjustments, corrections--moment to moment, with the goal being coordinating our actions so our shared activity is successful. I can\u2019t just do what I want when I want if I care about our shared success, if I care about what we are trying to create together. \n\n And so, the even deeper learning is about impulse control. That\u2019s a biggie. That is where Stage 3 gets tricky in our house. \n\n As you can imagine, you need to be regulated to participate (Stage 0-Regulation), be motivated to engage with someone (Stage 1-Experience Sharing) be able to gather information by looking at the other guy (Stage 2-Referencing) before you can even begin to work on Stage 3.\u00a0 Check, check, check. Since Fluffy is doing great in all those categories, we sort of thought it would be a short drive down the runway and then, swoosh, into the air we\u2019d go! \n\n Instead, we are stumbling along, the engine coughing and sputtering as we taxi round and round the tarmac.  \n\n It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all okay. It will take time and I have all the time in the world. Progress is not a smooth and gentle upward slope, not a lilting, slowing growing soft song of summer; it\u2019s a sharp jagged line followed by long stretches of horizontal ragged v\u2019s and the occasional and precipitous dive to the valley below; it\u2019s an erratic song, a score by Philip Glass rather than one for Disney animation. \n\n If you are coordinating your actions with someone else, you must continuously observe and adjust, make tiny corrections, one after the other. It means you must hold onto what you want to do--what you would typically do were the entire operation up to you alone. There are typical people out there who\u2019ve never quite learned this, who either passively allow themselves to be dragged along or who force you this way and that. The job might get done.  Might.  But what is sacrificed is the relationship. And this is the heart of the matter for me: helping Fluffy learn to care about the relationship, to what happens between himself and the other guy, to notice when a connection has been lost and be interested in and able to make repairs. \n\n I think he notices the disconnect and I know he\u2019s interested in things getting back on track. He wants to be with the other guy. But up until now, we\u2019ve done all the work. Now we are asking him to take up some of the slack and it\u2019s hard. Some of it is about competence. He knows he\u2019s in new territory. He knows something new is being asked of him and he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s up to the task so he defaults to his own show, where\u2019s he\u2019s most familiar, where he can\u2019t get it wrong because only he is privy to the rules and timing. But a lot of it is about impulse control. \n\n When it\u2019s time to walk, Fluffy races ahead. When it\u2019s time to dance in a circle, he yanks on my arm, pulling me into a whirling dervish spin. When he has an idea, he must act on it IMMEDIATELY. When he thinks of sharing something with Dave, he IMMEDIATELY leaps up and begins bellowing his name, regardless of where we are and where Dave is. He needs to play the game according to rules he invents INSTANTLY. He must tell me his story in its detailed entirety regardless of where I am--sitting next to him, getting up to answer the ringing phone, closing him alone in the car while I walk around to the drivers seat; there he is, alone in the car, his lips moving, his arms gesturing passionately. He wants to tell me his story. It is important that I hear it. He does notice I\u2019m not there, but he can\u2019t hold onto his impulse to share long enough to coordinate his telling with my readiness.  \n\n So, we\u2019re spotlighting all over the place, the readiness and the togetherness.\u00a0  (Aw. I\u2019m not ready. Oops. He\u2019s way over there! I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready to help us yet. Oh! I\u2019m not ready to listen. Let\u2019s push this together! Hey! We did it together! Wow. I love walking together.)  We\u2019re spotlighting the moment the connection is lost by turning away or covering our ears  (Ow! That\u2019s too loud! I can\u2019t talk when you\u2019re yelling. Uh oh. That hurt. I don\u2019t feel like playing now. Hey. I want a turn to talk. Oh, yes! You already told me that. Aw. It doesn\u2019t feel good to hear the same thing over and over.) \n\n Stage 3 touches on a lot. Coordinating actions. Impulse control. Readiness. Togetherness. Repairs. Big things for a guy with a powerful mind of his own, a huge dose of perfectionism, and a history of solo flights.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/09/circling_the_ru.html", "title": "Circling the Runway--Stage 3"},
{"date": "October 03, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I am now inculcated or inducted or initiated--wait--yes! here's the word:  attuned  by a Reiki Master to  Reiki , level 1. I completed a training workshop this weekend and I am a believer. Wow. Energy. It\u2019s some amazing stuff. Fluffy has known all along, of course, as all kids do, with his talk of strong and weak energy, of blocks that build and break free. He kept saying, YES YES! as I was talking about what Reiki is and how it works. YES YES! with recognition and what seemed like maybe a slight impatience. YES YES! There are two more levels to go before one achieves the status of Reiki Master and I think I\u2019m headed in that direction.\u00a0  \n\n Remember that repeat mammogram? From a couple weeks ago? That I understood was about dense tissue and difficulty seeing or some such thing? Well, it turns out there was a lump. A tiny lump, 8 mm to be precise. I saw it when I went into the x-ray room in my stunning cranberry johnnette, this new fangled coverup that hangs from your shoulders like a shawl and drapes in such a way so that either one or the other breast peeks out like a curious mouse, or moose. In my case, maybe squirrel. I\u00a0 saw it encircled by a black sharpie on my films, flat on the wall, illuminated by that eerie blue light.  Right here , the technician said.  This is what they want to see more closely.   \n\n\n\n I then collapsed into her robust bossom, hung onto her dangling ID necklace and begged, NO NO! Take you! Not me! Who will care for Fluffy? But I'm so young! I must leave this place and begin my healing! A fast! A cleanse! Let me go! Where is my son! Why are you keeping him from me! I must see my child!  \n\n She peeled me off and placed me in the jaws of that cold hard machine and flattened my boob like a tortilla while she scurried behind a cement wall and hid like a coward. She took regular x-rays and then mini compression x-rays and I was told to wait, she would bring these to the radiologist and if it all looked fine that was all, I could go home.  It doesn\u2019t look bad anyway. It\u2019s nice and round, the edges smooth. The bad ones look jagged, like stars, like the star of David. You can take a seat in the waiting room. This won\u2019t take long. \n\n It did take long. Under the vibrating florescent lights, I read about 54 year old  Joan Lunden  and her second set of twins while middle aged women in cranberry capes came and went. And came and went. At long last, the technician returned and escorted me to ultrasound for further scans. After those were completed, I waited for my new technician to report back after consulting the radiologist. She poked her head in to let me know he, the radiologist, was on his way in.  \n\n You know how I\u2019ve been feeling about doctors lately but you know what? I loved this guy. He was direct, professional, warm, informative. He scanned and pointed and chatted and said it was benign, with 98% accuracy. But to be sure, he would recommend a biopsy. \n\n The biopsy was yesterday. I was so impressed and reassured by this guy, I requested him for the procedure. I was not disappointed. It was the least invasive biopsy I could imagine. A tiny needle was inserted through my vulnerable but thankfully, well-numbed breast. A second needle \u2018gun\u2019 was then threaded inside and, bang, he shot through the lump and captured tissue samples. Five times. Least invasive. Even so, they scrubbed and swathed me in betadyne and dimmed the lights in order\nto better use the milky monitor screen to guide the tools into MY BARE BREAST WITH THE LUMP INSIDE. I watched the entire thing. It was no Six Feet Under and of that, I was glad.   \n\n I\u2019ll know on Friday. Friday. Till then, I\u2019m Reiki-ing everything like mad with special attention to my dear, left boobie. \n\n October = Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  \n\n I'm aware. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.reiki.org/FAQ/WhatIsReiki.html", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5014340/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/10/a_short_story_o.html", "title": "A Short Story of Reiki"},

If you want to learn more about this and upcoming tours, please dash over to  Andi Buchanan \u2019s new site and  browse around . There's much to see. \n\n I tell you, I love the laugh out loud moment. I\u2019m reading along and then suddenly, out barks my laugh. It\u2019s such a lively eruption, one that I always want to share with whomever is sitting next to me. I may look over at that person and smile dreamily, like we\u2019ve both just witnessed a birth or been offered something lovely and unexpected, like chocolates in the exact shape of our noses and so we are bonded from that moment on. But since I\u2019m pretty much always reading alone these days or beside my snoring husband, mostly I smile into the air with my finger tucked between the pages, quietly picturing the scene. When I return to the book, I settle in expectantly, knowing it\u2019s sure to happen again. \n\n With Guterson\u2019s book, it happens. I befriended her protagonist, Julia, from the start. She\u2019s plucky and in a pickle. She\u2019s pushing forty, pregnant, and unsure of the father: is it Jim, her husband of fifteen years, or Ray, her sexy ex\u00a0 from long ago? This you can get from the jacket cover. What you can\u2019t get is the easy intimacy that develops with each page.  \n\n The story unfolds in what feel like journal entries. The writing is sure, funny, surprising, spare at times but sprinkled with perfect detail. We don\u2019t get the writerly painting of the scene, grand descriptions of interiors or exteriors but you know, here I didn\u2019t need it. Here, I got the essentials: great characters and a wonderful story told with skill and ease and with a power that snuck up on me. \n\n Guterson\u2019s voice is full of a breezy confidence. I could quote many passages but since I just read more about the dreaded mommy wars, about who is or isn\u2019t doing it right or enough or with the best possible hair style, etc. etc., here\u2019s this from Julia\u2019s reminiscing of when she was newly married to Jim and expecting their son, Chad, trying her \u201cbest to figure out how in the world to be a mother.\u201d \n\n\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had anything decent to go on.

Schedules, yes.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Schedules, no. Lay them on their stomachs. Lay them  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 on their backs. Bottle. Breast. Wean. Don\u2019t wean.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Toilet train. Don't toilet train. Pick them up when they  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 cry. Never pick up a crying baby. Public school. Home  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 school. Montessori. Competitive sports are good.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Competitive sports are bad. Fluoride. No fluoride.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Vaccines. No vaccines. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Your welcome.\u201d \n\n You see?  \n\n Go  here  or  here  to buy your own copy so you and I can smile in each other\u2019s direction and eat our chocolate noses. Or something. Go on! You know what I mean! As always, I will raffle off my copy to one of y\u2019all. Just leave a comment and in a week, Fluffy will select one lucky name from his hat and into a mailer will Guterson\u2019s book go.

Or when you\u2019re standing on the production floor of The New York Times when the thing goes to press? That makes you feel as if your ears will surely explode like two firecrackers leaving jagged flesh where your delicate cartilage once flowered?  \n\n Ring ring ring. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiing. That\u2019s my ear. All day. Under a loud muted humming. At night, it spins me through the darkness of the room, interrupted only by a jarring cough cough cough.  \n\n Don\u2019t I sound fun? \n\n It\u2019s rendered me slightly deaf and as a consequence, I\u2019m on edge. I can\u2019t really tell who\u2019s talking or what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019m answering the fridge and slipping the lettuce under my son\u2019s shirt. The ear things impairs my sight the way not wearing my glasses impairs my hearing. I\u2019m going through the day impersonating a normal person when, in fact, I\u2019m  this close  to getting all fetal in the corner to stroke my matted hair and murmur,  the people the people , over and over. Either that, or clumsily stagger through the kitchen looking for something which which to cut it off. The Ear. Like Van Gogh. Only, who would I send it to? That\u2019s what stops me. I lack community! I don\u2019t have anyone to receive my ear!  \n\n Although, come to think of it, all of you have been a godsend, a lovely, warm and reassuring armful of support and understanding and identification. Would anyone be willing to leave their snail mail? Just in case? \n\n Lately, we would have to list my favorite things as: ear ringing, outbursts of ear swatting, and coughing.  \n\n It used to be: anger, exaggeration, and reclining. My husband\u2019s remain: convenience, preparation, and backups. \n\n We started this when we first met. No. Strike that. When we re-met. See, Dave and I dated for a few months and then we broke up. For 11 years.\u00a0 During which time I got married and then divorced. And then we got back together and got married. So, soon after we re-met, we jokingly named three of the other person\u2019s favorite things. We tried to get a couple friend to join in the fun but the gal part of the couple couldn\u2019t get the hang of it. She\u2019d look happy and pensive and say in her Aussie accent,  Oh! Lovely! What fun! Let\u2019s see...well, yes! There\u2019s cartooning! Jim! You\u2019re a cartoonist! And, well, you\u2019re terribly fond of sailing, so that\u2019s two! \u00a0 and we\u2019d say, no no, we mean things that  irritate  you but lovingly so,  you  know, but she just looked vague in a  down under  sort of way.   \n\n For Fluffy these days it would be: yelling, multiple night wakings, and not going to the bathroom when he obviously has to but instead doing every manner of thing to keep it in like hanging on window molding, twisting himself into alarming positions, running around in circles, slamming doors and shouting at the very suggestion of  trying  a pee pee even though we\u2019ve promised to come right back to this and save the place and put it on pause and stop the timer and freeze actual time. \n\n He\u2019s at the tail end of his sickness and the poor guy is not himself. We leave for Maine in two days, headed for a beautiful, remote cabin on the rocky coast with no electricity or telephone and I am crossing every body part that by then, we will all be well. He\u2019s never been to this house, a place I used to go every summer as a kid and then adult for many many years. It\u2019s like going back in time, I told him, to the days of being guided by the sun and moon, a place where the world is so quiet and the sky is so inky black at night, if you stare long enough, you can almost see stars being born. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/08/when_will_the_r.html", "title": "When will the ringing end?"},

Just back in the door from starry, un-plugged Maine where we walked on rocks and pooped in a wooden box. \n\n It was many things: beautiful, peaceful, simple, easy, hard, fun, dull, and relaxing with a sprinkle of stress. Vacations, for us, aren't so much like vacations as they are like moving our life to a different backdrop. In this case, it was minus the help and computer and phone and flushing toilets and loooooong hot showers each morning.  \n\n Truthfully, some of that was lovely, like when you remember to breathe all the way in. I didn't miss the electronic world and having no help allowed us all to find a sweet rhythm together--sleeping at sunset,\u00a0 planning activities by the tide, snacking on berries found alongside the wooded roads, building fires for warmth.  \n\n Now it appears to be fall even though the calender says it's weeks away. That's okay. I love fall.

{"date": "August 15, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m discouraged today. My ear is throbbing. I woke to Fluffy\u2019s arm slung over my neck in the big mommy/daddy bed where I brought him last night when he awoke crying and coughing and calling out distorted scenes from his dreams. He sounded much better this morning but he always sounds better in the morning when the sun is blue blue and the wind is a soft caress and the birds perch on flowering branches and sing bright songs of happiness. And then the day progresses and the clouds blow in. Fever returns, throats tighten, and a pallor settles into the skin.  \n\n Too many days with the sickness. I don\u2019t care for the coxsackie. I don\u2019t. If it even is that. Now with the coughing and the flash rash that spread like an oil fire across his chest and tummy, tumbling greedily onto his thighs, back, and arms. That disappeared almost as quickly and mysteriously as it came. I know. I\u2019m not writing proper sentences. I am. Not. Writing sentences. That properly. Organized are. Because nothing is organized in the house now. Except the silverware drawer which I emptied, sanitized, and reordered in a way that brings me a fleeting moment of calm, my island of oasis, each time I open it for another teaspoon with which to deliver the pain medication. \n\n This morning, Fluffy sang the Winnie the Pooh song and I thought, huh, I guess the monitor is on somewhere in the house because of the tiny echo I heard in my ear. My left ear. The one pointed up to the ceiling while the opposite sunk into delicious pillows. Pillows. Mmmmm. For sleeeeeeping. But when I sat up, I realized, no. No monitors. But yes. Echo. As if Fluffy were only a centimeter or two high and teetering at the top of the ear canal, la la, singing into the darkness down below. \n\n I think it\u2019s an ear infection. My doctor\u2019s out on a family emergency. The other two doctors are on vacation. They have referred me to the walk-in.  \n\n You know my feeling about doctors these days. This is not helping. \n\n Insert this: We had company last night. And the schedule\u2019s been off for a month now. And the sitter had to be canceled. And the new RDI will be harder for parents without consultants to access. And still no one recognizes it as the powerful remediation program that it is, no one in the position to reimbursed financially stressed families clamoring for help, for support, for guidance, families EAGER to get started but thwarted by the steps and costs needed to GET started. \n\n And yesterday, yesterday! I was full of promise and the merest bit of momentum. I\u2019d read my preliminary Enki materials and had charted a beginners course for meeting Fluffy\u2019s daily rhythmic needs. We went for a family walk! We had circle time! We wrote by hand without tears! We had fingerplay songs! We did pretend play! We had rest time after lunch! And today Fluffy is in the playroom yelling at the sitter, as he\u2019s been doing for the last hour. When he\u2019s not pushing her or slamming doors.  \n\n I\u2019m discouraged. Did I say? I know. I know. It will be okay. It will pass. But I don\u2019t like this feeling. Shall I dismiss the sitter? And go down there and throw myself into helping Fluffy regulate? Who will attend to my ear? Shall I hook myself up to a hot garlic oil drip? Is anyone walking Beegu? And, where is Dave, anyway?  \n\n This all reminds me of the recent RDA. Dave and I sat in the back room, watching Fluffy and our consultant on the video monitor screen. Every time Fluffy had a successful interaction, Dave would look over at me and say, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d Every time Fluffy was resistant or recalcitrant, Dave would look over at me and say, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to make it.\u201d He did it all deadpan. It was all, of course, a joke. We both know he will be fine. But we also both know why that was funny, because, as Homer says, (no, not  that  Homer--Homer Simpson)  it's funny 'cause it's true.   \n\n The situation. What it asks.

{"date": "August 16, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I visited some people today, some lovely people, a friend of my mom\u2019s and her kids and their kids. I brought Fluffy with me; we came from the beach on our way home for dinner. We don\u2019t normally do that, my son and I, swing by someone\u2019s house, someone we don\u2019t know all that well, someone with kids who my son doesn\u2019t know at all. But I thought we would try it. I wanted a chance to say hello--they were slated to leave the next day. Surprisingly, I have plans both tonight (at home) and tomorrow (away) and this was my only shot at a visit. Fluffy was up for it. He\u2019s been socially curious and interested lately so I gave it a try.  \n\n We stayed for about a half hour. I left in tears. I learned a lot. \n\n The first thing was how very out of practice I am with socializing, especially socializing with my son. I don\u2019t do it, unless it\u2019s with family. I\u2019m not counting being out at the park or the Y or the beach; those sort of encounters are just being out in life. I mean, getting together in a mixed crowd (kids + adults) with the hopes of having an actual visit with one of those adults. When we do see people, Dave or I will team with Fluffy while the other roams around independently. That\u2019s how it goes all the time, really. I don\u2019t mind. I love being with Fluffy. I want him to have fun too. I want him to feel as comfortable as possible and I know he will if he has either his mom or dad as his mooring, bobbing along in the water alongside him, anchored well to the sea floor.  \n\n I\u2019m always there and always ready to fade back should he strike up conversation with someone new. I\u2019m always there and always ready to help facilitate interactions with other kids. I try to leave it be as much as I am able but I\u2019m not always sure how hands off to be. I want him to feel successful. I know I\u2019m not in charge of that but I know I need to be there, one set of eyes on the person talking to me, one set on my son. That\u2019s just a fact.  \n\n And a fact that those with typical kids can\u2019t quite get. \n\n It\u2019s not that I have to keep him in line or keep him from bolting. That\u2019s not the issue. It\u2019s that I care about how the experience is for him as much as I care about how the experience is for me. If I want an experience where I care more about my good time than his, I will arrange to do it on my own.  \n\n So, the very first hard thing about this visit was, I was there, sort of pretending to be a person who often sits in a room with my son and other adults with their NT kids and la la la.\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t know them that well; they weren\u2019t already briefed on how big a deal it was to swing by. Because they don\u2019t me very well; they didn\u2019t know how hard it was to listen to them and be aware of my son, where he was, how he was, what he was doing. And the time. What time is it? How long have we been here? Is it time to go? \n\n Fluffy was amazing and great and chatty and seemed quite comfortable. I was beaming and watchful and glad to be there and still not able to really hear anyone that well. Then he found a Jr. Yatzee game and wanted to play. Next time I will say, airily, confidently, oh! We don\u2019t have time to play today.  \n\n He wanted to play with me. Only. The youngest there didn\u2019t like that and I jumped in to say, we\u2019re visiting them, it would make her feel bad not to play too, etc. etc. and after a time, he relented and we started to play. Sort of. It became clear to me that playing this game wasn\u2019t such a good idea, that it was time to go. But I felt stuck. Do I stop the game? Because Fluffy was beginning to act out, grab things, cheat, push some of the pieces on the board around, would this leaving feel like a punishment?  \n\n I knew he was overloaded, trying to play with the other child was too much. She was feeling like HE was too much and had already said a couple of times, STOP COMING NEAR ME or something when Fluffy tried to talk to her. He\u2019d approach and she\u2019d move away and he\u2019d move toward her and she away, and on and on. He wasn\u2019t aggressive; he just wanted to talk and felt he had to be near her to communicate and so kept following her around.  \n\n By this point, one of the girls and her mom had disappeared, the other girl retreated to the back yard with her dad, my mom\u2019s friend and her husband had left the room and it was just the one little girl who didn\u2019t want Fluffy near her, her mom (the one I was there to visit, the one who I like very much but who I don't know well and have never hung out with) and the two of us. \n\n By that time, the other girl from the back yard returned and had joined the game. It wasn\u2019t exactly going smoothly. I floundered a bit, trying to facilitate the game, reminding Fluffy that we all had to play by the rules. Oh! Don\u2019t grab! Remember! Everyone has to be having fun, to which the little girl said, I\u2019M NOT HAVING FUN! just as her sister got up and retreated to the back porch again. I announced the current round was the last! We limped through, put the game away, got up and said it was time for us to go. I'M GLAD YOU\u2019RE GOING, the little girl said.  \n\n For some reason, that was it. I started to cry. It was pathetic and also unstoppable. Thankfully, it wasn\u2019t the hiccup or wracking cries, just the tears spilling forth kind of cry. I tried to hide it. I bent down, looked away, wiped at my eye, tried to gather our things quickly. My mom\u2019s friend had returned by that point and she said, What was that? What did she say? I tried to leave before she said it again but she was too fast.  \n\n Then Fluffy was at the sliding doors to the back porch, trying to figure out how they worked. Someone suggested going out to say goodbye to the other little girl and her dad and so out we went, me, still bent and wiping, willing the tears to stop. Fluffy said to the other little girl,  We\u2019re done with the game.  No response.  We\u2019re leaving now.  Long pause. Uhh, okay. I took his hand to go when my new friend was before me with a camera, click! I couldn\u2019t look up and reveal my pained expression and welling eyes so I placed my hands atop Fluffy\u2019s dear head and looked away. It was mortifying.  \n\n As I type this I think, what was all that? Why was I so upset?\u00a0 There was nothing terrible in what the little girl said. My goodness, my son had said far worse things complete with shoves and shouting. There was nothing terrible in what Fluffy did. There\u2019s quite a distance between where he is socially and where the other kids there are, but I already knew that.  \n\n I don\u2019t know. I felt suddenly vulnerable. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to be feeling that way there. I was taken by surprise. I felt bad for my son and his trying to reach out and not connecting. I felt overcome with how alone we are in this journey so far and how much I need a community, a real one, in the flesh, people who get it, people who have all the same sloppy jumble of feelings that I do about their amazing, beautiful, brave, and awkward kids so when moments like these happen, everyone knows what everyone else is feeling because everyone\u2019s felt that way before. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/08/where_everyones.html", "title": "Where Everyone's Felt That Way Before"},

I\u2019m tagging myself. \n\n Five things about me: \n\n (1) I don't know which I've been enjoying more,  Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator  or Fluffy's recap of the highlights. If you find yourself in the car quite a bit, download the version read by Eric Idle. It is cracking us up over here.  \n\n Dave\u2019s the technophile in our house, soon to be outseated by Fluffy. But until that happens, he\u2019s the guy rolling the giant thimble of multi-colored wire down the hall, managing uploads and downloads and various i-thingies. He loves his  Audible dot com . He practically sleeps in his headphones. Even his telephone is a snappy little headset number. If I want to get his attention, all I have to do is tape my message, transfer it to digital, upload it to my hard drive, burn a cd and drop it down the stairs to his cartoon cave. \n\n I strap on the ipod whenever I get on the elliptical, sadly, fast becoming a rare event. Lately, I\u2019ve jogged in place to the words of  Blink  and  On Intelligence  and everything  Pema Chodron . Gotta love her. I must start doing the  tonglin  meditation. After all, I\u2019m already having the disturbing thoughts. Why not put them to good use? \n\n (2) I get my period every five minutes and consequently, I have exactly 42 seconds during which I can comfortably wear something other than underwear. I can wear a t-shirt but nothing else on the lower half.  \n\n (3) I am against how quickly the summer is passing. Here on the east coast, we stood our jiggling thighs in rain for three months, endured the scorching heat of hell for two and, as far as I can tell, Labor Day is like, tomorrow? There is so much I want to get to and so little time to get to it. Does anyone else relate to this? Just for starters, the Enki materials--lovely, inspiring, informative, comprehensive, sit in a stack by my desk and beckon for my attention day after day.    \n\n (4) I recently discovered through conversation with my son, that if one darts down the beach along the glistening shoreline, it turns out there are light and color reflections that appear, move, and disappear in the sleek gray sand--lights one can race and sometimes beat. \n\n It also turns out, if you shake your head side to side very quickly while standing in the shallow water, you can hear a round pulsing sound, like a clapping but more textured, like a WA WA WA WA in vibration. And it also turns out, (and this I knew) there is nothing better than rolling in the warm dry sand directly after being tossed in the cold salty waves. I used to fill my one-piece to overflowing, log roll back into the ocean, wriggling in the surf until all the sand fell free. I would still be doing it if I was operating on a wee bit more sleep.  \n\n (5) I never knew why all the adults were bothering with their funny little folding beach chairs. Now I know. \n\n Feel free to tag yourself.

Thank god. Fluffy\u2019s still got it--day 6. The \u2018doctor\u2019 said it could last a week. \n\n All in all, he\u2019s been a star. Although, I worry what this will do to his thirst for screen time. We were down to about 2 half hour videos and about an hour of computer time per week. Now, our RDI program is called, turn on the TV, TOGETHER! Switch channels, TOGETHER! Select videos, TOGETHER! I think he\u2019s got this mastered!  \n\n I also worry a bit about his return to having us be characters from books and videos for long stretches of the day.  \n\n Pooh?  (He\u2019ll beckon.) \n\n Do you have to go to the bathroom?  (I\u2019ll ask.) \n\n No! I\u2019m talking to Pooh!  \n\n Oooooh. Okay. Yes?  (I\u2019ll say in my best Pooh voice.) \n\n The moment when the sperm meets the egg is in the mommy\u2019s body!  (Your basic AA Milne conversation starter.) \n\n Oh, my. \n\n Yes. And you grow inside her until you are too big to stay and then you come out . (Slight change of voice):  How long does that take, mommy? \n\n About 9 months. \n\n Pooh? Pooh? That takes about 9 months. \n\n Oh!  Yes. And then when you are out, you drink boobie milk. Mommy doesn\u2019t have any left but if she wanted to make more she could have another baby. Ahhh. \n\n Yes. But if she didn\u2019t wanted to do that, she could get a machine and plug it in and it would attach to her and then it would suck and suck and suck for a long long long long long long time and after that, she would start making boobie milk. Oh! Yes. And I would drink it! Oh? \n\n Yes. I asked if I could make the boobie milk come back and she said I\u2019d have to be sucking all day and I wouldn\u2019t even have time for ANYthing else, not even playing games or going to the beach or even EATING regular food! Oh, dear! Yes. So, if she wants to do that, she\u2019ll just wait for another baby to grow inside her or get one of those machines, Pooh. That\u2019s what she\u2019ll do. Uh huh.

{"date": "July 29, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t RDI is like magic. It really is. Play a few games, go for a walk, toss a couple rags in the laundry basket, read a story, put books back on the shelf, and then next thing you know, your son is sharing experiences and referencing like crazy. And why? Because you asked him to? Because you wrote a story about it? No. Because he learned it through moments with his mom and his dad that lasted, on average, three minutes. And how did he learn it? Really? I don\u2019t know. By magic. That\u2019s the only explanation I have. \n\n Now, Fluffy was always, what? I dare not say high functioning because it\u2019s a misleading and quite possibly, meaningless phrase. Fluffy has lots of language. That\u2019s wonderful. A real strength. He also uses it to control and hide and it ends up largely pushing others away and confusing them rather than using it as a bridge to connection, an avenue to genuine communication with others, especially his peers. But no matter. I\u2019m not worried about it. We\u2019re lucky that language came easily for him and the rest, the understanding and awareness and nuances of conversation as a two way street--will come. He\u2019s also always had the desire or need to be WITH another person, mostly me. He was never off playing on his own. Never. As a neurologist told me, I WAS his frontal lobe. Only in this last year have moments of independent play bubbled up through water, each holding a twinkling good witch of the north. I\u2019m sure this comes from the RDI we\u2019ve been doing and how it\u2019s helped Fluffy self-regulate, calm, and feel the ease that comes from his growing confidence in navigating his world, both the smaller more controlled one in his home and the larger more unwieldy one out his door. \n\n Now hear this: The RDA was a huge success! Fluffy was a star! The goal was to see if there were any holes from previous stages and gather ideas and information about the next couple of stages. We played bean bag crash, obstacle courses, hide and seek, grocery store, toss and roll the ball, team ball kicking, team dancing, Mrs. Midnight, blocks, bean bag mountains, and much much more. There were many breaks and no pressure and it all confirmed Fluffy\u2019s mastery of (1) Experience Sharing--his genuine desire to connect WITH another person and (2) Social Referencing--his ability to get information of various types FROM another person.  \n\n Yipee! \n\n What this means is, Fluffy wants to play WITH another person more than he wants to play with a certain THING. He cares about having fun but he also wants the other guy to have fun. The referencing he\u2019s doing is about getting information from the other person, what they mean, feel, want, what they\u2019re talking about or referring to. But it\u2019s not rote or mechanical; it\u2019s really remarkably fluid. For example, he was telling Lauren, our consultant, a story and she asked a question he wasn\u2019t sure of, so he turned to find me, looked directly into my eyes and made a questioning face. I shook my head yes, since the answer to Lauren\u2019s question was yes, and he turned back to her and said, YES! For those of you with typical children, this will seem quite ordinary. For those of you with kids on the spectrum, you know this is MONUMENTAL!  \n\n The first day was the Mommy and Fluffy show. Lauren came in and out with new games or little notes giving a new direction to the game and then retreated to the other room where she and Dave watched our progress on the video monitor. We moved through the games that tested objectives of the mastered stages and then on through games in stage 3 and stage 4. Predictably, this is where things began to fall apart since it was unchartered territory and up at the edge of his competence. But still! He hung in there!  \n\n The Lauren and Fluffy show was the next day and that got off to a rough start. It wasn\u2019t about the games, it was about getting used to a new person and anxiety about what she was going to ask of him. He\u2019d go along to a certain point and then zoom back to where Dave and I were watching and give us a blow by blow,  We\u2019re making an OBSTACLE COURSE! We\u2019re jumping OFF CHAIRS!  Once he was assured of our presence, that he wasn\u2019t free-falling through cold dark space, he\u2019d zoom back and reconnect to Lauren. That was the biggest thing about this whole experience. Fluffy was breaking connections here and there as we all do, but he noticed it and always came back, he always made repairs, he always reconnected.  \n\n On the last day, we all played. Lots of partner things: flying our space ships together, pouring soup into pots together, taking bites together, dancing and stopping together. It was fun but it was also hard work. Play is work. It really is, and you see it so clearly in RDI. Not because it\u2019s unpleasant, no no, it has to be engaging. Kids don\u2019t learn when they\u2019re not having fun. But fun is not the biggest motivator--competence is. The need and drive to build competence is the biggest motivator for, frankly, all of us. How long will you keep at something if you don\u2019t think you are making any progress? Learning something? Getting better? You will give up and so will our kids. The more I get RDI, the more I see it as not a therapeutic program or even an intervention. I see it as a way of being mindful in parenting, mindful of what our children find confusing, mindful of how to frame and spotlight things so they can come into focus. \n\n And things are coming into focus for my guy, little by little, like magic. Last weekend, I invented a crossword puzzle with words from the weekend: Long Island, Ferryboat, Aunt Susie, Uncle Steve, etc., Fluffy asked,  Is Beegu one of the answers?  I said, maybe! And he said,  Mommy, I knew by the look on your face and the sound of your voice and the way your eyebrows went arching up that the answer would be yes.  Yes Yes! I said, You were reading my face! \n\n By the time we pulled into the driveway late yesterday afternoon at the end of our third day, we were all fried. There were McDonalds wrappers stuck to our foreheads and ketchup splattered everywhere, like a kiddie Peckenpaw flick. Thankfully, the town beach is five minutes away. In no time at all, we were frolicking in the waves, rolling in the sand, and generally flailing about with wind slap-slapping the hair around our heads like wild caterpillars.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/rdi_is_like_mag.html", "title": "RDI Magic"},
{"date": "August 04, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \u00a0 My boy. July, 2006.  \n\n My dear sister-in-law came up from the DC area this week, with her two absolutely adorable kids, Elliot, just 6 and his two year old sister, Camila. The morning they arrived, Fluffy tore into the bathroom where I was\nshowering, ripped back the curtain and ran around in a tight circle\nscreaming,  THEY\u2019RE HERE! THEY\u2019RE HERE!  as if a Santa himself was\ndumping a sleighful of toys in the front yard. It is sweet to see them after too long a time. The sweetest of all was how much Fluffy extended himself to both of them.   \n\n \n\n With Elliot; July, 2006. Taken by Dave. \n\n To my six year old nephew, Elliot, he share his playroom and all his things, even the coveted light saber, taking it gently from him to demonstrate its magnificence and then handing it back with ease. He invited him to listen to Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator on the way home from the zoo, beckoned him to watch some of his favorite video, Pooh\u2019s Grand Adventure, and darted to and from the freezer, detailing his latest rash of scientific experiments that involve the creation of frozen sponges, frozen washcloth balls, frozen homemade pops, frozen water balloons, and ice cubes made in various and sundry plastic containers. And much much more.   \n\n Regarding Camila; July, 2006. Taken by Dave. \n\n With Camila, he was big brother-like, patting her softly on the head, bending down down down to talk eye to eye, instructing her on the color green, and tuning in sharply anytime she got upset.  What\u2019s wrong? Why is she sad?  At one point on the beach, Camila was missing her mom, down at the water\u2019s edge with Elliot. She searched the sand and called out, Mama! Mama! Fluffy, by her side, bent down and said soothingly,  Don\u2019t worry. She\u2019ll come back. Mommies  always  come back.   \n\n I\u2019m seeing more of more of who he is, who his social self is, and it\u2019s a very sweet sight. The desire to connect has woken up and is on the tracks, awaiting the arrival of more social-developmentally and sensorally integrated trains cars, if I may be so metaphorically clumsy! For whatever reason, he and Elliot didn't make a real connection so despite Fluffy\u2019s breakthrough extensions, he remained on the sidelines. I always wince inside when that happens. But I have to remember that the real world is where I want him to thrive and the real world is full of missed connections as much as made connections. The name of the game for all of us is not in finding the perfect anything; it\u2019s in noticing when things break down and wanting to make repairs--trying, trying again, trying it differently, something I saw him do. I felt so proud of him.   \n\n My son may be awkward, he may say the same thing a few or three hundred times in a row, he may stand too close and speak in only two volumes: loud and yelling, but he has the biggest, most tender heart I've ever seen and it pumps through his pores and out in the air where it mixes with my voice calling, Come on, cars! Or at least, in the meantime, Come on playmate who is up for a bumpy but beautiful ride!  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/08/come_on_cars.html", "title": "Come On, Cars!"},
{"date": "August 01, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n \n\n See Fluffy. See Fluffy sip. Sip Fluffy sip.  \n\n We are heavily into sipping and blowing and chewing and crunching and sucking. One of these days I\u2019ll be posting a picture of Fluffy slurping applesauce through a straw, although perhaps not the spectacle straw in the photo above. I tried serving his yogurt fruit shake with it and he nearly fell off his new chair with the foot rest that is meant to help him sit at the table longer and will last through to his teenage years. It definitely does the former and we\u2019ll have to see about the latter and I will not be serving fruit shakes through that straw ever again. \n\n Speaking of sensory integration, one of the most engaging presenters I saw at the recent ASA Conference was  Judith Bluestone , director and founder of  The HANDLE Institute . The acronym HANDLE stands for Holistic Approach to NeuroDevelopment and Learning Efficiency. She and her trained practitioners use her own unique methods for neurorehabilitation. Bluestone herself struggled with severe birth defects, hearing loss and autism during her lifetime and has spent the last over 30 years in some form of disabilities education.  \n\n I loved her! I wanted to get the training and become a HANDLE practitioner. I wanted to fly Fluffy out to Seattle for a consultant with Judith herself tout suite! I told a friend who is sorting through her own sensory processing challenges about HANDLE and she discovered a facility in New Jersey. I\u2019m hoping to make an appointment for an assessment this fall once we get a few things straightened out like, ah, where we\u2019ll be living.  \n\n I learned so many things in that one hour and a half seminar. Apparently there is this tiny but incredibly important nerve in the face called the trigeminal nerve that can be stimulated by a very simple and pleasant exercise called Face Tapping, to sometimes astounding affect. She described it for us while a practitioner circled the room and administered the procedure to whomever had their hand raised. I was flagging her down from the front row.  \n\n It was quick, gentle, and relaxing. Go  here  for details. The cool thing, other than the stories she told, was how similar it was to something I\u2019ve been doing with Fluffy on and off at bedtime for a couple of months now. It started out as an intuitive face massage on acupressure points, some of the same points used in  EFT . Now, I\u2019m not a big EFT-er. I heard about it from one of my many yahoo lists, downloaded half the manual, and spent one morning tapping myself silly. I didn\u2019t stick with it, but I found Fluffy really responded to the version I used. He\u2019s always responded to head manipulation. I\u2019d love to take him for regular cranio-sacral session but since our first attempt fell flat, I\u2019ve been considering getting the training. \n\n Are you sensing a pattern here? Any sort of problem with time management? Let\u2019s see, I plan to homeschool my son using Enki, do RDI, finish a novel, edit an anthology, AND get trained in both cranio-sacral and the HANDLE technique?\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n It\u2019s just that I love all that stuff. I love body work. Years ago as I was lying face up on the massage table, my eyes closed. My body was still but in my mind, it arched back, suspended and collapsed like an olympic skater, spinning round and round. Just as the image appeared, the cranio-sacral therapist said,  Wow! You\u2019re spinning! I see you leaning backwards with your arms out and you\u2019re spinning!  It was the most psychedelic experience of my life and I swear to you, it unwound a knot at the base of my spine that had been twisting for ages and causing me great discomfort.  \n\n The brain/body connection is mysterious and powerful and also completely grounded, if you ask me. It\u2019s scientific and mystical. I mean, I saw  What The Bleep Do We Know , so, I'm like, qualified to debate quantum physics and shit, right?   \n\n By the way, Bluestone\u2019s latest book is called  The Fabric of Autism . I haven\u2019t read it.

A mere three days ago while we were all away on the tip of the north fork of Long Island visiting Uncle Steve and Aunt Susie in their piece of heaven! And heaven it is, with lush fields and old fashioned roadside stands and marshes and inlets and beaches that hug miles of shoreline on either side of the peninsula.  \n\n Dave went to the bathroom; Fluffy raced to get his magnadoodle and darted in after him, calling,  I'm going to draw your picture while you pee!  He sat on the floor and whipped it off, really, in record time. Can you believe this? From a guy who shunned all manner of writing utensils since soon after his third birthday and has only recently returned to the wild acrobatic scribblings which were the only drawings he dared commit to paper over the last two years? For those who haven't been following along, this is HUGE! I will post a picture of his typical drawing later when we return from the RDA but in the meantime, la la! Figurative representation! And an ACTION shot, no less! \n\n I was so thrilled by his creation, I'd pick up the magnadoodle and practically shove it in Steve and Susie's face every five minutes, my face in fish bowl distortion closing in on them from the sides. I'd squeal, LOOK! LOOK AT THIS! CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? They both would look (how could they not?) and smile and nod and generally do whatever they believed would provide them actual breathing room and a tiny bit of personal space. Once I explained the significance, they joined the celebration because they absolutely adore this guy, Fluffy, my son, their beloved nephew. I love that in a person.  \n\n The weekend was delightful. Fluffy, though dsyregulated by all that was new and different, had such a good time he didn't want to leave. Steve and Susie were lovely, gracious hosts, taking us on boat rides, preparing beautiful meals which we ate sitting down with knife and fork, a departure from a fair number of my meals which are taken as I stand before the open refrigerator, supping from my bare, cupped hands. \n\n Okay.

{"date": "August 09, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy, balancing backwards in the bath; July, 2006. Taken by Dave. \n\n A year ago, Fluffy was four and a half,\u00a0 still in diapers, still nursing, and still in stage 1. He was dead set against following my lead; the very suggestion that he toss a few items of laundry into washer was met with loud shouting, some thrashing, and a mad dash for the opposite end of the house.  \n\n I left the diaper thing totally alone to the mild panic of a few relatives who mentioned it during every phone call and lo and behold, it took care of itself. I had to put the boobies in lockdown to create a bit of freedom for me and so, at the end of last August while on vacation under the lovely light of Cape Cod, Dave and I cuddled Fluffy to sleep every night. Again, essentially, it took care of itself. Up until then, I had waited for him to magically and naturally wean himself but it was not to be; this was guy who was born to nurse. In fact, I\u2019m quite sure that he\u2019d be nursing well into adulthood if he had access and permission. I can see him, cupping the boobie like a grand Shakespearean goblet, sipping casually during natural pauses in conversation with his date. \n\n Following my lead, the backbone of RDI, the essential dynamic of parent as guide and child as willing apprentice has not, ahem, taken care of itself.  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s not what you call compliant. Now, I know not all compliance is good. I have a friend who\u2019s son is so compliant it\u2019s a problem. Not a safety issue, at least, not yet. But one of an underdeveloped expression of self. She passionately wants her son to have his own opinion, his own likes and dislikes. A bit of resistance in her case would be a good thing. In ours, a tiny bit of mindlessness would be delicious. \n\n To be fair, this isn\u2019t simply a mindful/mindless issue. My friend\u2019s son has a wonderful mind and Fluffy\u2019s resistance is not about having so large a mind and much more about anxiety, control and competence. Although he DOES seem to have the large mind and I always hope that doesn\u2019t sound obnoxious since I don\u2019t think his being brainy has anything to do with me or Dave. ANYTHING. He just has this brilliant mind and as much as I love it because it\u2019s fascinating and part of him, I\u2019ve also always wished in a Bewitched sort of way I could sneak into his room off and shave a few IQ points off with charming wiggle of my nose in exchange for some padding in the relationship building department. It\u2019s like my friend\u2019s son--I told the mom I wanted to mix our two boys together and then divvy up the compliance--a bit less for her son, a bit more for mine. \n\n RDI had some suggestions about dealing with this guide/apprentice issue (what is called Master/Apprentice with the term Master being used as the one who\u2019s got a handle on the skills and functions being taught rather than the one who is handling the whip) but they all backfired in our house and frankly, we just had to find our way with it. And here\u2019s what worked: tiny moments throughout the day, tiny moments of consciously doing an activity that focused on a particular objective. MY guiding principle was something Dr. Gutstein said during the parent 4-day training back in January: It\u2019s never about trying to GET MY SON TO DO ANYTHING. It\u2019s always about having an experience with my son where I was the leader, an experience where we each had a clearly defined role. That was the magic message for me. \n\n Think of RDI as a  way of being with your child  more than a therapy that you implement in discrete moments. It's a slowing down on  every front , a willingness to insert pauses,  use less language , use more gesture, more nonverbal communication in every way. It's a letting go of prompting as much as possible and shifting to an authentic desire to share your thoughts and feelings in an open ended way without trying to elicit a specific answer or response. In other words, take the pressure off, yourself and your child. Dr. Gutstein calls it the marathon mind--urging parents to get out of crisis mode, stop sprinting and prepare for a steady pace that you can maintain over the long haul. I think we're at that place now. Then think of putting on one clear and manageable thing at a time in a big shaker and sprinkling it here and there. Sprinkle sprinkle. Lightly. Like a refreshing mist. \n\n For us, lately, the shakers packed with objectives in Stage 3, Coordinating Actions, specifically, parellel simultaneous--doing the same thing at the same time. Going down stairs together! Pouring together! Jumping over waves together! Flying spaceships through the air together! Drawing lines in the sand together! Eating chips together! Tiny moments. Fluffy, ever alert to any subtle shift in the energetic field, always bellows at first. NO! I DON\u2019T WANT TO DO THAT! Most times, all it takes is a soft sigh of \u2018aw\u2019 from me and downcast eyes and he recants, OKAY MOMMY! MOMMY! NOW I DO WANT TO DO IT ! As long as I keep it short and calm and friendly, we are swiftly on the other side and I see him relax and even expand. A bit more. A bit more.  \n\n Now, many RDI-ers have just returned from the annual conference in Colorado where Dr. Gutstein and Dr. Sheeley pulled back the curtain on the highlights of the new operating system, RDI 3.0.\u00a0 A complete unveiling is slated for January, 2007 and I plan to update you all as soon as I know anything but as I was here, holding down the Fluffy fort, I know not a thing other than the phrase Operating System sounds technical and therefore, makes me a wee bit sleepy. But I trust in the brilliance of Dr. G. and Dr. S. and the initial reports have been overflowingly enthusiastic and I have four months to get the brain in shape to assimilate and integrate all the new information. Phew. \n\n I think of myself as an agreeable girl but the truth is, I like to take things at my own pace, in my own way. I've been known to shout, NO NO! I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT! at least,  inside  my mind. Is it a compliance issue? Or just a matter of a sturdy personality? I prefer to think of it as the latter, though I do wonder, will I grasp this new 'system' well enough?\u00a0  \n\n As to my son, we'll just keep sprinkling lightly. I love his sense of self. I just don't want his sense of fear to get in the way of him expressing this spectacular self out in the world.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/08/new_operating_s.html", "title": "New Operating System"},
{"date": "August 07, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Dave; August, 2006. Taken by Fluffy! \n\n Yesterday was the last day of the Newport Folk Festival, a yearly event that takes place a mere 30 minutes away. Dave has attended some of the time since we moved when I was newly pregnant. The first time, he saw Gillian Welch on opening night, Friday, August 2nd, 2001. How do I know? The date is seared into my tiny brain because it was Fluffy\u2019s exact 6 month birthday and the opening night of what would be seven months of alarmingly frequent night terrors.  What? Oh no no no! Six month-olds don\u2019t have night terrors!  I was assured by our pediatrician. Ah, the innocence of professionals! What they don't know will almost kill us. \n\n The following year we tried going as a family, you know, the way all the other families do with phlegmatic infants in slings and doe-eyed toddlers in tie-dye onesies unsnapped at the bulging diaper and curly blond children dancing in jolly circles clutching sweet potatoes that they lick like lollies. We tried it. Fluffy was a year and a half and already saying, BOB DYLAN in his lilting falsetto and we trotted of to see this icon\u2019s first appearance since being booed off the stage a million years ago when he dared to plug in his guitar.  \n\n The concerts take place at Fort Adams Park, on a treeless patch of grassy expanse, waterside. It\u2019s lovely but that year it was also wall to wall people under a scorching sun and I spent the entire day holding MY son, my hot, tired, overwhelmed son. While I\u2019d like to say hanging with the masses taking in live music on multiple stages is inspiring and hip and mellow, in actual practice, it fried my nerves. It was during the high alert time of my mothering when I felt my son\u2019s every moment of discomfort as if it were happening to me, which, in a way, it was. There was no place to go for relief, the crowd swelled and swelled in anticipation of Dylan\u2019s appearance, boats bobbed in the bay, groovy people bobbed all around me, we sat on our few square inches of festival real estate as Fluffy played with everything mechanical--the mini fans, the wheels on the strollers, the braking device, and my boobies.  \n\n Fast forward many years. Night terros are a distant memory. Fluffy is much more resilient. And so, we thought, huh, what if we tried it again, but this time, on our own? Imagine that: a whole day to ourselves, to play, to acomplish nothing, to waste time.\u00a0 Mama Mama generously offered to babysit for the entire day--Fluffy adores his time with her. The timing was perfect: We had a break in the unusually busy schedule of trips to Long Island, RDAs in Boston, visits from out-of town relatives, and weekend guests with their new puppy. Why not? \n\n Well, I guess the answer would be, because we have no idea how to have a whole day to ourselves. We were baffled, vague, overcome with fatigue and inertia. And worry. But what should we do? Should we really go to the festival? It will be hot. It will be crowded. And quite possibly loud. What will we eat? Will there be lots of traffic? Where will be park? Is there really a water taxi? How often will they run? Will Fluffy be okay? Will he feel abandoned? But we LIKE spending the day with him! Well, what about bagging the concert and just spending the day together? There\u2019s a concept! Just the two of us? Blank stares off into space. But where would we go? What would we do? We could go to the beach. Yes. I guess. But I LIKE going to the beach with Fluffy. \n\n Mama Mama came. It took us one hour to get out of the house. The first stop was a sandwich shop that was wall to wall teenagers in nothing but teeny bikinis and flip flops. Where do they keep their money? As we were waiting to order, I was telling Dave and story and when he interrupted for the third time I threw my fruit roll on the counter and said:  That\u2019s it! I\u2019m sick of you interrupting!  and he said: Hey, I don\u2019t want to be held hostage listening to your story. I like to make comments about random things from time to time. That\u2019s just the way I am. And I said:  Oh? Well, I like to stand outside alone while you stay in here and wait for our food. That\u2019s just the way I am. \n\n And so our date was off to a rousing start.  \n\n We got our sandwiches, got over our tiff, and ended up on the beach. Alone. It took another hour before we were relaxed. And then it was glorious. We had whole conversations. We lay like slugs on our towels. We lolled in the ocean, intertwined in each others' arms and then outstretched, riding the swelling waves. After a lazy stretch of time, we made our way to a dockside restaurant for dinner.  \n\n When we got home, Fluffy was happy as a clam, deep in the middle of dinner and his third freezer experiment of the evening.  \n\n Maybe next year we\u2019ll try the festival on our own. By then we\u2019ll have a year of practice. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/08/but_what_will_w.html", "title": "But What Will We Do?"},
{"date": "July 26, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Almost a year ago, we began our official RDI journey with Lauren, our RDI consultant. The first step was bringing Fluffy to her office a couple of hours away for an assessment, called the Relationship Development Assessment, or the RDA. It took place over three days, a couple of hours each day, capped by a separate phone consultation to discuss the findings, our reactions, and a plan for our home program. \n\n Fluffy, Dave and I took turns frolicking on the other side of the two-way mirror while videotape rolled. Some of the time she played with Fluffy while we watched. She had a wonderfully focused and relaxed way of engaging him. It was inspiring to see. I called it the three Fs: friendly, firm, and focused. Or maybe it was the four Fs because she was also remarkably flexible and somehow her being this way allowed him to do more. \n\n We came away from that at the very start of the RDI journey; Fluffy was at Stage 1, Emotion Sharing. He was also at the very start of allowing himself to be an apprentice and us to be his guide. In fact, this was the hardest part of our RDI journey during the first almost nine months. He has the Master/Apprentice thing down only HE was the Master and we were his Apprentices. Ahem. We made our slow slow progress, stumbling along the way, but finally connected to our own version of the four Fs somewhere around our progress from Stage 1 to Stage 2: Social Referencing. \n\n We're now at Stage 3, Coordinating Actions, or so we believe. This week is our follow-up RDA. It's the first time Lauren has seen Fluffy for any length of time in person. Throughout the last 11 months, we've been sending video footage of our games and household chores together so she's seen a lot of him at home, with us in our pajamas and morning hair and stacks of dirty dishes toppling over in the background on the counters. So, this week we will find out where we really are and set the course for the rest of the summer and into the fall when Fluffy and I will begin our homeschooling journey with both  RDI  and  Enki  as our curriculum. \n\n Aside from wanting the week to go well, I'm a little concerned about imminent shifts in the RDI program and assessment tracking which will be revealed at the Annual Conference in Denver this August. Parents and consultants will hear about it at essentially the same time though in different rooms. I wish that had already happened so we'd have the advantage of the new system during this long week. Oh well, maybe Lauren can apply it in retrospect. She'll have all our footage and the visit fresh in her mind. \n\n Okay! Off we go! I'll be reporting in each day.

The water is only about up to my knees but it's rising, my friends. \n\n I don't know what to do about not getting to my work. I don't. Either I'm suffering some acute but mysterious illness that drains my blood every evening around Fluffy's bedtime only to return it in my morning coffee or it's just age but I cannot stay up late anymore and expect to function somewhat normally the next day. Or shall I say, neurotypically? In any case, I can't do it.  \n\n I want to do it. I love the evening hours. It's like stolen time, like a credit card with promises of free money. Oooooooh, loooook! Wheeeeeee! I get the second wind along with naive inspiration and the next thing I know, I'm sipping ice coffee on the floor of my office and Dave comes in holding the clock and pointing darkly to the hour: 2 am. What are you doing? I know I know! I say, but I'm getting SO MUCH DONE! \n\n It's the schedule in part. It's been three weeks of back to back trips and RDAs and visits from out-of-town family and friends. Bam bam bam and while I love the chance to talk to grown ups and I'm floored by how well Fluffy is doing with the enormous and never-ending changes to his routine, I long to get back to some sort of dependable Kyra time that isn't spent doing laundry and running errands and moving piles of things from point A to point B. \n\n I thought it would be today but in the wee wee hours of the morning, before 3 ay em to be exact, Fluffy came down with double conjunctivitis which, thankfully, wasn't Coxsackie virus and it's accompanying rare but possibly life-threatening side conditions because I have to tell you, as much as I'm kow-towing to the great god who created 5HTP with it's calming and stabilizing affects, I still feel a tiny bit like Fluffy is going to die when he gets sick. There. I said it. And now you know I'm neurotic. Maybe you already knew? \n\n My son isn't the BEST patient in the world. By Dave's account, I scuffle through the house moaning\u00a0 pitifully,  but I don't feel well! I don't feel well! I don't feel well!  when I'm ill so maybe he is his mother's son. Ah well. The babysitter's been canceled even though I considered ushering her in... What's that? Oh no no no! I think he's just got something in his eye. No matter! Worry not!  But I can't subject her to contagion. It doesn't feel right. \n\n And so the work sits in the far reaches of my mind, growing dimmer, the invisible particles of an unidentified scent disintegrating and drifting out and far far away.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/08/back_in_the_pho.html", "title": "Back in the Phone Booth"},

And now I am up in the air, lilting this way and that, soaring on my rotund belly, arms outstretched in all my parade pageantry. Look at me! Up here in the air! Weeeeeeeeeee! \n\n The glasses mystery completely baffles. I'm telling you, Friday morning I was dashing about, putting together a package for my nephew's sixth birthday, my glasses alternately on my nose and atop my head since I am unable to find a box  without  them and unable to address the box  with  them. Such is my plight.  \n\n But on this day, the day in question, the day the glasses vanished into thin air, I was wearing them on my head when the doorbell rang and by the time I reached up to retrieve them, they were were gone. Gone, I tell you. Poof.

The glasses, they have slipped through the crack in the fifth--or is it the sixth? dimension.  \n\n The first day, I was mildly irritated. I've 'lost' my glasses so many times, I was sure all it would take was one careful swipe under my desk and voila. The second day I packed it all away with the distracted pat of denial, oh well, they'll turn up somewhere, pat pat. But they haven't and today is day number three and WHERE ARE THEY? HOW DID THEY JUST DISAPPEAR? Dave is calm and collected. Maybe you put them back in their case. Did you look in your glasses case? WHAT? WHO PUTS GLASSES BACK IN THEIR CASE? YES YES!

You'll find them if you keep looking. Don't give up even if it's hard. I know you can do it, Mommy! You do lots of hard things  and I said, Thank you honey, but please stop  poking  at that now and start  eating  it and he looked at me with fuzzy alarm so I got closer to adjust his napkin and push him closer to the table and I saw he was constructing the Millennium Falcon with blue  theraputty  and was not, in fact, near anything edible.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYDWZQ/qid=1152495493/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6214102-6318548?%5Fencoding=UTF8&s=hpc&v=glance&n=3760901"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/poof.html", "title": "Poof"},

This was test number three and I can safely say we will not be popping any more fluffy white corn for the Fluffmeister. No no.  \n\n First there was screaming. I don't mean crying, I mean screaming. I think some of you out there know what I'm talking about. Then the throwing of rain boots, biting, licking, and during the bath just now, repeated impersonations of passengers on the Titanic.  \n\n Oh, dear! No no! I said, nervously, as I reached for his arm to pull him back up. Gurgle gurlge! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Mommy! and then more gurgles and cackles and baring of the teeth. He was playing this game that was wildly entertaining, for him. He daintily picked up the tuperwear container with his foot and held it up high (beautiful extension by the way, nice line, good point of the toe) and then he would lean all the way down onto his back, arch his neck, deposit his head underwater, open wide his mouth and take on a rush of water. And then CACKLE CACKLE GURGLE GURGLE, my swift rescue followed by peels of maniacal laughter . \n\n Okay then! It's time to start checking ingredients for the  hidden  corn. I know it's everywhere, right?  \n\n I will say, though, Handwriting Without Tears is most definitely IN. I've been using it with Fluffy for the last couple of weeks and he is tearing through those letters. He's not a drawer or writer yet, just a talker and reader. He's been getting OT from Miss S. through the school system all year and he loves it, loves Miss S, loves his time in her special playroom. I met with her earlier this month and got confirmation that Fluffy's difficulty with drawing and writing is almost entirely an issue of perfectionism strangling his wrist before he can even try to sputter out a line. He wants it, no,  needs  it to come out perfectly and when it doesn't, he gives up and defaults to the same swirling circles and energetic scribblings he's been doing for the last two years.  \n\n But no more! He's making beautiful Ls, and Es and Fs and Ws (for his real name) and Ms (for mommy), with the roll-a-dough, the magnetic board, the wood pieces, the chalk, and crayons. On paper! He's making them in shaving cream, piles of beans, peas, and mustard! He's drawing them in sand! He's fashioning them out of salami rolls and celery! There's no stopping him! \n\n It's a brilliant program. Truly. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a multi-sensory approach that's fun, simple and designed to bring rapid success and therefore, confidence. And it's working! Today he drew a big beautiful sun with two eyes and one smiling face. Inside the sun was a blue circle (earth) and some green land. The sun was beaming. He was beaming. I was beaming.

And I\u2019m not talking about the three buff boys carrying a huge American flag as they jogged along the shore in tight bikinis, past the THRONGS of holiday beach go-ers who clamped cigars between teeth in order to energetically clap and cheer GOD BLESS AMERICA! which, because of the bronze tight tight bodies and teeny tiny bikinis and extra enthusiasm from the big brawny men in the crowd, caused Dave and I turned to each other and remark,  is it gay pride?\u00a0  \n\n No! I mean banner day in the realm of social interaction! Fluffy playing with my friend Rosemary\u2019s children, Aidan and Elise! And a random red haired boy! At the park! At the beach!\u00a0 For over 2 hours!  \n\n We met at the park, coming in separate cars, ready and able to make our departure if things went sour. I\u2019m practiced at this now, this art of quick reversal, of nonchalant departure. It\u2019s been nearly two years of setting out for a park, scanning for kids, happily settling in to play on our own and then, invariably, children materialize and circle in for the kill. Of course, they mean no harm. They only want to play ! Hi! Hi! Hi! What\u2019s your name? What are you doing? Can I play?  And when that doesn\u2019t work, when my son doesn\u2019t respond or responds by pushing or shouting BLEEBLA BLOOOTIAAAA, they turn their attention to me, a grown up! On the jungle gym!  Wanna see me climb? I can jump down from it! Wanna see! Wanna see! Watch this! Are you watching????  There was a time when I would love to see! When I would love to be at the center of a tumbling tangle of kids and maybe that time will return one day when my son can join in and hold his own. But for now, I mostly want to look at them deadpan and intone, No. I don\u2019t. Go away.\u00a0  \n\n But I digress!! \n\n Fluffy loves this park. It has several challenging sections, tippy tire bridges, rocking wood balance beams, rope swings, rings, etc. etc., and a couple of big play structures, one shaped like a boat. After taking himself through his own obstacle course complete with levels and check points, he arrived at the boat climber. A bit later, Aidan came through the park gates. Fluffy spotted him, flew off the climber and raced ahead,  Aidan Aidan! I found something I think you are going to love! Aidan! Aidan! Let me show you! Aidan! Aidan!  Aidan walked on, oblivious. I could feel the clutching in my throat as I watched Fluffy pursue Aidan around the park, up the long ramp, down the steps. I could feel Rosemary\u2019s worry too, Rosemary who has stuck by me through this whole journey, always calling, always inviting, always asking, always understanding when I\u2019d say no, no, not now, no. I could feel her worrying for me, for Fluffy. My mom was there too, and the three of us watched the scene held our breath and silently willed Aidan to turn around and give Fluffy his undivided attention.  \n\n It didn\u2019t happen.  \n\n And then the park exploded in a blast of white light.  \n\n You want it to work perfectly but they have to figure it out on their own,  Rosemary said, with a pained smile. It\u2019s true, I said. And you know what? This is real life. Not everyone will listen all the time. What if the world was full of me? Hanging on his every word? He\u2019d fall apart the second someone had another agenda. \n\n Fluffy didn\u2019t fall apart. He persevered until he delivered his news and then returned to his ship. At some point, Aidan joined him. And they played. They really played. I was nearby but I didn\u2019t insert myself. I didn\u2019t need to. Fluffy was deep into his pretend scenario, rattling off complicated instructions to which Aidan would respond,  OKAY! GREAT PLAN!  before rocketing off to activate the force field and hide the stash of gold. \n\n He stayed on that ship for an hour.  I can\u2019t abandon my ship!  he\u2019d shout, which was a perfect metaphor for what he was doing, not abandoning himself. He needed the safety of the ship and the breaks he got from the intensity of the interaction when Aidan would temporarily leave. When Aidan returned, they'd interact; when he drifted away, he'd stay connected, calling randomly to him from across the park.  \n\n After the park, we spontaneously set out to find take-out food and landed at a new beach for a picnic and a splash. All of us. There was swimming and eating and more playing. It was all through-the-roof huge. It was all off-the-charts astounding for Fluffy and I thought, we are past the storm, the supplement induced storm of a few months ago with all the extra aggression and anger and anxiety on top of his social confusion and fear, the WALL that seemed to erode all the gains made. We are on the other side.  \n\n It isn\u2019t this singular event. It\u2019s a shift in these last few weeks. Fluffy's whole body looks different, the way he races over to see what is wrong when he hears a child who is clearly upset, the way he sits by a 2 year old boy we met the other day who was crying, to be near him because the boy's sadness made him sad.  Why is he sad?  he asked the mom. It\u2019s hard for him to share his toys sometimes, she replied. Fluffy looked pensive and then said with a concerned shake of his head,  it\u2019s hard for me to share sometimes, too.  \n\n At the beach, he was bothered when Aidan wouldn\u2019t let Elise land in his pretend airport because it was for planes only and Elise was a rocket. Fluffy was on that and on that, sincerely rankled by her exclusion. He tried and tried to talk Aidan out of it but Aidan wouldn\u2019t listen and so he came over to me and said, sotto voiced,  I\u2019m going to teach Aidan a lesson . Aw, honey, why not just have him see what it feels like to have an airport where he can\u2019t land? and then let him land so he can see how fun it is for everyone to play together? And so he did that and Aidan relented and Elise landed her rocket and Fluffy rejoiced and talked about it all the way home, over and over, when he wasn\u2019t wondering  why why why do cows eat hay and not just the green green grass which they seem to love, Mommy, why?  \n\n Why, they eat both, honey. They save the hay for later when the grass is gone. They munch the hay and remember the soft smell and the green green blades in their minds and hearts just as the tiny mice did when they closed their eyes and let  Frederick\u2019s  warm, soothing imagery fill them up. \n\n The way this, too, will fill me up when we pass through the inevitable dry patches ahead.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394826140/102-6214102-6318548?v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/filling_up.html", "title": "Filling Up"},
{"date": "July 20, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t One of the seminars I attended at the ASA Conference was led by a panel of parents on the spectrum raising kids on the spectrum. They got their diagnosis after their children were diagnosed. One of the many things they talked about was the invisibility of this disability and the difference in how society responds to those with ASD compared to those with visible, physical disabilities. To the latter, society says, adapt and adjust! To the former, society says, remediate remediate remediate!  \n\n With the exception of one person, these people had aspergers. They had spouses and children. Most had jobs. They were making their way in the the world. I don\u2019t say that to take anything away from them, their valid experience, point of view, political self-appointment as the voice of ASD, and real frustration with the fear, ignorance and limited vision of those suffering from neurotypicality. But I did note there is an assumption that all kids on the spectrum are experiencing the same thing when they\u2019re not. And neither are their parents.  \n\n It was enlightening and I was glad to be there but I left wondering, where is the place for NT parents to talk about their experience? It isn\u2019t a lament of raising a child with ASD; it\u2019s a struggle to provide for their child, to give them a good life, a whole life, an independent life. I\u2019m all for expanding the breadth of acceptable neurology. I\u2019m all for respecting and broadening the scope of acceptable behavior. But when I hear angry calls to get away from the \u2018grief model of diagnosis\u2019, for aggressive slaps of CONGRATULATIONS! YOUR CHILD HAS ASD! I tell you, I pause. What is this? What is going on? What has happened to acknowledging the process? The human process of coming to a new understanding? Of moving through the unexpected to acceptance and in the process, changing, growing, containing more?  \n\n It reminds me of when my ex-husband left me. I met a woman who had been through a divorce years earlier. I barely knew her but when she found out about my situation, she flashed a clown smile and practically shouted, OH I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU! I wanted to punch her in the face. She danced around, boogying to the pulse of my new life. The freedom! The choices! The discoveries! The opportunities! But I was in the middle of the explosion and I needed time to sort through the mess, to step around and FEEL WHAT I NEEDED TO FEEL, grieve what was lost, and then slowly see what was now possible. My life eventually got better than I ever imagined. My new relationship happier and more realized. But I had to go through something to get there. Many people were uncomfortable with my process, with my hanging it out there, with my dark feelings, my fear, my sadness, my anger. They wanted me to clean it up, get over it! Or at least suck it up long enough so that they didn\u2019t have to see it, so they didn\u2019t have to let it rustle up anything in them.  \n\n Now, discovering your child has ASD is NOT the same thing. No no. Please do not misunderstand, pull my words out of context, quote me and then tear me to pieces! But, as with any profound change, there is a shift, and in that shift, a loss, and in that loss, grief, and in that grief, a process and through that process, an expansion or at least the possibility of an expansion that makes for MORE ROOM for GREATER SIGHT. Why the rush to push it away, brush it under the rug? What is threatening about it because I can only think it must be threatening for there to be this reaction. If it were only a matter of not relating or identifying with this process, wouldn\u2019t there be more curiosity?  \n\n I don\u2019t hear people acknowledging enough that ASD is a SPECTRUM disorder. Okay, right there. I should not say disorder? But I may say spectrum, yes? It is a wide spectrum with a wide band of expression and for lack of better word, severity. It often (always?) comes with other co-occurring conditions that increase the challenge both for the child and the parent raising the child who is trying their best to provide what that child needs most, for their happiness, for their actualization, because that is what parents are trying to do, help their child actualize. They have a role that lasts a certain length of time (usually) before they pass the baton, and they want to do their best by their child and for their child and the confusion and difficulty made by the perplexing nature of their child\u2019s unusual neurology coupled with the paucity of services and supports out there in the world and the level of misinformation bombarding our circuitry, well, it\u2019s a lot to deal with.  \n\n Some kids on the spectrum are socializing and communicating and moving on their own, dressing themselves, developing relationships, walking, talking, using the potty. Others are blind and having seizures, unable to physically navigate, still in diapers, eating through a feeding tube, struggling to communicate their feelings thoughts and needs and unable to connect to others easily for a whole host of reasons. It is so completely obvious to me that these children are every bit as blessed and precious and valued as any other child, that they need and deserve respect, love, education, care, attention, that their lives are as important as every other life. ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS??? And isn\u2019t is also obvious that their care is more complicated? That their parents are moving through something very different than most, certainly then what they anticipated? That the parents in the first group, on one end of the spectrum, the families on the opposite end and all the families in between are experiencing something that is hard? Couldn\u2019t it be possible that these parents experience a kind of worry and concern about their children every day? About their future? About who will care for them when they are no longer alive? Let\u2019s not sweep our arms across the room in a blind gesture of mild irritation, impatience and judgment for those that are, at the very least, experiencing stress and anxiety about providing for their children who\u00a0 require something more and different because they are not of typical neurology.  \n\n Yes, ASD is not just a disability issue but also a diversity issue. Yes, we can and ought to shift the message from tragedy to hope. Yes, we can shift the focus from a pressure to normalize our kids to have them be \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d to a genuine and serious effort to educate society, to move toward acceptance. One panelist, said, what\u2019s so awful about hand flapping? Why isn\u2019t it okay to hand flap in this world? Why can\u2019t we take the stigma out of the ASD diagnosis and the expression of unusual behaviors. Yes! I want to stand up and say,  Hand flapping is fine with me!  And,  Stimming is a stupid word! We all stim!  And,  Why do we have interests and passions and those with ASD have obsessions?  And,  Why don\u2019t we look more closely at our language and choose our words more carefully? To words of acceptance and inclusion rather than rejection and exclusion?  One goal, spoken by an autistic activist, was to grow a feeling of competence in those with ASD, to help them better navigate the social interactions that are a very real and everyday part of life. Yes, again! (RDI anyone?)  \n\n And while we\u2019re working to take the stigma out of an ASD diagnosis, let\u2019s also take the stigma out of talking about what\u2019s hard in dealing with autism. Let\u2019s stop pushing away the necessary process of acceptance that occurs when your child is diagnosed with autism. That is not the same as having a round table discussion of whiny parents complaining about how hard it is to care for their child, which I hear is a  big  problem in the NT population. Huh. Is this true?  I\u2019m  not hearing this but maybe I\u2019m out of it? \n\n And it\u2019s certainly not the same as thoughts of harming one\u2019s child. My god. Killing your child is mental illness. Thinking of killing your child is mental illness. Promoting the idea that NT parents of ASD kids are all straining against these sort of thoughts is fucking lunacy, dangerously irresponsible and quite possibly, mental illness. \n\n But for me, there\u2019s a tiny elephant in the room and it looks sort of like this: There is a difference between those on the spectrum who mostly \u201cpass\u201d and those that stand out. That is just the truth. It\u2019s harder if you stand out. If you sound funny when you talk or if you don\u2019t talk at all. If your pants are up around your armpits and your fingers are in your ears.\u00a0 If you look at things sideways. If you scream and hit rather than say, no thank you. If your typical stroll through the mall is following your tongue as it drags against shiny metal surfaces. It is. I want to live in a world where all of that is okay, where it ISN\u2019T harder, where no one scowls or laughs or wishes \"it\" would all just go away. I really truly do. In the meantime, we live in a society where wearing size 6 is a sign of being a fatty pants, where nursing in public is considered lewd and disgusting, where stepping inches out of the narrow and ever changing target zone of hip and cool and acceptable is cause for ridicule and sometimes, terrible violence. How close are we to embracing hand flapping? Really? Sadly, we are closer to abiding a careless, bigoted, greedy moron as the leader of the free world than rising above panic or alarm over a beautiful child flapping her hands off to the sides. \n\n Still, we must create the change we want to see. We must create a society that extends equality, respect, and acceptance to all. \n\n What and who is society? According to  Barbara T. Doyle , one of the ASA Conference presenters, it is Everyone. Everywhere. All The Time. Society is the one lady who sees how you are with your child in the checkout line; society is the class who observes how the teacher responds to the child\u2019s difficulty in the hallway; society is the group at the neighboring table who watches how you interact with your child in the restaurant. Society is everyone who sees you resist the urge to hurry up and get out when the going gets rough and instead, use the opportunity of being looked at to educate and demonstrate the child\u2019s unconditional value and worth. Every time. As best you can.    \n\n Doyle suggests coming up with your own definition of autism that is simple and direct that you can say in an instant so others can begin to digest it. Here is mine: Autism is a developmental issue that makes social situations and dealing with sensory things harder than the typical person.  \n\n She said many other wonderful things. Here are just a few: \n\n Put the relationship ahead of compliance.  (Do we really want our kids completely compliant? Consider someone saying this: Drink that up. Get in the car. Take off your clothes.) \n\n See all behavior as communication.  Don\u2019t seek to extinguish behavior until at least you understand what is being communicated. \n\n Respond to all communicative signals as quickly as you can. \n\n When you\u2019ve erred, when you\u2019re stuck, choose a respectful response  that minimizes the tension. \n\n Help eliminate the US versus THEM mentality  that is reinforced every time someone says something like, you are SO patient to deal with that every day! You are such a special person! God chose you because such and such and la la la. Phooey. The message is, YOU must be SO SPECIAL to be able to deal WITH THEM. We are not divided that way, or we ought not be. We are we. I do what I do with my son because I love him, I rejoice in my time with him, I learn from him and I am compelled to be the best mom I can be because it\u2019s important to ME.  \n\n What is this world we want to create? The one we don\u2019t have because, in part, we\u2019ve never tried to create it? Because up until now, we haven't seen the \u2018affected\u2019. We\u2019ve been busy keeping them in, keeping them away. But now it\u2019s time to bring them out. Bring everyone out. And here is what everyone needs: \n\n To be safe, to belong, to be valued, to make a contribution. \n\n And if we experience difficulty in creating this for our children, let us keep making the space to talk honestly about it.\u00a0  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newhorizons.org/spneeds/autism/doyle_myths.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/bring_everyone_.html", "title": "Bring Everyone Out "},
{"date": "July 12, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I got this idea from reading Susan\u2019s post over at  Friday Playdate  and if you\u2019ve never been, you ought to hop over there right now and reserve a martini.  \n\n I guess I never thought of recounting my day since I thought no one could possibly be interested in the minute by minute accounting Chez Fluffy but Susan made it all so very lively and entertaining, which is her way, so much so that I\u2019ve decided to dive in. My self-imposed rule is that I can\u2019t decide which day to do ahead of time. I have to pick this day, today, so here I go. \n\n At 5:00 am, Fluffy voice woke up me from a drooling sleep and I went in to ask what I always ask when he calls to me every night, Do you have to got to the bathroom, honey?  Yes . So we weaved down the hall and he peed mostly in the toilet but somewhat on the floor and a bit on himself which meant a change of pj bottoms. By the time we weaved back to his bedside he was wide awake and telling me something very pressing about Star Wars, his latest fascination, in a booming day voice and I began to silently pray. I climbed into bed next to him, pulled his puff up over both of us and whispered, It\u2019s still nighttime, let\u2019s talk about that in the morning.  \n\n Fluffy\u2019s voice woke me 2 hours later, this time from centimeters away. He picked up his thread with no loss of enthusiasm or volume while I lay very still with my eyes closed until he implored,  Mommy! It\u2019s 7:21 in the AY EM! Time to get up! \n\n We made our way to the kitchen where Dave was slicing doggie sausage treats for his morning walk with Beegu. I went directly to the coffee maker and started brewing a large pot. Dave left with Beegu as the sweet sound and scent of coffee brewing filled the room. Mmm. Coffee. Remember when I gave it up? Such folly! \n\n Since I wasn\u2019t actually drinking the coffee yet, I could not stand or even sit and so I laid on the floor next to Fluffy and played a game of stealing his nose, his ears, his mouth, and then his nose again. He stared and smiled and stared some more that soon he was inches from my eyeballs and wondered aloud,  Why white on the outside, then brown, then black? Why?  That\u2019s how people eyes look, I said.  Why?  he asked again. I smiled and shrugged, Huh. I don\u2019t know. \n\n Once coffee, yummy yummy coffee was ready, I sat on the couch. Fluffy used me as a backrest and read  Sardine . I stared out the window at the white sky and the doves sitting like beads on the telephone wire and beneath them, the weeds in my yard so tall and thick from the near constant rain rain rain, I could walk around bottomless and no one would be the wiser.  \n\n Dave returned and made us all toast. Post-toast, he and the Fluffmeister dashed to the playroom, boarded the Falcon Millennium, threw it into hyperspeed and set off for the DeathStar. \n\n I read showered, dressed, put away clothes, started a load of laundry, talked to my friend,  Kim , made the bed and began to clear a path in my office to my computer where I read a few blogs and checked email.  \n\n When the battle was won, Fluffy emerged from the basement and sat down for a victory meal. We ate breakfast, chatted, and worked on our Handwriting Without Tears. True to its name, there were none. Tears, that is. But there was much making of the letter I, with wooden lines, in chalk, on the magnet board, on each others back with index fingers, with crayons.  \n\n At 10:30, the sitter arrived to grant me 2 1/2 hours. They played in the yard until the clouds cracked open like eggs, then inside as the ground outside our windows found some way to let in more water. I tackled stacks and heaps and piles in my office and made one last great effort to find my glasses to no avail. Sniff sniff. I loved those glasses.  \n\n I called my doctor to apologize for flaking out on our appointment last week. I called my dentist to make an appointment for replacing a bridge on a tooth that is held together with safety pins and chicken wire. I called my butt doctor to say, can\u2019t we hold off on a follow-up colonoscopy since my last one and only one five years ago was squeaky clean? I mean, am I really at that point? Where I shuffle step to my ride that takes me to my yearly screenings and then to the CVS to pick up prescriptions from the pharmacist who calls me by first name? I paid bills and did 40 loads of laundry, dragged bags of recyclables to the dump, returned and picked up library books, bought groceries, and wrote a teeny bit. The teeny tiniest bit. \n\n 1:00: Lunch with Fluffy followed by a rousing game of blow the cotton ball around the table followed by the construction of several hundred space ships followed by a joint collaboration on a green and blue clay Yoda who sat next to us on a couch during a short screening of selected scenes from the movie, The Empire Strikes Back. After witnessing scores of light saber fights between Darth and Luke, Fluffy and I raced around wildly and ended upstairs with a bucketful of musical instruments and jammed. Sort of. Beegu came in for part of it but that was ill-considered and involved the forced removal of egg shakers, guitar picks, shoes, a tin can, and a pillow from her sloppy jaws so out she went again to the sheets of rain, booms of thunder, flashes of distant lightening.  \n\n 5:00: Dave came \u2018home\u2019 or rather, upstairs from his home office and did a rockin\u2019 2-man version of row row row your boat and various other things with Fluffy while I made dinner. We ate. Or rather, Dave and I ate, Fluffy gagged on one spoonful of applesauce because there was \"something crunchy in it\", deemed the pasta unsatisfactory, polished his teeth with a piece of chicken sausage and requested cracker mini-sandwiches and ice tea. He got the mini sands.  \n\n After dinner, I printed out the feedback from our RDI consultant on our latest tape, read it in preparation for our phone consult tonight, read emails, lugged the clean laundry upstairs, starting reading a new memoir,  Running With Walker , printed out directions to the Convention Center where the ASA Conference is being held tomorrow, brushed teeth, washed up and got into pjs, as is my way. It was 7 pm. Bedtime stories, lights out, singing, cuddles. Fluffy was asleep by 8:30. Dave had just finished cleaning the kitchen after having taken Beegu out for her second long walk of the day. We sat on the couch and had 20 minutes ALONE until the phone rang at 9 for our one hour consult. As soon as we put down our respective headsets, Dave was in bed, barely able to finish calling out goodnight before sawing zzzzzzs.  \n\n That\u2019s it. It\u2019s now 10:30. I\u2019m up. The house is asleep. The rain has stopped, for now. The dishwasher is rolling hot water around and around, chugging in place, like my mind. \n\n A year a half ago I would have spent literally hours and hours playing magnatiles with my son, following strict rules about shapes and colors combinations, riding waves of sudden frustration and anxiety and anger, hearing  No! No! No!  over and over at the slightest suggestion of anything slightly new, like let\u2019s paint, let\u2019s color, let\u2019s go for a walk, let\u2019s sing, let\u2019s dance, let\u2019s bang the drum, let's breathe out first and then in-- NO!   \n\n Today we played a wide variety of games, creating, inventing, turn-taking and transitioning with genuine flexibility and genuine sharing and genuine fun.

{"date": "July 14, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I have so many things to say but I haven\u2019t the foggiest notion of how to get them from my brain to the page. If only I could lean down and wipe my head all over the keyboard, like I was slathering a piece of toast with peanut butter, eh ah ur aaaaaagh. There. Do you see? Is it all clear now? \n\n First of all, would everyone using blogspot please amend their sites so I can leave a comment? Is that awfully bold of me? I would so love to say a bit of something after reading all the lovely posts but I am disallowed. In light of the current situation, let me say,  MothersVox , I\u2019m loving the 5HTP! And I\u2019m getting it at the local health food store--100 mg., once a day. With food. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s everyone\u2019s teacup, but so far my sister's come on board and she's feeling an upswing. My husband, on the other hand, feels nothing save for maybe a vague racing sensation or could that be the pop-tarts? No one knows for sure. \n\n Secondly, I want to write about the ASA Conference I\u2019ve been attending this week but my thoughts swirl around my frontal lobe like tiny funnel clouds, coming close to the ground but not yet touching down. Overall, it\u2019s been very positive. I love having chunks of time to roam in the grown-up world. Fluffy loves having extra time with his dad. Dave loves battling the waves with his intrepid son on what would normally be workdays spent at his desk in the basement.  \n\n I  can  say, I\u2019m in a very different place than I was a year a half ago. I\u2019ve  gone through something -- concern, worry, discovery, grief, fear, retreat, panic, reassessment, acceptance, and through it all I\u2019ve learned about myself, my son, my husband, my friends, and a bit about Autism and Asperger\u2019s. I\u2019m not all done now. I\u2019m not slapping my flour-coated hands together and sitting down to a warm slice of bread but I do feel MUCH CALMER. Everything\u2019s going to be okay. It really is. Fluffy is going to be fine. More than fine. I don\u2019t have to take away his Aspergers. I don\u2019t even know what that means. All I need to do is what I\u2019ve been doing--be his mom. \n\n You know, all this talk about remediation versus acceptance can really be tossed out the window as far as I\u2019m concerned because I never needed to be convinced of my son\u2019s value, intelligence, rights to education, respect, and understanding. I accepted him all along.\u00a0 But I can change my language if that will clarify my standing, if the word remediation closes off communication. I can say, my goal is to teach my son. That is all. My goal is to teach my son whatever I can to help him make his way in the world, so that he has the best shot at creating a life he loves. \n\n I was reminded today of a great quote by Mahatma Gandhi. \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world.\u201d And what is the change I wish to see?

{"date": "July 10, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Isn\u2019t it true that no one knows what autism is? I'm asking. Isn't it true that no one knows what it\u2019s caused by? Isn\u2019t it true that some kids lose their diagnosis after various treatments? De-toxing? Play therapy? ABA? RDI? Diet and supplements? No! people shout! Autism is INCURABLE AND LIFELONG! These cases of cure and recovery are clearly cases where misdiagnosis was made! These kids COULD NOT HAVE BEEN autistic in the first place!  \n\n How do you know? In a child? When you don\u2019t have a clear definition of autism? Other than a list of behaviors and missed developmental milestones that mostly constitute what isn\u2019t happening: pretend play, a certain kind of social interaction and exchange, eye contact, a general lack of curiosity, interest, involvement in OTHER rather than in just SELF, pragmatic language, typical, appropriate language or simply language at all, period. If your child has the core characteristics--I won\u2019t even call them deficits, just characteristics, then a diagnosis of spectrum disorder is made, or autism, classic, mild, moderate, severe, PDD-NOS, or Aspergers. (The jackpot! If only we could get our child to recover enough to have an Aspergers diagnosis! Whoopee!) \n\n I'm sorry; was that outloud? Oops! Back to my point.  \n\n It seems to be the only way to have everyone agree on a diagnoses of autism is\u00a0 if a parent is given that diagnosis for their child and then, after one or many or some combination of therapies is given for a number of years, the diagnosis of autism remains. Then the diagnosis was right; they MUST have had true autism because they didn\u2019t \u2018recover\u2019 because autism can never go away. If they move off the spectrum, as can only be measured by CARS and ADOS these days, then, they WERE NEVER AUTISTIC in the first place and had some other disorder, issue, allergy, problem, virus.  \n\n Is that it? If so, we have to come up with more terms so that those who are truly autistic and never lose their diagnosis, the ones that are asking us to stop trying to cure them or fix them or recover them can have their autism and eat it too. They can have it, indeed do have it, embrace it even, but now need recognition, respect, understanding, assistance, adaptations, inclusion, exclusion, and whatever else only they are qualified to articulate and that they clearly, deserve.  \n\n I am not being flip. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be autistic because I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not autistic and so I don\u2019t get it. But I do get we need to include and accept and learn about this difference called autism. AND I do think we ought to come up with some word or phrase to describe kids who have social interaction issues, language/communication issues, information processing issues, sensory integration issues and allow the parents of these kids to pursue therapies that help alleviate the confusion and discomfort and address the deficits and teach these kids what they need as best they can. And if, at some later point, they are no longer so challenged, we can say they had this (insert new word or phrase here) and now they don\u2019t; we can say they\u2019ve been, what? recovered? remediated? neurologically reset? that they have been given support that allows them to participate in a more typical way than, maybe, if they hadn\u2019t received intervention X or been given supplement P or had play therapy Y or had Z taken from their diet.  \n\n I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making sense here--does anyone know what I\u2019m talking about? \n\n I just read,  Daniel Isn\u2019t Talking  and  Let Me Hear Your Voice  and even though these are vastly different books, I was struck by a few things all at once most likely because I read them quickly and back to back and that makes a small brain like mine throb.  \n\n First of all, I was struck by how very much like RDI ABA  can  be. Some of what Catherine Maurice did with her two children was very RDI-like. Much wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s true, but some was. From what I gather, ABA programs can vary quite a bit but seem most effective when they are modified to the individual child by flexible, sensitive, and gifted therapists.  \n\n Secondly, why the fury over Catherine presenting her children as having recovered from autism? People are still outraged by it, saying they MUST have been misdiagnosed! I understand that many people are disheartened when they start ABA and find their own children don\u2019t recovery the same way or at all or nearly as fast. But does that mean it didn't happen for her kids?  \n\n Which brings me to the third thing. I worry that mothers (parents) are being led to believe that unless they do \u2018it\u2019 RIGHT they are failing their kids, that their children\u2019s fate lies in their own particular talents at play therapy. Or at being a brilliant manager. Or at finding the perfect therapist. Or at securing gushing rivers of cash to pay for it all. This ghastly pressure, the flip side to having \u2018caused\u2019 the autism, is the responsibility to CURE the autism or be held up as not doing it right, not doing enough, believing enough or being proactive enough. It seems there is no place where mothers can go without taking a hit. \n\n Lastly, the book, Daniel Isn\u2019t Talking is a novel, not a memoir. Marti Leimbach told some of her own story through fiction. How much is based on her real life with her autistic son? Who knows, but I did note that she allows her protagonist, the mother of Daniel, to wish her son was normal, Yes!! Can you imagine! To say THAT WORD! Normal! To have her character wish, at some earlier points in her story, while watching her son sleep, he could have an ordinary childhood, be an ordinary, normal kid.  \n\n Frankly, I found it refreshing. It was a fictional character, of course so we could all forgive her political incorrectness, character weakness, momentary mommy grief, but really, isn\u2019t that an okay thing for a mother to think? To say at first? Or to say periodically over a lifetime if one\u2019s child has the \u2018real\u2019 autism and they watch a lifetime of struggle? To grieve the loss of the ordinary from the extraordinary?\u00a0 To then talk of providing opportunities to strengthen weakness and nurture strengths? Because all kids are extraordinary, all of them, but only the bulk of them progress along ordinary developmental pathways, and only the one out of one hundred and fifty or something I think it is now, are  extraordinary  kids progressing along  extraordinary  developmental pathways. And parents are raising them. And I think it\u2019s safe to say, sometimes they are wishing it all was a bit more ordinary.  \n\n So, Catherine recovered her children, retrieved them from their autism. NO! They weren\u2019t autistic in the first place! Okay, then she helped her children get over a mysterious assortment of challenges of unknown origin that were interfering with what many would call typical development. She used her own, modified version of Lovaas\u2019s ABA program, and some pretty intense hugging. (Don't get me started on THAT.)   \n\n I believe her. Bears and Samahria Kaufman of The Option Institute, used their own version of behavioral/play therapy approaches, now called The Son-Rise Program, and recovered their son, Braun. Catherine discredits The Option Institute in her book and I wonder, why? I wish I could find her, find some update on her and her children. Ah well, she wrote anonymously and all my googling at this late hour produces no recent information on her or her family. I\u2019d want to ask her,\u00a0 why diss them? I went to the Option Institute\u2019s initial training. I found it very helpful. The child play facilitators work in similar ways to RDI and to Floortime and maybe even ABA. They certainly take charge. They each have their own differences, but the basics are there, 1:1 work, play, interaction, challenge, all modified slightly to adapt to the individual child. When it works, it seems to me it\u2019s working in the same way. You need a way in. Once you\u2019re in, you start forming new pathways. That\u2019s it in a nutshell.  \n\n OF COURSE I'M OVERSIMPLIFYING!! I\u2019m an RDI gal. I think that much is clear by now. I don\u2019t do Floortime per se, but I do a modified version of it every time I get on the floor and play with Fluffy. I don\u2019t do ABA, but I suppose you could say that I do some tiny form of it in that I do reward and reinforce wanted behaviors and discouraged unwanted ones. There is praise here, there are treats here, there are consequences here, there are isolated, structured, Kyra-led teaching moments here. I don\u2019t do Son-Rise anymore but I did a version of it with Fluffy for the first few months of our \u2018home program\u2019 and during that time Fluffy made the most dramatic changes he\u2019s ever made in the shortest time. He went from hardly looking at us and crying and getting angry (and genuinely terrified) at the idea of ANY pretend play to voluntarily suggesting playing with masks and looking at us a lot. How much? I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t taking notes and at the time we weren\u2019t running tape, but it was remarkable and noteworthy and those who saw him play with us were impressed and excited. We were thrilled. Fluffy was too. \n\n What\u2019s my point? I guess I want to stop all the infighting. I want to find a way to allow the parents to talk about therapies and interventions with their spectrum kids without this being an insult and assault to those in the neurodiversity camp. I want the small bugs that live in my eyelids to stop crawling around my arms and legs right now as I type because it\u2019s almost 2 in the morning and I can\u2019t sleep. I want all of us to provide an open, eager audience ready to be educated by the varied and valuable autistic population of this world. I want there to be a different name for those kids who are called autistic at one point and then not at a later point and I want those kids to be part of an important discussion that looks at diet and environment and toxic preservatives and biology and the great mystery of brain development and the great wonder and power of human exchange.  \n\n Of course, they can include the truly autistic kids and adults in that discussion too, if it's okay with them. Hell, toss us all in there. Like I say, I\u2019m for the widest embrace possible.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385517513/102-6214102-6318548?v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449906647/102-6214102-6318548?v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/isnt_it_true_th.html", "title": "Isn't it true that no one knows what autism is?"},

Or shall I say, despite  our  skin in  her  teeth.   \n\n Yes, yes, I know she\u2019s a puppy and puppy\u2019s nip, especially one made from two very mouthy breeds: labradors and standard poodles. But what we were getting wasn\u2019t so much nipping as chomping. And baring of needle teeth and dark rumbling growls and mad dog stares. She was Kujo. And we were terrified. \n\n The last four weeks have been like this:  That's it; we're getting rid of her.  Aw, look at that face! We'll keep her forever!  Ach! The devil seed is in her! Feed her to the sharks!  Oohh! Don't worry! That won't scar! \n\n It's been a rollercoaster. We went so far as to make up FOR SALE flyers and notices and she was  this   close  to going to a friend\u2019s niece or into an aluminum can but then we enrolled her in puppy kindergarten where she pranced onto the field beneath her glowing halo. What a star. She sat! She lay down! She came when called! She rolled onto her back and revealed her vulnerable underbelly to every other puppy and generally made us look like lunatics. The instructor would looked at her and then at us, as if to say, ah, okay now, who\u2019s psychotic?  \n\n At school, she excelled. At home, she gnawed on shoes and feet and fingers and rugs. At school, she heeled. At home she trotted from room to room leaving behind ponds of pee pee and piles of poo. Grab me a couple of ice cubes, will ya\u2019 Beeg? We\u2019d ask and she\u2019d prance over with a little canister full of the stuff. But give her 8 weeks of crating and walking three times a day and wild celebrations when she relieves herself outside in the proper place and she can not, for the life of her, get the house training thing down.  \n\n Enter  Cesar Millan , Dog Whisperer, with his clear confidence and adorable salt and pepper hair. Hallelujah! I ask you, is confidence not sexy? Is it not??? We ordered the entire dvd set and have been watching them compulsively from a prone position of calm submission on the floor. We are not dog. We are human. And we are smitten! He IS pack leader! Come east, Cesar! Come walk us! We need a consultation! \n\n I love watching him. I love his body language; it\u2019s mesmerizing. I love his calm. I love that he loves his job. I love that he hikes four hours in the California hills with his pack of 40 + dogs, each one once so aggressive they were headed for the great dog run in the sky but now part of a peaceful, if motley, pack.\u00a0 Rottwielers, pit bulls, and more, happily panting behind this man. I think Cesar may, in fact, actually be a dog. \n\n I love the simplicity of his message which I have boiled down to this: (1) Do not treat dog as human. Dog is dog. Human is human. (2) Dog needs three things: exercise, discipline, and affection, in that order. (3) When you give your dog affection, you intensify their state of mind at that given moment.  \n\n So, if you\u2019re dog is wild and excited and you pet, you intensify the wild and excited state of mind. If your dog is scared and growling and you pet, you intensify the fear and aggressive response. Only give affection when your dog is in \u2018calm submissive state of mind\u2019. The trouble is never the dog, says Cesar. It is always the human. And so, he rehabilitates dogs and trains humans, over and over. In his show, you watch that unfold and the results are amazing. And fast. \n\n Cesar, come east! Come whisper in my ear! We could always use pointers since we\u2019ve haven't seen an episode about a problem puppy. Of course, we follow your advice as best we can. We stand with our shoulders square. We walk with confidence. We  channel  you, Cesar! But the reason I want you here is for me. There must be some way to apply Cesarese to my life, to the areas where I am in need of rehabilitation, where I have fallen into bad habits.  \n\n For starters, just who has been giving me affection while my mind has been in a weakened state? Who has been petting me while I\u2019ve eated economy size bags of potato chips? Who has been scratching me behind the ears each time I surf the net rather or talk on the phone rather than write? Who has been yanking me onto their lap for a big cuddle each time I neglect to exercise? I need Cesar to snap the choke chain every time I lose my focus but I guess that\u2019s not terribly realistic. I guess it\u2019s up to me to lay down, \u2018rules, boundaries, limitations\u2019. I guess I need to live by his trusty triumvirate-- exercise, discipline, and affection. Only for me, I\u2019ll have to modify and include affection at every step. I need me the affection. \n\n So here's my new perscription for rehabilitation: Affexercise, affectipline, and affection. \n\n EDITED TO ADD: go  here  to read a funny article. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dogpsychologycenter.com/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25love.html?ex=1152244800&en=22a402900f45f120&ei=5070&emc=eta1"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/whisper_to_me.html", "title": "Whisper to Me"},

I know our atmosphere traps light. Would we always see the stars if we had no atmosphere?  \n\n Today he wondered how fast the earth was traveling through space, not around the sun but around its own axis. I said I didn\u2019t know but I supposed out loud to my sister, in whose backyard we were standing, that one could figure it out if you knew the distance around the earth (I don\u2019t, offhand) since we do know it completes a turn every 24 hours. My sister and I shook our silly heads and said we didn\u2019t get the whole thing, why don\u2019t we just fall off, for one, since in our cartoon imaginings, like Harold and the Purple Crayon or the boy from Le Petit Prince, some of the time we must be sticking out sideways from a big sphere or hanging upside down like bats and  how  does gravity  do  it and  why  don\u2019t we fall off like like pennies in an upturned hand?  \n\n Fluffy thought for a second and said,  I have an idea: gravity doesn\u2019t really pull you down, it pulls you to the earth so if you are upside down, the gravity wouldn\u2019t pull you away, it would pull you back up, back toward the earth.  And then my sister and I said, like, wow, totally dude, and sipped our silly seltzers and splashed our silly feet in her silly pool while gravity pulled our silly boobies back back back toward the center of the earth from whence they came.  \n\n I know. Just go with it; it's Father's Day and I'm all out of creative juices after toiling over a card for my very own dad.

{"date": "June 06, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Sometimes I am overwhelmed by the autism community and the debates and the semantics and the explanations and the misunderstandings and the intensity.  \n\n You know, I\u2019m just trying to help my son feel safe in the world and find a friend or two. I\u2019m just trying to give my son what he needs. I\u2019m just trying to help my son have a strong enough base so he can be put to bed for the evening without me lying next to him.\u00a0 I\u2019m just trying to find my way back to a life that I recognize, a tiny bit, a life that includes some of my own work, some of my own friends, some of my own autonomy.  \n\n I don\u2019t speak for Fluffy because I don\u2019t have to. Some parents are speaking for their autistic children as best they can because their children can\u2019t speak for themselves. I applaud them. They are loving, devoted, educated advocates for their children. \n\n Fluffy speaks well for himself. So well, it blows me away. Like the recent discussion we had at bedtime during which he told me,  I have a wall in mind. Sometimes the wall is made of thick thick glass that is bent from the anger that pushes on it all the time. This anger seeps through tiny holes in the wall from time to time and mixes with the craziness that scampers around free.\u00a0 The craziness scampers around free and sometimes mixes with the seeping anger that always pushes against a wall that is always there.  (Was it always there? I ask)  No. it didn\u2019t used to be there. The anger used to just come in a burst and swirl around causing anger energy blocks and frustration energy blocks that would make my heart beat very fast. Sometimes, the anger pushes so hard it breaks the wall and BANG hits the craziness and that is a bad, bad feeling. Sometimes there is a sadness energy block and makes my heart slow down and when that happens I lose a lot of my power and speed.  \n\n These are all direct quotes, unedited and unsolicited by me. \n\n Why does my son have this wall? When he used to not have the wall? What  is  the wall? Is it him? Is it his growing awareness of what is hard for him, confusing for him? Is it the embodiment of the thing that separates him from his ability to connect and interact with kids at the park? the playground? the neighborhood kids? How do I help him with the wall?  Can  I help him? Will the wall disintegrate as he becomes more organized? more able to integrate the input and information that literally, swirls and bombards in the social dynamic exchange?  \n\n I don\u2019t know. I do know my son says he has a wall in his mind with anger pushing against it. I do know he sings songs about killing kids when a little girl approaches him at the playground. I do know he isn\u2019t going to kill the little girl but I don\u2019t actually know what he will do if she gets too close so I get close too and I smile at both of them. But I am watchful. \n\n I keep saying to everyone,  it\u2019s not a good time to come by  and I think of The New Yorker cartoon with the guy on the phone saying,  Hmm, it's not a good time. How about never? Does never work for you?  \n\n I hope it\u2019s not a never situation. I hope we find a way to knock the wall down or live more happily with the wall, use it to prop ourselves up for a broader view.  \n\n I don\u2019t know but I do know this: I'm not trying to fix fix fix cure cure cure. I'm not desperate to make my son into a different person, to TAKE AWAY THE AUTISM, TAKE AWAY THE ASPERGER'S. I'm not sure he's NOT an autistic or that autism ISN'T who or what defines him. I'm not sure if he will ALWAYS have autism or will NOT have it one day. I'm not even sure what that means. Really. I'm not.  The world is on an continuum.   \n\n Sometimes I just want to say, I DON'T CARE, PEOPLE. You go argue the details, the meanings, the language, the nuances. I am busy here, day to day, minute to minute, with a live human being with whom I share a remarkable connection and love. Someone to whom I am devoted beyond what I can measure or describe. Someone I try to nourish, encourage, see, understand, hold, treasure, nurture--in other words, mother. \n\n  I\u2019m just trying to find a way to provide for my son\u2019s biggest happiness and richest future without sacrificing a chance at my own. That is an on-going balancing act and at the end of day, I often feel I've let us both down. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/06/the_wall.html", "title": "The Wall"},
{"date": "June 09, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Okay! You\u2019ve weighed in on my  Question of the Day : a book about raising kids on the spectrum can be funny! Of course, it would be everything else too since we are talking first and foremost about kids and parenting and once you\u2019ve entered that territory you are in the rainforest, my friends, all three rich and mysterious levels at once. I could go on about the sudden downpours, the mystery, the thick, fecund air teaming with life known and unknown but at some point, the metaphor will just get embarrassing. \n\n \n\n Back to the book! Now that you\u2019ve voted on it, it\u2019s time to help write it. \n\nThat\u2019s right. This is a call for manuscripts. I am co-editing, along with the magnificent  Vicki Forman , an anthology on raising special needs kids. Why? Because I want to read that book and it isn\u2019t out there. Because there are many wonderful anthologies about parenthood, about motherhood, about life with kids and the crazy wacky things they do and how it shapes our world and our view and our very selves but not one of them is a compilation of beautifully sharply poignantly brilliantly movingly crafted essays by writers who also happen to have one or more special needs kids knocking on their office door or the bathroom door or the car door or where ever you happen to be in that moment trying to get your good idea down before it\u2019s gone like so much sleek thigh. \n\n \n\n I need a book that expresses my experience. I have one child. He\u2019s the only child I\u2019m going to have. I had an image of motherhood and then I gave birth and I was in a whole new world. As the years went by, I wondered why I didn\u2019t relate to the mothers I was meeting and then I discovered why. My son has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. I was parenting in a different sphere. Mine was not the territory of parenthood only, it was the territory of parenting a special needs child and that is different. It just is. How it\u2019s different covers a whole range of areas and degrees depending on the child, his or her age, the family, the disability, but that it is different is unmistakable. \n\n \n\n One unmistakably difference is that parenting kids on the spectrum involves a simultaneous rooting to one\u2019s instincts and casting out blindly to find direction since instincts don\u2019t often serve in this instance; instincts can leave you stranded. And feeling stranded as a parent can make you panicky.\n\n\n \n\n I want to read about these kids and their families. I need the company. I need the stories. I need my pack. I know there are a lot of people like me who need this also. We all are surrounded by friends and family who love us and feel for us, who don\u2019t really get it but want to. Of course, there is not one experience to get, there is not a single voice for the community of those with special needs kids. There are countless voices. \n\n \n\n We are looking for essays that are essays that are darkly funny or sweetly buoyant, essays that are irreverent, poignant, moving, or trenchant, essays that bring the reader into the experience through the back door and describe scenes and experiences that are at once familiar to any parent and also deeply unfamiliar. \n\n \n\n I will be posting updates including a website dedicated to this project which will include all submission guidelines.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vickiforman.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/06/anthology.html", "title": "Anthology"},

{"date": "June 24, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy extending the hand of friendship; May, 2006. Taken by Dave. \n\n My son is referencing up the wazoo! I think we are closing in on the end of Stage 2 which means we are on our way to Stage 3! Coordinating Actions! the tender beginnings of playing with others! At least, that\u2019s what it feels like to me. \n\n In fact, Fluffy\u2019s been naturally coordinating here and there lately which makes sense. Development isn\u2019t linear, clink clink clink, like beads on a string; it\u2019s more like a weaving up, down and across, creating a length of fabric that strengthens and deepens in complexity. That said, certain things must be in place before other things can happen: You can\u2019t coordinate with another person if you don\u2019t look at them or can\u2019t make sense of what you\u2019re seeing.  \n\n We do cooking projects because, well, it\u2019s fun and also a great way to work on  RDI , especially the Master/Apprentice relationship, a key component of social development. Most ASD kids don\u2019t ever get that the adult in their life is a trustworthy guide, someone to look to for help in understanding his world. Without this sense, they are out on their own, searching for dependable patterns and decodable systems, things they can figure out and master, places they can feel competent and successful. It\u2019s often the world of numbers and letters, train or bus schedules, the land of sorting, amassing facts, becoming an expert on oscillating fans, etc. etc. since this is where the world is predictable; this is where they can be right, feel safe, know what to expect; this is where they can feel a sense of mastery.  \n\n That is the greatest motivator for us humans, according to  Dr. Gustein , the need to master, the need to feel competent. It\u2019s a greater motivator than fun. I believe it\u2019s true. \n\n We cook together because Fluffy knows he gets access to the ingredients, because he can\u2019t wield all the cool tools and appliances without assistance and so he\u2019s willing to be my apprentice and this is  dreamy  for me since most of the time the Master/Apprentice thing is very clear in his mind: HE\u2019S the master and I\u2019m the apprentice and I better hop to it!  Do it, Mommy! More blueberries! Get Captain Underpants! Read it to me while I eat! This one is squishy! This one has a spot on it! This one has a stem on it! Get that stem off! Mommy! Why aren\u2019t you reading?   \n\n He\u2019s developed a bizarre visual sensitivity (which sends him gagging and demanding the offending item be immediately taken from his sight!) but so far, he doesn\u2019t have a lot of tactile defensiveness so touching things doesn\u2019t send him flying from the room--it sends things flying into his mouth. He LOVES to sample everything I put out on the counter, scanning for novel items, like the powder egg whites. I really have to be careful. He\u2019ll dive into anything. And forget the sugar. He\u2019s like a flat out junkie with the sugar. Although who isn\u2019t?\u00a0 I used to tear packet after packet at restaurants when I was a kid, stacking little white mountain peaks on my tongue.  \n\n The other day we made bread for the first time and not only did he reference beautifully for what to add and how much, once the dough was made, we did a little tandem kneading. It was so satisfying and peaceful! I silently handed him his chunk and started kneading mine. He looked over, studied my movements and then joined in. I kept it rhythmic and simple; he stayed with me the whole time. At one point, he smiled into my face and said, \u201cI\u2019m doing exactly what you\u2019re doing!\u201d Yes! I said, smiling back. Yes, you are! My boy! Kneading dough with me! Coordinating his movements! Feeling the deeply satisfying harmony of being in sync with another person!  \n\n At one point, I lifted my dough ball high in the air, hesitated, and then slammed it down on the counter. It was risky since this kind of thing can easily become a gateway for chaos. The dough could fast become a space ship, a cannon ball, a missile. But no. He lifted his in the air with me, hesitated with me, and then slammed it down at the same time! With me! We did it again and again and then went back to the kneading. No chaos. Simple synchrony. At one point I stopped and nodded to his dough, as if to say, your turn, you lead. And he did! He smiled. I smiled. He kneaded. I kneaded and got to say, \u201cI\u2019m doing exactly what you\u2019re doing!\u201d  \n\n At the end, we fashioned our dough into fat logs and plopped them in bread pans to magically rise while we went to the park where Fluffy did not yell or push or sing songs about killing kids but where he  did  touch a boy\u2019s arm gently and ask what game he was playing. A spy game, the boy replied. Fluffy then raced across the field to the underside of a giant weeping willow, his secret fort, and instructed me to keep an eye on the spy in case he got into trouble. He\u2019s in trouble! I called, not sure what game we were playing. He tore back across the field and searched and searched but the boy was gone.  Where did he go? I wanted to help him!   \n\n He wanted to help him! He was playing! With the boy! He was doing it from 100 feet away but still!  \n\n Stage 3, here we come.

It\u2019s so fun to have the back and forth, something that was nearly impossible a year ago. He\u2019s doing it with other people too and I have to exercise a fair amount of restraint not to physically attack those who don\u2019t respond. MY SON IS TALKING TO YOU! HE\u2019S ASKING A FOLLOW UP QUESTION! A FOLLOW UP, DO YOU HEAR? \n\n Ah well, I guess it\u2019s one of those things that life will teach him: not everyone hangs on his every utterance, perched on tip toes, head tilted up and to the side. And not everyone will strain to decipher his story line as he rapidly talks and shovels in food simultaneously. And no one, not just me, will actually catch what he\u2019s saying when he\u2019s talking from inside the car while his conversational partner darts through house many many yards away, grabbing last minute essentials.  \n\n What can I say, he\u2019s a deep thinker and a long talker. He\u2019s got the gift of gab, as Dave says. His mind is a pair of bicycling legs, always going going going, which is why I often snort awake in his bed after putting him to sleep only to find him wide-eyed next to me, staring at the ceiling, puzzling out the area of a circle.  \n\n I will say this:  The wall  is down. Fluffy reported this fact during teeth brushing about a week ago. All gone. Since then, we had a very enlightening talk about bombs and fuses which I will now describe. \n\n It was closing in on bedtime and he was short two hours sleep from the night before. At the last possible minute, he remembered some unfinished computer time and even though little warning lights were flashing across my retina, I relented. When the timer went off, he super glued himself to the keyboard. When the cool newspaper part came up at the end of the game, the part he likes us to read out loud, we put our foot down and he yanked back the inner panel of his dinosaur pjs and revealed a bomb strapped to his skinny torso with brightly colored pipe cleaners. \n\n Dave and I, rock solid disciplinarians that we are, caved. We allowed for 3 bonus minutes to read the paper but when we turned back, the screen was blank and then Fluffy collapsed.  \n\n He threw himself all over the house,  I WORKED SO HARD--SO HARD--AND IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING! FOR NOTHING!  It was such a grown up lament, so odd to hear it from his small form. There was much crying and calling into the air,  WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE IT BETTER? WHAT SPECIAL TREAT CAN I HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR IT?   But all we had was our empathy and our metaphors about disappointment being like a feeling boo boo and the body is wise and knows how to heal it just like his tetanus shot. Sometimes our sounds of sympathy helped, sometimes they made it worse; he would wind down, remember and wind up again as if freshly assaulted.  \n\n We tried the old D&R, distract and redirect, which only worked for a second, then right back to metaphor, this time stressing the importance of revving  down  our engine at night, not  up . Fluffy brightened at this and said,  Another way to express it is that it\u2019s like a bomb went off and the fuse, instead of being long like it might have been in the morning, was short because it was night!  Dave and I exchanged looks since this business of having short or long fuses is something we\u2019ve never told him.  \n\n As is his way, Fluffy went on to describe his bomb system in detail, the three modes and three types of bombs in each mode with the least bad mode holding a a big bomb and long fuse, a middle bomb and long fuse and a small bomb and long fuse. The next least bad mode had a big bomb with medium fuse, a medium bomb with medium fuse and a small bomb with medium fuse, and the worst, as you can fill in here, was the mode with the big bomb with short fuse, etc. etc.,  \n\n When he finished, he was MUCH calmer and the sun was just peering over the horizon because, have I mentioned? the gift of gab and also a little speech thingy which extends the ends of his words in a kind of echo-stutter and almost all of it comes out at top volume: \" MommE-E-E-E-EEEE, the WORST mode, the WORST mode, the WORST mode-ode-ode-ode-ode is the BIG-IG-IG-IG BOMB WITH THE SHORT FUSE!!!\u201d \n\n We showered him with sounds of love and appreciation and told him how proud we were that through all that, he didn\u2019t hurt himself or us not once, didn\u2019t hit or kick or punch. He said, that only happens when there\u2019s anger and the wall, not with bombs and fuses. Silly! \n\n We finally climbed into bed for stories and songs and cuddles and after all the excitement, I was out like a light. My son, not as much. He looked up at the glow in the dark stars for who knows how long until I startled awake, my mouth a fizz with spittle.  Mommy,  he whispered,  you know what I wish for? I wish that you won\u2019t die before I\u2019m ready.  \n\n Me too, honey. Me too. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/06/fuses_long_shor.html", "title": "Fuses: Long, Short, & Medium"},

{"date": "June 26, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I think the question on everyone's mind tonight is, why don\u2019t I have sex more often? It\u2019s so darn fun! And it\u2019s free, invigorating, a sure-tootin\u2019 tension buster, it burns calories and helps cement the relationship, I find, even more than a careful assessment of which counter was adequately wiped down, even more than parental critique, even more than shouting,  Don\u2019t be such a fucking prick!  \n\n It\u2019s always been fun, of course, though it got grim and full of effort when I couldn\u2019t get pregnant, like trying to scrub out a spot. We would roll up our sleeves, sigh, and go in to tackle the job together, full of conviction. Thank god we tossed the whole business in the hands of the white coats with the injectables and follicular harvesting needles so we could get back to sex without accomplishment!  \n\n Then we became parents, and, well, I have to say, it\u2019s true. As much as I swelled with a greater love and devotion to my husband than I had ever known after I gave birth, I also found myself swatting away his roaming hand with an alacrity and vigor that completely threw me. It was like a reflex, like one of those mechanical arms, or like a giant hairy mosquito had landed on my boob out of nowhere. AH! AWAY! SWAT! Not that Dave is like a giant hairy mosquito! Not hairy! I mean, of course, hairy in a manly way, yes, but not OVERLY hairy.  \n\n Fast forward five years and the situation has improved somewhat but sometimes the notion of having sex only sounds good in a purely  theoretical  way, like doing volunteer work or organizing the closets. And if you\u2019re groovy at all with the sleeping arrangements or if you\u2019re child has GINORMOUS sleep issues and attachment issues and spectrum issues, who has the privacy or free time? And when you do shake some time loose and your husband is standing before you with that look on his face, even going so far as to strip naked and prance about with the dishtowel \u00e1 la pole dancer, I mean, one of YOUR husbands out THERE, of course, then you want to grab him by the leader hand, so to speak, and rip the bedsheets to shreds such is the heat of your passions, but for some reason, you feel conflicted because you had sort of been looking forward to a home-pedicure or a night of bad tv or a few minutes of frantic eating in front of the open refrigerator door. \n\n What is my point? Oh yes! 5HTP! Er, I mean, sex! And it being fun! And free! And slimifying!  \n\n That is cause for celebration.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/06/more_praise_for.html", "title": "More Praise for 5HTP"},
{"date": "June 03, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t One day while making hard boiled eggs, I was called away on an important errand. I don\u2019t remember what the errand was but trust me, it was critical. The pot was on the stovetop; 6 eggs shivered inside the boiling water. I summoned my husband from the basement where he draws cartoons and told him about the eggs. Would he turn off the water in 10 minutes?  Of course.  Would he remember? Roll of the eyes,  Yes! of course!  Did he want me to set the timer? Mocking expression,  No, dear, I think I can handle it.  And so I was off and he was on, so to speak. \n\n Several hours later I broke through the front door, waved away bilious smoke and fought my way to the kitchen. The timer was beeping; the smoke alarm was screaming, the blackened pot was fused to the burner, egg shells and petrified egg pieces were strewn about the house as if detonated. Two globs of egg white were stuck to the 10 foot ceiling still encased in a fragment of shell, like alien paratroopers. And my husband rocked on in the basement, carefully outlining little talk balloons over the heads of his characters. \n\n And why am I telling you this? I don\u2019t know. \n\n I don\u2019t capitalize when I send emails. My funny friend, Cheryl, aka, Ch\u00e9 (my partner in revolution, as she says) tells me it\u2019s the mark of a gal who considers herself either much too busy or much too important. It may be true although it may just be a mark of my deterioration. On all fronts. I mean no harm. I mean no offense. I could take the time to press the shift key at all the right moments but then I would lose some other key function, like talking without crying or driving without crashing.  \n\n Cheryl makes me laugh. She lives far away. Across the country. I just sent her an email, requesting that she fly out immediately and be on hand for merriment. I need more funniness in my life.  \n\n The puppy is horrible. She bites us all the time. We are all afraid to go outside, even to walk across the lawn to the trash for fear of the biting and the nipping and the barking and the baring of tiny sharp needle teeth. We cower at the front door and observe her through the screen. You go.  No, you. \n\n Okay. And here\u2019s my question of the day: Can a book about raising kids on the spectrum be funny? Not  just  funny, other things of course, too. Moving, enlightening, enlarging, engrossing, riveting, revealing? I know it can be beautifully written. Consider all the amazing blogs out there. I keep thinking of Ann Lammot talking about how she went to the library when her dad was dying of brain cancer and asked the librarian for the funny books on brain cancer and how she imagined the librarian replied,  Oh, yes! Right over there next to the comedies on Spina Bifida. \n\n So. That\u2019s my question of the day.

{"date": "June 27, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t My luscious sexy smart friend  Julie  wrote this post that I read tonight after yanking the morning glory-type weeds that are choking the life out of the day lilies in my front garden bed while still in my 2-piece from the beach. My street is pretty busy and the houses are close together and despite my going 4 miles on the elliptical every morning for a month or so now, I\u2019m not in 2-piece bathing suit wearing shape. Trust me on this. I did just get a bikini wax, opting for the regular and not the thong since heavens! I\u2019m not up for hanging my buns out there although I wish I could because I think they would feel delicious and alive smack up against the salt air and the grainy sand.\u00a0 I think I may have erred not going for the thong wax since I have the italian in my blood and the hair... I suppose I could braid it or something festive but I ended up hunching over for a hour with the tweezers.  \n\n Anyway, I was out there weeding in my bikini and Fluffy was by my side playing a superhero game with one of my panty liners, Stickyman, who warded off evil, occasionally attaching himself to the stem of the day lilies and then zooming off, panty liners wings outstretched and glorious. Cars and neighbors went by and I didn\u2019t care what anyone thought about the whole scene. It was SO LIBERATING!  \n\n Not that I would care about Fluffy playing with my panty liner. He\u2019s been fascinated by all feminine hygiene products for ages. I always keep a few in my purse and the car for emergencies, for both of us.  \n\n No. It was not caring about being out there in, basically, my underwear.  \n\n You see, I\u2019ve been going to the beach every day in the afternoon, not counting the days when endless torrential rains made me slam into the slider and collapse on the floor weeping, MY GOD! MAKE IT STOP! IS THERE NO END TO THIS TORMENT?  \n\n My son loves the beach, the waves, the salt, the air, the sand, the french fries served in cardboard boats beside a sea of ketchup. I love the beach too. I\u2019ve been feeling very lucky lately, full of gratitude as we used to say in the 12 step program, about all the gifts in my life. Maybe it\u2019s the 5HTP talking or maybe we are finding our way over here with the Imago couple\u2019s counseling and the RDI and the elliptical and the sitter help lined up so I have a couple hours to get to the writing.\u00a0 Okay, maybe it IS the 5HTP and that, my friends, is fine. My brain needed to be nudged out of the groove the needle was dragging in. Whatever it is, the beach is a tonic.  \n\n It is also full of teenagers in tiny bikinis and dozens of saline implants. As an aside, had any of my high school classmates gotten a breast augmentation, we would have chided them mercilessly! How silly! We would have chased them down the hall with pointy pencils and thumbtacks! These beach teenagers are young, like in their teens or something. They are nimble and brown and lean and young! Even the hefty ones are lean! They are be-tattooed and be-pierced and they all have Breck hair except for the few that worship Paris Hilton in their bleached locks and white plastic be-rhinestoned sunglasses and maybe even fringe, was it fringe I saw? on one of the bathing suits? Next to the teenagers are the twenty something set who maybe don\u2019t have as much bosom but who also don\u2019t seem to be able to fully button the front fly of their jean skirts despite rock hard tummies. I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t look the same when I do that at home from the gas and the bloat.  \n\n The point I\u2019m trying to make is that I STARE at all of them! Stare! At the bodies! They're all so lovely! All of them. Only, I bet  they  don't think so. They think they're fat or flat or too short or too gawky or too hippy, that their knees are puffy, their nose has that bump, their hip bones don't peekaboo out far enough beneath their super low, ultra low slung, low riders. I want to expunge these misunderstandings. I want to glide toward them in my orange toga, arms benevolently outstretched.  \n\n I\u2019m prone to like bodies, I just am. I think it\u2019s that I like looking at people, at all types of people, at the lady with the shelf boobs that are comically, impossibly huge and jutting out straight like a bad Benny Hill skit (that's redundant, isn't it? because has there ever been a good Benny Hill skit?), or the woman with legs up to her armpits and then quickly a bit of body tossed in at the end. I\u2019ve been looking at the girls though with a bit of wistful remembrance and a sure sense that I am now, clearly, in a completely different category, the category of ladies who I used to babysit for, the category of moms, of Mrs. So and So. I\u2019m not a total shmo. I\u2019m really not bad for my category, but, what I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s a  completely different category  and though I may have fleeting thoughts of Could I still...? and Do I at all...? the truth is, No. Not like that. Anymore.  \n\n I think I\u2019m finding the freedom in that. And despite those asinine bumper stickers I see, freedom IS free. \n\n p.s. don't forget to click on the main photo of Julie's  Bodies  post to see her fabulous Mermaid Parade pics! Oh la la!

I love you! You're so great! I'll never forget you! \n\n\n\n I was going to post Fluffy's first morning thought,  how could Mama Mama recognize me when I was born if she'd never met me before?  and how he told me I was his favorite person in the whole world and how lucky\nI was to have only one kid because if I had more, how could  he  be  my  favorite person in the whole world? \n\n Instead, I sit here at the computer and weep.

{"date": "May 19, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t And now for something completely different: Andrea J. Buchanan\u2019s collection of essays,  It's a Girl: Women Writers on Raising Daughters.   \n\n This is the third anthology edited by  Andi  that I\u2019ve had the happy opportunity to read, after  It\u2019s a Boy: Women Writers on Raising Sons , and  Literary Mama: Reading for the Maternally Inclined , co-edited with  Amy Hudock .\u00a0  \n\n The writing is all wonderful but here are my standouts:  The Food Rules  by  Ann Douglas ,  Breasts: A Collage  by Rachel Hall,  Baby Fat  by  Catherine Newman ,  Twenty Minutes  by Jill Siler, and  Isolation  by  Barbara Card Atkinson. \n\n I\u2019m tempted to reprint  Isolation  in its entirety but I\u2019ll resist so that you\u2019ll have the pleasure of reading it along with all the others in your own copy of the book because isn\u2019t that a necessary tactile experience? feeling the paper between your fingers? feeling this thing that Andi made from the stories that she and the other contributors made about mothering or almost mothering or longing to mother the daughters in the lives they are all making together? \n\n Maybe it\u2019s the mother in me, but I want you to read it so much that Fluffy and I plan to have another blind drawing from the names of all commenters on this entry and will send off my copy to the lucky winner. \n\n In the meantime, here are a few pearls of wisdom from Atkinson\u2019s,  Isolation :  \u201cNo man is an island but every new mother is a sandbar, with regular tidal flooding and the occasional threat of submersion.\u201d \n\n On the urge to hold our children:  \u201cDoes it fade? or will I be a wizened old woman, hunched awkwardly as I attempt to blow raspberries against the belly of my exasperated, restrained fifty-year-old?\" \n\n On her daughter being a tween:  \"It\u2019s her job to knock down the fences I erected simply by being here before her and it\u2019s my job to repair them as best I can.\u201d \n\n As always, I love reading the writing. As always, I relax and recharge in the company of these women\u2019s voices. As always, I feel nostalgic for a time passed: my son\u2019s first few months, the newness and preciousness of my mommyhood, and awe at mystery of what will come: the march into teenage years, the memories of my own childhood, my relationship with my mother and father that raising Fluffy will surely unearth in me. For even though I\u2019m a woman raising a son with nary a daughter in sight, there will always be collision and creation from the dance of who I am, who he is, who I was and who we are both becoming that is part of raising children, no matter the flavor. \n\n There much more to say, specifically about the complicated dynamic of being a girl and raising a girl, of being a woman and raising a woman-to-be that was fascinating to read, how we feel about our bodies, our power, our roles, our choices, our expression of our femaleness. It\u2019s why I longed and feared having a daughter--all that INTENSITY. But lo and behold, I was blessed with a boy who will be my only child and, frankly, I can\u2019t imagine things getting more intense than they already are.\u00a0  \n\n So, maybe having a daughter will have shattered illusions, birthed epiphanies, and brought my own particular femaleness into sharper relief. I\u2019ll never know.

She was pierced through the heart with desperation and loneliness. She longed for the seven other dogs in her pack, for the farm with its fields of white sheep puffs aimlessly wandering about looking for someone to keep them in line. She was skittish and ill at ease and then one day, she bit Fluffy. In the face. \n\n It was horrific and shocking and, thankfully, not a skin-breaking bite. But, understandably, it terrified my son. We had done nothing but reassure him that Mouse  would not bite . Never. Unless, of course, you skewered her or jumped off the roof onto her back, etc. etc., but other than that, she was a guarantee, a gentle, child friendly dog. Back on the farm, the two sons of my friend who placed her with us would routinely stretch her lips open to the floor and tie her ears in boy scout knots and nothing. Not a peep. \n\n Fluffy was amazing about it. He processed the whole even through his tears, as if he was in therapy, his brain and heart weaving an understanding. After a few hours of separation, we brought them together for a little healing. Mouse was calm and gave him kisses. We said,  she's saying, I'm so sorry . Fluffy said,  thank you,  and they smooched a bit. My friend wasted no time. She arrived by dinnertime and took Mouse home. She was mortified and apologetic, wondering if Mouse had some hormonal imbalance from the spaying just before she arrived? Some other ailment? She couldn't make sense of it. It was as jarring as if she herself had suddenly reached over and sunk her teeth into my ear. \n\n It turns out, Mouse just needed to be back home. After a few days, she returned to her winsome, confident, happy self.  \n\n We spent a few weeks being dazed by the whole course of events. And then, yesterday, Beegu landed.  \n\n She's a little labradoodle from a breeder not five minutes away and she's the most adorable, high stepping, romping and rolling thing alive.

{"date": "May 29, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019ve had a glass of wine so forgive me; I\u2019m feeling a little sloppy. I don\u2019t normally drink wine but when it\u2019s around it\u2019s sort of fun, like a party, like wearing contacts.  \n\n There is much going on in the autism community what with the murder of Katherine McCarron and the Autism Every Day video that is not like a party, that is not fun. At all.\u00a0 Some things are too hard to post about and some things are clearly too hard for people to look at.  \n\n The death: I am flattened by grief, by outrage, by a confusion that goes beyond words. All I can say is that killing is, in my opinion, always an act of insanity and killing your child--my god! I\u2019m swept into a greek tragedy. I can\u2019t hold the image or thoughts in my mind. I need to have my eyes and brain poked out with hot daggers, with ice picks. How could it happen? Not just to an autistic child but to ANY CHILD? Where is the mother instinct? It has to be seen as madness. It is madness.  \n\n The video: I felt for these families. Our situation is not like these situations but I felt for the stress and isolation these mothers expressed. I hated that they talked so frankly in front of their kids. Didn\u2019t they realize that their children could hear them? I hated hearing that mother talk of driving off the bridge with her autistic daughter. But this was not autism entirely; this was a slice of autism for these families. Yes, they chose to call the video  Autism Every Day  but for me, it was  Autism, in Moments,   For Some . I think it\u2019s important to remember that these sort of short films are part of a whole--not the whole. They shed light on one section. There needs to be many more shorts, hundreds, to light up other sections of the landscape before one can begin to say, This Is Autism. \n\n I\u2019m not sending this film around to friends and family. I\u2019m not linking to it from here. But maybe it will spark some dialogues that might not have happened if the film hadn\u2019t been made. Maybe someone might approached a friend with a child on the spectrum and say, what do you think? Is that what it\u2019s like for you? No? Sometimes? Tell me more.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n I clicked around the blogosphere and read posts and comments, sometimes leaving my own among the company of some outright rancor and I wonder, is there room in the autism community for the neurotypical parents of ASD kids to talk about what\u2019s hard? Is there room for that? For us that to be part of the conversation? Is there room to say as this video did in part, come see how this is not what you may think it is; come see that sometimes our kids don\u2019t sleep AT ALL; sometimes our kids run into traffic; sometimes our kids needs aren\u2019t accommodated or considered in the school system and yet they need to be educated and finding a way to honor that is sometimes painful, perplexing and infuriating; come see how our efforts to address health issues are depleting our resources and stretching us to the brink; come see our stress; come see. \n\n The Autism Every Day\u00a0 video doesn\u2019t tell my story. If you read this blog you will hear some of my story. Some. I can\u2019t tell you Fluffy\u2019s story. That\u2019s up to him.\u00a0  \n\n I call the killing of an innocent, beautiful, perfect, sacred child horrific and tragic. But I don\u2019t call the video despicable and I certainly don\u2019t say it\u2019s responsible for an act that is outside the realm of my imagining.  \n\n All voices of parents raising children on the spectrum need to be heard. All voices of people living on the spectrum need to be heard. Do you see? It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s contradictory. It\u2019s emotional. It\u2019s matter of fact. It\u2019s impossible to pack into a neat little package. It\u2019s not ONE WAY or the other. It\u2019s unwieldy. It\u2019s life. And it needs our energy, flexibility, and courage to find a way to hear, and hold, it all. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/05/not_fun_at_all.html", "title": "Not Fun At All"},

{"date": "May 31, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy is reading. He sits on the couch and flips through his Captain Underpants books and reads whole paragraphs with words like \u2018restroom\u2019 and \u2018furious\u2019 and \u2018urinals\u2019 and \u2018poopypants\u2019. He makes a mother proud. Thanks to his dad, he\u2019s heavily into  Dav Pilkey . He told me how to navigate to his website which he does on the weekends when he\u2019s allowed to use the computer with internet access. Under supervision, of course.  \n\n We discontinued one of his supplements, a magnesium with extra B1 and B6 and it seems to be helping enormously with a recent bout of aggression. Things always go along in waves over here, alternating cycles of progress and what looks like regression but the last five weeks were sprinkled with an almost continual rain of hitting, pushing, licking, and kicking. It\u2019s awful to think the supplements may have contributed. Ach. All I want to do is give my son good nutrition. I never gave him baby or toddler vitamins since he was nursing for decades. I never bought into the urgency of those things--supplements, fluoride drops, etc. etc. since he was always robustly healthy. Aside from the pelvic kidney floating around in the middle of his belly like a yogi third eye and the UTI that led to its discovery, Fluffy is one healthy dude. No ear infections, few colds, great appetite, and wonderful wonderful poopypants, if I do say so myself. \n\n We did a metabolic analysis to see what, if any, vitamins or minerals were deficient. It was easy as pie--collecting a morning pee in a jar. Fluffy loves those experiments and helped me mix the powder in the test tube, shook it up with a grave expression, loaded the package with ice packs. The results were amazingly detailed: charts of metabolic pathways in all sort of important cycles, Krebs, Calvin, photosynthetic, heavy wash and rinse, the works. It showed some significant deficiencies in a few areas and we, working with a naturapath, set out to correct them, little by little.  \n\n Whatever. Sometimes I just throw up my hands.  Fllleeeeuccch . Like just then. I threw them up. \n\n For now, the vitamins and supplements are out the window; the only things we\u2019re keeping are the oils and the enzymes. For now, we\u2019re just living our life as simply and calmly as possible, with tasty healthy food, lots of play, RDI, and some good old fashioned sensory fun. For now, we\u2019re saying,  \u2018sorry, it\u2019s not a good time to play\u2019  when the neighborhood kids come through our front gate; we\u2019re saying,  \u2018sorry, not right now\u2019  when sandy kids come over to join our beach play; we\u2019re saying,  \u2018sorry, maybe later\u2019  when kids race over to take turns with Fluffy\u2019s glider planes; we\u2019re saying,  \u2018sorry, maybe next year\u2019  when we\u2019re invited to a friend\u2019s cookout, we\u2019re saying,  \u2018I don\u2019t think we can make it\u2019  when we\u2019re invited to a playdate; we\u2019re saying,  \u2018it\u2019s just not a good time\u2019  when a friend calls to ask about dropping by. \n\n And in the meantime, we give Fluffy love love love and yummy attention and hope hope hope that no one tells us again that he needs social skills groups and more practice with other kids and more time around people as if his difficulties in this area were something that could be remedied by osmosis, like a human air freshener rather than something that we need to respect and open to and continue to learn about and trust in as both something that is okay and something that may very well be transitory. And in the meantime, we bolster up our help department so that Dave and I get breaks and dates like we had last night when we went out to eat and chatted like old friends.  \n\n I\u2019ve heard some news lately about couples breaking up, about couples not able to talk honestly with each other, about couples wondering what happened to the tenderness and safety they used to rely on in their relationship. And I thank the lordy lord that Dave and I have found a way to keep talking, over his incessant singing of  Joy to the World  and his St. Bernard slurping of cereal in the morning and his mysterious hearing loss and his allergy to starting a load of laundry and, to be fair, over my incessant correcting of his parenting and my mysterious disappearance into my office at the tail end of dinner, and my flouncing about the house like Isadora Duncan except when I am stomping about like an African tribesman or moving imperceptibly, like I'm on hold with Oliver Sacks, all the while proclaiming my right to be the  unencumbered me! me! me!  while outlining the margins on how he is to be him.    \n\n Last night over succulent calamari, we clinked glasses, looked deeply into each other's eyes and cooed, isn't it great that we're constantly telling each other how much we drive each other crazy? Isn't it dreamy?

It was good to get away. It stripped away the chronic tension to reveal the sadness lurking below.  \n\n It\u2019s better this way. I\u2019ve actually enjoyed the last three days since our return. I\u2019m moving at a snail\u2019s pace. I\u2019m not snapping at Dave. I\u2019m far more present with Fluffy and since he and I are so connected, so inextricably linked at the mysterious level of spirit and soul, he is calmer than he\u2019s been in weeks. When I am off he is off which makes me more off since I tighten a bit under the weight and responsibility of how much I affect him, how much I affect his mood. But there it is.  \n\n I had a high colonic  ('Hi Colonic!!\" ) while in Arizona at the suggestion of my stepfather. So funny to say that but my mom married her boyfriend of over 12 years back in the fall and now Dave calls him my dad as in, why\u2019d your dad get a colonic in the first place? which he did as part of a total cleansing program since the discovery of his renal carcinoma about a month ago. I hope he doesn\u2019t bristle at my public mention of it here but maybe the blogosphere will send out great gobs of healing vibes and his upcoming surgery will go without incident and with speedy recovery. I\u2019ve been feeling puffy for about 15 years so I decided to hop on the table and hike up my paper jammies just to see what exactly was going on my large intestine and let me tell you, it was quite a sight. \n\n Yes, that's right. I'm now going to tell you about my medically assisted evacuation. \n\n The set up is remarkably relaxing. You lay in a purple room, calming instrumental music wafting through the air, under blanket and against a stack of pillows much like you\u2019re about to get a facial. But you don\u2019t. Instead, you watch as a sterile one-time use only plastic tube sends the contents of your ascending, transverse, and descending colon out of your body and then a stream of doubly sterilized warm water under mild pressure is sent back inside to coax, loosen, and dislodge debris from every crack. It all sails by. Bye bye. At the tail end, a steady stream of frothy foam bubbles its departure as the gang of resident yeast is chased away like a clot of rioters. It was painless. The therapist and I chatted on a wide range of topics through-out, most notably about her cancer she cured in 12 weeks with almost daily colonics. Who am I to say? All I know is I felt very light afterwards, very light and free of shit. I could not say an untrue thing.   \n\n If you\u2019ve had one, you know. You talk about it everywhere, over oatmeal and scrambled eggs, over grilled sausages, lentil soup, and pot roast.  \n\n It\u2019s launched me on my own cleansing protocol which will hopefully turn my depression around and if it doesn\u2019t, then off to the psychiatrist I will trot for a prescription of something. I can\u2019t stay in the dark neighborhood of my mind where the thoughts are morose and circular. I don\u2019t have the time. \n\n In other news, Fluffy abounds with astounding creativity in thought and expression. He also blows me away with how well he expresses his feelings. One night on vacation I sunk to that place where I didn\u2019t like my child. I hate to admit it but it does happen from time to time. Things escalated rapidly in that way that makes me feel like hurling furniture against the wall with a growl although if I try to explain it later to someone without kids I feel all haywire and picasso as I sputter about how out on the ledge I was about my son not getting dressed or refusing to put on his shoes or continuing to lick the ceiling or something like that. Anyway, in this instance as he was hitting me with the tube of sunscreen or doing the peace rally passive resistence hang I said something like, \"I-don\u2019t-like-what-you\u2019re-doing\" in that obnoxiously measured voice and his face crumbled and he said,  oh mommy, when you say that I feel like you don\u2019t like ME  and then my heart fell to the cement in my belly where it flattened out and began to turn brown. Because he was right. When I said that, I didn\u2019t like him even though I was using that  language , you know, that language where we think we can hide. It\u2019s human I know but that doesn\u2019t make it feel any better; I don\u2019t like ME when I\u2019m like that. \n\n It passed and I felt around and we were both still in one piece and I saw I hadn't ruined him yet and the next day Fluffy dreamily offered up his own Esop fable:  Mom, I have an idea. I think the very first hyena was named Ena and when she met other animals she told them her name and they said, \"Hi Ena!\" and then they all started laughing and couldn\u2019t ever stop and that\u2019s why they\u2019re called laughing Hyenas.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/03/cleansing.html", "title": "Cleansing"},

That\u2019s what I do when I\u2019m rushing and nervous and I am both right now because in a few short minutes I need to leave for my periodontal surgery; the time has come for MY many shots of Novocain. Ach! As I rush, I bump into things and send them flying and then crashing to the floor. At least we have hardwoods most everywhere so things bang but do not shatter except for in the bathroom where the unforgiving tile just pulverized a small yellow bowl. Now I fear we will all have tiny sunshiny shards of pottery embedded in our bare feet when we get up in the middle of the night to pee.  \n\n My update will have to be brief. \n\n You know, I\u2019m not so much depressed as sad, sad about lost friendships and the sparseness of my own grown up life. I will post about it more later as it\u2019s been on my mind since our Arizona trip although it\u2019s hard to do because it\u2019s so personal. I know, I know. I talk about pretty personal things here but the truth is, it\u2019s all filtered. I keep a journal for the feelings most raw, for when I am at my most vulnerable.  \n\n Dave and I moved here when we were newly pregnant and I haven\u2019t formed very close friendships other than the one that fell apart when Fluffy\u2019s challenges became apparent. She couldn\u2019t be there for me and wasn\u2019t up for sorting through the disrepair that came as a result. I tried several times but she couldn\u2019t do it and so I gave up. She still isn\u2019t. So even though she calls from time to time, this thing between us goes unmentioned and although my MIND tells me that she did the best she could and blah blah blah it also tells me, What\u2019s the point of getting together in my tiny amounts of free time for a bit of socializing when it can't be very real? When I need it most?  \n\n Two other much more long-standing and dear friendships also fell apart during that same time for the same reasons. These two other women live a distance away so we don\u2019t have the added awkwardness of running into each other at the deli counter but the pain and sadness in those cases is much greater, the loss more acute. \n\n I\u2019m now late so I'll stop here--oh! Except for this last piece of news: We now have a dog! A fellow RDI mom who shows and trains and runs collies in sheep trials had a grown collie she needed to place so she brought her to us this weekend. Her name is Mouse. She\u2019s beautiful and so very gentle and Fluffy already adores her. I asked him what he thought when he first saw her he said,  I thought, that\u2019s the longest nose I\u2019ve ever seen! It looks like a spear! \n\n It\u2019s true. She has a spear nose.

We are all having a ball over here.  \n\n Fluffy is closing in on mastery of stage 1! He had the playdate of all playdates last Friday, interacting, inventing, coordinating, and cooperating with my friend Rosemary's son for two hours. No, that's not a typo: TWO HOURS! I was there but not intervening, reconnecting, and repairing, simply watching, floored, proud, delighted. At one point, the other boy got frustrated with something and burst into tears. Fluffy came right over and said,  Oh, don't be sad. I love what you made! I think it looks great! \n\n Oh! And we're checking into where to live. The loveliest woman in the comments section in the last post tantalized me with visions of the robustly healthy and progressive populace of Boulder, Colorado and gobs of sun sun sun. We're also leaning heavily toward Northampton, Massachusetts. But, who knows? We'll see.  \n\n All I know is that spring is here and I am bursting through my own parched earth. I am breathing again, big lusty breaths, like Fluffy when he reaches his face out the window as we drive along, gulping the air, as he says, to get extra oxygen to feed his muscles. Yesterday he told me,  Mommy, I can feel my body breathing even when I'm not thinking about it. It makes a sound like it found something exciting and then it lost it again, like it's surprised and then a little sad. \n\n I need to follow him around with a tape recorder. He's such a poet; he makes my heart sing.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/04/im_almost_there.html", "title": "I'm Almost There!"},

I thought it would be like the dentist--a few shots of Novocain, the steady stream of directives:  Clamp down, Open, Close, Wider, Turn this way, Stop biting me,  etc. etc., the cotton, the suctioning and general tugging around in there, the drool-talking for a few hours afterward and then, boom, back to normal. But no. It\u2019s been two days and I\u2019m swollen and achy and still taking the tylenol/advil cocktail and I have wads and wads of periodontal bandaids clinging to the inside of my mouth in four different extended patches. It looks like packs of gum, chewed up and pressed here and there for later. And it has to stay put for 2 weeks.  \n\n Okay. Well, I guess it was important. I do want to keep my teeth. God! I like my teeth, wait--I LOVE my teeth! I want them ALL forever! \n\n Back to my small small life.  \n\n Thanks to everyone who said they related or understood or have even a tiny bit of this in their life. It does help me feel less alone. It does! I wish we could get together and clank tea mugs or wine glasses or Cleanse For Life shakes which is what I\u2019m drinking these days and tell stories that would make each other pee. I do. I wish I had something to do here in this town when I have a free moment. That is part of the problem. There is truly nothing to do here. Nothing. When Dave used to put Fluffy to bed once a week so I could have Mommy\u2019s Night Out, I\u2019d often eat take-out in my car in the parking lot of the only decent grocery store while talking on the cell phone to my friend Kim. Woo hoo. That was my mommy\u2019s night out. I could have gone to the one coffee shop opened at night in a hideous development that has couches but I would have to compete with the pack of teens reclining in their belly shirts shouting, \u201cLIKE, I MEAN, OH MY GOD\u201d on their cell phones to the other pack of teens lounging on the arm chairs opposite. We have no coffee houses, art houses, movie houses, playhouses, no shopping even--only the Marshall\u2019s Home Good stores and how many wicker baskets does one person need? \n\n My two friends have two kids each, precious little time for frolicking, and no money for sitters.\u00a0 A couple of times we did manage to slip out to my mom\u2019s vacant summer house with a bottle of wine and some facial supplies. But once every six months doesn\u2019t scratch the itch. I\u2019d have to drive an hour to get to something interesting and, at night, I tell you, I haven\u2019t got the umph. Plus, going alone? I\u2019d need extra umph. Not that being alone is hard. I love being alone but I am alone so much. I need being with other people. I need that to recharge as much as I need alone time and I don\u2019t get enough of it and I am feeling at a tilt.  \n\n Well-meaning people stress how important it is for Dave and I to get out! You need it ! Go! Have fun! We would love to have a night out to ourselves. We haven\u2019t had one since Fluffy was born. We\u2019ve gone out for early dinners with the blue-hair set; we\u2019ve gone out for late night dinners with the highlighted set once Fluffy\u2019s asleep but we have not yet been out for a whole night, a whole juicy night to ourselves. We aren\u2019t there yet. You\u2019re just going to have to trust me on this. Fluffy\u2019s attachment is extreme--his anxiety through the roof on certain issues. That is that. It will change one day and, believe me, I ACTIVELY work on this, but I know him well enough to know that pushing it would be disastrous and the fall out would set us way way back.  \n\n In the meantime, this is a nice place to live in the summer. The ocean abounds and we all love the beach. So, that is what we\u2019ll do. Go to the beach all summer long and then pack up our bags in the fall and move. I miss New York and California but one is too overwhelming and the other is too far. We\u2019ll just have to find the best in-between.  \n\n Any ideas? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/03/any_ideas.html", "title": "Any Ideas?"},

{"date": "May 05, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I wish I could join the gals at  Code Pink  for their 24 hour vigil to end the war in front of the white house on mother\u2019s day and sing Dylan\u2019s,  Masters  of War . Maybe you can go and sing it for me? We are so far from getting out of there. I just read an article about the enormous military base we are currently building in Iraq to the tune of many millions and huge swaths of real estate, cordoned off like some royal ruling palace. Blach. And I would go and belt out that song if I knew all the words. Or how to sing. Or how to play the guitar.  \n\n Okay. Much has happened here over the last couple of months. I am launching a freelance writing business; we are moving to Northampton, MA, the women\u2019s group had its final meeting last week, my mom is on her way from Arizona for the whole summer, and  Dave  has sold another book. PLUS I\u2019m out of the phone booth. No more water, at least for now. As dear  Vicki  said, maybe balance is always being about to fall and falling is fine with me. The beautiful quote, \u201cI get up. I fall down. Meanwhile, I keep dancing\u201d is on my office wall. I can see it from the floor. \n\n On the  RDI  front: we\u2019ve officially moved on to Stage 2, Social Referencing. In a nutshell, it\u2019s about looking to other people for information about how to proceed when uncertain or confused. This is what the most others call \u2018eye contact\u2019 but it\u2019s really so much more. Eye contact can become a rote skill that children learn through direct prompting or social skills group. Referencing is an internally motivated behavior based on the child\u2019s own desire to know how the other person feels or what they want or where they are leading them or what to do next or what is okay and not okay.  \n\n It makes perfect sense to me that it follows Experience Sharing in Stage 1 since it is through the genuine pleasure gained from sharing excited gazes with another person that the motivation to look to someone\u2019s face in anticipation, interest, celebration and discovery is born. I\u2019ve seen it in Fluffy. I\u2019ve seen his body relax over the last seven months as he\u2019s come to feel a bit more confident that following our lead will, more than likely, bring him to a place of success and discovery, that he can trust us as his guides, that he doesn't have to rely strictly on his own view of the world that leads him away from the large unknown and into the smaller static known. That is the beauty of RDI from what I am seeing day to day and what I am hearing from the other RDI moms I know--they are watching their kids move into more choice, the comfort of navigating a broader landscape with ease. I see it in the video tapes we have of Fluffy playing. It\u2019s subtle but there. Something physical is changing in him, it\u2019s like the expanding pathways in his brain are sending out little messengers of relaxin and elastin to dance all over his skin. \n\n Okay, it\u2019s not all dancing. There is still plenty of testing and bellowing,  No! Nothing! No, YOU are getting a consequence MOMMY!  Plenty of tearing down the hallway in the middle of an activity to slam the door of his room, some biting, occasional licking of the door frame or windows, and some sort of general strike in the food department as Fluffy rejects every item I lovingly cart from the kitchen. I think he\u2019s outside on the front lawn right now waving the sign,  Will Reference For French Fries. \n\n But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ASD, I think that\u2019s being a kid. From a developmental point of view, Fluffy is about three so he is doing exactly what he is meant to do--push push push, where am I? where are you? and I am meant to be showing him the boundaries with equal measures of creativity, calm, confidence, and consistency. Yah. Except for the tiny fact that it's impossible and sometimes I end up in front of him shouting, YOU ARE NOT THE BOSS; I AM THE BOSS! punctuating my brilliance with finger pokes in the air.  \n\n At the end of the day, after stories and songs and lights out, I ask Fluffy if there was anything good or bad that happened that day that he wants to talk about. It\u2019s hard for him to remember events from his day so usually he asks me to tell him what good or bad thing happened and I tell him something wonderful. He loves it. Sometimes, though, he does remember and last night he remembered me getting mad at him. He didn\u2019t remember why I got mad but he said,  It scared me, Mommy, and I think maybe that must have been your bad thing since you must have been feeling bad to have gotten mad.  Yes it was, honey, I say. I\u2019m sorry I got mad. I didn\u2019t practice good self control.  That\u2019s okay, Mommy,  he said.  People make mistakes. The only way you can never make a mistake is if you\u2019re dead.  \n\n Hmm.

{"date": "May 09, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I feel terrible. I have baby bird blood on my hands.  \n\n Over the weekend, I was wildly pawing at last year\u2019s ornamental grass growth, crispy fresh Home Depot clippers in hand, freeing up some room for the new green shoots when I noticed something lovely and solid and dome-like ensnarled in the handful of dead brush I was cavalierly tossing behind me and onto the brick path, the one I laid down two summers ago in a fit of ill-placed confidence and enthusiasm. \n\n A nest; a dear goblet of a nest painstakingly woven from the very dead grass I was brutally shearing. \n\n The old growth was essentially gone by the time I made the discovery and so I stood in the middle of the garden bed, hair askew, underwear in a snarl up my butt crack, one breast popped out of underwire and peering over the stitching of my filthy t-shirt like a shy animal, counting the eggs: six. Six gray speckled eggs. \n\n I tucked in my boob and sprinted inside with the nest to show Fluffy and Dave, cautioning them NOT TO TOUCH THE EGGS as if I knew anything, as if I was a naturalist with my own cable show. They both looked up blankly and then returned to the Captain Underpants book as if they both heard a distant noise they failed to identify, but no matter! Professor Poopypants was in a pickle! I wandered back outside to return the eggs to... where? I couldn\u2019t put them in the grass anymore since they would now be hopelessly exposed so I gathered some of the dead grass into a kind of funnel, tucked it behind a nearby tree and next to the grass and sat down to wait for the return of Mr. and Mrs. Bird.  \n\n They returned within minutes and began hopping about on the ground near the grass, hopping hopping, flying up, flying down then up then down again. Actually, one twittered on the nearby tree branch and watched while the other fruitlessly searched and I was pretty sure that the one up there observing was Mr. Bird and the one on the ground doing all the leg work, was Mrs. Bird. There was much chirping. \n\n Mr. Bird: Where is it? \n\n Mrs. Bird: It was just here! \n\n Mr. Bird: I thought you were watching them! \n\n Mrs. Bird: I WAS! I just flew away for a second! \n\n Mr. Bird: A second? \n\n Mrs. Bird: Yes, for a second. I\u2019m doing a million things here. Where were you? \n\n Mr. Bird: Hey, this was MY morning. \n\n Mrs. Bird: It\u2019s  always  your morning. \n\n Mr. Bird: What did you say? \n\n Mrs. Bird: Nothing. Oh! Where is it?  \n\n Mr. Bird: Are you sure it was right here? \n\n Mrs. Bird: Of COURSE, I\u2019m sure. \n\n Mr. Bird: But how does a nest just  up and walk away? \n\n Mrs. Bird: I tell you, I was just here! How could the eggs get lost so quickly? \n\n Mr. Bird: Eggs don\u2019t get lost.  Birds lose eggs. \n\n I tried to will them to find the nest but after a few rounds of looking and chirping and flitting about, they gave up. I briefly considered buying a heat lamp and raising the chicks as my own. Fluffy would have siblings! I could relive those early months of motherhood without having a complete breakdown! I could do the 5 Esses from The Happiest Baby on the Block! I could Swaddle and Shhhh and Side lie and Shake and whatever the hell the other S is so Harvey Karp could beam with pride at how effortlessly I\u2019d sail through the colic using his master plan! But mixed families are so complicated and I knew, in my heart, I was not up for the challenge.  \n\n And so I set the nest in the tree hoping some other bird family might find it and adopt and I trudged over to the gaping bald spot of dirt and sticks and rocks that has graced our front yard since the construction on our addition was completed over a year ago to see if I could clear a humble spot for a humble vegetable garden for my own dear Fluffybird and me.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/05/i_feel_terrible.html", "title": "The Nest"},
{"date": "May 11, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m in my office basking in the glow of its spotlessness. Fluffy is in the kitchen mocking the babysitter at top volume. It\u2019s 3:00 and he\u2019s been up 11 hours. Yes, that\u2019s right; he got up before 4 am, or rather, WE got up before 4 am.  \n\n La la. \n\n To be fair, he\u2019s doing pretty well considering he usually climbs out of bed around 8 to lazily saunter into the bathroom and pee all over the wainscotting. Today the wainscotting got an early watering, as did the small pots of beans, potatoes, tomatoes, and sunflowers and the kitchen floor, but no, those last few things got real water. From the faucet. We had one disastrous RDI session which was captured on videotape and all I have to do is keep it out of Child Protection Services nasty little claws and we\u2019ll get to keep our son. Let\u2019s just say they won\u2019t be using that at the next RDI parent 4-day training unless it\u2019s the breakout session on Families Who Were Asked Very Nicely To Leave. \n\n My office is delightful, though. Have I mentioned? It\u2019s a well-oiled machine. It\u2019s frighteningly efficient and organized. The only thing that may throw a wretch into the works is actual work. You know, paying work that requires me to write. But for now, I bask. Bask Bask Bask. And when I grow weary from basking, I swivel in my desk chair to cast adoring eyes at my new cabinet. With 12 drawers. To put things in. That I can later find and use before collapsing into a snarl of overturned flowers pots \u00e1 la Jack Lemmon in  The Days of Wine and Roses . Or should I say Lee Remick? Okay. Not that I\u2019m often drunk, but I\u2019m, you know, often disheveled and driven by a madness that consumes me to find it! find it! where is it! I know I put it  somewhere!  But never again! Because of the drawers! And the oil!  \n\n I\u2019ve had two things on my mind lately besides Stage 2 and Social Referencing, and drumming up writing business and my sister\u2019s mysterious illness and the move to Northampton that may not happen for a number of months or more. It\u2019s (1) Arbonne, the new RE-volutionary skin care treatment that is only available through your friends and neighbors and, (2) the debate over remediating autism. I\u2019ve just bought the former and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ve fallen prey to another live action informercial, if you will. Please advise. \n\n The latter is a debate I willfully ignore, like portion size and Le Petit Flic who bicycles up and down our street in his furor mustache. But I do feel bothered by what seems like a new polarization: either we must celebrate the joy of autism or be thrown to the ground by the tragedy of autism. More on this later, if I can ever gather my thoughts coherently. \n\n In the meantime, I bask; my son bellows; new storage space beckons. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055895/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/05/i_bask.html", "title": "I Bask"},
{"date": "February 22, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t There is a heated debate between those who say autism can be remediated and those who say it can\u2019t. I think the concern of those who say it can\u2019t is the belief that saying it CAN is the same as saying one is trying to remediate the child. I think, they might say,\u00a0 one can\u2019t want to change something about their child and still claim to accept their child. I disagree. I say I can accept my child and want to help him in areas where my child has deficits, weaknesses, in the areas that make it harder for him in this world.  \n\n I call the ways in which I help my child remediation. Others may call it something else but it seems to me it's the same at heart: to help improve the quality of our child\u2019s present and future life.  \n\n Language is important but what\u2019s more important to me is understanding what someone means by the words or phrases they use. I may take offense at what someone says but unless I stop to ask, what do you mean by that? I haven\u2019t gone as far as I can toward generating a meaningful exchange of ideas because I am still stuck on what I THINK THEY MEAN and then everything gets filtered through that lens.  \n\n I can\u2019t see this debate as having anything to do with who loves their children more, who accepts them more, who parents them the RIGHT way, etc.. I\u2019ve heard some of that and I say, yuck. Sticky stuff. I don\u2019t want any of that on me.\u00a0 All I see are passionate people advocating for their children, loving them, parenting them, providing for them. \n\n For me, the word remediation relates not so much to remedy or cure but to remedial, to improving the functioning of x, y, z. In RDI terms, it means providing an opportunity for a developmental do-over, for my son to have the chance to lay a relationship foundation with others, with himself. I believe it will help create a place of safety and home,  within himself . The brain is changed through our interactions with others. That\u2019s a fact. There\u2019s no stopping it! Mine has probably changed (I dare say, even at this advanced age) due to the lively emails and passionate posts over the last few days.   \n\n Perhaps the problem is, as  Susan Senator  said in  this  post, we need more language to describe autism. Up until now, autism has described the common areas that present difficulties for those on the spectrum, primarily with communication and relationships. Since we live in a world with other people and need to communicate in order to survive, in order to THRIVE, then having difficulties in this area deserves attention. And help, provided in a loving and respectful way. For me, autism hasn\u2019t described the neutral or gifted aspects of an individual. I guess I\u2019ve always called that just being human. Which is why I\u2019ve talked of remediating the autism, the areas in which a person is struggling, confused, overwhelmed, in order to reveal, more truly, the person, including their gifts and their own never-before-seen-never-to-be-seen-again individual expression of biology. \n\n Maybe I can stop using the word autism to describe what is atypically harder for this population. Maybe I can use another word to describe what is hard for my son and say I\u2019m remediating THAT. Okay, I can do that. Especially if, in doing so, I am more respectful and sensitive to those with ASD. I've never doubted that autistics have a valuable and unique perspective, but just as there is no cookie cutter person anywhere, there is no cookie cutter person on the spectrum.  \n\n What may not be unique to anyone is the pain of being judged, disrespected, dismissed and stigmatized. I hope to never do those things. \n\n I think of those that debate as experts. I\u2019m not an expert on autism--not by a long shot. I don\u2019t  want  to debate--discuss, yes! but not debate. Is this an issue of semantics? Maybe. The dictionary lists debate and discuss as synonymous. But the entomology reveals a distinction I think is important, at least to me.  \n\n From  etymonline.com: \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 debate\u00a0 c.1300, from Fr. debattre (13c.), orig. \"to fight,\" from de- \"down, completely\" + batre \"to beat.\" \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 discussion\u00a0 c.1340, from O.Fr. discussion, from L.L. discussionem \"examination, discussion,\" in classical L., \"a shaking,\" from discussus, pp. of discutere \"strike asunder, break up,\" from dis- \"apart\" + quatere \"to shake.\" \n\n Note the difference, at least in the Old French origins of these two words, the beating down versus the shaking apart. This feels very apt since debates brings to my mind an image of two people hunkered down in opposing chairs and somebody WINS. Discussion brings to mind an image of pulling one chair alongside another to take a closer look, spread things out, give it room and in the end, a greater understanding may be reached. I\u2019m certainly not saying that those who debate are out to beat each other up, but I\u2019m just saying: words can be synonyms and still have different feelings, even, dare I say, different meanings. \n\n The only thing I may be an expert on is how I feel at any given moment, and even that\u2019s, er, debatable, er--I mean, discussionable. I can discuss, well, nearly anything! Because I love to talk! to give my opinions! share my antics! my thoughts! feelings! and visions! \n\n One of my visions for my son is that one day, he will feel safe with his peers, that he will develop meaningful relationships, that he will share his thoughts, feelings, and ideas with others and be interested in hearing the same from them, that he will find meaningful work. When this happens, will he still have Aspergers? Who cares? I don\u2019t. I only care about the quality of his life and the reason rx is valuable is that it (1) put things into focus for me (2) explained a lot (3) makes it unlawful for Fluffy to be denied the help and/or consideration he needs.  \n\n Other than that, say he has Aspergers till the cows come home. It has never felt shameful or less than to me. \n\n EDITED TO ADD: I've turned the comments off on this post. I'm still up for a discussion; I just need a little breather.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://susansenator.com/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/2006/02/is-autism-new-gay.html", "http://www.etymonline.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/blah_the_discus.html", "title": "blach!!! the discussion continues..."},
{"date": "February 22, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t When I say I want to remediate the autism, I mean I want to give my son a chance to move through the developmental stages I believe he missed. I want to give my son a developmental \u2018do-over\u2019. I want to go back to the first stage and slow down, be more deliberate in my play and interactions with Fluffy, spotlight certain things so that he has the opportunity to make certain pathways, certain connections in his brain that he didn\u2019t have the chance to do the first time around.  \n\n This will not affect who my son is. It will strip away what stands in the way of him being able to share who he is with more people in his life outside of his family and a few close babysitters. All of us come into this world with our own particular slant on, well, everything. All people, not just those with autism, have something unique and fascinating to offer the world. All people, not just those with autism, have unique brains. \n\n We\u2019re at stage 1, Emotion Sharing. Generally speaking, this is about sharing excited gazes during pleasurable activities. It\u2019s not about eye contact although it involves a lot of facial gazing. It\u2019s about enjoying something, together. It\u2019s about sharing excitement about something fun to come, sharing excitement about something we are doing in the moment, it\u2019s about behaving in ways that bring about each other\u2019s increased pleasure, for example, each of us acting silly to make the other one laugh or smile. It\u2019s the kind of thing that I experience with other kids who don\u2019t have Aspergers in seconds flat--a kind of connection, a kind of relating. It\u2019s the kind of thing that I didn\u2019t experience with my son until we began doing RDI. \n\n We\u2019ve been videotaping our interactions--short segments, about five minutes long. We try to tape at least four times a week and then review it in the evening. It\u2019s incredible what you can see this way, including the clear realization  I need to step away from the fridge after 8 pm . It\u2019s a valuable tool, this ability to step back and see oneself, see connections I didn\u2019t notice, see opportunities for connection I missed, see when I am trying too hard, see when I am in the moment.  \n\n Dave and I watch them together and then send off 30 minutes to our RDI consultant every couple of weeks. We review her written feedback report with a long juicy phone call during which we get to ask all sorts of questions, clarify our next set of objectives, and gather suggestions on activities to do with Fluffy including appropriate scaffolding--or support--needed for him to feel competent. It\u2019s only since the parent 4-day that I feel clear about the level of scaffolding I need from her to feel competent myself to lead my son to a feeling of competence. I don\u2019t think everyone would need that, would need the 2-day, the 4-day, the consultant, the on-line listserv for parents doing RDI with their kids, etc. etc., but I that\u2019s what I needed.  \n\n The other day, Fluffy and I were looking through the Handwriting Without Tears (HWT) notebook for preschoolers. I\u2019ve mentioned before that my son (who is not hyperlexic yet recognized all upper case and lower case letters before his second birthday and has now taught himself to read by some mysterious process of magic or osmosis) has great difficulty writing and drawing and painting. We are taking this HWT at a snail\u2019s pace, something the workbook encourages and supports by design.  \n\n Fluffy flipped to the M page, for mommy, and found a picture of an actual mouse next to one of computer mouse and excitedly covered them with his hands.  Mommy! I have a game for you! Cover your eyes!  which I dutifully did.  Now, open them!  he said and with a flourish, lifted one hand to reveal the real mouse and looked up at me with gleeful anticipation. He kept looking, smiling excitedly and then, as he revealed the computer house, he looked down and then quickly back up at me, smiling broadly, proudly, delightedly. We hooted and laughed together, with each other, at this game that he invented. He kept it up through the whole alphabet, scanning the pages, looking for more silly, playful pictures to share. It was obvious to me, he wouldn\u2019t do this activity on his own--it wouldn\u2019t be the same without me, without another person. He needed, wanted, and loved  sharing that experience  with me.  \n\n That is a peek into a developmental do-over. That is a peek into celebrating my child, loving my child, mothering my child. They are one in the same to me.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/a_peek_into_dev.html", "title": "A Peek Into Developmental Do-Over"},

I wish everyone well on their own walk. I wouldn't think to tell anyone else where to go or how to go; I need my energies to navigate my own path, to see what I see as I go along.

How may I direct your call!\u201d which never failed to crack me up even though I don\u2019t think one person noticed. When that wore off, I\u2019d end the calls by cheerily calling, \u201cVagina!\u201d It wasn't hostile; it was silly and juvenille and it helped me get through the day.  \n\n And that is what I would like to pass along to all of you: the chance to end your calls by saying, vagina!

{"date": "February 24, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I had a discussion with someone recently who didn\u2019t agree with some of the things I said and how I said them. That happens. In this case, we went back and forth, always with emotion, often with respect, sometimes with exasperation. It unnerved me but it also stretched me. It got me to thinking about this blogging business, this posting personal and sometimes very raw things on the internet for anyone to see, and why I do it.  \n\n It began as a place for me to process and decompress, a place for me to give voice to the struggles and delights in my life. It\u2019s not so much a chronicle of my son\u2019s life since I don\u2019t speak for him or anyone else. I speak for me, for messy complicated me. I\u2019ve got the full range of emotions and human qualities. I\u2019m loving and compassionate and silly and brave and confident and peaceful and competitive and angry and scared and reactive and insecure and self-centered. I know a few things and I don\u2019t know far more. I\u2019m feeling my way around in the dark sometimes, but that\u2019s okay. I know of a blind man who roofed his own house, alone. Being in the dark doesn\u2019t always mean being lost.  \n\n This blog has always felt safe to me and I\u2019m going to continue to assume that safety. I\u2019m a big fan of RDI. It makes sense to me. I\u2019m going to keep writing about how it\u2019s working for us over here. I\u2019m not trying to convince you but if you think it sounds promising, I say check it out. If not, that\u2019s a-okay with me. \n\n There are a multitude of opinions on autism. There is no final word, nor should there be.  \n\n I will say that I\u2019m a tiny bit concerned about what seems like a trap for parents of kids on the spectrum. I\u2019m worried these parents are being held up to a different standard, as if we are raising a whole new species. \n\n As far as I can tell, all parents want to give their children the best they can. They want to nourish, provide, guide, and protect. They want their kids to have a better life than they had. They hope to one day watch their children set out on their own, to make their own way in the world. All the while, they strive to understand these completely unique and separate individuals, these beautiful mysterious, fascinating, baffling, infuriating creatures, to nurture gifts, encourage interests, and strengthen areas of challenge.  \n\n Why should parenting a child on the spectrum be any different in this regard?\u00a0  \n\n Autism is one of my favorite topics. There\u2019s much value in reading memoirs and essays and articles by those on the spectrum. I\u2019ve read some, have a stack on my bedside table and more on the way from interlibrary loan. But is there ONE autistic experience?\u00a0 Wasn\u2019t that very idea offensive to the African American community? The idea of there being a definitive \u2018black experience\u2019. Aren\u2019t the voices of African American a collection of individual voices?  \n\n Maybe some things are too emotional for me. Like the topic of abortion. If you say it\u2019s wrong, I respect that and would like to hear more. If you tell me it ought to be illegal, I can\u2019t listen. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not capable. It\u2019s too emotional for me and I don\u2019t have the skill. I\u2019m all, SHUT UP MY GOD SHUT UP and that\u2019s that. My brain doesn\u2019t work that way and that\u2019s okay. I like my brain. I\u2019m a huge fan of the way it keeps the heart pumping, not to mention operating the whole autonomic nervous system, keeping everything fed so protein making factories can dash about, unzipping the double helix and whistling over to t-,r-, and m-RNA,  Come on over, gang! Let's transcribe!  Huge fan.  \n\n I make assumptions about parents that I naturally extend to parents with kids on the spectrum. I\u2019m assuming they respect their kids, admire their strengths and unique perspective, value their differences,\u00a0 and learn from them. I\u2019m assuming they want to help where their child is struggling. I assume most parents are having a kind of conversation in the raising of their kids, a back and forth. I like to think all parents find the experience of shepherding a separate life brings with it the chance to be changed oneself.  \n\n That is parenting, isn\u2019t it? Shall we say to parents with autistic kids, Wait! Don\u2019t parent that kid! They are too special, too different?\u00a0  \n\n And now, because I could go on and I don\u2019t think I need to because, after all, I am only wondering about this, about this possible trap, I leave you with something Fluffy said to me a few minutes ago. We had just returned from a new dentist who told us he must drill and fill two of Fluffy\u2019s teeth with the help of Novocain. And so, we were talking about dentists and doctors and germs and illness and he got to wondering about how many times I\u2019ve had to stay in the hospital for more than a day. Only twice, I told him, the last time when you were born. He looked thoughtful for a moment and then said,  \u201cMom, I was really surprised when I came out of you and into the world because I thought the whole world would be as warm and cozy as it was inside of you.\u201d  \n\n The world; she may not an incubator, but we can all keep growing within her.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/a_possible_trap.html", "title": "A Possible Trap"},

Taken by Fluffy. \n\n Fluffy has mottled enamel, what they don\u2019t or can't call \u2018soft teeth\u2019 in dental school but what amounts to the same thing. In about half the cases pediatric dentists see, it\u2019s a result of high fevers or ear infections, some event or series of events during teeth formation. In the other half, it\u2019s just the way it goes, a matter of genetics.  \n\n We already had one cavity filled without the aide of Novocain and while I\u2019m quite sure Fluffy didn\u2019t feel pain, he did feel the drilling and scraping and warp of a box of cotton logs stuffed down his throat and the whole experience left him exhausted and terrified.  \n\n He has four more cavities. Our new dentist wants to fill two of them and he wants to use Novocain. This guy is good. He\u2019s got years of experience. We\u2019ll get the first appointment of the day and give Fluffy Valium before we go.  \n\n Most of me knows it will be okay. I mean, what are we going to do, not have them filled? Bring him to the hospital and give him general for two cavities? But I tell you, I hate that it has to happen. I want the magic man to come and fill his teeth while he peacefully sleeps. I know my son and I know that after the anxiety of anticipating the pain, the actual pain will come and then his terror will soar. It won\u2019t matter that the shot will be over quickly, the shock of it will last and magnify. First there will be the gaping mouth no-sound cry, then the wild eyes, and then the struggle for his life to get up and out of the chair. And what will we need to do? This: hold him down. \n\n I know. I\u2019m getting myself worked up. Maybe  I  ought to take the Valium with a quick shot of whiskey and come hooked to my own portable gas source \u00e1 la  Frank Booth  in Blue Velvet.

I need to walk the narrow streets of the deep south with a wise and eccentric medicine woman, the kind who glides along on feet hidden beneath her draped and flowing layers of texture, color and scents, who learns me in the art of harnessing personal power and vision while remaining firmly grounded to the earth and family and mischief. \n\n I\u2019ve come to conclusion that I can\u2019t blog anymore. Okay. I\u2019ll keep blogging but I can\u2019t do it very often. I love the feeling of community and camaraderie I\u2019ve gotten over this past year or so. I love writing regularly. I love reading other blogs. I feel as if we\u2019re in the same neighborhood, that we crisscross the street in our pjs, clutching our coffee cups or wine glasses or screaming children, our hair in tangle knots, our clay masks cracking like mud flats too long without rain.  \n\n But the computer is becoming like the salami these days. I sit down to steal an hour or so to work on a project and before I know it, a pound of genoa is missing and stray bits of peppercorn are stuck to the end of my nose. I say,  I\u2019ll just check my email and peek at a few blogs  and then swooosh, I\u2019m down the rabbit hole through the space/time continuum that leads me here and there in what feels like lightening time but what is really a slippery through-the-looking-glass distortion of time and I wake to find myself googling something absurd and meaningless and my time, she is gone, down the steps, with nary even a silver slipper in her wake.  \n\n So, I\u2019m saying goodbye.

{"date": "February 26, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I have a weakness for infomercials. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m particularly proud of, but there it is. It\u2019s one of my Achille\u2019s heels and if nothing stands between the screen and me, I am shot. \n\n Thankfully, I rarely watch television during the wee hours of the morning or the vast stretches of bright day, so I don\u2019t see many of them. But a couple of weeks ago, my back landed me in bed from dawn till dusk and I saw quite a few. Quite a few.  \n\n I did pretty well for most of the day. I didn\u2019t order the mattress that folds in half or puts you in perfect sigmoidoscopy position at the gentle press of a button, something with which I\u2019m sadly familiar. I didn\u2019t order the knee press thingy or the juicer although I did note that Jack La Lanne looks as frighteningly fit and enthusiastic as ever.  \n\n I clicked by the extended scenes of acne miraculously healed through daily application of ProActive, having ordered that two years ago only to land in the emergency room for shots of epinephrine while Fluffy howled inconsolably at the sight of me hooked up to the beeping heart monitor devices. Even my swollen face didn\u2019t amuse him, my eyes closed to tiny windows, my lips the size of wiener schnitzel. I will say, aside from an angry red cast, my skin looked fabulous.  \n\n I sailed by the Suzanne Sommer's BodyRow, the recent memory my very own model sitting curbside for three straight weeks over the holiday season etched into my brain as distinctly as the dark shadow it left behind when the junk man finally picked it up at the probable urging of my neighbors, the very ones that dangle decorative ice skates from their front door knobs. \n\n I flew passed the Ginsu knives; they don\u2019t really cut pennies but do a beautiful job on fingers and phone cords. Click. \n\n I no longer believe an uncirculated $2.00 bill will provide for retirement. Click. \n\n A genuine zirconium is an oxymoron. Click. \n\n But then, sometime after Joe Black and before Oprah, I saw something that may have changed my life forever: Bare Minerals by  Bare Escentuals . I was riveted. Dave who seems to have suffered some sort of acute hearing loss soon after we were married nonetheless, barreled into the room at the imperceptible swoosh of the credit card sliding out of my wallet.  No!  he bellowed, his movements in slow motion, his hair dancing above his furrowed brow. I was on the phone with a Bare Escentuals Technician, sitting in a pool of pillows and ice packs and heating pads, credit card in hand. I waved him off, elated. Darling! Not to worry! I\u2019m not throwing money out the window! I\u2019m getting the BARE essentials! It\u2019s all natural! with an SPF of 15! and the promise of glowing flawless looking complexion! It\u2019s actually good for your skin!  \n\n It arrived a few days ago with a set of brushes and it took exactly ten seconds to apply--hand to god, ten seconds. Yesterday, I met my sister for sake and sushi and I kid you not, unprompted she effused,  Wow, you\u2019re skin looks gorgeous! Why, it\u2019s glowing! It doesn\u2019t even look like you\u2019re wearing makeup!  \n\n I am those ladies in the audience, the ones that smile inanely and look around to nod and clap like seals before the bucket of fish.

{"date": "March 12, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Are vacations fun?  Dave asked the darkened ceiling at 4:30 this morning when Fluffy was clearly up for the day. He stared some more and then queried the two adults in the room, abruptly torn from the dreamland they had entered a scant five hours before,  Do they really work?   \n\n I don't know. I only hope this day is better than the last two. \n\n Yesterday was the stormiest day my mom can remember since moving here ten years ago. I, stubbornly, insisted on wearing my new cotton skirt; pale legs and open-toed sandals dangled beneath. By five o'clock I was in a foul mood. I was cold and tired and puffy from eleven hours of traveling the day before due to some technical problem with our connecting flight in Chicago. While sitting on the tarmac for well over an hour, Dave and I played the game, What Mechanical Malfunction Would You Ignore If Allowed To Take Off Straight Away? Faulty landing gear, no. Heat/cooling system failure, yes. Breaks in the oxygen circuit, no. Sporadic electrical navigational system, yes. Just fly very low, right? Below the cloud cover, where it's warmer and easier to see. \n\n We flew American with the conversatively dressed staff in their navy blue and tasteful gold jewlery. The seats are half the size since last I flew and you now have to pay for the in-flight snack of processed cheese goo, a couple of stale bread sticks and a sausage stick--oh, and some Lorna Dunes, always a treat. I love a butter cookie expecially those made without a lick of butter whatsoever. There was an older couple with a 2 year old in front of us, by older I mean slightly younger than Dave and me. They were excited that Fluffy was right behind them. Look! A big boy! Say hello to the big boy! The toddler folded over the headrest to stare and point and make happy noises at Fluffy who gestured back to him in staccato fashion and loudly remarked,  No! Go away!  which I echoed silently with my tight smile. Yes. Go away. We don't like children here. Just our own, singular son. And then the small boy let loose an explosion of wet, hacking coughs which shot his pacifier over our heads and Dave frantically set another Airborne a-fizzing. \n\n Once we were finally in the air, time ticked backwards and I bought two snack boxes and sucked on my sausage sticks and read The Professor's Daughter, by Emily Raboteau. As I fell in love with her voice I simultaneously fell into the snake pit of my own personal Salieri writhings, bemoaning my own mediocrity. I'll never write that well. Why didn't I start long long ago? When I was one or two? Back when I had all sorts of time on my hands? In the middle of this self-torture, Dave looked away from the window and asked the passing stewardess where we were and she actually said, \"I don't know. Hell?\" \n\n Fluffy is disregulated and quite possibly getting sick (thank you, small toddler child) and I made the mistake of telling him about a run-in I had once with a Jumping Cholla years ago when I stayed with the nuns here in Tucson on silent retreat. I was warned not to get too close as the spiky baby pods could literally jump onto your skin or clothing and I nodded beningly and carefully replied,  Sure they do and my stuffed animals come to life when I'm sleeping . But then I DID walk too closely because they appear mystical in the sunlight as if covered by a golden feathery aura and sure enough, a pod DID jump onto my hand where it took hold like a patch of angry porcupine quills. Oh no, I said, and reached with my other hand to pull it off and was promptly impaled by the remaining spikes. I ran back over the trecherous trails, my hands locked together as if in cactus hand cuffs, back to the silent kitchen, back to the no-nonsense nun who extracted each needle with hefty tweezers. Tears streamed down my cheeks and an odd ache crept up my arm. \n\n Of course, I kept the details to a minimum; I told him they don't LEAP out at you like Mama Mama's dog Max, that you have to get VERY close before they can grab hold; I told him they're only in the country and we're staying in the city so he doesn't have to worry but every time we mention going somewhere he looks up in alarm and whispers,  is that in the country? \n\n Today promises to be sunny and it's delightful and dear to see my mom and Tucson IS beautiful--vast stretches of scrappy desert land surrounded by craggy dramatic mountains poking into their own weather systems, swirls of gray and blue clouds and streaks from rain and snow circle the peaks. We are staying in a condo within walking distance of my mom's place in a lovey retirement community graced with low stone walls and snaking pathways, fruit trees leaning down lustily offering lemons, grapefruits, and clusters of quinces. It's obscene, really. All that food! Hanging from the trees! Dropping from branches to roll along the sidewalk, pooling in the gutter at major intersections in the middle of town. \n\n Maybe we should move all the homeless here. It's warm and roomy and overflowing with vitamin C. We could load up an American flight and greet them all with fresh lemonade.

If only I had know there\u2019d be, like, eight of them. We only prepared for two, silly me, I thought, two fillings, two shots. No. Poke poke times four. Yes, Fluffy was groggy from the Valium and the dentist did wipe the topical numbing agent here and there but then he went ahead and poked him inside the cheek. The cheek! There were pinpricks of blood and screeching and writhing and STOP STOP YOU\u2019RE HURTING ME so I asked for a break and Fluffy sat up, tear stained and aghast, and said through his choking sobs,  That was so bad it made the bubble gum flavored gloves mean nothing to me, Mom, nothing!  And then he had to lie back down for the last two and that was the worst part, the going back for more. Once the needle was put aside, the dental team left the room and we had a chunk of time to rock and hug and assure there would be no more shots. No more pain. From here on in it would be purely a construction project and after that, a frozen chocolate pop to soothe the battered ground. \n\n I hatched an on the spot strategy for the drilling and filling with well-time breaks and lots of hand holding and counting and Fluffy did beautifully. He was brave and cooperative and afterward his one cheek puffed out like a lopsided chipmunk. It\u2019s still a bit swollen and that was two days ago. My guy. He hasn\u2019t got the high tolerance of pain.  \n\n We are leaving tomorrow for Arizona. Tucson, to see my mom. She rustled us up our own condo in her complex, near the heated pool. And it\u2019s a good thing as I hear the weather, having been holding at a steady 80 for the last several decades, promises to dip down into the 50s with accompanying clouds and rain. Woo hoo. Break out the sun dresses. I told my mom, this can\u2019t last the whole 10 days or someone is going down. How will I showcase my new bikini wax? With peekaboo cutouts in my blue jeans? \n\n Lastly, thanks to every single one of you for all your kinds words of support and encouragement. I love to blog; I love reading your blogs. As  Candace  says, blove (blog love) to all! Sorry to sound like one of those women\u2019s magazine, but the issue is one of balance and that is profoundly hard for me. Hard. Very hard. Did I mention it\u2019s hard? And, right now, the blogging community is my only community and so when I remove it in order to make room for other writing, I create a new imbalance. Oy.  \n\n What I\u2019m going for now is a little discipline. I\u2019ve never been very good at that either, but maybe I can mature in this area, right? I mean, I\u2019ve never considered myself mature. I\u2019m the gal tittering at fart noises and just barely suppressing the urge to moon and flash at the grocery store and IEP meetings, I still go for the laugh by plastering stray pieces of spinach to my teeth or draping linguine from the opening of my nostril. Yet, here I am, rapidly maturing with the dry skin and digestion preoccupation to prove it. \n\n I need to mature in this area of creating discipline. Mature's not really a bad word, indicating an emergence from the undeveloped to the full, complete, and ripe. Ripe. I like that. I could even use the pottery definition, as in baking creations formed out of clay and earth, \u201cto fire to the point that develops the optimum strength\u201d because aren't we all creations formed out of earth and clay, in a way? And don't we, go with me on this one, bake out here in the fire of life?   \n\n So, here\u2019s to maturity; here's to developing our optimum strength. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://suburbanmisfit.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/03/cheating.html", "title": "Cheating"},

You just park your butt at the keyboard and start. And then keep going.

{"date": "February 10, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I'm reading  Inconsolable,  by  Marrit Ingman  and you must too. She is my new hero. Her writing is rollicking and riotous and searingly honest. It's an account of her post partum depression and even though I didn't have PPD during the first year of Fluffy's life, I think I must be having a bit of it now; either that or a smattering of post traumatic stress syndrome. \n\n She writes with such energy and precision and humor and passion and HONESTY. She makes me wince and gasp and laugh out loud; she makes me want to lean over and read passages to complete strangers waiting alongside me on the loooooong benches in the DMV. She makes me want to reprint whole chapters on my blog which I won't do but I will print this: \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Nora Ephron has said that a baby is like a hand grenade thrown into a marriage. She's absolutely right. Though maybe it's more like a dirty bomb. I've heard people say that parenthood will fix their relationships, will make their women nurturing and their men faithful. That's the biggest fucking lie in the whole world. Having a baby will push your relationship to the very end of its elasticity. You will discover your limits as a person, possibly for the first time in your life. You will be happier than you've ever felt; you will be angrier than you've ever been.\" \n\n And this: \n\n   \u00a0 \u00a0\"The weird thing about becoming a parent with a partner is that you go through all this shit, you have these horrible fights that spiral out of control, and you want to keep your mouth shut but you can't; you have to make one more hurtful comment, you have to push one more button, you have to twist the knife and rip and tear and cause just a little more pain before you'll be satisfied. But when it's over, you're both still there. You exchange looks full of meaning: Wow, all that and the smoke cleared and we're both still here. You are the most tenacious motherfuckers on the goddamn planet Earth. You are the parenting equivalent of Legionnaires. When all this is over, you will get French citizenship and a comfortable pension. You are so badass, you deserve your own blaxploitation theme song that plays when you walk down the street.\" \n\n I love Marrit. She is making me laugh out loud and I don't do enough of that these days. NOT ENOUGH. I love the laughing out loud. It's on the top of my love list. You can keep your chocolate hearts on Valentine's Day and just send me a case load of the laughing out loud in recognition and relief that there is this person out there with courage enough to lay it all out there and do it with such skill.  \n\n I love this book so much I will gift it to one of you, my dear readers, for Valentine's Day. If you want to be in the running, all you have to do is leave a comment and I will put all the names in a hat and pick one at random. Any comment will do, but if you're feeling brave you may say something about what you've found hard about being a mom. And feel free to say it without guilt, without explanation, without fear. Because being a mom is magnificent and it's also very very very hard. Both things are true and I, for one, don't find enough of the hard being talked about on this good green earth.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580051405/103-4302624-8889452?v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.suite102.com/baldo/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/i_love_marrit.html", "title": "I Love Marrit"},
{"date": "February 19, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I would just like to say that there is no proof that Albert Einstein or Andy Warhol had Aspergers and I think the movement to authenticate this is ill-conceived, on many fronts.  \n\n I tell you, I must be missing something because I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get what sounds like this debate: either embrace, celebrate, and accept your ASD child or rescue them. And the reason I don\u2019t get it is that, (1) I am not trying to rescue, cure, or fix my son (2) I already embrace, celebrate, and accept my son, and (3) I most definitely AM trying to remediate the autism that my son has, not the autism that my son IS because my son IS NOT AUTISM. Or Asperger\u2019s. He is a human being, uniquely gifted as all children are, with magnificent qualities and his own perfect expression of self.  \n\n And he has challenges, as we all do. And his challenges resulted in missing the developmental train, so to speak. Unless he\u2019s provided with the opportunity to develop the ability to navigate the dynamic system of social interaction, things will be harder for him in the world, harder than those who didn't miss the train.   \n\n Will he die? Will he wander the globe, lost, alone, and destitute? Not necessarily. Will he find a niche? Bring to light some singular achievement, expression, invention, work or art or technology? Maybe. Is the possibility of that taken away if the core deficits present in all those on the spectrum are ameliorated and even eliminated through remediation? I doubt it. \n\n I wonder why this irks me so, because it really does--the idea that if you remediate the autism, you remove the gifts and rob children of their identity. What also irks me is the list of names that I found doing a google search \u201cFamous people with Aspergers\u201d. Here are some of them: \n\n Jane Austen B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Ludwig van Beethoven Alexander Graham Bell Emily Dickinson Thomas Edison Henry Ford\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  Thomas Jefferson Carl Jung Franz Kafka\u00a0  Wasily Kandinsky\u00a0 \u00a0  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Isaac Newton Friedrich Nietzsche Bertrand Russell  George Bernard Shaw Henry Thoreau  Mark Twain Vincent Van Gogh John Denver  Jim Henson Alfred Hitchcock Howard Hughes Andy Kaufman Charles Schulz Andy Warhol Woody Allen Bob Dylan Bill Gates Al Gore Michael Jackson Garrison Keillor Keanu Reeves Oliver Sacks\u00a0 \u00a0  James Taylor \n\n People: get a grip.  \n\n Does it begin to sound a teeny bit like those spoofs of darling Shirley Maclaine out there on her limb? Wherein, for a time, everyone discovered they had been Joan of Arc or Cleopatra or Mary Queen of Scots during past life regression therapy? \n\n We all have autistic traits and tendencies. We all have sparks of genus. We all have untapped power, potential and vision.  \n\n When my son yells, \u2018get out, go away\u201d to a boy who trots by him at the playground, I know what I know by mothering with my heart. I don\u2019t need to read a memoir to imagine what it must feel like to him. I know he\u2019s not feeling right, safe, centered. And I know I want to do what I can so that he has the chance of experiencing life on the playground as fun, interesting, enjoyable.  \n\n Is there any mother out there not doing this? Not motivated by the same thing? Please help me with this; I really want to know. For those of you who are calling for greater acceptance, for a wider embrace of our differences as human beings, for a matter of fact inclusion of all personality types, learning styles, neurological landscape, for slashing \u2018normal\u2019 from our vocabulary, for valuing everything along the actual spectrum of minds out there, I say, yes! yes! a million times yes! And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s also remediate the autism. \n\n I\u2019ve been engaged in my own very personal story for most of the last year and a half. When I first started blogging I didn\u2019t know of one other autism blog. I was too absorbed in what was going on within the walls of my home and those of my mind and heart. I know of many now because they found me and then I found more of them and I\u2019m glad for that. I try to add every autism blog link to my sidebar. If I\u2019ve neglected to include yours, please let me know. We need voices. We need connection and community. We need each others\u2019 stories.  \n\n The politics of autism are explosive. There are many different views on autism beginning with whether or not autism and treatment are two words that belong together. Maybe I add ammunition by my position. Maybe I fan the flames. But I tell you this: I would never tell a grown person that they ought to be some other way, that they are wrong or in need of fixing, unless of course, they are my husband. We each have to find our own way in this world and I have the deepest admiration for the journey. \n\n  As a mother of a small child with a neurologic difference, a difference that I witness impacts him every day, that separates him from others, that distorts his self-image, the impedes what would be his natural feeling of competence and confidence, I am pulled not toward books on autism, but to books on human development. I want to maximize his own potential. He is my son. I want to help him build a solid hull, fit it with mast, tiller, rudder, keel, the proper ballast, and sails. And then I want to watch from the shore as he sets out on his own. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/i_must_be_missi.html", "title": "I Must Be Missing Something"},
{"date": "February 17, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I got tagged by Kristen over at  Motherhood Uncensored  ages ago and, to be honest, I don\u2019t even quite remember what I am meant to do, but has that ever stopped me before?  \n\n I think it was something like this... \n\n Ten things about me: \n\n (1) I brush my teeth standing very upright with my left hand on my hip, like I\u2019m doing a Broadway number. My dad did that: the brushing, not the Broadway. \n\n (2) I\u2019ve always hated that scene in the movie version of Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune where Michele Pfeiffer and Al Pacino are having a drawn-out fight and Michele is brushing her teeth during the whole thing. I\u2019m not buying it. She didn\u2019t have any toothpaste on that brush or she would have gagged a thousand times by then, or at least have been wearing a modern design of spittle across her chest. \n\n (3) Sometimes I like to sit very far forward on the toilet seat when I pee and lean down as far as I can. For some reason, it cracks me up. \n\n (4) Fluffy is my son\u2019s nickname, one of many thousands, the leader of the pack. I don\u2019t even know how it came to be since his real name doesn\u2019t begin with F. It even doesn\u2019t sound like Fluffy--not even close. Dave started calling him that during the first few weeks of his life and it\u2019s still a front runner, though neck and neck with Mollyotto, Fluff-And-Folly-Onto, Tito, JollyOllyOnto, Mickandmollymoomoo. Kind of alarming to see it in print, isn\u2019t it. \n\n (5) I met a new mom at a \u201cMommy and Me\u201d dance class about four years ago when both our son\u2019s were approaching one. She dropped by one afternoon back then with a basket-full of miniature blueberry muffins beautifully displayed in gingham cloth and wicker tucked in the underbasket of her cranberry red jogger stroller.  Here , she purred,  we just love to bake things together.  Really? I said, picking last night\u2019s dinner out of my hair, here we just do a lot of screaming.  \n\n (6) A year ago, my father and stepmother came over to help us christen the addition that he designed. I served a surprisingly delicious and easy GFCF meal and after Fluffy\u2019s 2 hour struggle to fall asleep, the grown-ups watched a slide show of their trip to Iraq, 5 months before the US invasion. We were dropping bombs then and had been since August-- a full 7 months before March 21, the start of this fucking war. (And now I will get 30 hits on the site from google searches with the phrase \u201cfucking mom\u201d. Go figure.)  \n\n (7) Some kids are maternal and some are predatory and that\u2019s terrifying to me. Kids are going to make fun or Fluffy, tease him or perhaps even torment him and I will then have to kill them with my bare hands.  \n\n (8) People live everywhere. I really find that astounding. \n\n (9) I got an email from someone who\u2019s started blogging and wants to spread the word. No harm there. When I first started blogging, oh say, about a hundred years after everyone else started blogging, I sent out a group email to everyone saying, come check it out! I hoped they would like it and pass it on to whomever they also thought might like it. Some people were very generous and supportive, others said a quick hooray! Still others said not a world. \n\n Okay. That\u2019s fair. Everyone\u2019s busy. But this person has snubbed us more once or twice and although it\u2019s all water under the bridge and la la and I\u2019ve moved on, seeing the email makes me want to clear my voice and say, news flash, this business of human interaction? It\u2019s two way street. Two way, over here. Maybe there are some one way streets out there and maybe even I\u2019ve tried to set some up and if so, I apologize for thinking I\u2019m more interesting than the next guy. But jeez, hopefully I\u2019m making all the streets nice and wide, with big shoulders because we all need to pull off the road for emergencies from time to time. \n\n (10) Fluffy made one valentine. It was for his Dad. He glued the heart on the front and wrote, To Dad, on the inside. It was a huge deal--writing comes very hard for him--and Dave almost cried when he opened it. A couple days went by before he realized he never made a card for me. Of course, this occurred to him after bedtime stories and lights out and since he couldn\u2019t get up right then and there to slap it together, he became despondent. I told him he had the whole week to do it and he cried harder, saying,  but what if i don\u2019t remember before the week is over?  And I said, oh, did I say a week? I meant years! Er, you get as long as you need! There\u2019s no deadline! And he peered at me in the nightlight glow and said, through sobs,  Okay, mommy.  (hiccup)  Okay. I will make one for you the day before I die,  and I said, and I will love it, honey! Then all was right and good again. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://motherhooduncensored.typepad.com/motherhood_uncensored/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/forgive_me_a_me.html", "title": "Forgive Me: A Meme"},
{"date": "February 21, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t This blog is where I get to have my voice. I'm not speaking for anyone or trying to convince anyone or hoping to please anyone. I'm just grabbing a tiny square of blogosphere real estate and letting it fly. It's helped me enormously to have this outlet. I think I could say, it literally saved me from bitterness during a time when I was feeling deeply disappointed with life.  \n\n I don't feel that anymore. I don't feel that disappointment. But I still love the freedom to let it hang out there and I love when I get the time to read what some of you all are hanging out there. I don't get to read enough: blogs, books, newspapers, magazines, fancy restaurant menus. I don't . One day I will have more time. Until then, I will post when I can and read your posts when I can and hopefully comment whenever I swing by to let you know I was there.  \n\n I was just having a tiny chat with someone about swearing and I got to thinking about this post from way back when I first started to blog. I don't know what the etiquette on reposting is but I guess the point is, I get to make up my own. Beware: it contains gratuitous language. Here it is: \n\n I love to swear. I get a ridiculously puerile pleasure from it. It\u2019s\nabout the only place that I can cut loose now that the sun set, long\nago, on the wild days of my youth. I don\u2019t drink, smoke pot, do \u201ce\u201d or\nany other drug named after a single letter. I almost never sniff the\nhose-y part of the whipped cream except if there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll score\nthe last bit of the cream, it\u2019s all about the cream, the sweet\ndelicious cream. I don\u2019t debt or act inappropriate sexually (or even\nappropriate sexually, come to think of it), steal my boss\u2019s colorful\nstockings, lift passages from my sister\u2019s diary and copy it into mine\nas if it represented my OWN PERSONAL THOUGHTS, or pretend to guess the\namount of money my parent\u2019s wallet holds only to exclaim \u201cyou\u2019re\nright!\u201d as I palm the extra bills.  \n\n No, I\u2019m the model of maturity, except when it comes to swearing. Or\neating. Or farting. Or forgetting to throw my tampon out after leaving\nit on the bathtub rim like a luckless mouse during a shower. Okay, but\nthose things aside, I really do inhale still waters and exhale the\nstorm. At least I try, when I\u2019m not pointing out the section of the\ncountertop that was neglectfully left a-crumb or stomping around\nwondering aloud why it is only I who holds the torch in the planning\nand scheduling and meal-making and relationship-tending category.  \n\n And I\u2019ve gotten very attached to it--swearing, that is. I know it\u2019s\noffensive to some, and I really do apologize for stepping over the\nline, for saying \u2018Fuck it\u2019 when I guess I could just as easily say,\n\u2018Oops\u2019; or 'What the fuck?' when \u2018Are you closed?\u2019 would do or even\ntrump it since it adds that extra old-time charm, like \u2018Oh my stars!\u2019\nor \u2018What in the world?\u2019 but there you have it, there is proof that the\nentertainment cupboard is currently bare. Perhaps it points to some\ndeeper issue but right now that will have to take a back burner to\nsaving my sanity and laying a relationship-building foundation for my\nson. La la. \n\n This has been going on for a long time starting way back in my early\nadolescence when my parents gave my sister and I one minute of swearing\nwhen we needed to blow off a little steam. At the time, we lived in a\nbeautiful old victorian, the grand sweeping variety with 12 foot\nceilings and velvet wallpaper and pockets doors throughout. There was a\nlong butler\u2019s pantry on the way to the kitchen flanked by glass-door\ncabinets, copper countertops, and an old dumbwaiter at the far end. We\nwould open the door to that dumbwaiter and curse into its darkness at\nthe top of our lungs while our mother stood by, watching the second\nhand. We tossed them all into that well with gusto, including VAGINA\nand PUBIC HAIR and even MRS. WATT, the vice principal who was rumored\nto have 3 boobs. The whole episode never failed to bring on cascades of\nnervous and tumbling laughter and left us breathless and invigorated,\nlike a country run. \n\n I don\u2019t swear when I\u2019m with Fluffy and I\u2019m with him a lot; the\npressure builds, as you can imagine. What helps is when Dave does\nsomething kind, like when he brings hot tea to the couch where I\u2019ve\ncollapse in disgust at having found dark facial hair now on my CHEEK.\nIn these such instances, I used to say, \u201cYou are so fucking great\u2019 but\nthat fucking just wasn\u2019t cutting it and so now I say \u201cYou are so\nfucking fucked up\u201d\u00a0 or \u201cGod, you\u2019re fucked up\u201d and then we bask in the\nglow of our mutual love. He does it too now. When I told him I loved\nhim dearly and couldn\u2019t imagine going on this crazy ride with anyone\nelse, he got all misty and said \u201cAw, honey, you are such a piece of\nshit.\u201d  \n\n Isn\u2019t he the best? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/reposting.html", "title": "Reposting"},

{"date": "February 10, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I used to go to DA, debtor\u2019s anonymous. It was a well dressed room. We met in church basements and held hands at the end while we said the serenity prayer. During the meeting we told on ourselves and tried to live according to spiritual principles. I met some wonderful people. It was a meet-on-equal-ground thing. You made friends all kinds, ages, backgrounds. It was very egalitarian and true and I loved that part of it. I loved that everyone was trying to figure it out, wrestling with their own image of a high power. The only thing I didn\u2019t love was the timer. The second you were called on to share, that friggin\u2019 timer got set and the race was on until the one minute warning and then \u201cTIME\u201d was sung out and the band began to play and if you kept talking, they went to commercial. \n\n Last night was the halfway point of the women\u2019s group: meeting six; six to go. I love the group. They love me. We love each other! It\u2019s the most amazing experience, very programy, without the timer. We have each others\u2019 backs. We listen and support one another. It\u2019s not a confrontational. It\u2019s honest. There is hot tea, a wrap-around leather couch, and I trust everyone in the room. \n\n I took them all with me, metaphorically of course, to the IEP meeting that was called to take Fluffy off the class placement which is fine since he doesn\u2019t go to that class. I also stopped his speech appointments since the SLP admitted she isn\u2019t working on any speech goals with him. She says, he doesn\u2019t have any issues other than pragmatic language and we differ greatly on how to approach that. She wants to do a mini social skills class; I want to do RDI.  \n\n It wasn\u2019t a great meeting. I was on my own little boat at sea and they were staring stony-faced from the shore. I would talk about RDI, the same thing I\u2019ve been talking about since last June, and then there would be an awkward silence during which the SLP picked invisible lint from her sweater and wiped phantom creases from her skirt. The OT smiled at me; the teacher sat at the computer with her back to me. The only one with me was the director of special education. I guess that\u2019s a good one to have on your side.  \n\n I cannot get why is RDI considered to be so radical by some. These people are all caring educated adults but they cannot see they are clinging to a static system of dealing with ASD kids. This is what we do with them; this is what they need. Okay. Show me the studies that follow these kids not just into the next grade, but into junior high and high school, past graduation and into adulthood. Show me the studies that look at quality of life for this population. Show me the studies that show social skills and other behavioral approaches improve the lives of ASD kids in the long run because I don\u2019t find them in the literature and I\u2019m not interested in moving my son through the school system so much as I\u2019m interested in coming over to his house one day to play with his kids and eat dinner with his family and friends. \n\n I keep talking about remediation, meaning  restoring normal functioning  to my son\u2019s brain, and they want to talk about compensation. Bandaids. I don\u2019t want a skilled child with autism; I want a less autistic child.  These kids will always be autistic , says the well-meaning educator. Hmm.

I'll be sending Inconsolable\noff to  lovely Laura  this week. Thanks to everyone for commenting! \n\n \nThe storm is raging out there. It's very exciting. I love a storm. Just\nso long as it's gone by week's end and is followed by an EARLY BALMY\nspring. That's all. That's all I require. That and Mary Poppins by\nsundown. \n\n And now, a little story: \n\n Fluffy asked about the car ashtray in the car on the way to gymnastics yesterday. I told him it was for cigarette ashes for people who smoked and he wanted to know how a cigarette smoked, as if it smoked, you know, like the candles smoke when we blow them out.  \n\n I did my best to explain smoking in simple terms, adding it wasn\u2019t good for you.  Then why do people do it?  he asked and I thought about introducing the topic of addiction but then thought better of it and so I said, sometimes our bodies want something that\u2019s not good for them but they want it anyway even though their minds tell them no.  Why?  he asked. Well, I said, it was sort of like the way you would eat candy and pops and chocolates all day if I let you but that I couldn\u2019t because even though your body wanted it, afterward, your body would feel bad.  Do people like smoking?  Not everybody, I said.  What do the ones that like it, like about it?  he asked. Hmm. I considered and chose the simple answer. They like the way it tastes. I don\u2019t, I said, I don\u2019t like the way it tastes but some people do.\u00a0 He was silent for a very long time and then he said,  I hope the next kid isn\u2019t like that . I said, what do you mean, honey? and he said,  I hope the next kid who\u2019s born doesn\u2019t like the way it tastes, especially if it\u2019s a kid that I love which is very rare for me, mom. It\u2019s very rare for me to love a kid.  \n\n Today we're going to make valentines. It may not take very long. Fluffy claims to love only me and Mama Mama. If pressed, he'll say he loves Max (Mama Mama's dog) and Maxine (our neglected guinea pig). If pressed a wee bit more, he'll admit to loving his daddy. A little. I've expanded the criteria for valentine's giving by saying we make cards for people we love a little, a medium amount, and a lot, AND for those we like a little, a medium amount, and a lot.  \n\n We'll be lucky to squeeze out six this year.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lightblog.com/member/puddle/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/various_on_a_st.html", "title": "Various on a Stormy Sunday"},

{"date": "February 01, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy with birthday balloons; February, 2004. \n\n I have the house to myself! TRA LA LA!!! It doesn\u2019t happen very often since Dave works at home and Fluffy and I hang around here most of the time and whenever I do get some help in the playroom, I dash about scraping goo off the floor or stack the plates by the sink in ever higher towers or slip into my office to squeeze in a little writing or email or blog reading or return an urgent call placed to me the week before. All housebound activities. It\u2019s rare for me to be OUT of the house and even rarer for me to be alone in the house. \n\n But I\u2019m alone now! The boys are out soaking up the glorious sunshine and I\u2019m baking Fluffy\u2019s birthday cake. Oh, did I mention? Fluffy\u2019s turning FIVE tomorrow. Five. AND we\u2019re having a party! With cake and ice cream! And kids! And a magician! And balloons and streamers! And party favors! And exclamation points!! And thanks to  MOM-NOS  and her brilliant suggestion, a safari hunt in the front yard. I\u2019ve got all the little animals blown up and Dave\u2019s made an adorable safari notebook for each kid. It\u2019s the perfect game, non competitive and everybody wins and when they win, they get crazy string in a can to spray all over the yard. It\u2019s so toxic!!! They says it\u2019s not but I sprayed it in the house and the noxious invisible gas set off the fire alarm. BUT! It says it\u2019s non toxic and non flammable! And it was a breeze to clean up! And Fluffy loved it!! And just so long as none of the little toddler siblings of the big boy\u2019s grabs a can and shoots it down her throat or spontaneously combusts, we\u2019ll be fine. \n\n The cake is a mix and by the way, the most delicious and moist  GFCF mix  I\u2019ve found. Forget baking it on my own. I\u2019m pretty handy in the kitchen but baking GFCF has me flummoxed unless the party theme is door stops and anvils. And speaking of themes, we don\u2019t have one, unless you count birthday party--is that a theme? I\u2019m not really a theme girl. That\u2019s okay. Fluffy won\u2019t notice. That is, if he comes. He told me yesterday,  I didn\u2019t want any kids here.  Oh? But honey, you said you wanted kids, wanted a party like Ethan\u2019s... I didn\u2019t say that, of course, I did ocean breaths and tried to mirror affectively, you don\u2019t feel like having the kids come and things like that. It felt sort of lame but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. Dave was shooting me worried glances and it was one of those times when I pretended I was calmer than I was, to quell the panic. \n\n So today I\u2019m wearing a pretty new skirt and it feels like spring outside and even though I know global warming is a serious issue and one that I call my senators about from time to time and even though I think it\u2019s frightening and appalling that our president GAGS actual scientists who KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, smart and dedicated professionals who even went so far as to actually show up for college and do the course work, I\u2019m a tiny bit pleased that we\u2019ve had such a mild winter. I\u2019m not my neighbor with the whistle and the all weather tires on her mountain bike hitched up to the burley with the twins, her toddler strapped into the backpack while a wild flurry of snow flakes makes them into a winter sculpture before they even leave the driveway; I\u2019m more the let\u2019s enjoy the winter months sipping hot cocoa from the warm side of the window sort of a gal. \n\n When Fluffy returns, we\u2019ll set out for neurofeedback, stopping off at Whole Foods along the way to buy nitrate/nitrite free salami and other assorted GFCF treats for his birthday lunch. I\u2019m really embracing the diet thing these days. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the somatic memory of being rocked and soothed from last week\u2019s group but I\u2019ve felt supported this week even though the search for the nanny continues and playroom help has been scarce for over two weeks, even though I feel like taking my round hair brush to my delicate female inside such is the state of my yeastal inflammation, even though I think I\u2019m traveling with my own mini-tube of preparation H. The diet IS restrictive, let\u2019s be clear: there are many things you can\u2019t eat. But, there are things you CAN eat and these days I\u2019m saying yes yes yes! \n\n And Fluffy is too. Maybe not at first; he\u2019s still the guy who says no first. But his mental engagement is through the roof and he\u2019s slowly becoming more competent and flexible. There are a host of breakthrough moments to report. Here\u2019s one: Fluffy has a particular fascination with how many items of various household products come in a package, toilet paper or paper towels or Lubraderm lotion or Dave\u2019s Irish Spring . He often asks about this, over and over again,  Mommy, why does our toilet paper come in a pack of 4 and the toilet paper at the store comes in a pack of 8 and the toiler paper at Friendly\u2019s comes in a pack of one? Why, Mommy, why?  We look puzzled and shrug and pause and then maybe say, huh, different kinds of toilet\u00a0 paper come in different kinds of packs, or something like that. A few days ago, after getting a fresh bar of Irish Spring for Dave, a kind of soap I don\u2019t use, a soap we have discussed many times before, about how it comes in a package of 3 and it\u2019s bad for mother earth because it has chemicals and it has separate cardboard containers which adds extra trash to the landfill and how THAT makes mother earth sad too unless of course, you go to the dump and recycle it, and THIS time he took the soap out and said to me , Mommy, why does it come in a package --and then STOPPED HIMSELF, laughed and said,  OH, I DON\u2019T EVEN CARE!   \n\n Let me repeat that for those of you in the back row: He stopped himself, laughed, and said,  I don\u2019t even care! \n\n Onward!

{"date": "January 27, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Holding Fluffy; January 1, 2006. \n\n I set out to the fourth meeting of my women\u2019s group last night feeling like I was crouched on the edge of my body, gripped and snarling, like a coiled animal on a rocky ledge. Fluffy was off a lot during the week, dysregulated, not eating, and I\u2019ve fielding calls from people responding to our ad for a nanny and getting increasingly discouraged. The ones that sound good on the phone don\u2019t show up; the ones who could show up say things like,  \u2018hey, it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault he\u2019s got that brain thing; he was born with it, right?\u2019  or when I say we are trying to limit our use of language, they say,  \u2018aw man, you mean like swearin\u2019?\u201d  or , \u2018you got any pot?\u201d \n\n Plus, I\u2019ve been bumping into this guy in the house who claims to be my husband. I don\u2019t know; he does look vaguely familiar and seems to be here a lot so maybe there\u2019s something to it. Then again, it probably  is  my husband since we so easily slip into that comfortable familiarity and lively banter, like  I\u2019m sick to death of your passive aggressive bullshit  and  You know what? You\u2019re a miserable bitch. \n\n The group is amazing, co-led by two women and made up of nine others, including me. We sit on delicious wraparound sectional couches and meditate for about 5 minutes before and at the end of every meeting. During the two hours we are together, usually two women have a chunk of time to do some work. Last night I was one of those women. \n\n I\u2019m sworn to secrecy when it comes to anyone else but I can talk about me. me me me! At first I just talked about feeling overwhelmed, about how hard it\u2019s been to find reliable consistent help, about how sad I felt that two long-term friendships have all but ended this past year, the year I learned of Fluffy\u2019s asperger\u2019s, the year my heart broke and then began to heal again. I talked about how stressful it is to never have time with my husband, to be navigating the imbalance of time and duty that seems to happen in every marriage once children arrive at the same time as we are navigating the waters of autism remediation from two separate places because we are two separate people with two separate styles.  \n\n I talked about how the house is a needy house and I am the only mother living in it. \n\n I am the only mother living in it. \n\n And then one of the group leaders asked me to lie down in the center of the floor. As I did, the women knelt beside me. I closed my eyes and they lifted me into the air, high into the air. I felt their hands underneath me, soft and strong, and then they began to sway, gently rocking me. I felt as if I were a baby wrapped in a sling or an infant nestled in a cradle and they rocked and swayed me in the air how far up I don\u2019t know because my eyes were closed.  \n\n I thought of my son and his colic and how I couldn\u2019t soothe him even though I would have walked through my life without rest without sleep without pause to soothe if it would have helped but it didn\u2019t. I thought about this last year and the instinct to create safety for my child and how frightening it is when that\u2019s not always possible. I thought about my yearning for motherhood, the years of infertility, the image of family that had always felt sure but was no longer--my children climbing into my lap, tumbling and rolling, giggling with me and each other. I felt this raw grief rise up and howl out of me and they held me and swayed me and rocked me until it passed. I thought of my grandmother and her mother and her mother and felt primitive and powerful, as if I\u2019d been transported through generations to a current of truth about women; this is what women do: they rock, they soothe, they grieve. \n\n I drove home in that dreamy way you do when you\u2019ve sunken back into your body, when the softness blooms from the inside out and the soft puffy red splotchy rises up and onto your face, when you drive at the speed limit and breath all the way in and all the way out, when you really use the headrest on your car seat and you come into your house and you see your husband sitting on the bed next to your son and you remember why you married him and you know your son will be fine, more than fine, perfect, messy strong weak happy sad sure scared joyful, when you know there are no crouching animals but there is need.  \n\n There is need. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/there_is_need.html", "title": "There Is Need"},

Last night I sat in bed, devouring page after page saying, okay, I'll stop after this section, wait, okay, I'll stop after  this  section until it was 2 in the morning. I can't believe what the human body can endure. Phew.  \n\n Early in his stay at the treatment center, Frey describes a trip to the dentist's office where his four smashed in teeth are repaired: two caps, one filling, and two root canals, all without a single shot of anything.

{"date": "January 22, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Still no pictures. Ah well. Go  here , if you must, for a frolicking visual.  \n\n I want to talk about the  RDI  but I don\u2019t want to irritate the poo out of you by sounding pedantic or inflated, like I\u2019m some sort of RDI or autism expert because, oy falloy, I\u2019m far from either. The only thing I\u2019m qualified to lecture on is how to keep eating when you are full and how to drive your point home and then some and then  just a bit more  when arguing with your husband. That\u2019s about it.  \n\n Okay. Disclaimer stated. Onward. \n\n The first thing RDI asks of the family is to talk less, gesture more, slow things down, and use more declarative language. I want to talk a tiny bit about declaratives. \n\n Declarative language is used to share experience. It doesn\u2019t ask for an answer or response, for example: Wow! That looks cool! I wonder what the name of that is? I love the color green. I went for a wonderful walk in the woods this morning.\u00a0 Imperative language asks for an answer, for example: What are you doing? What\u2019s that called? What\u2019s your favorite color? What did you do today? The first way of communicating is an invitation; the other person can say something or not. The second requires a response and often a right one as when the child is being tested or asked a question you know they know the answer to, as in questions that are really fill in the blank.\u00a0 Imperatives are not where we learn about each other, to think creatively and express ideas and feelings. That\u2019s the realm of declaratives.  \n\n RDI says, imperatives are necessary but they are overused with ASD kids. They say, shoot for using declaratives 80% of the time, imperatives 20% of the time. And when you say something declarative, wait 45 seconds before you say something else.\u00a0 Wait and see if your child chooses to share something with you. They may not and that\u2019s okay. But they may surprise you. Try not to make one declarative statement after another, hoping that one of them will penetrate and boom, a conversation will finally erupt. Trust it. Say something genuine. Go for a walk and share what you notice, what you see, what you feel.  \n\n Remember that slowing down and talking less is a goal. Remember that speech is the LAST component of language development added in the typical child. It comes in after a very rich foundation of language has been laid down. From the moment infants are born until somewhere around 18 months when most toddlers start to speak, they have become experienced communicators, using facial expression, body language, prosody--I don\u2019t know all the terms here since I\u2019m not an expert of any kind, but you know what I\u2019m talking about. My friend Rosemary\u2019s daughter was speaking in whole complicated paragraphs when she was 15 months old. It was ALL gibberish but very animated and engaged. She paused, mimicked the rise and fall of story telling, gestured, all the while tuned in to me, modifying responding, reacting, to what I \u2018gave\u2019 her, moment to moment. She had huge amount of receptive language before she said an identifiable word. \n\n We\u2019ve been using declaratives with Fluffy for a while now and I see how it works, especially when I compare it to watching an interaction with someone who doesn\u2019t use them and how that can shut him down. I\u2019ll say, hmm, I wonder what that does...? And he will jump in with his own thought or idea. If someone says, what's that? Silence. Part of it is that kids with Asperger\u2019s can often feel that there is only one answer and they don\u2019t want to get it wrong so they don\u2019t say anything at all. You might ask, what did you do today? And Fluffy won\u2019t know what you mean exactly . What part of today do you mean,  he may think, or,  what part of the day is it now?  or,  I don\u2019t remember what I did today and now I feel worried about that.  But if you say, I built a snowman in my yard, he may think of snow and a memory or thought or feeling may swirl to the surface tumble out without a bit of stress over right or wrong.  \n\n You can sort of cheat it a bit. When it\u2019s time to go out, instead of saying, time to put on your boots, say, I see your boots by the door! or, I\u2019m getting my boots on to go outside, or, oh! I guess you\u2019re going outside today in your socks! All those statements give Fluffy an opportunity to think, to say, huh, why is mom telling me about my boots, oh, that\u2019s right, we\u2019re going out, I need to put them on. If we tell our kids the same thing over and over they become prompt dependent and miss out on the chance to develop what is called their own internal supervisory system, the ability to monitor oneself, to develop mindfulness, to think for themselves. Of course, sometimes you just have to say, come brush teeth right now or you\u2019ll get a consequence after standing in the hall waving a toothbrush saying I have your toothbrush over and over again but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got the 20%. When it\u2019s imperative, use an imperative.  \n\n Try this: next time you\u2019re playing or hanging out with your child, watch the clock and don\u2019t ask a question for 20 minutes. Don\u2019t do it when you\u2019re trying to get something done or get out of the house or do school work, only when it\u2019s truly \u2018free\u2019 time. It's not that questions are against the RDI law or even that all statements are truly about sharing experiences, but trying 20 minutes without a question may highlight some communication habits you may not even be aware of. \n\n I\u2019m reading two great books right,  On Intelligence  by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, and  The Developing Mind  by Daniel J. Siegel. They are both fascinating, the first about a theory of how the brain works (since after years and years of inquiry,  no one knows ), the second, (from the subtitle) \u201chow relationships and the brain interact to shape who we are.\u201d They\u2019re very RDI-ish, in fact, The Developing Mind is just one of a long list of required reading for RDI consultants in training and On Intelligence may soon be added to that list since it is currently on Dr. Gutstein\u2019s night stand. Here's a quote from the start of The Developing Mind: \u201cThe mind emerges from the activity of the brain, whose structure and function are directly shaped by interpersonal experience.\u201d  \n\n We spend a lot of time in our educational system worrying about preschoolers knowing their colors and numbers and how to sit criss cross apple sauce and wait wait wait your turn here's what you do in this situation and here's what you do in that situation but we don\u2019t spend nearly any time teaching our kids to think and certainly much of special education doesn\u2019t even attempt that with ASD kids. One simple way to begin, in my opinion, is to adopt a more declarative state of mind. Because the declarative state of mind opens the door to human connections which shape the neural connections in our children's brains and create their actual minds.  \n\n Sounds like a bumper sticker: Use Declaratives; Create a Mind.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommhigh.html", "http://www.rdiconnect.com", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805074562/bookstorenow57-20/102-1110097-3740955", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572307404/qid=1137987842/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-1110097-3740955?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/declaratives.html", "title": "Use Declaratives; Create a Mind"},
{"date": "January 24, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy had a kind of breakdown in public today. It was at the gum store. I guess he got it into his mind that he was going to get two packs and I said, no, just one. It was almost more than he could take . He threw gum packs about the store and himself upon the floor a number of times. The store clerk was horrified, gasping and tsk-tsking and rolling her eyes at the other adults in the store. At one point, I saw her wagging her craggy finger at him, eyes hanging low in her gray sockets, jowls shaking many inches below her chin. Fucking shit, lady. My son\u2019s not a brat; he\u2019s got a BRAIN DISORDER. \n\n I didn\u2019t get into it with her. I kept myself focused on Fluffy and my own breath. I stood my ground and kept giving him hugs when he asked for them, his face red and scrunched up with the effort of trying to move through the struggle. It lasted about 3 minutes, which is a pretty long time to be center stage by the front door and cashier station as customers came in setting the door bell jangling, shuffling around us to purchase their afternoon papers and smokes and lucky lottery tickets.  \n\n I\u2019d hug him and say, I love you, sweetheart, and then we\u2019d go over to the gum and I\u2019d set him down and say, let\u2019s put that one back and he\u2019d start to but then throw himself down again and say,  I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t do it, I\u2019m too sad , and thrash around and then ask for a hug and I\u2019d give him a hug and pat him gently and then we\u2019d go back to the gum.  \n\n We did get the other gums put away and the one pack of gum to the counter and we did get to the car, Fluffy on my hip, coming down from the whole scene. I\u2019m sure there was some serious head-shaking in the store once we left but you know, I didn\u2019t care. And it was nice not to care about that, but instead to care about my son in the back seat and know that I am willing to take the time to do what I can for him, whether we are in the privacy of our own home or under the judgmental eye of the uninformed public. \n\n I will say that I went to a new doctor yesterday for a lingering chest cold and I was struck by how stingy she was with my son who came with me and was a shining star, by the way, excited to be in a real doctor\u2019s office with all the glamour and allure of props and machinery and none of the anxiety that his own annual would provoke. As soon as she came in, he burst forth with an animated tale of my breathing woes and his own stethoscope at home and she checked him to the corner and asked me a question as she stared down at her clipboard. Fluffy made a few other attempts to communicate and she had none of it, brusquely interrupting him with \u201cI need to talk to your mommy\u201d without so much as a glance in his startled direction. \n\n I hated her for that. Just listen to him for 62 seconds; you don\u2019t have 62 fucking seconds to listen to my son? Plus, I wanted to add, why are you asking me the same thing the receptionist asked and the two nurses with whom I\u2019ve spoken since I arrived asked? Aren\u2019t you all working in the same damn office? Why do you carry around those absurd clipboards if you don\u2019t write anything of value down?  \n\n I think I don\u2019t like western doctors. I\u2019d LIKE to like them. I like medicine. I think I could have been a great doctor had I gotten any guidance other than,  you are meant for greatness but we don\u2019t have the slightest idea how to help you achieve it so good luck with all that and why don\u2019t you open the front door so we can get on with our screaming for all the neighborhood to hear?  but I tell you, I\u2019m not liking the attitude and the knee-jerk dispensing of antibiotics.  \n\n I said,  are you saying that I have a bacterial infection?  and she said, in some cases, random small bodies are responsible for this sort of thing (or something odd like that),  but will the antibiotics take care of that,  I asked? I can\u2019t tell you they will but they might,  well is there anything else I could take, some natural remedy that might address this so called small body growth?  And she said, I could prescribe an inhaler, would you like an inhaler? and I said,  this would help with the bodies?  and she said, no, it's a muscle relaxant, and I said,  oh, do I seem tense to you?   but if it won\u2019t really help, why not throw in a toaster oven because ours is full of black sticky crap and salmon drippings from last night\u2019s dinner and I just don't have it in me to scrub the fucker, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, DOC? \n\n Maybe I\u2019m just grumpy because of the small bodies, but I think these doctors need to go back to school for an intensive on THE ART OF HEALING starting with a breakout session called, Your Patients Are Actual People and Why You Should Care. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/warning_grumpy_.html", "title": "Warning: Grumpy Blogger Ahead"},

{"date": "February 06, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Today I have the honor of spotlighting the stupendous anthology,\u00a0  Literary Mama: Reading for the Maternally Inclined , edited by  Andi Buchanan  and  Amy Hudock , both of whom have wonderful pieces within the covers of this powerful collection of women\u2019s voices. \n\n I daresay, it\u2019s not reading just for the maternally inclined, but for all those inclined to read. Period. Because that\u2019s what stood out for me; it\u2019s a book chock full of vivid writing that is juicy, funny, insightful, inspiring, heady, and heartbreaking. So much so that it left this reader a bit flattened--all these women find time to mother well and passionately, to write well and passionately and to get published in not one but two forms, first in the  Literary Mama's eZine  and then in this  beautiful Seal Press edition.   \n\n Maybe because I am nursing my own grief over my son\u2019s challenges and my own inability to have more children, I was particularly drawn to the section of the book entitled, Surviving Illness and Loss. The whole section is incredibly moving but I found myself weeping almost entirely through  Heidi Raykeil's ,  Johnny , taken from the memoir she\u2019s writing about her son\u2019s short life spent in the neonatal ICU. Here\u2019s an excerpt: \n\n \u00a0  \u00a0 \u201cWe sat in that room a family, the three of us together, like we had always planned. We stripped Johnny\u2019s prefect little body of the last of the Band-Aids and wire tape sticking to him. He was covered in pinpricks, so many tests, so many needles, for what? Physician frustration. He was a medical mystery, and he bore the brunt of it, never even making a cry. He was such a god boy, such a brave boy. I took off my shirt and laid his naked body on my belly. If only I could put him back, where he was safe and alive. I would go on being pregnant for a lifetime if it meant he would be healthy and happy, turning somersaults and kicking the days away inside of me.\u201d \n\n In the same section,  Vicki Forman  begins her piece,  Dear Friend , with this sentence:  \u201cI want to tell you why: I cried in your office; bought myself an expensive purse; don\u2019t talk about the details of my life; smile a lot; give short, simple answers.\u201d \u00a0 and ends with this:  \u201cSometimes you don't like something your whole life but you're still meant to be here on Earth. That is the beauty, the struggle, the true puzzle; fifty pieces and more, upside down, inside out, right side in.\u201d  In the middle, she opens my chest and climbs in, moves things in me that were waiting for her precise language. Our sons are very different, but I felt a kinship with her words that soothed and lifted me.  \n\n Every piece in this collection articulated something for me. Most especially these:  Holly Day's  breathtaking  Nebraska ,  Kimberly Greene Angle's  sweeping  Forecasts ,  Sybil Lockhart's  poignant  Gray ,  Lisa Rubisch's  funny and cathartic  How to Make a Meat Pie and Other Tales of the Ambitious Mother  and all the poetry by  Ona Gritz . \n\n I\u2019m proud of these women and proud of their voices. These writers, these mothers; these writers, these woman; these writers, these people.\u00a0 To mother and write requires courage, flexibility, stamina and most of all, the willingness to take oneself seriously in the best sense of the world. I thank them all for inspiring me to be willing to do the same. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580051588/qid=1139260305/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-4302624-8889452?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.mothershock.com/blog/", "http://www.literarymama.com/fiction/archives/000439.html", "http://www.literarymama.com/ezine/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580051588/qid=1139259664/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-4302624-8889452?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158005157X/qid=1139260157/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4302624-8889452?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.literarymama.com/creativenonfiction/archives/000593.html", "http://www.literarymama.com/poetry/archives/000651.html", "http://www.literarymama.com/creativenonfiction/memoir/", "http://www.literarymama.com/columns/mamainthemiddle/", "http://www.literarymama.com/creativenonfiction/archives/000756.html", "http://www.literarymama.com/poetry/archives/000326.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/virtual_book_to.html", "title": "Virtual Book Tour: Literary Mama"},

{"date": "February 03, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t   \n\n Toxic String; Yesterday. \u00a0 \n\n Before I became a mother I would scoff at germaphobes.  Stop being such a wimp! So what! It\u2019s a little bug! Drink out of my cup. DO IT! You\u2019ll toughen up your immune system and when small pox gets dropped in the water supply, you\u2019ll breeze past the bodies.  It didn\u2019t matter who was sick, me or the other guy. I had illness bravado. \n\n Then Fluffy was born and you could hear the needle scratch across the whole record. If someone due to come over even mentioned that they knew of someone who was sick, I would lock the doors, turn out the lights and leap onto Fluffy\u2019s body, spread eagle, like I was protecting the president--I mean, someone important who I liked a lot, until the person gave up and went home. I was one of those ashen-faced mothers at the playgroups at the sight of a mother covertly wiping away the rivulets of green snot off her barking child. MY GOD WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU, I would hiss as I snatched up my child by the toe and bolted for the car. \n\n Sickness sent the terrible sleep situation in our house to an intolerable place, a place of weeping and tearing out my hair, of scratching at my skin to get the spiders out, a place of howling into my husband\u2019s frightened face I CAN\u2019T FUCKING TAKE IT! I CAN\u2019T! I CAN\u2019T! WHY AREN'T YOU SAYING ANYTHING?! SHUT UP! SAY SOMETHING!! and so I warded it off with every ounce of vigilance I had. \n\n Until yesterday. \n\n Fluffy\u2019s party was at 2pm. I invited the children of three of my friends, they each have boys Fluffy\u2019s age and one younger child. We don\u2019t really spend too much time with any of these kids; socializing has been so hard for Fluffy, but that is changing now, since our big breakthrough playdate with Aidan last Friday and of course, a number of hugely successful playdates with Ethan over the last few months. In fact, it was after going to Ethan\u2019s party that Fluffy decided he wanted a party,  just like Ethan\u2019s , with cake and ice cream and KIDS. The other boy, Sammy, used to be a constant companion back when his mother and I were much closer. He and Fluffy were born a day apart, down the hall from each other in the same hospital delivered by the same Ob and assisted by the same doula. They haven\u2019t played together in well over a year but they used to see each other at least once a week.  \n\n It makes me sad, this changed friendship. Every year on Fluffy\u2019s birthday I think back to that time when we were both so new to parenthood, posing for a picture with our tiny babies wrapped efficiently in those pink and blue hospital blankets, our tiny baby logs. All six of us, shy, beaming, new:she with her son and husband, me with my son and husband, our faces so young and vulnerable and full of the otherworldly experience of having stepped on the threshold of life and death, having reached back through that membrane to pull our children into this world. That is such a specific face--I\u2019ve seen it in other photos of moms with their newborns, an openness washed across on this, the other side of the tumult of birth. \n\n But I digress. \n\n I knew the party brought Aidan and his sister, the kind of kids who perpetually drip and crust and cough but who have boundless curiosity and a love of digging deep into the dark soil. I call Aidan the Archeologist because of this very zest for life plus the dashing profile he cuts wearing large brimmed hats in every season. I was ready for that. Okay, then Sammy\u2019s mom called to say her daughter\u2019s glassy-eyed and hacking. I waved her in. It\u2019ll be fine! Midmorning, Ethan\u2019s mom called to say Ethan\u2019s sick.  \n\n What\u2019s he got?  A double ear infection.  Oh. Well, they\u2019re not catchy, right? He\u2019s got a fever.  Mmm. Well, how\u2019s his mood?  He\u2019s been throwing up hourly.  Uhuh.  \n\n (Silence.) \n\n So, what are you saying, you\u2019ll be late? I mean, we\u2019ve got extra bowls and towels and, you know, we\u2019re only talking a couple of hours... \n\n Ethan was sadly missed but I\u2019m happy to report, he is now on the road to recovery and to New Hampshire for a long-anticipated family getaway.  \n\n And the birthday was glorious, in every way. Fluffy called the spring-like weather his gift from mother earth. Safari animals were hunted down, toxic string in a can was gleefully sprayed, magician tricks were performed followed by a tedious stretch of time during which cartoon trademark characters were twisted into shape from looooong squealing balloons, cake and ice cream was consumed, and presents were opened. It was a party! It worked! Everyone had a fabulous time. I\u2019m afraid I went overboard with the party favors. Every time I got nervous I bought more toys and trinkets and shooters and mini-markers until by the end of the day, little kids were pulling out their backs hefting trash bags full of crap I\u2019m sure their parents wanted to immediately throw away. \n\n Tee hee. Nerves! \n\n So, Fluffy\u2019s five. Five. It\u2019s a big one, isn\u2019t it? The fives and zeros. He\u2019s such a big boy now. I watched him in the bath today with his \u2018magic\u2019 school bus towel and diving Nemo fish toy. He flipped and flopped, made bridges and waves, stretched the length of the tub, dove beneath the surface and held his breath without his hands to pinch his nose or cover his eyes and I had to let him come up on his own because I knew he would, but still, I sat right by the edge and he was under a long time and then he broke through the surface and gasped and gulped at the air and his eyes sprang open delirious and relieved and electrified and I remembered the moment when he first emerged from the waters within my own body and I felt the memory rise up through me like the wavy lines off the highway in summer and I nearly wept from his beauty.   \n\n How could I ever thank him enough for this, this gift to me, my motherhood? \n\n The Busy Birthday Boy. \n\n  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/my_gift.html", "title": "My Gift"},
{"date": "January 15, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I\u2019m going to talk about RDI (Relationship Development Intervention). I am. In fact, I feel like turning this blog into a daily account of our RDI program. I don\u2019t know. Maybe no one would want to hear all that, all those details. But maybe just one family does and maybe they would find out about RDI and do it with their child and maybe I\u2019d meet up with them in five or ten years and we\u2019d bring along our kids, now off the spectrum, and eat gobs of casein and gluten,\u00a0 and encode episodic memories while we referenced, experience shared, coordinated and used so much creative, flexible thinking, the room would spin and we\u2019d all laugh about how the room was stimming. \n\n I don\u2019t know. In the meantime, I\u2019m having some thoughts and here they are. \n\n Fluffy doesn\u2019t have trouble processing information because of his personality; he has trouble because he has autism.  \n\n As we remediate the autism, pathways will form in his brain allowing him to process information with greater and greater connectivity. But this process in no way, threatens to change who he is. That thread of the autism debate has never made one lick of sense to me, the concern that treating the autism would change who the child is.  \n\n If you were in a room with deafening noise and slowly you turned the noise down, removed some of the noisemakers, until you, previously frozen by the onslaught of confusing sounds and messages, were now able to hear and respond, then, have you changed? Or are you now more able to express WHO YOU ARE TO THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.  \n\n Remediating=the act or process of remedying, ie, repairing, correcting, restoring health of the normal functioning to the body.  \n\n The core deficits of autism are the same, whether you are classically autistic or high functioning like PDD-NOS or Aspergers. These kids aren\u2019t different from you and me; their brains aren\u2019t INcapable of being restored to what is generally considered neurotypical. But there is something different in place initially that requires intervention.  \n\n Some children exhibit signs of autism from a brain injury. In those cases, the parents are clearer about what needs to be done, oh, there\u2019s a problem here, we can take these steps to restore health to the functioning of the brain, so let\u2019s go. Why is this not the same in the autism community? Why isn\u2019t there that assumption? The brain needs our help. Let\u2019s get in there and give it a chance to grow, to correct, to repair. This does not imply the CHILD is broken, in need of fixing. It implies that the child is and ought to be given the same opportunity we provide every human being on the planet, the chance to form new pathways, the chance for the brain to learn, the chance for the brain to do what it was MADE TO DO--to change.  \n\n Dr. Gutstein, the co-founder of RDI, doesn\u2019t prescribe to the hard boiled egg theory of the mind: better get in there before the magic moment when the child turns 5, before the brain is hard, done, the end. This goes against all the research in the field of neurobiology. The brain is plastic, it changes, new neurons are made every day and migrate to new places in the brain, awaiting assignment. Most brain cell death takes place in the waiting room, when the new cells get no job assignments. If no one signs them up and begins training, they\u2019ll die. Until then, they\u2019re as game as can be. Me me !! Pick me! I\u2019m up for learning a new pathway of language, of communication, that isn\u2019t just labeling things and rote memory and sequential pathway of events; I\u2019m up for the more complex stuff too, the interconnectedness, the whys and predictions, the testing hypothesize, the seeing patterns in the middle of variation and fluctuation. \n\n Let\u2019s be very clear about this; the trouble Fluffy has in forming episodic memory, in having reciprocal interactions, in referencing, in communicating in a broadband complex way have nothing to do with who he is. Fluffy isn\u2019t AUTISM or ASPERGERS, he\u2019s Fluffy, wonderful interesting bright affectionate Fluffy. He has strengths and challenges built in to his personality, these will remain with him his whole life, to lesser and greater degrees. Any remediation program that really takes him back to what he missed developmentally is only going to give him the tools, the basics, to be a real player in the world. Scripts won\u2019t help him, the \u2018when this happens, we do this\u2019 because the world doesn\u2019t work that way.  \n\n We make our way, we have success, we build confidence in our increasing ability to respond flexibly and mindfully in any given situation that is, by it\u2019s nature, FRAUGHT with uncountable variations an possibilities. Real conversations and connections with other people, the reason we\u2019re here, the most interesting and exciting and worthwhile thing going in our lifetimes, are moment to moment improvisations. The very thing that makes them fun is we don\u2019t know what will happen next. But children, typical children, learn very quickly that this is where the action is, more! new! challenge me! I\u2019m up for it! I can figure it out and if I can\u2019t I can learn from my mistakes. ASD kids don\u2019t get that because they haven\u2019t built any competence in those areas. They are looking for sameness and predictability, static systems because their comfort comes from that, their feeling of competence comes from that. I do this, this happens. Every time. And believe me, they get very good at the things they figure out, don't they? They are the same as any other kid, they are motivated by a feeling of competence MUCH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, more than fun, more than rewards. They want, they need to see themselves as competent.  \n\n But if we teach ASD kids a hundred versions of x and think that will prepare them for the world, we\u2019re kidding ourselves and short changing them. The beauty of being alive is in seeing ourselves as capable of learning, real learning, taking what we know and applying in it a new situation, adapting. \n\n Let\u2019s believe in our kids, in ALL our ASD kids. Let\u2019s go back to believing they can have what we dreamed for them before we learned anything was wrong. Because they can. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/a_few_thoughts_.html", "title": "A Few Thoughts Are Spinning"},

Dave and I had a total of 16 hours in the car up and back to do nothing but talk and fight which we did to much productive end. Truly.  \n\n Dr. Gutstein was brilliant, albiet a bit odd, but certainly clear, masterful and inspiring. I got much needed help on a few fundamentals and a much needed break from the routine of my life. One of the nicest gifts of the week was my ability to be fully present at the workshop; I felt like  Owl at Home  without the racing around part: when I was up, I was not down; when I was down, I was not up. In other words, I did not worry about Fluffy at all.  \n\n There were couples and RDI consultants and power point presentations, breakout discussion groups and brainstorming sessions, the batting of balloons en masse; there was even salami and potato chips. It's true. It turns out, they're very RDI.  \n\n  I learned many things, one of which is, couples look alike. I don't mean they have a similar style, I mean they LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER--startlingly so.

{"date": "January 17, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t I'm having a ball over here with Fluffy. I am in the RDI zoooooooooooone. I'm, like, totally there, man. This is the most relaxed and focused I've felt in, well, ever.  \n\n The first few years of parenting were those of joy, elation, and amusement mixed with profound sleep deprivation, stark isolation, sweeping bouts of frustration and the flat cold wind of sure inadequacy. I loved being a mom, being Fluffy's mom, but I was, as I mentioned here many times, absolutely thrown by how hard it was. It wasn't just the regular hard it was the how the fuck does anyone get anything done hard. And since Fluffy talked and walked early, and looked at me a lot, basically gazing into my eyes like a drunken love-sick sailor every time he nursed which was 22 hours a day for over 4 years,\u00a0 since he loved the scream of my hair dryer and the vroom of the vacuum, since he was curious and seemingly, paradoxically, independent while demanding constant care, attention, and involvement, since he didn't spin or line up toys, I NEVER for one tiny second considered that he had AUTISM. NEVER. He was high needs. He was eccentric. He was brilliant. He was FINE and I just hadn't figured out how to do it yet, how to parent HIM.  \n\n Of course, that all changed about 4 months after his third birthday. Slowly it became clear that something was awry. Our biggest tip-off was how he was with other kids. He had never been interested in them, sort of marched ahead, ignoring their requests or questions or offers of soggy spit sodden graham crackers but he was never aggressive. In fact, my good friends son, born a day earlier than mine, was the one we raised our eyebrows around. He entered the terrible twos at 18 months and stayed there for a solid 2 years. When we were over for a play date one afternoon, we found him wrestling my Fluffy to the ground by his hair and attempting to ride him like a horse. Whenever he did things like that, Fluffy always looked completely shocked, like, why the hell would anyone DO that? but then he'd shake it off and trot back to the new toys, tossing one after another aside once they were quickly scanned and deemed uninteresting. That was another difference. Fluffy never played with anything. Not really. I kept buying things and borrowing things in the vain hope I'd find the ONE toy that captured his interest. No. He liked the computer, magnatiles, books, and my boobies.  \n\n So, as we closed in on his half birthday, I saw that every other kid his age was figuring out the social thing at least part of the time. Not so my guy. In fact, he got aggressive for the first time: biting, hitting, kicking, throwing things. And for the first time I'd watch him run and run and run down the beach, through the umbrellas and bathers and coolers, never looking back once to see if I was there and thought, hmm, maybe this isn't a sign of confidence.  \n\n There were other things too, rigidity, inflexibility, inability to recognize faces--even mine on a few occasions, his obsession with numbers and letters, his fear of pretend play, his never saying goodbye or hello, his not looking at people, his failure to point or share, to express curiosity about people but only about systems or machines. And of course, the sleep. The sleep! Don't even get me started on the night terrors.  \n\n Then there was the year between the start and quick dismissal from preschool and this past fall, when we had our RDA with our RDI consultant. And the last few months of trying to do RDI at home and feeling completely sure this was the thing for us, for Fluffy, but slogging through confusion, frustration and feelings of inadequacy all over again.  \n\n I don't think of myself as type A. I'm really not. It used to crack me up when the fertility specialists, all men, would tilt their head to the side and tell me how hard it was for\u00a0 OLDER women like me, used to success and accomplishment in the workplace, to learn how to relax and  let go and let fertilize  or whatever the hell they were trying to tell me. Look BUB, I've spend the last 20 years doing every grunt job on the planet, scrambling and underearning up the wazoo. I'm about as accomplished as your side table over there so just shut up and get me the biggest fucking needle you can find, cram it full of hormones from horse pee or silent menopausal nuns, some fresh human chorionic gonadotropin and STICK IT IN MY ASS, PRONTO.   \n\n So. Fast forward to today .  \n\n I finally feel like I know what I'm doing. No. There's no exact formula but what I've found is my intuition. It was lost. Or rather, it was meaningless before, like the empty sleeve of a one-armed man. They don't talk about that much in the autism community. But a parent loses their intuition when they don't get the typical feedback from their child. Because it's meant to be a loop. You act, they respond, or, they act you respond and then they respond to your response. And that builds over time.\u00a0 Not so with the ASD child. A parent fails to bring their child through the typical developmental stages, fails to help them, their child, make sense of the world. It's no one's fault. Certainly not the parent, doing everything in their power to provide for their child. Certainly not the child, doing everything in their power to grow, discover, and learn. In the process of this absence, one's feeling of being a competent parent is lost. Or hindered.\u00a0 It doesn't seem to work that way if the parent has a typical child, either before or after. Then you can see the difference.  \n\n I don't have any other kids. I have Fluffy. Delightfully, quirky, poetic Fluffy. And I'm going back in for a second try. I think I have the stuff for it.

{"date": "January 20, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Out back, yesterday.  \n\n Oy. The parameters for zapping Fluffy\u2019s brain during neurofeedback need to be adjusted. Ever since we walked out of yesterday\u2019s session it\u2019s been rigid city with passing clouds of chaos, vague wanderings, flopping around and glazed expressions. It\u2019s not his best look.  \n\n I wish I could link to past posts here but I can\u2019t, either due to my own ineptitude, which is plentiful, or the shortcomings of typepad. If I could, I would remind you all that neurofeedback is painless and can been very organizing but the megahertz for the middle range of electronic activity need to be tweaked here and there and man, we are due for a tweaking. The moment the technician unstuck the electrodes and sent him into the waiting room, he was looking for a fight, toddler style.  \n\n There was a NT little girl playing happily on her own while her brother was having a go at making space ships zoom faster through the galaxy monitor screen with only his brain, no keyboard or joystick. She looked over at Fluffy, smiled, eager to play. Fluffy clearly had to pee but ignored that reality and my suggestion and the cheerful girl. Instead, he began rolling marbles down a run in between such aggressive pinching and twisting of his penis through his pants I was sure it would snap off and be tossed aside in irritation. I finally got him to come to the bathroom with me and when we returned, the little girl had down the unthinkable--she was playing with the marble run.  \n\n The horror. \n\n I did my best to facilitate a turn taking marble run game and then Dr. L. walked by and asked me about the parent 4-day and I turned to him to answer, which is my way, and when I glanced back, the marble run was in ruins and Fluffy was flashing the eyes of satan throughout the room. Push came to shove and then a time out in the hall after dragging Fluffy doing his peace rally pacifist resisting THE MAN impersonation, all limp and righteous.  \n\n He hates a time out. And ours are pretty mild, really. I hold him with me for about 30 seconds.  \n\n The horror. \n\n So, the RDI marathon continues and through this patch of static, I forge ahead with my slowed pace, non verbals, and declaratives. It\u2019s been helping. And so has the good old fashioned parenting 101 with the calm and the clear and the consequences and the consistency.    \n\n As for the brain training, get me some conducting goo and turn up the dial. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/we_need_an_adju.html", "title": "We Need An Adjustment"},

Okay, more than a little nervous.\u00a0  \n\n Every other year, we\u2019ve had a small, family-only event. This year, he wants a party, like Ethan\u2019s--the one we all went to a few weeks ago; the one where he ate real cake and ice cream and had a great time; the one where the big kids ran and squealed and played at rocket speed and he happily tottered around in the train room with the under 2 set.  \n\n He didn\u2019t seem to mind or notice that he was out of the \u2018pack\u2019. But will he be odd-man out here? At his own party? Will he notice it then? And whom shall we invite? He doesn\u2019t really have any friends. Ethan is as close as he comes but he hasn\u2019t had a playdate with him in over a month; each suggestion I\u2019ve made over the last few weeks has been met with a sure  no, not today , and I haven\u2019t felt it was right to push.  \n\n The thing is, kids can be mean, even when they don\u2019t mean to. And I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve done my best to shield Fluffy from it but it has happened and it fucking sucks. Even a friend of mine\u2019s son very swiftly joined in to mock and tease when Fluffy didn\u2019t understand the game. Even that same boy and the sweet son of another friend of mine did the same; the sing-song, the taunting, the fake set up and then the running away, laughter sailing behind them.  \n\n Fluffy may not encode much, if any, episodic memory, but kids with Asperger\u2019s have notoriously VIVID and LONG memories for bad experiences. \n\n But maybe if I keep it short and HIGHLY structured, get \u2018em in and right into a supervised game, then food, then magician (an extravagance--Fluffy loves magic), then cake then presents then boot \u2018em out the door?? \n\n What I need here are suggestions, for games or themes or incantations and spells or just incredibly strong medication for me.  \n\n Maybe for all of us.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/call_for_ideas.html", "title": "Call For Ideas?"},

Maybe we ate it or served it to Fluffy? \n\n I wish the food thing weren\u2019t so hard.  \n\n We\u2019ve been doing GFCF, tried going off, need to go back on for a while to get a clearer picture, and now it looks like we may have to try  Feingold . More eliminations. What will my dear boy eat? Something needs to be done because he\u2019s got ghastly dark circles under his eyes and red ears and he is just generally off.  \n\n Salicylates. Phenols. Those are the possible culprits and\u00a0 they are in all the food he\u2019s been eating lately: tomatoes, oranges, peanuts, berries, pickles, bell peppers. He\u2019s lost interest in things he used to love eating: meatloaf, turkey burgers, pork chops, chicken, and only wants to eat salt. Salt sprinkled with fat and potatoes.  \n\n This morning I presented him with delicious slow-cooked oatmeal with walnuts and soy milk and organic maple syrup and he pushed it away after one bite.  What else do you have?  was his question, the question he now asks at every meal, as if he is the food critic and we are the obedient waitstaff, ready to race back to Chef in the kitchen with reports of his gastronomic ennui. I listed a couple other breakfast choices and he said,  I would like salami or olives or pickles or pepperoni\u00a0 pizza or plain pizza. Can I have any of those? \n\n Ah, no. \n\n I dashed off to Whole Foods, 40 minutes away, and purchased organic foods and nitrate/nitrite-free sandwich meats and then raced home as if I were delivering a liver for transplant. It\u2019s unseasonably warm and I had to do an errand that ought to have taken a few minutes but ended up taking 30 because the woman at the store was new and flustered and had to keep sneaking off to smoke cigarettes and drink from a flask, but I am trying to spread peace and since I\u2019m sure the meats really were okay and not bubbling with microorganisms in the way back of my car, I smiled and told her it was okay, no problem, take your time, and, I think you\u2019re hair is on fire, and maybe you ought to sit down? \n\n The thing is, Fluffy has always been a good eater and I don\u2019t want that to change. Food used to be simple and tasty and flowing and there was much lifting up and toasting of overflowing mugs, ripping of banquettes, banging on the table as the whole pig was carried from spit to plate with laughter and capes and shlopping up sauces of stinking cheese. And now, let\u2019s see: no meats or poultry; fish is too scary with all the mercury; cheese is dairy so that\u2019s out, too much soy is no good, especially for boys; gluten is a no no and so say farewell to many of the hearty whole grains; tomatoes, berries, bananas, peanuts, almonds, peppers, cucumbers, oranges--all gone, for now, and one must always be careful of too much corn or potatoes since the body turns it into sugar and suddenly, hordes of yeast bad-asses are marauding the gut and wrecking havoc on the whole system. \n\n Well, I\u2019ll just have to find a way to make it appealing.

I have a sickness brewing; I feel it in the back of my throat, my ears, my joints. Jeez. I can't get sick now. Be gone! Away with you! \n\n Last week we began preparing Fluffy for our departure. We told him we were going to a school, a special school to help parents become better parents. Once he found out my mom, Mama Mama, would be with him and that I would be home in time to put him to bed, he carried on, nonplussed. The past few days, however, he's brought it up daily, wondering if maybe just Daddy ought to go or maybe we ought to go to that school another time or maybe we were already really great parents and didn't need to go at all. \n\n Today, mid-rocket play, he looked over and said,  do they ever let kids into that school? to prove the people there really are parents?   \n\n That's my guy, brainstorming a way to get into that room. \n\n I hope it goes well.

I feel for him; he is so dysregulated and clingy and inflexible, hanging off my neck, saying over and over again,  I feel sad, I feel sad, I feel sad,  when I think what he\u2019s really feeling is  not right .  \n\n That makes two of us. After a solid week of him glomming onto me so that I literally hear the rip of velcro when I free myself long enough to take a pee, clearing out of the way when he swipes his hand across the counter sending every last article flying to the floor, melting down when I pick up a foam block when we\u2019re playing magnatiles and HOW DARE I TOUCH A NON-MAGNATIZED OBJECT WHEN WE\u2019RE ARE PLAYING MAGNATILES, I have retreated to the rooftop where I will now gently set down the laptop and fling my body to the garbage cans below. \n\n It\u2019s a low roof.  \n\n We\u2019re very CLOSE, my son and I. We really are. I love it and I love him but I am SO READY for him to be close to other people too. Come on, other people! Come quickly and be close to my son!! I\u2019ve been working on that for ages and there are a few other special people in his life but when he is feeling this way, only I will do. And if I set him down or unhook my hand from his, or turn back around to get something in the other room, my god, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve dropped him into deep space. \n\n Even when fuming from some egregious slight like disallowing chocolate pops for breakfast, he\u2019ll stomp and yell,  Stop it, Mommy! Stop it! I\u2019m mad at you!  and then in the same scrunched up face, shout,  MOMMY! CAN I PLEASE HAVE A HUG SO I CAN CALM DOWN?  \n\n I know I know. He\u2019s been sick. the holidays are nutty, overwhelming, the schedule is all off, the playroom help has dried up since all the college gals are back home, we tried going off the diet for the last 6 weeks, which I think was a mistake. To top it all off,\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going through the terrible twos. See, that\u2019s the beauty part of developmental delays, you get to the stages, you just get there late. So, as we close in on 5, we are just now entering the land of the bellowing NO. \n\n I suppose it\u2019s good. We never had much negativism, never had a big temper tantrum stage. Dr. H. says this is the first time he gets that other people have their own ideas, thoughts, feelings, needs, etc., and that these don\u2019t always mesh with his. She says this stage precedes the beginning of true negotiation and compromise and lordy knows, I\u2019m all for that.  \n\n So, I\u2019ll just try to hang in there but sometimes I feel like I\u2019m getting smaller and smaller, like little Alice through the looking glass only I haven\u2019t seen any white rabbits and the cats in the trees aren\u2019t smiling today. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/12/no_smiling_cats.html", "title": "No Smiling Cats Today"},
{"date": "December 23, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n We brought a holiday card like this one to Fluffy's OT, Miss Sharon. It was only the second card he's given to anyone, the first being at his friend Ethan's birthday party last weekend. We wrote her name together on the envelope and then he ricocheted through the doors and up the steps to await her arrival.  \n\n There are two stairwells from which she can emerge so it's always a game to play--will it be that doorway or that one? I stood and smiled at his bursting enthusiasm while he played the color jumping game which involved leaping from a green to red to orange linoleum floor tile with a steady outpouring of sound effects and complicated score-keeping. And all the while, he held that card high in the air, quivering, expectant, proud.  \n\n When she came around the close doorway, he raced to her and brought the card very close to her face,  Look Look Miss Sharon! A beautiful card for you in an envelope that has a long rectangular glue part that you activate by licking!   She thanked him and admired the envelope, remarking particularly on the glue part. They opened it together and then laughed at all the Fluffys they found in the picture. \n\n Then they left for the sensory room and I waved and called out,  Goodbye! I'm saying goodbye! I'll meet you right here when you're done ! to which Miss Sharon replied, Goodbye, Mom! We'll see you when we're done!  \n\n My son rarely says hello or goodbye and we don't prompt him anymore. Instead, we use declaratives, highlighting our own hello and goodbye-saying, because we believe in doing so, we are helping him to develop his own 'mindfullness', his own desire to greet those he meets because he wants to, to say goodbye to those he leaves because it means something to him.\u00a0 It was one of the earliest signs of his Asperger's, a sign we were oblvious to at the time, a sign everyone was oblivious to at the time.\u00a0 We've lived in the same house since he was born and we'd see the same neighbors day after day, all of them friendly, all of them bending down to give hearty hellos to our dear little infant, baby, toddler, and he would stare straight ahead and never say a word. I would say,  oh, honey! It's so and so from next door!  Stare. I would say,  say hello to so and so!  And he would repeat our words in the faint high voice of a robot, still staring. \n\n On the day of the Christmas card, Fluffy turned around and looked square at me.  Mom! Goodbye, Mom! I'll see you when we're done, Mom!  and then he ran over to me, reached out his arms, and gave me a huge hug and a kiss. \n\n When I started to blog, I felt alone and scared. It's been almost a year now and I feel a lovely and real connection to a community of people. I'm not scared anymore but I'm still feeling around in the dark but now it's like being one of many on a nighttime hike, our flashlights shining out into the wilderness, sending white beams through the wide dark sky. \n\n Thanks to everyone who stops by.

I just heard from my childhood boyfriend who found my email by googling my name. So thrilling to hear from him! I loved this guy, this boy, I suppose I ought to say since we rolled around making out for hours at a time when we were, what, 14? less? 13? He has a lovely wife and two children, 4 and 2. Isn\u2019t that adorable? Or is it only adorable to me? I have nothing but the fondest memories of this guy. I think we had a ball. I was still an innocent; I hadn\u2019t begun to behave badly in relationships. I don\u2019t even remember why we broke up. I don\u2019t think anyone was mad at each other; Tucker, if you\u2019re reading this, maybe you can remind me. Fluffy is better. The illness has all but past, the dysregulation is all but gone though the attachment is still fairly extreme. I\u2019m nervous because Dave and I have the 4-day RDI parent-training seminar coming up in Boston next week and my mom is slated to man the playroom from our early morning departure to our 6 pm return each day. We were going to load up the car with books and magnets and beanbags, my mom strapped to a rocker on the roof of the car, and all stay in a hotel for the duration but I pulled the plug on the plan at the last minute. I imagined Fluffy and mom, holed up in a drab hotel room for hours upon hours while the bitter winds of winter blew snowdrifts through the empty city streets.  So, now I\u2019ve got a sitter lined up to give my mom a break midday for a few hours, we\u2019ve got a new new Magic School Bus videos coming,\u00a0 the lure of special treat playing on daddy\u2019s computer, and of course, daily french fries to help him get through the day. I\u2019ll be home in time to put him to bed, but it\u2019s still the longest he\u2019s gone without both of his parents. Four long days. Gulp. Please send all the most positive vibes you can muster. We\u2019ll need them.  You see, I need this training. I need it. I need the help, the support, the information, the being in the room with a bunch of other parents on the same journey with the same philosophy. RDI is still fairly new. It\u2019s really the only remediation program that makes any sense to me but there aren\u2019t big cover stories or TV specials on it, even the recent autism treatment cover story in Mothering Magazine didn\u2019t mention a word of it, there\u2019s no funding at the state level, insurance doesn\u2019t pick it up, I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m the only parent out there currently writing a memoir about how RDI is \u2018saving\u2019 my son--one that will most likely take another 10 years to write since the whole process is s-l-o-w, real but slow. Remediation along the social developmental pathway, it turns out, isn\u2019t sexy. Oh, and by the way, Happy New Year! I\u2019m, personally, for the new year, for 2006. I\u2019ve always made new year\u2019s resolutions, or rather, new year\u2019s visions. I write down what I want my life to be as if it IS. I make two copies, one gets pinned to my office wall so I see it and read it every day, the other gets sealed up in an envelope that I\u2019ll read at the end of the year. Here are a few: \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u2019ve got a fabulous relationship with my literary agent \u00a0 \u00a0 I\u2019ve got a book contract from a publishing house that I  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 respect \u00a0 \u00a0 Fluffy is having regular successful playdates \u00a0 \u00a0 Fluffy is thriving in his homeschool program \u00a0 \u00a0 Fluffy has mastered stage 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am part of an interesting and supportive community \u00a0 \u00a0 I have an incredibly creative, dedicated and dependable  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 part-time nanny \u00a0 \u00a0 I am feeling fit and fiery and connected to my passion \u00a0 \u00a0  I\u2019m reading the most exciting book called  The Creative License  by  Danny Gregory . It\u2019s full of his beautiful drawings and inspiring words about reclaiming one\u2019s natural genius and I think you ought to go buy it this instant. It\u2019s also full of wonderful quotes like this one from Henry Miller: \u00a0 \u00a0  Every day we slaughter our finest impulses. That is why we get a heartache when we read the lines written by the hand of a master and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which we stifled because we lacked the faith to believe our own powers, or own criterion\u00a0 of truth and beauty. Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering profound truths. I\u2019m really getting that I\u2019ve got this one life here. This is it. This is my life and I\u2019m going to live it, I\u2019m going to say yes to it, I\u2019m going to keep going back to the drawing board when things look complicated and dire and grim and shake things up, turn things over, rip off a fresh page; I\u2019m going to keep believing that there\u2019s a way to work it out, to see it differently, to find a new perspective, to sit quietly in the center of my heart with my hand on a pen. I\u2019m going back to when I drew that picture of Dee Dee with my cat on her lap, when I was 4 and full of curiosity, when I was matter of fact about my desires and willingness to leap and fall and leap again. \n\n What about you?

Well, skinless to some degree I was, just booted out of a marriage, wandering the busy streets of NYC with no career, children, or assets of any kind in sight, fast approaching 40.

People were funny, irreverent, profound, scattered, terrified, peaceful, thoughtful, searching. It was an amazing experience, deeply moving to me to be surrounded by others who were making a stab at figuring something out, something personal and spiritual, containing a simple, larger truth, people who were united mostly by their own admission that there wasn\u2019t always a neat answer or a pretty picture in the dark places of their minds. \n\n At first, I gravitating toward people who shared  well , who sounded  good . I would move through the crowd, turning my shoulders this way and that, cutting through the clutches that would invariably gather, stepping over the acreage of metal folding chairs, across the dirty linoleum floor to the person who sounded together. I would say, thank you for sharing, and sometimes, though certainly not always, this person would look up and with the eyes of the haunted, growl, and spew pea soup halfway across the room. And often, though certainly not always, the person who sounded like she was sharing in a straight jacket on a weekend pass would levitate into the air on the purified sound of 'om' but not before uniting hands with the whole of the human race. Which led me to believe that we are all confident, calm, wise, worried, scared, and insecure, puzzling out a way to make our lives work. \n\n \n\n Those particular meetings aren't around here but there is a women's support group starting in January and I\u2019ve signed up. Here\u2019s what the flyer says we're gonna do: \n\n \u2022 Explore the tension between the woman we present to the  \u00a0 \u00a0world and our fantasy woman \n \u2022 Find the sacred place between being a doormat and being a  \u00a0 \u00a0bitch \u2022 Discover our self-imposed limitations and expand our  \u00a0 \u00a0awareness of our own possibilities.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Let me also say that it's been over 2 weeks without coffee and my\nfriends, the colors have returned! I've been squirting st. john's wort\ninto my tea and leaping onto the elliptical machine every day since it was delivered\nto our house over the weekend. Yes, that's right, Dave and I are now\nexercising in our underwear.  \n\n AND Fluffy went to his first birthday\nparty over the weekend. It was chaos--house jammed with\nnever-before seen adults and kids of all ages. He gravitated to the quiet room, the one with the train set and the under 2 crowd, while the 4 and 5-year olds raced up and down the stairs with ruddy cheeks and wild eyes, leapt off beds, shooting soft nobby balls at each other's heads. He proudly presented the gift we wrapped together. He ate pizza, cake, and ice cream. (I'd say we're officially of the GFCF now.) Aside from time he emerged from the bathroom, nude from the waist down, and blithely made his way back to the toddler room in search of his train rocket, he was just another kid at the rumpus. And he had a\nball! He said,  Mommy, that was great! I want to have a\nbirthday party just like that when I go turn five.  \n\n And so, he will. \n\n I am now off to my mom's house to watch the very able bodies of  Rize  do the impossible.

{"date": "January 07, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t There was a young man at neurofeedback last week for the first time. He appeared to be about 12 years od but it was hard to say. He was slight and held his limbs like a lanky crane unhappily waking through a sticky marsh. He was having an extreme reaction to certain pitches in the waiting room that apparently pained him a great deal as he wrapped his arms around his head and whimpered a high pitched cry. Enter Fluffy with the pink race car that he loves to pretend is a rocket and within seconds, the boy was on his mother\u2019s lap, squealing into her neck.  \n\n They were there to try the neurofeedback. The mother went in the \u2018training\u2019 room with her son and sat in front of the screen, the electrodes stuck to her ear lobes and head, doing a practice try so her son could see what was involved, to help with the anxiety, just as we did with Fluffy the first time. \n\n Dr. L., in his infinite wisdom and compassion, used a private room for this young fellow and so, once they disappeared behind the closed door, I couldn\u2019t see how things were going. But I could hear it.  \n\n Neurofeedback doesn\u2019t hurt. Electrodes are stuck to your earlobes and various places on your head with conducting goo. It\u2019s an odd sensation but surprisingly unobtrusive. The \u2018trainees\u2019 have many games to chose from and once a selection has been made, they sit in front of a computer screen and make the game go with their brain. Somehow. Very science fiction. There is no joy stick, no keyboard. When the brain is organized, the space ship zooms or the pac man munches many dots or the tiny stars populate the night sky; when the brain is disorganized, the space ship slows, the pac man stops, no more stars come out.\u00a0 Fluffy\u2019s been coming since the spring with some time off this past fall. He likes it. I think it helps. \n\n The young man didn\u2019t like it. He wanted to go home. He was squawking, no, no, let go of me, stop it, let go, no, leave me alone, let me go, over and over and I began to get worried. What were they doing in there? Weren\u2019t they listening to him? He doesn\u2019t want to do it! Let him go! He wants to go home! I was fighting the impulse to storm the treatment room. I was winning but barely. \n\n Soon they emerged, the father walking stoically ahead, the mother gently walking behind, alongside her son and as he made his way through the maze of chairs and toys to the front door gingerly stepping on his lean bird legs. And as he did, he continually called out in high alarm,  let me go! leave me alone! I want to go home!  and there was no one touching him at all.  \n\n The eccentric man in his robin hood hat leapt to open the door for them. The parents murmured their thanks. He replied,  Indeed , with a deep bow and flourish through his impressive mustache. \n\n I trust my gut. I know some things. I think I know what\u2019s best for my son. I don\u2019t know the whole story-- for me, for my son, for the people in my life. I certainly don\u2019t know the whole story for anyone else. But something about the sight of this boy and his deep sense of unsafety cut through me. And then last night I read What Do We Say by  Jordan's mom  and I was so heartsick and outraged, I lay awake in bed and stared at the ceiling for hours feeling afraid for our kids. \n\n I know we're all in it together but some of us are in it more than others. I wish there was more we could do for one another.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jordanpowell.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/some_of_us_are_.html", "title": "Some of us are in it more than others"},
{"date": "January 08, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t At the treefarm; December, 2005. \n\n When I was a kid, we took our tree down around Easter. By then, it was nothing but the silhouette, the needles having fallen to the floor like a thousand fainting ladies. We were a stubborn lot, or maybe just lazy, or maybe just clinging to the good feelings Christmas had promised.  \n\n Thanksgiving went so swimmingly this year, I was startled by how hard Christmas was, how unnerving and disorienting it was to watch Fluffy tantrum and stim, alternately bite and glom onto me, throw himself on the floor and swipe everything off the counter.\u00a0 It was like opening a lovely gift only to have it turn into a wild animal, hell bent on escape but desperately needing comfort. \n\n He\u2019s doing much better. He\u2019s got wonderful moments of engagement and regulation, insight and cooperative play. He wakes me up to pee in the middle of the night and says as we walk down the hall,  oh mommy, it\u2019s still nighttime. I see the dark empty trees in the black sky ; or, after watching a duck at a local farm step out of the water bath in which he had been bathing,  look how dry that duck is! the water rolled down his back like a rock rolling down a hill! \n\n But we are smack in the middle of the terrible twos or the thrashing threes or whatever it\u2019s called when your normally cooperative child becomes rabid with recalcitrance and defiance, when he stomps around chanting NO NO NEVER NOTHING NOT NO ONE NO NO!!! and the simple three minutes of unloading the hamper turn into 20 minute battle of the wills. And like that boy in the waiting room, I hold him by my side and wait it out so that we can begin again and he cries  ow ow stop it mommy stop it  and I know I\u2019m not hurting him, I am holding him gently to keep him in the room because we don\u2019t have locks on the doors and I need to follow through, I\u2019m asking him, non verbally, to plop a few items of clothing into the laundry basket but by the sounds of it, you\u2019d think I was plucking off fingers one by one. \n\n The RDI workshop starts on tuesday and thank the lordy lord. Dr. Gutstein will be presenting and, I know from the 2 day I attended this summer, he makes himself very available during the breaks. He also does a live on-line chat every Tuesday through the  Connections Center  (requires membership which is free and easy) and I was greatly relieved to hear him say Fluffy\u2019s behavior is actually good news. Many ASD kids never go through this stage and they need it to develop true mindfulness. He says it\u2019s the brain waking up. I say, gee, glad to hear it but what would be BETTER to hear is that you\u2019re logging off to scurry over to the playroom for a solid week of intensive 1:1 coaching. The stress of the holidays plus the schedule changes plus the illness plus the woken up mind have all but wiped  my  mind out and it was just hanging in there in the first place. \n\n We took our tree down tonight and a stream of dry needles sprinkled across the floor and out the back door. I swept them up and put them aside to make a yummy smell pouch with Fluffy in the morning. It was lovely to remember the day we trudged out in the woods, the way he selected this one with confidence, the sight of him tossing the chewed up football to the collies that lumbered along with us.  \n\n But this year, I needed it gone. Maybe it will herald an early spring.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com/default.asp"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/this_year_i_nee.html", "title": "This Year I Needed It Gone"},
{"date": "January 06, 2006 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Wrapped in a towel; summer, 2005. Taken by Dave. \n\n Last night was the first meeting of the new women\u2019s group I joined in order to find the sacred space between being a bitch and being a doormat. That exact location was not revealed, as yet.  \n\n I left after embracing my son 467 times, the last few hundred along the brick path that leads to the graveling driveway as he came tearing out in his sock feet, hyperventilating his request. We\u2019re experiencing a major set back in the mommy\u2019s night out since the total disaster of three weeks ago when Dave tried to put him to bed while I was in the house, downstairs, doing work. He\u2019s successfully put him to bed once a week for, oh, seven or eight months now so we felt it was time to try me being at home, mostly so that I could avoid another scintillating evening cruising Applebees and Walmart alone in the dark, sucking down a double decaf frappacino, woohoo, or shouting out the answers to the movie star quiz at the start of a bad movie at the local scum shopping development that sprung up on Route 1 so hideous it gives your eyesore an eyesore. \n\n As I got in the car, I heard his high pitched wailing. As I drove away I heard his sobbing and pleading. As I zoomed past the offensive architecture of the local theater, I wondered, what\u2019s the point of this women\u2019s group. What\u2019s it gonna be, a bunch of women sitting around in a group? To what end, talking? Well, ah yes, I guess. But my boy! my boy! My heartsick boy!  \n\n And so I called home and told my son through his wracking sobs, of the new magic school bus three-pack dvd hidden in my office. He raced upstairs wearing the Madonna-phone headset as Dave skittering behind him with the battery pack so we wouldn\u2019t get disconnected. Once the dvds were in his hand, he calmed down enough to stop crying and then we talked about how much he loved me for the next 15 minutes until I arrived at my meeting.  \n\n It turns out, the group is amazing. XX had us each bring YY and put them, one by one in the OO as we talked about what it meant to us. Then, in silence, we went around the circle and HH the YY that we had all contributed, into any FF that we felt made sense. This was to go around and around until every person in the group looked at BB and said, \u2018pass\u2019, ie, choosing NOT to EE the YY anymore. Which took one hour and 20 minutes. I was riveted.  \n\n Oh--you\u2019re not following? You see, I took a vow of confidentiality and so I can\u2019t say. A VOW, I tell you, which I take a hair more seriously then, say, my ex does. I can\u2019t say what anyone did or didn\u2019t do but I can say what I did but what fun is that? It would be like listening to the details of my dream and we all know where that leads, drooling and nodding off and cries of hurry up and get to the part about me. \n\n On the way home, I called to check in and Fluffy was still up and swiftly resumed the conversation about how much he loved me in his tiny tired voice. He wanted to know when I would be home and I had to be careful with my answer since I knew he had the timer in his hand and would set it then stare and count along until it beeped.  \n\n 16 minutes and 34 seconds later, he came sliding around the corner, clutching the timer, and tackled me. We climbed into his bed where  Zoom! Zoom! Zoom! I'm off to the Moon!  and  Pat the Bunny  were waiting and exactly 26 seconds after I walked in the door, the timer went off and he released it and we began to read. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439365414/qid=1136606219/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-1110097-3740955?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307120007/qid=1136606293/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-1110097-3740955?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/the_womens_grou.html", "title": "Mommy's Night Out"},
{"date": "December 14, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \u00a0  Stick, cut and slice; Magnetic fun for the whole family. \n\n \n\n We watched War of the Worlds last night so you don\u2019t have to.  \n\n Really. Don\u2019t. It\u2019s so silly! The gigunda alien creatures are so advanced they apparently buried their tripod structures before humans graced the earth, but then waited thousands of years before the big strike. Why not just slide down on the lightening bolts way back then and take over, skewer a few wooly mammoths and suck down their blood? And why, after scorching and plundering recklessly, do they suddenly send in the oddly gullible snake eye to delicately peek around Tim Robbin\u2019s basement hide-out? So the squeaky flipper-head aliens came sneak in and form a club house? And poke curiously at a rusty bicycle wheel and sniff grub? They been traveling through various galaxies for millions of years at the speed of light but a bicycle wheel and some take-out fascinates them so much they take a break in a middle of a full scale war? Not to mention all of them being done in within a day or so by the microbial world. Gee, they should have gotten flu shots.  \n\n Okay! I got tagged  here  and she got inspired  here , so on to my list! Things I love: \n\n Sleeping in the cozy bed. It\u2019s like a giant sleeping pill. Love it. Love the warmth, the puff pulled up nearly over my head. Love that almost suffocating feeling.  \n\n Drinking strong coffee first thing in the morning. Sigh.  \n\n The beach. Everything but most of all, swimming in the wild ocean waves. I know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but it does feel like a homecoming. Like the dolphins who were said to have once been dog-like mammals who returned to the sea.  \n\n Laughing really hard. I miss it. I\u2019m not laughing enough. I mean the kind that makes you lose your breath and pound on the table with your fist; the crying laugh. I need more of that. \n\n Dancing. Any kind here. Whatever the kids are doing, I\u2019ll take a stab at it. But I won\u2019t be wearing my pants below the butt crack. No one needs to see that. \n\n Being inspired.  \n\n Digging my fingers in the earth; planting, transplanting. \n\n Feeling exhausted from satisfying physical work. \n\n Making things. \n\n Now, for actual things, I\u2019d need to pass the keyboard to Dave and his list of various iPods and accessories including a voice recording attachment, wires and adaptors that bring satellite radio all over the house, the warmest flap hat, the best waterproof snow gloves, dimmers for bedside lamps, downloads from deep space that allow for lightening fast computer functions, and many other things I can\u2019t keep straight. I would like to be this techno-savvy gal, but mostly I stand around clasping my hands together in one extended expression of astonishment. \n\n But I\u2019m not able to close without a tiny list of stocking stuffers: \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Micro Uniball pens. Black; no writing in blue.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Shu Uemura Eyelash Curler \u00a0 \u00a0 Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub \u00a0 \u00a0 Tweezerman Magnifying Mirror and Tweezers \n\n And: Magnetic Self-adhesive Sheets! This is fun for the whole family. Peel and stick family pictures to the magnetic backing, cut out the shape and presto! For extra fun, cut the full body shot into three parts: head, torso, and legs. Then mix and match.

{"date": "December 15, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Holiday paperwhites and a painting by the brilliant William Meddick. \n\n \n\n  If we were being filmed by an overhead camera and if that overhead camera were to pan out and back far enough so we were just a mere speck on the landscape, we would see we are all on a path, that it is sometimes winds through low ground, sometimes on hilltops, sometime murky waters, forests, rocky patches, parched fields, tall grass, and sometimes it is green, green and wide with an magestic view, like the earth upon which Julie Andrews twirled at the beginning of The Sound of Music.  \n\n Of course, I didn\u2019t invent this way of looking at life, at our walk through it, on our own individual paths, etc., but I do like the image of looking down from great heights to my small form making its progress, of being able to see ahead to easier ground because when I am feeling dark, my mind is about as sophisticated as a cat on a car trip. It's like this: my life has always been and will always be this vomitous jiggly journey, trapped inside this car, while I look out through the slippery windows, out there at things that go by too quickly for me to recognize. \n\n No. I don\u2019t feel that exactly, but I remember how my cat used to act in the car and in my view, he couldn\u2019t remember the life he had before the car trip or the life he was going to have once we reached our destination. He couldn\u2019t imagine the Maine for which we were bound and all its pine tipped splendor, the way the sun punctured the early morning darkness and shimmered on the steel gray mud flats, couldn\u2019t conjure up the grass hoppers waiting to be capture, eaten and regurgitated, the stiff weeds beckoning to be brushed against and chewed. \n\n His life was a bumpy car ride. The end. \n\n I am not a cat but when I am in the tall tall grass, I forget.  \n\n I\u2019ve been reading  Marrit Ingman's  book, Inconsolable, and I love her honesty. I love that she tried to strike up conversations with mothers, their infants slung around their bodies; I love that she wondered how they were doing,  really  doing; I love that she longed to connect with other mothers about how hard and isolating and stressful motherhood can be. I didn\u2019t have PPD but I\u2019m wondering now if I\u2019ve had some sort of chronic stress disorder since Fluffy\u2019s birth or is it a disorder? Or simply a consequence of motherhood? Andi Buchanan talks about it in her book,  Mother Shock , about the passage into mother hood being like one to a foreign land with the same sort of exhaustion, disorientation, unfamiliarity with the customs and pace of life that happens when you settle in a new country.  \n\n Maybe that\u2019s what it is? All I know is there was an instant change when I became a mother that was miraculous! lovely! fragile! life turned inside out in the best possible way, upheaval! disorder! sleeplessness! I wandered around in my maternity pants and nothing on top, my gigantic boobies on display for every delivery people who arrived daily with gifts, packages, cards, flowers. It was deep winter in the northeast and I was floating in a bubble of zero modesty that began during delivery and ended about 3 weeks post partum. There\u2019s even a little footage of me doing an African dance with foot stomping and harvest hands reaching down to earth and up to the gods in my pj bottoms and a dirty cooking apron, pendulous breasts flopping about. I look like a lunatic butcher.  \n\n The instant change was fine. As the months and years have passed, the gradual change is something I\u2019m trying to shake off.\u00a0 Now, do I have to even say how much I love being Fluffy\u2019s mom? Does anyone need to reassurance? Or can we all assume all those intense and specific and wondrous feelings are deeply rooted and beloved and move on to the hard ones which are for me: isolation and stress of how to solve the taking care of myself puzzle. This is the gradual change in me, the effects of isolation and stress. \n\n (This just in: My he-man husband cut himself on a loaf of bread. This is a man who walks around all day saying OW whenever anything breezes by him. I used to leap up and dash to his side with the first aid kit--I love a first aid kit and would most definitely have been a doctor had I more than one shot at life. Now I barely look over. But I\u2019m saying, he cut himself on bread, not the knife, the BREAD, while it was still in its bag. Okay. Back to my stress...) \n\n I\u2019m lonely for the company of grown ups, those who can handle loaves of bread without injury. I do enjoy the company of my husband a great deal, but I need outside inspiration, if you know what I mean, not the sexual kind, just a little novelty, someone who lives in a different house. But I\u2019m out of condition, socially. I forget to modulate my voice. I laugh inappropriately. I stand too close, like my childhood friend Joan Matthew who used to careen into me like a truck with no brakes every time we went anywhere, like from my room to the kitchen.  \n\n As for the stress, well, I need a mother who could watch me like a hawk: NO NO! Kyra! No more candy! Kyra! Go to bed! Okay, honey, time for a nice hot bubble bath. Aw, come here, sweet pea, let\u2019s do some ocean breathing. Hey! Let\u2019s get our coats on; time to go outside! Kyra! Put that down! NO! No salami! And No More Computer!  \n\n I know, I know. I have to be my own mother. And some days I do a bang up job. But there\u2019s something about the shrinking of my life since becoming a mother that makes the mothering of oneself, as well as one\u2019s child, harder than it seems fair.  \n\n I suppose the camera  could  be locked in close up so I can see the little things more crisply and soon it will zoom back out again and everything will be clearer than ever. \n\n I suppose. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.marrit.info/", "http://www.mothershock.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/12/_if_we_were_bei.html", "title": "Search for the Overhead Camera"},
{"date": "December 13, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Breakfast out; December 2005. \n\n Fluffy had colic. He also had Asperger\u2019s but we didn\u2019t know until he was closing in on four years old. It explained a lot, it did. And it helped a little with the inadequacy. It was like huffing and puffing to cover ground, red faced and out of breath, items tumbling from you hands, your intense child clinging to every appendage, completely disinterested in other kids or toys, while a steady procession of everyone else you know with kids waltzed by, waving, baking cookies, having playdates, nursing baby number three while baby number two and baby number one played quietly on the floor by the waldorf activity basket and serenely self-weaned, only to discover I\u2019d been scrambling on a giant treadmill mounted on square wheels and pulling a large weight. Oh. No wonder it felt hard. \n\n We\u2019ve made huge progress since then especially now that I know where we\u2019re going and a bit about how to get there, we\u2019ve got our RDI map and a much better understanding of ASD and Asperger\u2019s and, most important, of Fluffy and his particular strengths and challenges, but I\u2019m still up against my own inadequacy. I mean it. Yes, yes. I\u2019m devoted and interested and passionate about giving my son what he needs. I know it\u2019s okay for me to need and want to pay attention to myself, to carve out the time to reclaim my own pace and rhythm. I know it\u2019s right and normal and necessary for me to need time alone with my husband, my friends, myself. I know I do a lot and I also know I do it imperfectly, that inside my mind I sometimes say, OH MY GOD PLEASE SHUT UP, or out loud I effuse, Yeah! to which my son replies,  why, Mommy? why did you say that?  and the truth is, I said it as I drooled into the stream of sun coming in through the window, my mind blank as the beach in winter and I have no idea what he was saying to me.  \n\n But the inadequacy has to do with not knowing how to help him sometimes or knowing that I can\u2019t help him all the time, that sometimes I am going to attend to other things like household things or mommy things, sometimes I\u2019m going to bring him along on errands that I know he can handle because I could wait until he\u2019s asleep and rally out on my own but I don\u2019t always want to, sometimes I want it to be easier, to have life in our household be more like regular life rather than one during which all waking hours are tuned in to monitoring activities, sensory input, our own responses and interactions, monitoring how much stimming my son is doing, balancing the approach to getting dressed everyday, shall I lay out the clothes and use declaratives? Shall I lock him in his room and not open the door until he\u2019s dressed? Shall we just go through the day, every day, in our pajamas? It\u2019s not that other households don\u2019t struggle with dressing or chores or compliance or ways to divide up time and attention, it\u2019s just that in my imagination, the stakes don\u2019t feel as high because, well, they\u2019re not. \n\n I videotaped Fluffy and me for the upcoming RDI 4-day parent training intensive in January. We were having lunch, and aside from being aghast at my own behavior at the food trough, seriously, what the hell was going on with my snorting and smacking and chewing and the eating with the fingers and the sneezing and particles of chips flying through the air threatening to crack the camera lens? oy vey. BUT, I was also taken aback by the one-sidedness of the conversation. I know we are doing better in this area, but I do the work, the looking, attending, responding, expressing, emoting, gesturing up the wazzoo. It was like the Fluffy show and I was Ed McMahon character fawning and guffawing and falling out of my chair to show my devotion. I exaggerate and of course, yes, I am trying to help Fluffy want to tune in to the other guy, to the world, but, you know, it\u2019s so out of balance. It\u2019s okay now. He\u2019s only 4. But no one is going to want to talk to this guy if this is still going on in a few years. No one. Think about it. You know those people who talk at you, endlessly, who never ask about you or when they do, you know they\u2019re thinking about something else, waiting for you to pause to take a breath so they can dive back in and take over.  \n\n The other night I had a dream during which Fluffy and I were trapped in a maze, doors and corridors and rooms leading around corners, past other families that lived there, that never left, that shepherded their children to the indoor bus stop and watched as they were driven down the hall to the indoor school. At one point, we were in a room with a group of bathing Japanese, hot water on the floor, steam rising up all around us. I had to climb up a ladder, one of those grand mahogany ones that you see in the movies, in the library of the well-read with floor to ceiling books. I had to use both arms to hold on, to climb; I needed Fluffy to use his own muscles to hold onto me, but he wouldn\u2019t and as we neared the top, we started to fall, down down in the slow motion of suspense thrillers that goes on for an impossible length of time. I was worried about the landing, worried about the hot water, the other people, the sharp corners of the bookcases. At the very last minute, a fat crash pad materialized and we landed on that, laughing, relieved, unharmed. \n\n Gee, I wonder what it could mean? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/12/i_wonder_what_i.html", "title": "I Wonder What It Could Mean?"},

I gave myself a few days to gaze lovingly at the 4 gigantic bags of french roasted beans we purchased from Sam\u2019s Club, to slowly pour a handful into the grinder and set it spinning on high, to brew dark dark pots at dawn and dusk, sucking it down at every opportunity while quoting a line from the just finished NaNoWriMo novel, \u201chmm, coffee, love coffee, coffee coffee coffee\u201d (the muse, she was on fire that night), and now that it\u2019s been 5 days of no coffee, I see no reason to keep on living. \n\n It\u2019s so sad. I feel the leap of joy in my heart as I reach for the grinder and then I remember. It\u2019s like somebody died. I sing a little dirge as I slowly march from teapot to stove, heating up water for my white tangerine tea. The new whole leaf tea bags are helping. Have you seen them? I wasn\u2019t sure if I ought to plop them in my cup or tuck them into my lingerie drawer. \n\n The first few days, I popped Exedrin but I\u2019m off that now, just down to drinking gallons of white, green, and red teas. It\u2019s okay I guess, but it\u2019s not the same. There\u2019s something about coffee, isn\u2019t there? Heavenly. The shaking fingers as I warm the palms of my hands in the morning mug, the slow but sure return of meaning to the objects in the world around me, the feeling of rightness in my heart and mind as I calmly set the empty cup down by the pot and to pour yet again, and again.  \n\n But that\u2019s all behind me now. \n\n The colors--will they return? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/12/the_colorswill_.html", "title": "The Colors--Will They Return?"},

{"date": "December 12, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Dad's birthday lunch; December 10, 2005. \n\n Here\u2019s a pic from my dad\u2019s birthday lunch over the weekend. My sister and I gave him some photographs from long ago including one from a trip through Europe when I was 3 and my sister was 5. He regaled us with stories from that trip and we were sitting, rapt, up on our knees, little kids all over again. He and our mom took us around Europe for 3 months with barely enough money to cover food and transportation. That year, our Christmas tree sat frail and decorated with toilet paper on a coffee table in our Rome hotel room.  \n\n We all took a steamer ship over and back; the return on an ominous and dark and enormous boat filled with immigrants dressed all in black, sailing over some of the roughest seas for days on route to America. People were retching everywhere, falling down the stairs in their own bile, trudging back for more salami. Come to think of it, maybe that\u2019s where it all started for me--my unnatural attachment to salami. A couple people actually died on the trip and were stored in the freezer until we got to port. Can you imagine? It\u2019s like something out of another time, which, I guess it was since it was 1962. Geez. I\u2019m old. \n\n In other news, I just can\u2019t post anymore. I don\u2019t know what it is. Things are happening but I\u2019m not getting them down. I will say that I\u2019m a total  Rocketboom  fan, along with about 100,000 other people. I want to do it! I want to vlog!!! \n\n Day 7, no coffee. It\u2019s getting easier. I still feel a little lost in the morning, the way I used to feel when I quit smoking and suddenly I had a lot of time of my hands and the new freedom of leaving the house without frantically pat patting pockets or pawing through purses to make sure I had enough cigarettes, cigarettes, gotta have the cigarettes.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying the tea now. It\u2019s fun, sort of cute, like coffee\u2019s lightweight younger sibling. Tea. Huh. All right, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got. I find it helps to double bag with a smidge of maple syrup and splash of potato milk. \n\n And while I\u2019m on the subject, snow ice cream made from snow, maple syrup, and potato milk is surprisingly good and easy to make. I\u2019m talking seconds. Fluffy loves it. Dave runs out in the dark and scoops up a handful and then high steps it back in the house like a cartoon making hooting noises as the white ball melts and drips between his finger. A delightful GFCF treat for the whole family. \n\n The last thing I will mention is the feeling of inadequacy that I\u2019ve had since being a mother. I don\u2019t feel it all the time but it\u2019s there and it started soon after Fluffy was born when I couldn\u2019t calm him, couldn\u2019t soothe him, couldn\u2019t get him to sleep. I don\u2019t know how to describe this to someone who hasn\u2019t gone through it, in fact, I\u2019m just about at a point now where I\u2019m going to make that obnoxious game show buzzing sound anytime someone who doesn\u2019t have kids says anything to me about having kids.  EEHHH! Sorry! Wrong answer! You\u2019re out of the game!  It\u2019s like me saying I get what it\u2019s like to be a man or a mother of three or a pygmy; it\u2019s that off the radar. And before I had kids, I didn\u2019t think that was true. I figured I could sort of, you know,  know , since I babysat a slew of kids, had friends and family members with kids. Now I know better.  \n\n There\u2019s more to say on that subject but the babysitter\u2019s leaving and, as my therapist used to say,  that's all the time we have for today .

Will of steel. \n\n We had a great time, though. It was nice to see family even though one person asked me if I was pregnant. No, I wanted to say, just fat. For the record, I wouldn\u2019t assume anyone was pregnant, even if she was sticking out a mile and standing in a pool of her own amniotic fluid with a teeny tiny hand sticking out from between her legs. I would slap on my waders and say,  you look fantastic and I just LOVE what you've done with your vagina!  She meant well, I think. She knows I would LOVE to be pregnant, to have one more baby, maybe a little girl this time, for the dresses, it\u2019s all about the dresses. Still, it made me want to change into my moo moo with the appliqu\u00e9 turkey. \n\n In other news, Fluffy did beautifully with all the people, with the disruption to the routine. But more than that, he enjoyed himself. As I put him to bed Thursday night, I said, you are such a great person, to which he replied thoughtfully,  Mommy, that means so much to me . As I put him to bed Friday night and wondered allowed what it was like to have such a full house for two whole days, he said,  Mommy, I loved it.  On Saturday, my dad, stepmother, stepbrother, his wife, and their two girls came for a few hours. We all descended to the playroom. It was the second time Fluffy spent time with other kids in his playroom, in his space with all his toys, with his magnatiles, and he had a ball. He shared; he took turns; he stood at the easel and co-created a few works of art with his cousin, Bella. He looked, to any observer, like a typical boy, a typical 4 1/2 year old playing with his cousins.  \n\n Now I am tethering myself to the computer until the last of my NaNoWriMo words have been written down. I think I see the finish line. I do. Unless there is some terrible mishap, some tragic collapse only feet from the finish line, I will come in with my 50,000 by midnight, November 30.

I love his parting question: what am I going to allow myself to do next? I love his spirit. Here is it for you. I hope it is, at least, somewhat inspirational: \n\n Dear Writer, Well, there it went. Another NaNoWriMo has passed into the history books.\u00a0  It was a year of biggests and firsts. We had a record-setting number of participants (59,000), a blockbusting number of winners (9,700) and an impressive number of mornings when we woke up to find the site hadn't imploded or otherwise misplaced portions of itself (27).  Thanks to your generosity, we also raised more money than ever before. Our bills for the year are paid, and funds are tucked away to launch NaNoWriMo's 2006 event. Even more thrillingly, we raised at least $8000 for our Libraries in Laos project. By the time sign-ups for the next NaNoWriMo begin, there will be four or five new book-filled spaces spread throughout the country; places where Laotian kids can go to discover the magic of reading.  All of which is well and good, but it begs a certain important question. Namely: What the heck do we do now?  It's a great question. And I have a suggestion.  I suggest we spend the next eleven months exploring a few other appealing, impractical items on our to-do lists. Because the secret of November's success is both simple and transferable: You were able to write a book because you allowed yourself to write a book. And in the coming weeks, after you've caught up on sleep and re-acclimated yourself to normal life, I hope you'll sit down and make a list. It's the most powerful list on the planet, and it's the one entitled: \"What I'm going to allow myself to do next.\"\u00a0  See you in October, novelist.

But through it all, I\u2019ve clutched,  It's A Boy: Women Writers On Raising Sons , a collection of essays edited by the brilliant  Andi Buchanan .  \n\n I brought it everywhere, just in case I found a tiny minute with which to bury my face in its pages--to the grocery store, the gym, the drive-through at the bank, because, you see, just when I finally accepted the fact that Fluffy was going to be an only child, along comes this poignant, funny, marvelous collections of stories and I\u2019m a wet nappy of mother yearning, burning up with baby fever all over again. \n\n Each writer, writes about her son, about this other in body and form that will someday become a man. We hear, among many other things, about that first sighting of the penis on the starry ultrasound screen that I, too, found surprising, so sure I was carrying a daughter. In my case, that discovery was a mere hiccup on the horizon of my prenatal dementia, surrounded by more pressing questions, like, is there more than one penis? is it poking out between only more than two legs? Is it, in fact, the lizard child? \n\n I pined for motherhood, marching toward it for over a decade with the determination of Holly Hunter\u2019s character in Raising Arizona, demanding, I WANT THAT BABY GIMME THAT BABY every step of the way. The experience of having a son, for me, has been a love affair. Would I feel that way about a daughter? I\u2019m sure of it. I\u2019d stare in disbelief, weep over her beauty, kiss every pudgy part, pluck off her arm and eat it. But I\u2019m also sure it would be different. Still yummy. But different. \n\n Because, you see, it isn\u2019t so much having a  son  as it is having  Fluffy , this particular, eccentric, funny, sensitive, questioning little person that is so compelling and so surprising, that has stretched me, pulled me into new waters. I think that\u2019s what I loved most about these stories, the chance to meet these kids, to peek in at who they are or who they could have been, at how these other-shaped beings changed these woman and reshaped their families.  \n\n I wish I could take every one of the writers out to high tea, stare at them over the finger sandwiches, pepper them with questions over the clotted cream and jam. Every story is deeply satisfying to read. These came right off the page and are still floating around with me:  Jennifer Margulis's,   My Three Sons ;  Jennifer Lauck's ,  It Takes a Village ;  Jodi Picoult's ,  Scaredy-Cat ;  Marion Winik's ,  Our Bodies Their Selves ;  Catherine Newman's ,  Pretty Baby ,  Jamie Pearson's ,  Making the Cut ;  Jacquelyn Mitchard's ,  The Day He Was Taller .  Susan Ito's   Samuel  was so unspeakably moving, I had to put the book down several times to sob into the air. \n\n Andi , managing editor of  literarymama.com , author of the witty and wise,  Mother Shock: Loving Every (Other) Minute Of It,  which I consumed with glee, has an upcoming collection entitled,  It's A Girl: Women Writers On Raising Daughters . It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019ve got a some months to calm down before that comes out in April 2006 or I might be slinking around in the wee hours, attempting an IVF cycle on the sly, jabbing myself in the butt with a syringe-full of hormones, siphoning sperm from my sleeping husband. What? No no! Everything\u2019s fine. Go back to sleep! I\u2019m off on an errand! Be back in a sec! \n\n I know you will love this book.

But that was all.  \n\n Emile\u2019s Dad, Raymond, was quiet. He was a chip off the old block. At least that\u2019s what Emile\u2019s mom always said. When Raymond was six, his father left the family. The day before, he brought home a short-haired mutt named King. King was his replacement. He was white with a perfect black circle over one eye. A patch. A pirate. A tough guy. He looked exactly like the dog that hung around Spanky and the Gang.  \n\n The first time Emile saw his own dog, Stumpy, she was slapping her tail thunderously in a pool of piss. Stumpy was Raymond\u2019s replacement, only Raymond chose to stay home when he left.  \n\n Raymond did not, indeed, say much. And it was best not to say much to him. He was very smart. A mathematician. He had important things to think and remember and calculate, people who relied on him, people who greeted him with steno pads flipped to a fresh blue page. He worked at his desk alone, thinking things. No book or notepad, just him and his in-looking mind.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \n\n So Emile began to write stories. Some of them were very short. He showed one to Miss Fairchild, his sixth grade teacher. She looked weird after she read it, like she had something in her mouth that tasted wrong and needed the proper place to spit it out.  \n\n Emile\u2019s mom picked him up early that day.  \n\n Emile was a solitary boy, slight for his age. He had long delicate limbs, dark skin, brown curly hair, and eyes that were always red. Grownups didn\u2019t babble on when he was near. Emile would catch things, inconsistencies; it was taxing to be around.  \n\n As a man, he stayed small. His dark curls were interrupted by patches of straight hair that bolting out at odd intervals. He never had a girlfriend until he met Margaret at his first job out of engineering school. They were an instant match. She moved in right away and helped him with lots of things. Personal hygiene for one. He\u2019d forget to change his underwear for days at a time.  \n\n Margaret loved his stories. Emile would tell them to her late at night, when she woke up from a nightmare, clammy and untrusting. He would coo-coo to her, \u2018it\u2019s only a story, here, let me tell you a new one, a different one.\u2019 And he would begin. \n\n They shared a home for ten years. An apartment in a green stucco building, above Greenfield\u2019s Gravestone Carvings. When Emile came home late, Margaret would already be asleep. One night, she awoke from a nightmare with a timorous whimper. Emile, beside her in his blue button up shirt and greying briefs, was reading a little bedtime calculus. \n\n \u201cIn an instant,\u201d Emile began, laying down the text, and looking up at the ceiling, \u201cMargaret stood alone in a field of wheat rising high around her. The sky coughed a small gust of wind, and then it was as still as a dream.\u201d  \n\n Margaret inched closer. \n\n Emile continued: \u201c Margaret scanned her horizon--a broad sea of sepia stalks weaved around her. She reached out gently and brushed her finger across the tips of the plants and smiled at their feathery softness. She pivoted on the heels of her small bare feet and face where her back had been moments before. Here she saw a hill, a great green hill rising up from the golden blanket of last years growth. Atop the hill stood three curious trees, leaning impossibly low to the ground. Margaret walked through the leaning sea of plants until she was at the very edge of the hill, the place where the parched brown met the delicate blades of new growth, reaching up, like a thousand knowing hands.\u201d \n\n \u201cEmile?\u201d Margaret said, having now curled against his side, her legs tucked between his, her toes curled up and pressing under his naked thighs. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d \n\n Eight months later, the twins were born, just moments after Margaret and Emile said \u201cI do\u201d, moments after the Judge read the part about no man putting asunder what had been joined together. Emile and the Judge had to jog down the hall in the maternity wing since Emile and Margaret had been meaning to make it legal for months but something or other was always getting in the way.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://felicityatheling.typepad.com/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/11/trading_stories.html", "title": "Trading Stories"},
{"date": "November 21, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy, looking back; September, 2005. \n\n I\u2019ve been thinking about progress and how it always seems to come with periods of regression, the old two steps forward, one step back adage. But you know, is it true? Or is it that progress simply looks like a jagged upward line. They do say neurologic growth is often followed by disorganization as the new information is assimilated, much like the \u2018busy\u2019 signal my digital camera flashes as it writes the video I just shot to the chip. So, wouldn\u2019t it be funny, or actually, reassuring, if we all froze in our tracks every few weeks (or years, depending on your own particular rate of growth) to stare into space while an icon of a little hand scribbling with a pencil flashed in our eyes.  \n\n That\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at it with Fluffy these days. So many things are changing; he is growing at a remarkable rate and yet his progress is marked by frequent bouts of, well, scribbling. This scribbling can look like recalcitrance or wild misbehavior; passionate hurling of his body to the floor in a flood of tears over a minor mishap; a leaping up midway through dinner three four five times in a row to run in tight little circles by his chair as if he were engulfed in flames, shouting, I have to pee! I have to pee! I have to pee! Save for occasionally pulling his pants down to the ankles to, quite literally, waddle the hundreds of feet to the nearest toilet, he\u2019s got the potty thing down. So what can the outburst be other than the result of an accidental crossing of wires during the reorganization of the brain? Oops! Sorry out there! We\u2019ll have that sorted out in a jiffy! That, and of course, the autism. Have I mentioned the autism? \n\n He is so much more fluid and conversational in his speech. It always floors me when it happens because I\u2019ve gotten pretty used to the one-sidedness of our conversations over the last couple of years, seamlessly slipping into my role as Mr. Snail or Miss Frizzle or even, objects of fact and fancy:  Fork? Fork? Why do you have those pointy things on you? Do you like to pierce food with them? Do you ever wish you could scoop, Fork?  But now he is asking me,  what do you like? What is your favorite food? Where were you? Did you have a good time?  And  Mommy, I would like to give you a hug. I like to feel close to you. I like your warmth. \n\n Today, he was making numbers and letters with dot markers. HE WAS USING A MARKER. It was his idea. As he dotted away, he said,  I love this color blue. Isn\u2019t this a beautiful blue? I love these beautiful works of art I am making. Would you like to watch me make more?  And then he broke out a slim magic marker and made about 15 magnificent W\u2019s, the first letter of his name, the last of which was drawn within the boundaries of a small box. He then cut out the box (with help), fed it into a little contraption we got as a gift from his Aunt Annie, and presto! he\u2019d made a sticker that he promptly presented to his dad as a gift.  \n\n There\u2019s more. There\u2019s so much more. Including two recent playdates during which he played in his friend Ethan\u2019s playroom while I was downstairs talking to  my  friend Jane, whom I kept abandoning in order to crawl like a navy seal up the stairs to spy.  \n\n I think back to the first and only time I tried leaving Fluffy in the childcare room at the Y over a year ago. I had a feeling it wasn\u2019t going to fly, so I wandered the halls of the building and came back to peek through the big window minutes later. He stood in the middle of the room with both hand up in the air, squawking in high pitched alarm, like a panicked bird. The scene gripped me by the throat; I felt as if I were watching through the observation window of a treatment center. That began my late night web-surfing, followed by the testing, and the diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s. We jumped in with our treatment program in December; the fear hung on through the summer.  \n\n And now mostly, it\u2019s gone. I still worry about him, about his future, about his happiness. But, you know what? I look at him and I feel this confidence. I think it\u2019s his confidence. I think he must have handed it to me a few years back, for safekeeping, and one of these days he\u2019s going to waltz over in that nonchalant way kids do and say, oh, there is it. I was looking for that. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/11/scribbling.html", "title": "Scribbling"},

Well, the gang is en route for the holidays; we\u2019re hosting Thanksgiving this year, the first time since I was pregnant with Fluffy. We\u2019ve since added a dining room which is helpful, as the tables won\u2019t need to be positioned end to end and out the front door and everyone will be able to sit within the interior walls of the house.  I just hope I can pull off the meal. Cooking that big fat bird is a bit daunting and what exactly is de rigor with the stuffing these days? Do I ram it in that dark cavity? Where is will soak up the Salmonella and Sal\u2019s microbial pals and then spread through our overstuffed systems sending us all racing to the bathroom? I hate to cook it all separately. All that room inside the turkey, going to waste. Maybe I could use it for storage? Do I soak it in a cooler full of salt water? Do I sew it closed? Fluffy\u2019s Uncle Steve and Aunt Susie deep fried the turkey one year and not only was it a sight to behold with the gas tank and the mitts up to the armpit and the fleshy naked carcass impaled on a metal spike being lowered into the pot balanced on the bunsen burner out off the back deck, it was also the most deliciously juicy taste sensation of all time. But I\u2019m afraid deep frying is out for this household. Ix-nay on the eepfrying-da. We don\u2019t deal in vats of boiling oil. Only in metaphors of such. I\u2019d know how to do RDI with the bird. I could use declaratives up the wazoo, scaffolding like a mother fucker with small sounds and large gestures but I don\u2019t think it would do the trick. Uh oh!

We\u2019ve had three more playdates since then, two of them in this past week.

They run and chase! and climb and roll! And dig in the sand like pirates saying things like, \u201cthere\u2019s  HUNDREDS  of golds here!\u201d and \u201clook! the bad guy SHRANKED!\u201d Ethan\u2019s pretend play is lightening fast but it\u2019s also generous; there\u2019s always a way in, and Fluffy sometimes takes it, studying Ethan as he whips out pairs of glasses that see the invisible, imitating the way to hold his hands in small \u2018o\u2019s by his eyes to survey the scene.  \n\n They did a triple high five before we left and it was so damn cute and they were so damn close to each other, I offered, how about if you give each other a hug? so they hugged in a loose and tumbling way and then I died from the cuteness.   \n\n As we were pulling away, Ethan called out desperately, \u201cWait!

Don\u2019t we all have an images and ideas floating around in us, bumping into the things we treasure and the things that terrify us? I\u2019m not an athlete but I don\u2019t feel like an impostor when I mention my jog along the shore or my bike ride to the market. I don\u2019t feel like I have to qualify when I mention what I whipped up the night before in the kitchen,  now, achem, I\u2019m not an actual 4-star chef, but I did make a pretty passable pot au feu? \n\n Let\u2019s get some things straight right away. I\u2019m not well-read. I don\u2019t have a masters or a Ph.D., didn\u2019t get my undergraduate in Literature. I got it in Biology and with a Theater minor, from a tiny school in Rhode Island that no one heard of, including some of my fellow students. I haven\u2019t been writing seriously for 20 years. I\u2019ve only published two very short pieces in small presses on the west coast, many years ago.  \n\n I did write and illustrated stories when I was a kid, but no more so than most kids. I kept a journal on and off since high school but sadly, chronicles of my tortured and circuitous musings were lost when I threw out many notebooks soon after moving in with my soon to be first husband, fearing a breach of privacy. That should have tipped me off right then. I\u2019ve taken writing classes in bursts, have a file cabinet stuffed with aborted short stories and one stab at a screenplay.  \n\n I usually read with the dictionary by my side so I can look up words that I don\u2019t know, after which I press my finger into my temple and repeat the word and the meaning several times before releasing my finger and going swiftly bank. I\u2019m not sure I could circle and name all the parts of a sentence but I do know that most adverbs end in \u2018ly\u2019. The grammar course at Brown University's Continuing Ed taught me it is incorrect to say one feels BADLY when one is sorry for some transgression. If one\u2019s hands, say, are not able to perform the function of FEELING items very well, then it would be correct to say one FEELS badly, other than that, one feels bad. And often. I wanted to call up my ex-husband and rub this in his face until he lost consciousness since he was in a continual state of eye-rolling at the populace's poorly spoken word. But I wouldn\u2019t do that because I\u2019m a spiritual gal and I forgive him and instead, I send his tender spirit a stream of warm, white light. \n\n I\u2019m 3400 words into my novel, entitled, The Beginning, because that\u2019s what it is, the beginning of my novel writing adventure. I\u2019ve decided to dive into this month as  Chris Baty , founder of the National Novel Writing Month, says in his book,  No Plot? No Problem!  \u201ca hands-on writing classroom\u2013where advancement relies as much on dramatic failures as it does on heroic successes...\u201d. He called the kickoff year of this now annual event, \u201can amazingly liberating experience\u201d that taught him \u201cexactly which aspects of noveling I was good at (coffee drinking and complaining) and what my weaknesses are (dialogue, character development, plot, etc.).\u201d \n\n This is the seventh year of NaNoWriMo and at the end of it, Baty will have written 350,000 words, at least, and while I can\u2019t imagine his coffee drinking and complaining prowess have wavered, I\u2019ll bet his dialogue, character development, and plot skills have bumped up a notch or two. \n\n I\u2019ve guess you could say I've been writing  in bursts  my whole life, so I\u2019m a writer. Ach! The minute I say it, I feel my mouth stretching into a tight line across my face, the self-doubt and shame and embarrassment twitching in the corners of my eyes. But why? I  do  write. I\u2019m may be a bad writer but I\u2019m still a writer. Does anyone blush and look away when they say,  I'm a talker; I rant, I plead, I demur, I argue, I praise ,? Do some do this better than others? Sure. But do we grapple with being found out for the fraud we truly are by daring to lay claim to our own voice?  \n\n And how can I get better at something unless I practice? I say it to Fluffy every day. I even shake my head in wonder at his reluctance to make the letter A because  mommy, mommy , he says,  you do it so much better than me.  Because I practiced, honey! I cheerfully reply. You should see the first A mommy made! It was a mess! A riot!

{"date": "October 18, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t One of these days I will transition Fluffy to fall asleep on his own. As it is, I stay with him until he konks out which used to be somewhere around dawn's first light but lately is, mercifully, around 8. Tonight, I packed it in around 8:30. It had been a full hour in the dark, singing songs and answering questions and scratching various parts of his body. I grew increasingly restless until I announced that I had to do some work and would be back in a little bit to check on him. \n\n So began a steady stream of me in and out of the room, fixing covers, kissing boo boo, scratching an eye, tucking him back in, coming to see something very pressing about the pillows that I never really understood, and then began Fluffy's casual wanderings down the hall, wondering about having a cracker or maybe even a pop? and then a request for a nightlight and once that was in place, an animal to curl up with until I came back to check on him, and then Baby Bear, then Rudy, LiaLoon, Sock Monkey, Pine Pillow, Jelly Cat, and finally, this adorable little doll dear  Kitty  made for me that we've been calling  Beegu  from the eponymous book  \n\n adored, in this household, beyond measure. Both items: the book and the doll. \n\n \n\nIt's a first for him; he's never\ntaken one to bed. I've tried everything under the sun as a possible\ntransitional object but I've always said, I think  I'm  his transitional\nobject.  \n\n Ahem.  \n\n Anyway, I finally went back to lie down next to him and he fell asleep in the pool of all those animals and it made my heart heavy with love to see him there, so vulnerable, so well, not awake, even though the whole ordeal took 2 hours. The nice\nthing was that no one got hysterical or even terribly on edge. \n\n I'd like to say that I retired to my office and took rapid dictation from my muse, but in truth, I ate potato chips standing up and I\nwould be eating really fattening cookies right now if we had any in the house. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.livejournal.com/~kitty_dollies/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374306672/qid=1129689803/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1110097-3740955?v=glance&s=books&n=507846"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/10/one_of_these_da.html", "title": "One of These Days..."},
{"date": "October 15, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t We\u2019ve hooked up with a team from the local Cedars, a clearing house for services available for kids with special needs. If you qualify for  Katie Beckett  you can receive these services free of charge. We qualified. We rejoiced. It turns out that unless I want to initiate a vigorous ABA program (which can start right away) or wait a couple of years to secure a coveted spot in, say, therapeutic horseback riding, we may be out of luck. \n\n \n\n We were approved in July but didn\u2019t get a case number until early October due to some paperwork glitch. Okay, no matter. Although I always do the math in my head. Let\u2019s see, we knew something was wrong in September 2004, we began evaluations in October, got our diagnosis in January, applied for Katie Becket in April, got approved in July, and began the final two to three month process for services in October. That\u2019s 15 months from the start to the service, from the time our son was three to the time he is nearly five. The critical window! Everyone bellows. Hurry hurry! Get \u2018em while they\u2019re young! Before their brains harden like a hard boiled egg!\n\n \n\n Now, our son is high functioning. He is our only child. I can afford to stay home with him. My husband works at home. We\u2019ve educated ourselves, taken workshops, hired private consultants, and paid for sitters to give us a break. What\u2019s it like for families with more than one child? More than one on the spectrum even? Who can't stay home? Who can't afford private help and autism conferences? \n\n \n\n\n\n The Cedars team came last friday, on my birthday. Fluffy was upstairs engaged in a rousing game of Explosion Checkers with the playroom helper so I shepherded the three of them down to the playroom where we all sunk obliquely into beanbags and regarded one another at an angle.\n\n \n\n I loved them: the tall social worker with frizzy hair and a free-flowing skirt, the wispy case worker sifting through the bean bag folds for consent and release forms, and the stunning team leader, a woman with a hint of Jamaica in her voice and no nonsense shoulders slipping out of her tank top. One of my goals during this meeting was to convince Cedars to expand the autism treatment programs to include  RDI . I knew that it might not happen in time for us to benefit, but I want to spread the word, raise money to train more consultants in the area, find a way for more children to benefit from the power and sense of this approach.\n\n \n\n The leading program is ABA. ABA. ABA. Now, I don\u2019t want a fist fight and I would never presume to know what right for any other child. But when the ASD stone first hit my chest--the realization that something was moving about inside my son that had nothing to do with the terrible threes or sloppy discipline or being  spirited , I pounded at the keyboard with shaking fingers late into the night, looking looking reading reading jotting down every acronym I could find:\u00a0 ABA ABA ABA some SIT, smattering of AIT, as well as a host of biomedical approaches overseen by DAN! doctors.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n I wanted to be Tommy Lee Jones in  The Fugitive , barking out orders to my staff: BRING ME THE NEAREST DAN DOCTOR IN THE STATE! GET ME ROUND THE CLOCK ABA THERAPIST STAT! I NEED A WRECKING BALL--BUILD ME A PLAYROOM--SWINGS! TUBES! TRAMPOLINES! ORDER UP URINE, FECAL AND HAIR ANALYSIS PRONTO! ARE YOU INSANE? GET THAT BREAD OUT OF HERE! THROW OUT THE COW! WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING THERE? DO IT! DO IT NOW! HE'S ALMOST FIVE! WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME! \n\n After additional research + time, we came to the absolute conclusion that although playrooms and biomedicals and sensory integration therapy (SIT) were on the top of the list, there would be no ABA in this household. No no. Put away your notebook and ix-nay on the ompting-pray. I want my son to developing his own internal supervisory system. I want him to look because he's interested, comply because he's genuinely motivated, and act in accordance with his own understood thoughts and feelings.\t\n\n \n\n The long and short of it is that by the end of the hour, the Cedars team felt the power of the force. The four of us were jumping from the trampoline into piles of bean bags shouting RDI! RDI ! IF YOU DON\u2019T DO IT WE\u2019LL POKE YOU IN THE EYE! And it sort of WAS like being Tommy Lee Jones because I got to tell them what I wanted and what I needed and then sent them zooming out the door with RDI pom pom in their pockets and that jedi gleam in their eye. When they come back, they\u2019ll have my answers. Or at least, some answers and the beginnings of a plan for my guy. \n\n It\u2019s started already. Today we went to a gymnastics class, covered by Katie Beckett. It\u2019s for kids on the spectrum and it was so fantastically, utterly, wonderful that, again, I had to keep myself from bursting into tears at every somersault and toppling the kids over backwards with the force of my exuberant high fives. In fact, I patted several of the mothers on the thigh in a way that was meant to be an act of comradery and solidarity but may have felt a tad inappropriate as I notice them straining around to see from where MY mother was making her observations.\n\n \n\n The kids! The kids! How I love those kids! They didn\u2019t always listen, they sat on the parachute or crawled underneath often at the wrong times, one little boy took ages and ages down the length of trampoline, bravely falling into the pit of foam squares as if he were repelling down the north face of half dome at Yosemite. Fluffy had a magnificent time.  \n\n  I think the Cedars team will be thrilled. \n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dhs.state.ri.us/dhs/famchild/dchspec.htm,", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/default.asp"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/10/the_cedars_team.html", "title": "The Cedars Team"},

Taken by Dave. \n\n I am bathed in the afterglow of our smashing pumpkins Halloween night! \n\n \n\n Somehow, I fashioned a reasonable facsimile of Save-Ums\u2019s own Foo from yards of blue felt, wire coat hangers, thread, batting, velcro and sheer grit. Then, Fluffy put it on and loved it! In truth, he looked  less  like a round blue fish and  more  like the Grand Marshall of the KKK, Blueberry Division, but no matter! He raced around with the jet pack on his back, squeezing the foam block control handles, saying \u201cI\u2019m Foo! I\u2019m Foo!\u201d \n\n \n\n We did a little pre-trick or treat protein and enzyme loading, and then suited him up. He had to be lowered into the costume  like an astronaut into his space suit , Dave said. Fluffy answered,\u201cWHY?\u201d in that throaty delighted rasp, which meant, say that again and again. I crammed extra batting all around inside like I was stuffing a giant throw pillow and then skittered around him, sticking on the final squares of velcro to keep the whole thing together, like a Broadway dresser, scrambling to get the costume on before his on-stage cue. He lunged for his paper bag and tore out the door, across the darkened street and under the magnolia tree where ghosts swaying in the bare branches brushed against his pointy hat on his way to the first doorway.\n\n \n\n \u201cFoo come too!\u201d He shouted triumphantly, Foo\u2019s trademark line from\u00a0 TV, and then, \u201cTrick or Treat!\u201d. Every house gave him the treats we had delivered earlier that day. Fluffy was none the wiser. It was candy. And it went directly into his bag. No time for stopping on the stoop to inspect or eat it, just on to the next house! For more! more! more!\n\nI was beside him in my black dress, green skin, and witches hat, cackling and flying on my swiffer, and Dave brought up the rear, snapping photos blindly and watching for cars.  \n\n We rang bells alone, we rang bells with packs of other kids. At one point a cat leapt into view out of nowhere and darted along with us, stopping every so often in that comically panicked and frozen way cats do. \n\n \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t feel very useful when we don\u2019t give out our own Halloween candy\u201d, Fluffy announced while jumping up and down on the couch after we got home. So we swiftly lit our pumpkins, turned on our porch light and loaded up our giant silver bowl. When the bell rang, I would fling it open and pretend to lure the little children inside for my consumption while Fluffy dropped candy into the satchels of princesses, jedis, cowboys, vampires, and Brittany, looking pretty good postpartum, I might add. Short, but otherwise, pretty damn good.\n\n \n\n Nine months ago, Fluffy wouldn\u2019t put on a costume hat; he could barely tolerate me pretending to be something for more than a few minutes.  Mommy, I don\u2019t like that. Mommy, stop being that. \n\n \n\n We cut him off at five candies. We brushed teeth for an hour. We read stories about pumpkins. After lights out, we curled up and talked about the evening, staring up at the glow in the dark planets and stars.

{"date": "October 17, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Family Portrait on my birthday. Taken by the long arm of the Dave. \n\n La La!\u00a0 I am beside myself with glee. Fluffy had a playdate today and it was a smash success!\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \n\n It was done in a very casual, covert way. As we were driving to the dump, I said,  after we finish our errands, I need to help my friend, Jane. Oh! Here\u2019s the card that her son, Ethan, made for you  (handing it to him from the front seat as I drive to the dump).  He\u2019ll be excited to see you; he really likes you! But, we\u2019ll only be able to stay for a short time. \n\n \n\n Forty minutes later we pulled into their driveway. I don\u2019t know what he was thinking since he never responded and didn\u2019t mention it through the rest of our errands, but he did march through the front door on his own steam and, well, Ethan took it from there.\n\n \n\n He was so excited to have him there! He showed Fluffy all his toys in that wide-eyed, breathless way kids do: Wanna see my other cool toys? Wanna play with my trains? Wanna see my motorcycle launcher? Wanna go outside and play basket ball? \n\nIt turned out, Fluffy did want to do all those things. They raced, they climbed, they shot baskets, they tossed the frisbee, they charged cool Hot Wheels motorcycles and then launched them across the dining room floor.  \n\n Ethan was leading the way; Fluffy was in a bit over his head, but there were no acts of aggression, no declarations of being \u201call done with playing,\u201d no solitary sonic blaster explosions with Jane\u2019s family heirlooms. The kids played  together ! \n\n \n\n I did exchange a few grown-up words with Jane, but mostly I stood around with my hands fluttering around my neck, smiling like a mad clown, and maybe even mouthing along with whatever words my son uttered. I don\u2019t know. What does it matter? Look! Look! My son is having a playdate!\n\n \n\n Forty minutes later again, we were pulling out of their driveway and Fluffy said to me,  Mommy, at first I didn\u2019t want to come to Ethan\u2019s house but then it turned out to be very fun.  And it was all I could do not to dive over the headrest and into his lap, exclaiming YES YES! IT TURNED OUT TO BE FUN! BEING WITH PEOPLE IS FUN! FRIENDS ARE FUN FUN FUN!! Thankfully, I simply said,  Oh! I\u2019m so glad, honey!  So, you know what I'm doing now? Well, my friends, when your son has playdates, it\u2019s a whole new ballgame. Let's see, I\u2019m, ah, typing in my pajamas at 6pm, all brushed up and ready for bed. Once my son is asleep, I\u2019ll most likely surf the net, read a few blogs, and settle in for part 2 of the Bob Documentary with my husband, Dave, father of the boy who has playdates.  \n\n Yup.

{"date": "October 23, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Bristol clock; October, 2005. Taken by Dave. Orange sky added by me. \n\n Why am I up at this hour? I can\u2019t sleep and it\u2019s past midnight. I lay awake in bed and think about autism, Aspergers, RDI, of why my husband has to snore like that, like a hippopotamus up to his nostrils in mud? Why did I take the plastic mattress cover off my son\u2019s bed today when he is now sleeping on three towels because he wet the bed? Why didn\u2019t I bring him to the toilet when he first woke up instead of taking him at his word when I asked him, do you have to pee honey? as his torso swayed in the air?   \n\n When I first started writing about Aspergers it was to keep myself from going over the edge. Not from the diagnosis. It wasn't only  that  my son had autism.  \n\n You see, a few weeks ago, the little Hungarian man in the woods said there is a new kind of child being born, the \u2018self conscious child\u2019 who turns into the disappointed child when he discovers his parents don\u2019t understand him, don\u2019t know how to give him what he needs.  \n\n I think I was turning into a disappointed adult, maybe from years of knowing what I needed but not how to give it to myself. I never felt disappointed growing up or in my early adulthood. I don\u2019t mean in that small way like I\u2019m disappointed they ran out of Everything bagels. I mean, in the larger, I\u2019m disappointed with my life way, with missed opportunities and lost time, with not believing in myself enough not being willing to step out into it, the big abyss, to look way down there and jump. I love my husband and child and family. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t that. It was arriving at a point when the realness and the preciousness of this life felt piercingly loud and delicate and irretreivable. And that awoke a desperation in me. A rising tide of bitterness. \n\n So I wrote to keep the bitterness at bay. I wrote because I said I always wanted to write, that I feel like a writer but I never wrote and the betrayal was finally more than I could bare. I wrote because I had to express what I was going through, the isolation of parenthood was surprise enough but the isolation of parenting my son on the spectrum had my face against the cold cement of the dark dank basement, the loneliness and apartness I was feeling and that I was also CHOOSING because I believed in my gut it was right for my son, even if it was the wrong thing for me. Because how could it be the wrong thing for me if it was the right thing for him? That has been a huge question for me throughout this year.  \n\n Now I know that part of what was hard about parenting was the autism. Not the obvious kind, not the he\u2019s not verbal he\u2019s not looking at me he\u2019s hitting his head all day in the corner. Not to discount that as a painful, stressful, frightening thing for those families. But it wasn\u2019t our story. It wasn\u2019t my story. I just spent most of Fluffy\u2019s life feeling inadequate, which was confusing since I saw myself giving it every thing I had and I thought what I had was pretty good, pretty playful and flexible, pretty tuned in and dedicated. But it didn\u2019t work. We had no schedule. We never slept. We couldn\u2019t make plans. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone when I was with my son and I was with him a lot. He was mostly happy, as I bent and twisted into a strudle, a high-strung, perplexed, exhausted strudle, but somehow even a happy one; I love being his mom-a mom, after years and years of infertility. It\u2019s just that being his mom was ONE of the things I wanted to do with my 40s, not the ONLY thing.  \n\n I don\u2019t get this preoccupation with the \u201clabeling\u201d of my child, of our children. What\u2019s the concern? I\u2019ve heard people say about my son\u2019s Aspergers, how can anyone know, at his age?  Be careful.  Be careful with that diagnosis! Why? How is it going to change the way I am with him? It just explained a lot to me, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m not giving his care over to anyone else\u2019s authority. They could say he has Doody Chin-itis and if the list of symptoms and behaviors and manifestations made sense to me, then fine, I\u2019d walk around talking about Doody Chin-itis and try to raise awareness of Doody Chin-itis and slap a colorful Doody Chin-itis ribbon on my car. What does it matter? The stigma? No stigma as far as I\u2019m concerned. Do they think I\u2019m going to listen to the Doody Chin-iticians tell me what my son can and can\u2019t have in this life as a result of their rx? \n\n Listen, what of modern neurology? The brain is plastic, it learns, new neurons are made every day, pleuripotent ones, unassigned ones, if you will, that are called off to new locations and await further orders. And that\u2019s where most cell death take place--when they are failed to be stimulated, when they aren\u2019t challenged. And this ASD is a neurological disorder. So, let\u2019s call it what it is as soon as we are able, and then dive in and give those cells something to do. \n\n I hear of this heated debate, the biomedical approach versus those who petition for greater acceptance of these children, greater awarenes of autism, greater education. And I think, what am I missing? I do accept my son as he is. I embrace him and love him and will continue to work to allow for him to grow into his potential. If someone is chelating their child and pumping them with enzymes and intravenous glutathione and putting them the GFCF Feingold Failsafe all because they MUST get rid of the autism before they accept their child then that is quite sad. If someone is not exploring diet or supplements or alternative therapies because they feel to do so would be to not accept their child as they are, then I think that\u2019s sad too. But isn\u2019t this a gross oversimplification? I don't know scads of parents with autistic kids, but of the ones I talk to, and read about, all are passionately in love with their children, advocating for their children, accepting, loving, and learning from their children. Where is this debate taking place? And once you find out, please don't tell me because I don't want to join. I have limited energy. I can\u2019t debate something like that because it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I\u2019d have to walk by and wave my hand in the air, like I\u2019m swatting away a cloud of pesky flies. I need to go over here where the air is clear and I can focus. \n\n What if I said, let\u2019s just accept children with cancer and not try to treat the cancer because then we\u2019re sending the wrong message to the children about not accepting them for who they are. And I know I will be pounced in an instant for equating cancer with autism. Cancer = uncontrolled cell growth, genes turning themselves on and off with no regard to the body, eating away at healthy tissue, causing debilitation, devastation , and death. No. Not the same at all. What I\u2019m saying is that autism takes the child on a deviant developmental pathway that begins and continues to cut them off from interaction with other people, themselves, and the world. This is not typical. This is not \u2018normal\u2019, normal meaning, what we are used to seeing. These kids have brains that are different than the typical brain. But these are brains that can learn, and change. Social development may return to the typical path and even catch up and then the child can interact with others, with themselves, with the world. What child wouldn\u2019t want that chance?  \n\n Yes yes. There are some quirks about autism that bring a new perspective to this world, gifts, differences that are fascinating, valid, important. We need all kinds here but that\u2019s always been the case. We aren\u2019t going to remediate the autism until all autistic kids look like maryann and joe. Ask any parent, any professional that has treated autism. Put 100 ASD kids in the room, you\u2019ve got 100 highly different kids. Remediate the autism, and you\u2019ve still got 100 different kids. But maybe they can now deal with the sensory input of the scene, maybe they will feel safe, and will express themselves with the confidence and competence that is their birthright. \n\n What I want for my son is what any mother wants for her child: for him to have a full, happy, independent life; to have meaningful work; to have meaningful relationships, to have a partner to share his life with and children if he wants; to feel a part of this world:\u00a0 successful, excited, engaged. Autism robs this from many people. That is not okay with me.  \n\n Although no one knows the cause, there is a growing consensus of what constitutes autism. Now that we know where the deficits lie, let\u2019s treat them and turn down the static so we can hear what these kids are saying.  \n\n I, for one, am interested. I\u2019m not trying to fix them. I\u2019m trying to hear them. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/10/watching_the_cl.html", "title": "Watching the Clock "},
{"date": "October 23, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t A bridge in Cape Cod; August, 2005. Taken by Dave. \n\n I discuss my son and his Asperger\u2019s to a fair degree here, but it\u2019s all from my perspective; what I think and feel about it, what I struggle with, what I celebrate, what I discover as I keep searching for the best way to teach my son the things I want to teach him.\u00a0 I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the pre-K set with Asperger\u2019s, nor could I pretend to know what is best and right for any other child out there, even if he were four and verbal and smart with the dubious nickname Fluffy. I\u2019m out in the tall grass, swinging my scythe and tripping on hidden rocks. I\u2019m trusting my gut and keeping the main lines open between my head and my heart as well as those between my husband and me. We\u2019re consulting with professionals we trust. Most of all, we\u2019ve got radar aimed on our son at all times.  \n\n Toss me in the vat of self-absorbed bellybutton peering mommy bloggers if you like because this blog is about me. Me me me. And let me say, I\u2019ve got the full range of human emotions, all the traits: the good, the bad, and the ugly. I\u2019ve rallied the inner troops in order to provide the most respectful loving responsible care for my son and I can\u2019t even take credit for it. It just happened. I\u2019m grateful for it but it wasn't really a  decision , more of an extended knee-jerk reaction, like reaching my long arm across the front passenger seat at a sudden stop for months on end, reaching reaching as the car is screeching, the wheels spinning, all impulse and instinct to avoid the crash. \n\n If one person has felt even the merest bit soothed, the tiniest bit less alone or isolated after reading the blog, than I feel enormous and endless gratification. I know at first, I felt so alone and heartbroken, so raw and panicky it was like popping a spiritual life saver when I got ten minutes at my keyboard to bang out some words, my words, an SOS, a confession, something that cracked me up. Now I feel much less panicky, less lost, and not heart broken so much as heart heightened. I still struggle with loneliness and isolation but that may be a consequence of motherhood itself as much as autism.  \n\n Finding RDI has helped. It makes sense to me. It seems to be working for our son. I looked into other programs but this is the one that fits for us. I\u2019ve mentioned ABA here before and never with much love in my voice and here is where I want to make my apologies.  \n\n What do I really know about ABA? Nothing. Our son was always verbal. Our son was always interested in us. Our son looked mostly \u2018normal\u2019 to the outside world and even to us for the first three years of his life, eccentric, high needs, overwhelming, to be sure, but he wasn\u2019t behind. I\u2019ve been talking to families that use ABA with their ASD kids and it has opened my mind about that approach. I had a limited, distorted view of ABA and I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I may have offended by any disparaging thing I said or implied concerning ABA. The last thing I want to do is add stress to families already overwhelmed by autism, or to contribute any misinformation about treatments. I want the treatment options to be crystal clear and available to every person on the planet, presented in a colorful binder to all the fresh-faced parents along with their newly washed and swaddled baby. I want the community to be tripping over each other as they rush to every family's aid. \n\n That is what has been frustrating for me. ABA is everywhere. You can qualify for Katie Beckett and have a team in your house 40 hours a week the next day but no one will give you a piece of popcorn for RDI. It hasn\u2019t been around long enough. There aren\u2019t enough long-term studies to back up the benefits, they haven\u2019t measured the jumps in IQ, the cogntive growth, the gains in languge.\u00a0 Not enough people know about it yet. I want to spread the word.  \n\n So, if you\u2019re doing ABA, I'll shake my pom poms for you. If you\u2019re interested in RDI, I say go  here  and do some reading. But you don\u2019t even have to choose. I know one family that is using both and they\u2019d froth and growl like a mad dog if you tried to take either one away.  \n\n And that is right and good. \n\n Amen. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com/default.asp"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/10/my_apologies_to.html", "title": "My Apologies to ABA"},

I wore it to the gym last weekend and nearly wept on the exercise bike listening to the music on shuffle. \n\n \n\n I miss music. I miss freedom. I wouldn\u2019t trade my husband or child for anything in the world but sometimes I feel trapped. There is so much that needs to be done; an undercurrent of worry pervades my existence. I can\u2019t tell you if I would have any of this if Fluffy were neurotypical. I don\u2019t think I would. But I can\u2019t know. \n\n \n\n It\u2019s not simply worry about getting things done. It\u2019s worry about him, about his future, about his safety. It\u2019s like feeling as if it is up to me to monitor his oxygen consumption and every once in a while I need to do other things and so I do but who knows if he\u2019ll keep breathing.\u00a0 Other things = not just the laundry or the shopping or the scrubbing of the bus station bathroom we now have, but also me things, emailing and puttering and talking on the phone; writing and reading and trying on ugly clothes at Marshalls; listening to loud music and singing along at the top of my lungs; having the house to myself, me me alone alone, GET OUT AND LET ME HAVE THE HOUSE TO MYSELF; putting on boots with a chunky heel and striding down a New York City street to a little funky soundtrack in my head, not to mention athletically slapping paint on a stretched canvas until I am breathless and relieved; going out to a real restaurant, expansively ordering dish after dish, lustily devouring every morsel, slopping up juice with the heel of my bread, muttering, moaning, laughing with the crowd at the table. \n\n \n\n I expect too much of myself yet I don\u2019t know how to back off. I don\u2019t know how to want to do less for my son or how to need less for myself. I don\u2019t know how to solve the puzzle of time and needs and desires and drives. I don\u2019t know how to let myself have the time I take without the island of guilt popping up and bobbing alongside me on the lilting waves. I know it doesn\u2019t make sense. I know what my mind tells me, the wisdom and truth of rationalization, or what is realistic or necessary. But in the end, the simple truth for me is that I don\u2019t know how to do motherhood imperfectly without being on my own back about it. And doing it perfectly is about as possible as growing another head.  \n\n And there is the bind, my binding maybe, the thing that traps me.\n\nIs it the province of motherhood to feel this? Is it not just the realm of the special needs mother, but also that of all mothers--the stay at home, the working full time or part time, the mother of one, of many, the mother with nannies or sitters, or no help at all? Do we all feel we are not doing enough no matter what we are doing? Do fathers feel any of this? \n\n \n\n I know anger poisons the soul and worry obscures the truth of our journey--if you\u2019ll pardon my yoga speak--that we can fret and wring our hands, but that the truth is, all is right and as it should be even though it often feels wrong and as it shouldn\u2019t be. I can look at you and say, ah, she\u2019s got it, she\u2019s got it figured out, it\u2019s working for her over there. And maybe it\u2019s true and there is a way to \u2018figure it out\u2019 or maybe motherhood is a place where the truth of not ever being able to nail the system is magnified beyond our ability to measure or describe, where we are smack in the middle of a dynamic system that always changes as we change as they, our children change, and we have to learn moment by moment to ride the waves\u00a0 of our own and the world\u2019s imperfection, beauty, cruelty, brilliance, darkness, magnificent gifts and unspeakable losses, hitting our stride from time to time as we slip into a groove that  does  work and stumbling, from time to time, on those shores of guilt.\n\n \n\n I do feel trapped sometimes. Maybe it's inevitable, unavoidable. I\u2019d like to think I'm moving toward greater and greater freedom but I can\u2019t set my GPS to those nifty coordinates, sit back and whip out a magazine. All I can do is load up the car with snacks and the ipod and describe what I see as I lurch along and the cramped spaces inside me break open in that singular and emancipating way that music makes possible. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/10/the_view_from_h.html", "title": "The View From Here"},

Taken by Dave. \n\n Last night I drove on the dark windy roads to the Waldorf school nestled in woods to see the little old hungarian man speak to the circle of moms about giving their children unconditional love. I wish I had filmed him because he was so adorable in his tiny suit sitting on the \u2018unagreeable\u2019 chair speaking in his magnificent accent, inventing his own turn of the phrase, considering each\u00a0 \u201cside of the dime\u201d . \n\n He was unafraid of silence. He took his time. He searched for the right word. He invited questions at the beginning as he was only picking up handfuls of snow but soon a snowball would form and then it would roll and grow, and well, later on, it\u2019s difficult to find one\u2019s way through an avalanche. \n\n For some reason, he reminded me of my high school advisor, Ms. Terizchenco, even though she was easily 8 feet tall, mostly due to her legs. Those legs! She would cross them and cross them again, her calves entwining like snakes up a slender tree. We would stare, all 15 of us, in our matching plaid skirts and rumpled white button ups, our knees socks bunched up in the heels of our untied brown oxfords. She spoke of herself in the third person and spat on american hygiene, stopping the class every 10 minutes to throw her body into stark profile, demanding that we study it STUDY IT! the roman nose! the handsome chin! the strength communicated by the arc of her brow! I think it was her accent. I loved her accent. She really didn\u2019t listen to me or offer any good advice or strategies for success or even, for getting a passing grade from Madam Fenetre in french who was flat-out insane and drunk most of the time, tripping over phantom book bags in the front of the room, lapsing into bouts of melancholy over her fianc\u00e9 who went off to fight in World War 1 and for whose return she was patiently awaiting, but that voice! I was mesmerized. \n\n I went through a period when I pretended to be a Russian exchange student at every possible chance. Sometimes, for a change of pace, my sister and I would walk down a new street, excitedly conversing in east european gibberish. I\u2019m quite sure we fooled no one, but at the time, we were delirious with our overflowing genius. So you\u2019d think I\u2019d have been a show-stopper when, years later, at the acting conservatory, I was called up to do a gibberish scene in the style of a Bergman film.  \n\n I froze. I stammered. I stank.  \n\n And did my acting teacher, the director of the whole program, pull me from the scene, give me one or two brilliant pointers to get me back on track, a quick \"wax on, wax off\" in the art of inhabiting the Swedish angst-ridden soul even though I was a white middle class girl from the east coast, still in my teens? No. He humiliated me in front of the class. The coward. I wish I had more oomph in me at the time, more like Dolly Parton when she and her big boobs called the director in  9 to 5  a dummy\u00a0 when he mocked her for not being able to act. \n\n I didn\u2019t have it in me at the time.

It isn\u2019t going to work because in order for it to work the entire staff would have to get on board with the RDI mindset and that is asking too much. Old dogs. New tricks. They\u2019ve been doing what they\u2019ve been doing forever and while I do believe they love the kids and want to help, I also believe they think RDI is a nice  idea  for someone, somewhere, and maybe even them one day, when they get to it but in the meantime, they like to do it this way because,  look, look at me, listen, listen to me, say this: changing is hard. say it. good job! \n\n RDI in the classroom = revolutionary paradigm shift or simply a decision to slow down and make a connection. What would happen if they did that? They would realize, for starters, that they need to cut the class size by half, add more teachers, get more training, find more rooms, and let go of the fear that they can't do it differently or they will lose control of the classroom.  \n\n In the meetings, they listen and nod their heads, pat the stack of RDI materials I\u2019ve brought for them and jot down notes but then I walk into the classroom where the teacher sits facing the semicircle of children gathered for story time and watch as she opens the book, leans over, and clicks the play button on the boom box. With a tape in it. Of someone else reading the book. While she, a live human being, sits in front of them and holds the book. And turns the pages when she hears the chime prompts only she forgot a couple of times and so the disembodied voice forges on and the picture hangs in the air. Why did she forget? I don\u2019t know. Maybe because she wasn\u2019t actually reading the book? Maybe because the taped voice put her in a kind of trance, allowing her mind to wander to some other things like what she was going to cook that night? \n\n It\u2019s not all bad. It\u2019s not. But a school experience that\u2019s not all bad is not what I want for my son.  \n\n He loves his time with the OT in her magic playroom where today they were transported to Jupiter on the moon swing and stomped in the deep craters of Mars, where he unleashed his imagination and let it take him to places his physical body could not have dared to go. We\u2019re sticking with that. Once a week. Just that. \n\n In the meantime, I will think of the boy who has a meltdown every time he comes into the class because he\u2019s got autism and he has to be there full day, he has to change classrooms at noon and adjust to a new room and a new set of kids and a new teacher and it\u2019s breaking my heart. Fluffy says,  why is he sad?  and I want to say,  because he desperately\nneeds to regulate, because he doesn\u2019t want to come in, because none of\nthis is fun for him and he may not even know what fun feels like yet,\nhe may not even have had that chance.  They follow him around during the day and bring him back to the white line or the brown line or whatever color line they're asking all the kids to sit on at that point.  \n\n I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s there all day. Maybe his mom is single and has to work to support them. Maybe there is no other help and no where else for him to be. Maybe there\u2019s a house full of kids at home, an infant, others with special needs.  \n\n I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right for him, but I think of what Fluffy said the other day, his sweet eyes looking at me as he reached his hand to my face , Mommy, sometimes when I put my hand on your face right here it feels warm in a way that I like,  and I wish I could tear my shirt open and streak through the room in my Super Mommy outfit, cape streaming behind me, and take this boy to where he could feel more of that something warm on his hands, his face, his heart, his mind, in a way that he likes. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["mailto:"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/09/thats_it_for_sc.html", "title": "That's It For School"},

Taken by Dave. \n\n\n\n \n\n It\u2019s the nature of autism to swell and recede, at least in this house. It\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to hold gently in my cupped hands, the way you hold something exquisite in order to get a better look, rather than with a contorted pinch the way you hold something that just bit you in the dark. \n\n It\u2019s been swelling over here and it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to remember that nature. It\u2019s hard to remember nature, period. That low tide is followed by high; that moltings are followed by new feathers and skins; that even snakes must feel an extra chill as they slither from the ghostly curl no longer needed; that as we speak, tiny naked hermit crabs skitter across the ocean floor unshelled and vulnerable looking for a home to outgrow. \n\n\n\n Because, here is this:\u00a0  \n\n We had a family gathering at the zoo last weekend. We saw my step-brother and his two young daughters, Fluffy\u2019s cousins, for the first time in about a year. They are both beautiful, smart, funny, interesting little girls, one just two, one nearly four. The oldest one, Bella, took an immediate liking to Fluffy, either not noticing his solitary stance or deciding it was beside the point. She hooked her arm in his elbow and off she went, to race along the pathway, to offer up a graham cracker, to climb upon the shiny dog statue, and when it came time to eat french fries, she sidled onto the bench beside him to dip and munch, as if they\u2019d been doing this for years. \n\n As sometimes happens with little kids, one minute she was snapping down a fry and the next minute she was somersaulting backward in the air. She landed on the cement, her dad scooped her up, and she cried and cried that scraped and terrified cry. Now, kids have cried near Fluffy before. I\u2019ve always highlighted it and he\u2019s always looked straight ahead. But underneath it all, from my mother gut, I knew it bothered him.  \n\n This time he got up and went right over to her,  \"Bella Bella Bella ,\" he said, rocking from foot to foot,  \"I have something to tell you, Bella Bella ,\" he said, stroking her hair, patting her very gently. She turned her red eyes to him and he told her a story about when he once fell,  \"and not because I bumped into anything, I just fell down while I was running and hurt my legs, HERE, and my hands, HERE, and that made me feel very sad too. But then, Bella, I healed.\"   \n\n I said, 'I wonder if Bella would like to come sit next to you again and keep eating french fries?\" and he raced up to her chin and asked that very question. She did and they both climbed back on the death bench and resumed eating fries. Fluffy mentioned at least 2 or 3 more times he still felt sad about Bella feeling sad even though he was happy that he helped make her feel better.  \n\n A sparkling self-initiated, empathetic, gesture of friendship with a dash of shared episodic memory to top it all off.  \n\n\n\n Low tide comes and lays bare the mud and then the water returns and all is hidden once more. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  Bella and Fluffy in a giant, empty shell.

Once, a commenter on this site told me just to  breathe  and I wanted to slap her down the stairs, or repeat, for reasons that don't necessarily make sense but still felt right, a version of the line from The Hustler when Fats tells Fast Eddy to shoot pool and Fast Eddy replies: \"I  am  shooting Fats, when I'm done you can shoot.\"\u00a0 only I would say,  I am breathing, bitch, when I'm done, you can breathe. Last night, a dear RDI on-line mommy friend suggested that maybe I'm trying too hard. She said, put the kettle on, sit back and wait for it to boil.  It's hard for me to be a beginner, to let things take time. It's hard to take the long view. In theory, I'm all for it. In practice, I often don't allow myself a learning curve.  I do allow it for my son. I've always done more for him than I thought was possible, and not in a hand-wringing martyred way. It was fact. It was instinct. It was required and so it was. It's like the hand that shoots across the passenger seat when you stop suddenly at the wheel. You don't think about it. I've been out of the big world for five years, out of the small world too--even the tiny world of immediate friends and family. I may look tense at times, I may forget what you or I just said, I may lose an hour a day looking for my keys or wallet or that note with the critical number scribbled in fading ink, but all along, I think there's been a slow and steady harvest for me; my son's learning curve has been my shadow one.  \n\n So, I'll try breathing a bit more and I'll put that kettle on the fucking stove, alongside the MANY other pots and pans already simmering, even as I mutter to myself, yes yes, I  know.

My son is like an animal kept too long in captivity, one that gingerly steps to the edge of the cage and tentatively peers out when you open the door, ultimately preferring the inside or the very little bit of grass on the perimeter. Fluffy doesn't run to the slides and climber. He doesn\u2019t race to the jungle gym and see saw. He idly stands by it and recites the latest chapter in his made up computer game world.  \n\n The other parents look at us oddly. The other kids gravitate to us swiftly--to us and then, to me, when they see that my son is not interested in playing.  \u201cWanna see me climb up this slide? Wanna watch me go on the balance beam? Wanna push me on the swing? I can jump off while it\u2019s swinging and I don\u2019t even get hurt! Wanna see?\u201d \n\n I miss things. I miss the feedback I would get if Fluffy was neurotypical.

I keep forgetting that I won\u2019t get the same kind of stuff back from my son right now. I keep forgetting that parents of kids on the spectrum aren\u2019t really able to parent in the usual way because of this breakdown in the flow, in the feed-feedback-feed again loop that parents of NT kids take for granted because it\u2019s so embedded in the everyday it goes unnoticed.  \n\n It upsets me. I feel disappointed. I\u2019ve got to keep finding a place for this to come out, to continually process this grief and disappointment because it doesn't help to get mad and be mad at him.

But lately, the talking is oppressive.  \n\n The unresponsiveness at many offers of things to do, the falling flat of extensions and engagement, it is all part of a bigger scene with growing moments of connection, but when the disappointment swells, it saps my succulence and leaves me withered, sad, and angry.  \n\n I need to say it: I don\u2019t like the aspergers.

{"date": "September 26, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Riding the goatcart at the Peacefair; August, 2005. \n\n Fluffy\u2019s begun the slow transition to pre-school. The first week, each of the four adults who will be working with him came, one at a time, to our home and spent about 45 minutes in the playroom. And each emerged, one at a time, and regarded me as if I was attempting to nurse a stuffed animal to my naked breast.  Oh, he\u2019s FINE. He\u2019ll be fine! I have kids in the class who look much more autistic then him!  they all said, a press to my shoulder, trying to gently break it to me that there is nothing wrong with my son other than having been born to an overanxious woman who\u2019s isolated her child and created phantom symptoms of autism.  \n\n And I go into the slow boil under the surface while trying to gently remind them that my child has a social difficulties with HIS PEER GROUP, and that you can\u2019t possibly compare what he does in less than an hour in his own playroom with an attentive adult with how he would react in a new classroom packed to the gills with novel objects and 13 unknown children coming in and out of his personal space.  But he took my hand! But he told me all about his favorite toys!  Hello? This is aspergers. He\u2019ll tell you about his favorite toys until the cows come home, until the cows come home and then begin mooing and kicking at the playroom door looking for any escape, a bullet, Temple Grandin\u2019s latest invention, anything to end the onslaught of words on Magnatiles and made up computer games with endless levels and health bars and extra guys. These are the people that conducted his initial assessment and gave us the word Autism. These are the people that sent us to the expert for the final diagnosis. These are the people that saw him in preschool last year, throwing chalk at the other children and attempting to bite if approached. \n\n By that week\u2019s end, I was enraged by the implication that had we only exposed Fluffy to more children, he would be \u201csocialized\u201d , used to kids, happy to be around them, as if autism was something that could be cured by osmosis through exposure to neurotypical children. Do they think I was pleased to have spent the year mostly alone? Unable to have playdates or casual meetings in the park, on the beach, in the yard? I\u2019ve been paying attention to my son and what he needs. I\u2019ve been addressing the autism from the inside out. I\u2019ve been cutting out the unnecessary stimulation and distractions, the pressure and confusion so that we can start with his safety needs and then build up from there.  \n\n Last week, we went into the classroom, tiny baby step by baby step. The first day we arrived before any other kids came in so Fluffy could explore the room with his teacher. After about 15 minutes, the special needs kids came in for about 20 minutes of \u2018table time\u2019, a structured project with the teacher and her assistant. Fluffy was nervous but game, and within minutes, he had pulled up a chair and began making his patterns, loudly displaying them to the little guy next to him, the little guy who completely ignored him the way Fluffy would completely ignore kids who spoke to him. I always crumble a little when I see that. He spoke to you! He\u2019s connecting to you! Please respond to him! But the truth is, he seemed fine and kept right on with his patterns, asking to make harder and harder ones.  \n\n The site of those 5 kids at the table made my chest feel achy and concaved. It was so endearing and moving to me I could barely stand it. There was a little boy who was bursting with enthusiasm with every slow-spoken word, a boy who appeared to be wearing hand-me-downs from a sibling twice his age, a girl who walked daintily on her toes while she held tight to her aide\u2019s hands, and the boy who I was told looked much more autistic than my son. It was true. He did. He had that vague, unfocused expression. He didn\u2019t make much eye contact. He kept trying to take off his shoes. He swiped some small plastic fish at one point and darted over to the bathroom to put them into the sink.  \n\n He melted down when he couldn\u2019t find what he was looking for in his backpack. But you know, every single behavior he had made sense to me. I wasn\u2019t the teacher so I was free to look, to see things that she couldn\u2019t see. He had gone to his cubby which was directly next to another boy\u2019s cubby. They both had the exact same backpack, Buzz Lightyear, and he had mistakenly opened the other boy\u2019s. No wonder he was melting down. He couldn\u2019t find what he needed, his trains, his trains. He needed his trains to knock into each other so he could feel safe, so he could regulate, find the certainty he needed. There was much confusion while the teacher tried to get him to stop being upset, get him to behave better, to ask nicely for help, etc.\u00a0 I told her what happened and they made the switch, found his trains. And then he returned to his special chair with the wooden foot rest, hitting one of his trains into the other, over and over. \n\n We came one other day and stayed for circle time. I have some, well, feedback, shall we say, for the teacher. She is a lovely woman who obviously cares a great deal for these kids and about what she does. I\u2019m sure her experience and expertise will be more and more clear to me as I get to know her. But I just wish there could be a different underlying orientation, one that is about putting the interaction between and among the kids as the first priority. I wish, when she read the story, it didn't feel as if the most important thing was to get through it in a certain time frame. I wish it were more okay that the kids had questions and comments along the way. I wish it were a time for discovery and inquiry and interaction. Yes, we need to raise hands and take turns--yes yes. It all can\u2019t descend into chaos. But I think there could be much more room for it to be interactive. And give the IEP kids something to do with their hands. How about a little ball of beeswax to fiddle with? It\u2019s too much to ask them to sit still and listen. They need a place to focus and gather and concentrate that which is scattered and as yet unharnessed in them. And then the dancing at the end. Listen: turn off the music. Especially when there are words. Because if you don\u2019t, then you must keep up with the tape and is that the most important thing? Or is it more important to be with where most of the kids are, be flexible and open to respond to them, to their tempo, to slow down and adjust, adapt to what you are getting from THEM, these live beings and not the recorded sound on the tape.  \n\n Fluffy was exhausted by the week\u2019s end but he did want to go back. And go back we will, today, for table time. We\u2019ll keep making our baby steps and I will keep being there as we transition until they hire an adequately trained aide for him and not one whose main strength seems to be the ability to get exceedingly and evenly and alarmingly tanned, even though they will keep looking at me with that careful smile and offering that I could come on back in about 20 minutes if I wanted to!  \n\n I think school will end up being about 1 hour, 3 days a week with an additional 30 minute session 1:1 with the speech therapist and the occupational therapist, each. I think. I don\u2019t expect that school will be a place to remediate his autism. I\u2019ve got my complaints and concerns about what schools are doing and how they are doing it. I wish they would slow down, be available for eye contact, use body gestures and facial expressions more for information and communication, I wish they would ask less questions and make more open-ended statements, I wish they were less concerned about following their outline and more concerned about being present to the moment to moment opportunities for teaching children how to think rather than what to say.\u00a0  \n\n School will not be where Fluffy learns that, but it can be a place for him to build positive memories of success with other kids, something he\u2019s not had in all his short and wonderful life so far. No chalk has sailed through the air, no open mouths to bite, no aggression, and therefore, no outward signs of his feeling unsafe, and that my firends, is huge. There is even one little boy who seems to light up every time Fluffy comes in the room. He offers up a steady stream of commentary on his where-abouts:  Look! He\u2019s here! Is he staying today? Will he stay for circle time! Hey, does he have to go now? Will he be back?  Perhaps it\u2019s because Fluffy\u2019s appearance is still so new and fleeting. But perhaps it\u2019s because he might want to be his friend. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/09/baby_steps_to_s.html", "title": "Baby Steps to School"},
{"date": "September 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n My dear little napkin head. September, 2005. \n\n Oh! A blank page! How thrilling. Let me enumerate a few of the ways that I am mentally ill. \n\n I have stacking problem, and stacking and piling tossing out and onto the floor into growing heaps problem.  \n\n I need to do my little ritual to get ready for bed at 6 PM. Yes, I said, 6 pee em. Not that I actually go to sleep at this hour, but I must prepare. This comes out of the bedtime routine we\u2019ve had with Fluffy for some time now since he gave up his naps when he was a couple of weeks old. Consequently, bedtime was early. One day it was 4:10 pm. Of course, he was up and at \u2018em at 3 the next morning which was a riot--the kind they have in LA, ha ha, though I didn\u2019t see Rodney anywhere, yet there were many piles and stacks that day so I can\u2019t really say for sure. \n\n I look in the mirror 200 times a day. Mostly this happens while I wash and brush and floss while most adults my age are still outside in the great, bright world. \n\n I have a little hole in the floor on the inside threshold of my office door and that is where my patience goes whenever I am in there trying to find a little mommy time. If I see Dave out of the corner of my eye, standing there, wanting to engage me in pressing conversation about where to put various groceries or who we should name as Fluffy\u2019s guardians in case we are both killed in a freak dvd watching accident in our own living room because where else do we ever go, or have I seen his penis anywhere? I stare straight ahead at my computer screen and intone,  busy . I think I got this from my friends, The Fishers. You know, those people who own that funeral home? I plan to do,  volume! , and,  language! , although in my case it would be a call for louder voices and trashier words. \n\n I actually like talking out loud to myself, even, on occasion, in public. It feels very natural to me, as the flower of one of the many debates in my head passes its bloom and out it spills through my parted and moving lips. I am sharp, savvy, penetrating and well-read at these times, so clearly, it is a full-fledged fantasy. \n\n I have an enormous appetite and love great overflowing bowls of peasanty type food--the tearing of crusty bread, the spooning out of stews and heaps of pasta. more more! eat eat! basta!\u00a0 But I can\u2019t touch leftovers after 24 hours. Immediately, it\u2019s gag city. Tuna salad is only palatable for the first 15 minutes--after that it\u2019s fish saliva soup. Which always brings to mind the, hands down, most revolting story I ever heard about food. Worse than soup tureens of live baby shrimp skittering around the edge of the bowl being passed guest to guest down the table in foreign lands; worse than monkey skulls screwed to the edge of the table, sliced and lifted to reveal the juicy frontal lobes; worse than the night my little brother made the connection between the chicken he was eating and the cute chickens he read about in cute children\u2019s books as he cheerfully clucked clucked his drumstick across his plate at the exact moment we were all discovering that not only had he contracted lice from little Megan\u2019s house of chaos across the street but one of the little devils was marching his way to the drumstick at that very moment. Worse. When my mom was a kid, she spit spoonfuls of jello back into a glass AFTER having swirling it around in her mouth. Swirl spit swirl spit. Once she reached the rim, she gently replace it in the fridge, returning later to drink it all down.  \n\n And now, I shall vomit onto my keyboard. \n\n I like to sit and lean very far over when I pee. Sometimes I like to push the pee out as fast as I can. This may be reactionary since I am unable to stop my stream--my pee is all, you\u2019re joking right? Because, the doors are wide open down here, big mama. \n\n I keep thinking that maybe this year I can get a washboard tummy, so tight you could bounce a quarter off it. This has never been the landscape of my middle. In fact, there may be some loose change in there from previous attempts.  \n\n Still I dream.\u00a0  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/09/he_is_cute_i_am.html", "title": "He is Cute; I Seek Washboard Abs"},
{"date": "September 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Because I cannot seem to find my own words lately, I am reprinting those of Sharon Olds, a poet whose work I love and admire. \n\n No Place for a Poet at a Banquet of Shame Sharon Olds For reasons spelled out below, the poet Sharon Olds has declined to attend the National Book Festival in Washington, which, coincidentally or not, takes place September 24, the day of an antiwar mobilization in the capital. Olds, winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award and professor of creative writing at New York University, was invited alongwith a number of other writers by First Lady Laura Bush to read from their works. Three years ago artist Jules Feiffer declined to attend the festival's White House breakfast as a protest against the Iraq War (\"Mr. Feiffer Regrets,\" November 11, 2002). We suggest that invitees to this year's event consider following their example.\u00a0  \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 --The Editors of The Nation Dear Mrs. Bush, \u00a0 \u00a0 I am writing to let you know why I am not able to accept your kind invitation to give a presentation at the National Book Festival on September 24, or to attend your dinner at the Library of Congress or the breakfast at the White House. \u00a0 \u00a0 In one way, it's a very appealing invitation. The idea of speaking at a festival attended by 85,000 people is inspiring! The possibility of finding new readers is exciting for a poet in personal terms, and in terms of the desire that poetry serve its constituents--all of us who need the pleasure, and the inner and outer news, it delivers. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 And the concept of a community of readers and writers has long been dear to my heart. As a professor of creative writing in the graduate school of a major university, I have had the chance to be a part of some magnificent outreach writing workshops in which our students have become teachers. Over the years, they have taught in a variety of settings: a women's prison, several New York City public high schools, an oncology ward for children. Our initial program, at a 900-bed state hospital for the severely physically challenged, has been running now for twenty years, creating along the way lasting friendships between young MFA candidates and their students--long-term residents at the hospital who, in their humor, courage and wisdom, become our teachers. \u00a0 \u00a0 When you have witnessed someone nonspeaking and almost nonmoving spell out, with a toe, on a big plastic alphabet chart, letter by letter, his new poem, you have experienced, close up, the passion and essentialness of writing. When you have held up a small cardboard alphabet card for a writer who is completely nonspeaking and nonmoving (except for the eyes), and pointed first to the A, then the B, then C, then D, until you get to the first letter of the first word of the first line of the poem she has been composing in her head all week, and she lifts her eyes when that letter is touched to say yes, you feel with a fresh immediacy the human drive for creation, self-expression, accuracy, honesty and wit--and the importance of writing, which celebrates the value of each person's unique story and song. \u00a0 \u00a0 So the prospect of a festival of books seemed wonderful to me. I thought of the opportunity to talk about how to start up an outreach program. I thought of the chance to sell some books, sign some books and meet some of the citizens of Washington, DC. I thought that I could try to find a way, even as your guest, with respect, to speak about my deep feeling that we should not have invaded Iraq, and to declare my belief that the wish to invade another culture and another country--with the resultant loss of life and limb for our brave soldiers, and for the noncombatants in their home terrain--did not come out of our democracy but was instead a decision made \"at the top\" and forced on the people by distorted language, and by untruths. I hoped to express the fear that we have begun to live in the shadows of tyranny and religious chauvinism--the opposites of the liberty, tolerance and diversity our nation aspires to. \u00a0 \u00a0 I tried to see my way clear to attend the festival in order to bear witness--as an American who loves her country and its principles and its writing--against this undeclared and devastating war. \u00a0 \u00a0 But I could not face the idea of breaking bread with you. I knew that if I sat down to eat with you, it would feel to me as if I were condoning what I see to be the wild, highhanded actions of the Bush Administration. \u00a0 \u00a0 What kept coming to the fore of my mind was that I would be taking food from the hand of the First Lady who represents the Administration that unleashed this war and that wills its continuation, even to the extent of permitting \"extraordinary rendition\": flying people to other countries where they will be tortured for us. \u00a0 \u00a0 So many Americans who had felt pride in our country now feel anguish and shame, for the current regime of blood, wounds and fire. I thought of the clean linens at your table, the shining knives and the flames of the candles, and I could not stomach it. \u00a0 \u00a0 Sincerely, \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 SHARON OLDS   \n\n \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/09/sharon_olds.html", "title": "Sharon Olds"},

Taken by Dave. \n\n I called in the housecleaner earlier to help with my pre-vacation cleaning and organizational psychosis but Fluffy and I had to hightail it out of the house because she yammers on endlessly in her tall lean legs and white eye shadow. I don\u2019t know what's more fascinating--the legs or the shadow.   \n\n She also doesn\u2019t have kids and doesn\u2019t know the first thing about them, even that they are the same species as her and that one day, will grow up into actual people. Fluffy has been stepping up his conversational skills and he will excitedly open his mouth to share with her, and AS HE IS TALKING she will turn to me and practically yell, \u2018Aren\u2019t they  funny?  Yeah, my brother\u2019s kid, you know, my nephew, I guess? or  whatever,  he\u2019s always sayin' something to me about somethin'!\u201d\u00a0 and then she shrugs like, whoa! those little things  talk ! and walks away. She\u2019s blond and ten feet tall and appears capable of lifting both Dave and me with one hand while efficiently scrubbing beneath our feet with Mr. Clean's Magic Erasers. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing here; she looks more like the next contestant for Beauty and the Geeks, 40+ \n\n But enough of that. My son played with another child on the beach! Blow up the giant dinosaur balloons! Glue a billion flowers to the Honda! Climb aboard a ladder truck and flash your boobies to the crowd! \n\n I had already packed us up to go when Fluffy asked for a little more playtime so I said sure. Five minutes can mean a lot to the guy who seems to be headed for a career in contract negotiation. His final offer during his push for one extra bedtime book tonight was,  Okay, how about this: can we read just one letter of one word of one page of one more book?   \n\n He moved to the water\u2019s edge and began piling clumps of sand on someone\u2019s boogie board. I called to him and then gave the grave shake of the head. He turned back to the board. Clump Clump. I got up and moved in for the up close grave shake of the head when the mother of the child of the board said, that\u2019s okay, my daughter likes to bury her boogie board too. Enter, the daughter. She approached the board, sat down and smiled at Fluffy. He looked at her and introduced himself. \n\n He introduced himself. To the little girl.   \n\n This has never happened with another child. Never.\u00a0  \n\n The girl said nothing so I pounded her with my fists and hissed, SAY SOMETHING YOU WRETCHED MONSTER, or rather,  I don\u2019t think she heard you, honey.  And so he said it again and  she  introduced  herself  and then they were married. Well, almost. First they each sort of frog hopped on the sand.  \n\n I scurried back to my chair, mouthing to my mom who sat waiting for me, DID YOU HEAR THAT? and sat poised close enough to dive to the rescue should it be necessary, but far enough so he could test the waters. I had a feeling it was going to work this time. \n\n I was riveted. They played side by side.  Parallel play!  I stage-whispered to my mom. They had a few exchanges. I don\u2019t know what was said or even if the back and forth made any sense but it didn\u2019t matter. He was looking at her and no one was getting the Big Spittie or a face full of sand. Then she left the scene and returned with her truck, vroom vroom. I scrambled through our already packed bag until I yanked out his truck and sidled it over to him, slinking quickly back to my observation spot. He watched her vroom vroom and then HE vroom vroomed ( imitative play! ) They came apart and back together a few times ( regulating! ), seamlessly. After a few minutes of dumping sand on their own truck, Fluffy grabbed a huge handful and lifted it high in the air. I admit, I did brace then, but I didn\u2019t move. He walked toward her, squatted down and placed it carefully on top of her growing mountain, to her obvious delight and approval. And there you have it ladies and gentlemen:  Cooperative play.    \n\n I almost cried. It was 10 minutes of the most ordinary looking thing to anyone else but, to me, it was like finally seeing my lost son come toward me as I ran down an empty road. But it\u2019s not me he\u2019s headed for, it\u2019s the stadium at the end of the marathon, full of kids. \n\n It wasn\u2019t the moon or the beach or the tide or the lunch or the girl. It was something neurological, a result of the RDI we've been doing, a clearing and connecting that made this simple looking moment that has eluded him for years, happen.  \n\n And it will happen again.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/08/it_will_happen_.html", "title": "It Will Happen Again"},

{"date": "August 18, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t We went back to the pediatric dentist who declared the filling of my son\u2019s cavity would not require Novocain. Ding ding! This was the selling point for me since one glance at the approaching 3-foot needle would surely fracture Fluffy\u2019s sanity, and in my vivid imagination, send the pieces to the floor, collectively muttering,\u201cthe people, the people\u201d like Sybil in times of stress. \n\n \n\n I never minded going to the dentist. I like the way it feels to have my teeth cleaned, kind of tickley and relaxing. I once fell asleep with my dentist\u2019s finger shoved back against a drying filing, and woke up to him poke-poking me in the shoulder,  Miss Anderson. Stop biting me.  But even I have gulped audibly as that needle was held up to the light and then pressed ever so slightly, sending the glistening liquid up in a tiny fountain of spray. Does it have to be so LONG? Every time it\u2019s been sunk into my gums, I brace for its gory exit out the back of my neck.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n So, when this dentist said, no Novocain, I did a little cabbage patch.\n\n \n\n I took the first appointment of the day so we wouldn\u2019t have to do any waiting. Ah, my innocence! We were called right in. Fluffy climbed into his plastic recliner and started fiddling with the side controls, zooming himself up flat to the ceiling and back, while, in the next room, they began filming the kiddie version of Marathon Man. Marathon Toddler. The dentist scene. Absolute screaming. Absolute terror. For about 15 minutes. This is one of those times when I am grateful for Fluffy\u2019s inability to discriminate. All input is assigned equal weight. Let\u2019 see... small child\u2019s sounds of torture coming from who knows where compared to countless novel objects and distractions at the tip of my fingers. toy baskets! clay models of teeth to gnash about! a tray of skinny water guns and mini-vacuums! tiny mirrors! Miniature logs of cotton! Thankfully, he selected a sing-along book from the toy basket and I launched into renditions of Down In the Meadow and Heads Shoulders Knees and Toes with Broadway abandon. No no! Let\u2019s\u00a0 not put that away! Let\u2019s do it again! Now with accents! At one point the tiny girl in the neighboring room pleaded for her father and I thought, HE'S NOT IN THERE? WHAT IS HE DOING? ERRANDS? FEEDING THE FISH IN THE LOBBY? \n\n  Around the time the screaming finally ceased, I began to worry about this no-Novocain position. Did the drilling of my son\u2019s cavity really not require Novocain? Or had we stumbled into the local Christian Science dental practice and any minute, kind strangers in unflattering dresses were to emerge with prayer books in their hands and hymns in their hearts?\n\n \n\n In preparation, I had done a whole pretend play the night before with Mr. Rectangle Man, fashioned out of soft foam blocks, the kind you can build with and also sink your teeth into, the kind that topple softly down to the rug and just as softly when hurled across the room at the walls or the back of your head. Fluffy stared right this thing, smiling and chatting and giving advice about Mr. Rectangle\u2019s upcoming trip to the dentist. It\u2019s so vivid and real! There is such commitment to the pretense! Dave, on the other hand, almost never talks to Mr. Rectangle when we\u2019re discussing difficult topics.\n\n \n\n So, Fluffy was talking very candidly with Mr. Rectangle, sagely reporting that he would have to eat a pill that would put him to sleep so the dentist, who tries very hard not to hurt you, drills and fills his cavity. This is what happened to his cousin, E., and the only way cavities were filled as far as he knew. I got to tell Mr. Rectangle about the other ways cavities are filled when you are awake, and act out the whole procedure, drilling with a crayon, rinsing out with a pipe cleaner, vacuuming with a straw. \n\nThe only thing I didn\u2019t know about was the cotton. The cotton! The jamming of 300 cotton logs in his mouth, the wedging of an entire roll of toilet paper into the back of his gagging throat and the resulting wild-eyed stare and gargled sounds of protest. \n\n \n\n I was right there, holding his hand, offering up \u2018great job!\u2019 and \u2018almost done!\u2019 and 'what a big boy!' along with a stream of observations, oh! the lasar gun! you look like a lightbulb! (quickly! stop my inane babbling! someone stuff cotton logs in MY mouth!) while he was saying \u2018ow ow ow\u2019 which was really more of, \u201cWhat the hell IS this? This isn't what Mr. Rectangle and I went over last night!\u201d. They worked efficiently and quickly, and I'm sure, painlessly. He exclaimed all the way to the front desk,  my mouth my mouth it feels funny mommy! mommy! it feels funny! , but by the time I had paid the twenty thousand dollar bill he was fine. He got a plastic cockroach and a gigantic caterpillar balloon as big as our house that he batted and jousting with all the way to the car. \n\n \n\n We only have to go back  three more times . Yes, count them: four 4 in all. Was it the economy size bag of gummy worms we plied into his gaping bird-like mouth at the first sign of any atempt to pee near the potty? That never actually reduced our reliance on diapers and pullups and the scrubbing of the floors and rugs? That we finally abandoned but only after, apparently rotting his tiny, innocent, crumbling teeth? This after a lifetime of organic foods and rations of watered-down juice with meals?  \n\n What kind of mother am I?  \n\n I don\u2019t think I got one cavity until sometime in high school. My husband, meanwhile, slid out of his mom and into the delivery room with a couple of impressive gold crowns.

I\u2019ve held countless jobs, none that I really loved, but all that involved being with people who were lively and real, annoying and ridiculous, inspiring and brilliant, bitter and self centered, and on and on, pairs of personality traits.

He looked at me, smiling up as if to say,  What \u2018cha got? I\u2019m up for it! Surprise me! I want in!  \n\n He was purely relational. His mom was behind me with her three other friends, chatting away and looking trim and relaxed, at the glorious salty seashore, their collection of children playing, unattended to, larger ones hauling smaller ones around in that under the armpit way that stretches their bodies out like dripping silly putty and\u00a0 squashes their shoulders into their ears, compressing their tops unnaturally like they were sacks of seed.  Oh, hell. I think I'll succumb to the scatological and tell you about the most harrowing poop experience of my life. It happened just last night; I\u2019ve never had such an exhausting and emotional time.\u00a0 Usually for me, it's a quick sit and I'm back up to flush in a flash. But this was tribal, like pushing in the rainforest amidst a cloud of poisonous bugs and spiders that lay eggs under your skin. I almost called for help. But who? Dave? The EMS team? The midwife? I'm telling you, I needed one--that and a blood pressure check and maybe even a cool cloth to the forehead. And then it was over.

The liberal from down the street is actually exercising! Isn\u2019t that a riot! If you ask me, all her kid needs is a sibling or two to yank him out of his shell and get her mind off this ri-goddamn-diculous preoccupation about his developmental needs! Snort! \n\n But there I was, anyway, puffing on the elliptical, red-faced and bathed in a sticky cocoon of my own sweat. And here I am now, in front of my keyboard, surrounded by teetering stacks of books and papers and bills while important phone numbers slip between the wall and the filing cabinets, and dvds of the most recent family photos inadvertently get tossed in the trash. My outgoing phone message cheerfully announces that we will be home on Labor Day, and the daily hits on this site dip to an all-time low as I go weeks and weeks without posting. \n\n I don\u2019t know if I have anything to say. Did I just need to write, as my tag line says, to keep the bitterness at bay during the most scary and lonely and stressful period this past year? Do I have anything to offer other people, other parents? I feel unclear about where this writing is taking me, if anywhere. I didn\u2019t start writing to have it BE something, I just needed help adjusting to the discovery of my son\u2019s autism. I guess I can let the writing move where it wants to go and if people want to read it, okay. If not, okay. I can only keep going, writing as honestly as I can about whatever is going on over here, inside of me.\u00a0  \n\n I guess we\u2019re all changed by the events in our lives, certainly by motherhood. I\u2019ve been changed\u00a0 by it, the first time by my actual birth, the second time by my son's. Before this past year, I never thought about the every day of special needs kids. I felt compassion, respect and a kind of anthropological curiosity, looking in on a world so unlike my present and past, like reading about the !Kung.\u00a0 But now that I have a toe in the water--and believe me, I know it's only a toe when I lay our file next to the hundreds of special needs cases out there with wheelchairs and oxygen tanks and seizure medications--I  am  in a different world and it has changed me. I guess my landscape would have to change too and the people, either change in order to stay or change by leaving and clearing a space. Right now, the view beyond our little island of autism is pretty wide open. \n\n So, here are a couple of things, in no particular order:  \n\n (1) We\u2019re videotaping ourselves doing RDI with Fluffy, for our own review and for our consultant. We\u2019re working on establishing the Master/Apprentice relationship--that\u2019s the key, the first step--teaching him to trust that we will guide him to a feeling of competency so he doesn\u2019t have to rely on his own systems, fraught with preseveration and chaos.\u00a0 We are also trying to limit speech, increase nonverbal communication, and use declarative communication as much as possible. We\u2019re to review the tapes before we send them on and let me say, in the future I plan to get properly dressed before the next taping. No more prancing about in my stained pjs with my nips poking out a mile. And calm down. I'm postively apoplectic, practically climbing on the backs of cheerleaders for the big human pyramid every time Fluffy looks my way. Enthusiasm is one thing but I\u2019m looking a little psycho.  \n\n (2) About 100 evacuees landed in Rhode Island last Friday. I tore through the house like a mini-tornado and gathered clothes, toys, blankets, bedding, towels, and bags of toiletries and cleaning supplies I bought from the local Job Lot (which, by the way, was matching all monetary donations for the evacuees). Mom swung by with her bags and then Jane pulled up, her truck already packed with her donations. We piled it high and did such a good job securing it all with a tarp that Jane only had to stop five times to scamper roadside, lugging rocks and tree stumps over to keep dollhouses and strollers from flying out of the truck bed and sailing over the edge of the Newport bridge. When she got to the Salvation Army, shockingly, she unloaded ALONE, a couple of the guys on the clock that morning, apparently, too busy slapping it around with her dog and chatting it up with random people while sitting on the  tailgate of her truck . The one she kept scaling with ever-weakening knees as she dragged and carried and lugged item after item. She had the digital to document the scene but every time she focused a shot, they got wise. \n\n (3) Lastly, I\u2019ll say that we do Social Stories with Fluffy, a tool developed by  Carol Gray  to help with difficult situations. We wrote one about kids suddenly appearing at our front door and/or the gate in the yard, asking to play or simply dropping by to say hello. The sudden invasion of space and unpredictability is scary and unsettling for Fluffy. He usually races to the door, slams it, and yells, GO AWAY. Our story, entitled, Sometimes People Come Over, included a few  new  things he might say when he doesn\u2019t feel like playing, like,  Thanks for coming over but I don\u2019t feel like playing today. Maybe another day. \n\n We haven't read this story is ages and ages but last week, I took him to the park to fly his glider and it wasn't long before random kids arrived and scattered like a seed pod exploding. One boy drifted over to get a closer look at the plane and Fluffy looked up. You could see the wheels turning, reaching back through stills in his mind until he found the one he needed.  Thanks for coming over,  he said,  but I don\u2019t feel like playing. Maybe another day.  I was so proud of him for remembering this on his own and trying it out in real life. I wish the boy had said,  Okay.   Thanks for sharing!  and skipped off to the swings but real life doesn't always go like the books parents write for their children and he stayed right where he was. Fluffy hung in there and tried to say it a few more times in a few different ways but it wasn't until he got to,  I SAID, I DON'T WANT TO PLAY! GO AWAY,  that the other boy got the message and flew off. \n\n I guess sometimes, that's what it takes.  \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thegraycenter.org/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/09/teetering_.html", "title": "Focusing"},

That parents will discover their child is on the spectrum earlier and earlier and all kinds of treatment options will be clear, available, and encouraging. \n\n Fluffy has progressed so much since we began 'treatment' in January.

The diagnosis protects us in the school system, should we decide to go that route, pressing the stubborn and outdated to stretch their understanding, challenge some of the education system's 'austistic' tendencies to keep everything the same, to not rock the boat, to not shift the paradigm. But the only question that concerns me, and every other parent I've met with a special needs child is, what are the deficits and what can we do about them? \n\n Every child is different.

I started and he elaborated and changed it, but his changing felt so much more about creating together and not about control. I said, the aliens (bad guys) shoot lasers that make whatever they hit explode. He said,  the good guys shoot guns that destroy the lasers, and then make the aliens explode.  Then he said,  no, wait! I changed my mind. How about the good guys shoot guns that make the aliens \u2018slowly dissolve\u2019?  and he said this v-e-r-y\u00a0 s-l-o-w-l-y and drawn out. So cute!

I stuffed that huge stroller into the car and we schlepped it along with half the household to the beach and when it was time to walk, Fluffy climbed in and my mom, Dave, and I set out.  \n\n It took a while and Fluffy got out about 6 times to do some running but he never ran too far ahead and whenever he heard us call him back, he came. Progress. We finally got to the end and A. was there and even though our arms were practically touching, I wanted to pretend I didn't see her because it\u2019s always the same thing and I didn\u2019t have the heart for it. It\u2019s always, \" heeeeeey giiiirrrrrrl! hey sexy momaaaaaaa! right on wooooomannnnnnnn! how\u2019s it goooooing?\"  and I am all fine fine we\u2019re fine. These days, it\u2019s finally really TRUE because even though Fluffy still has Asperger\u2019s and we are still working hard to give him what he needs, there is this shift taking place that has brung hope and clarity and calm.  \n\n She and I had our boys in the same preschool program last fall and we were sort of friends, the sort of friends you make with someone you meet in the playground and at a friend\u2019s kid\u2019s birthday party and it feels like you really could be friends and you really might click but young children and time restraints keeps schedules from coinciding, naps and no naps and husbands going out of town and then she had her second pregnancy like every other mommy friend I made since moving here pregnant with Fluffy, every one of them has had the second kid. On cue. So she always acted like it would be great to get together,  far out  and all, but then it was clear that Fluffy was not adjusting well to school and then he had to leave and then she must have heard since I know all the parents were told and it was months before she called to say,  oh womannnn, fish oil, man, it is some amazing stuff . but that was all.  \n\n So each time I see her, every 4 months, it\u2019s always the same and here she was on the beach with her two boys and her uber husband and dave was in the water with Fluffy and I was chatting with my mom, trying to adjust my body so that we might find a way not to go through it but then we did. and then we said, oh hi! what an incredible day! happy 4th of july! Soon her husband emerged from the water and her two blond blond boys were climbing on him and it was time for them to load up their new boat and putt putt back down the river and back to their enormous house with pottery barn couches on wooden decks under graceful cover, and park-like back yard.  \n\n Seconds after they left, Fluffy emerged with Dave and began screaming about how itchy he was and lo and behold, his left leg was swollen and red and splotchy and Dave told me they had seen a jelly fish and that it had brushed by him but really, in fact, what happened was it had STUNG him and he got more hysterical with snot rivers and panic in his eyes and we walked down to the fancy private club, in front of all the members who arrive at the beach every day with their fashion magazines and sunglasses in manicured hands, calling behind them as they stride toward the shore,  Towel! Beach chair! Drink! Rub down!  where someone in First Aid applied insect bite ointment and a snap crack ice pack. By the time we made it back to our towels, after stopping many times along the way, he had healed. And soon began digging in the sand and peeing in his pants and onto the blanket. This, after already pooping in his bathing suit.

I scooted him away and out into the exhibits, which were, clearly, already over stimulating. I turned my attention to the stroller to pack us up for the ride home. When I looked up, he was gone, only the heel of his sandals were visible for a split second and then disappeared behind the bathroom door. He was at that thing again. Like it was his vocation.

It is some elaborate Booby Trap that he constructs out of rope; often sprinkler devices are set to hang down and about like native american prayer flags. This is how he plays outside. When he is not constructing booby traps on the back gate, he is busy securing a climbers clip or whatever those things are called, to the latch on the front gates, because, as he said to me recently,  Mom, I\u2019m the kind of personality that doesn\u2019t like anyone to come over.  \n\n One day, I trust, that will not be the case. But for now, it is. Because for him, the coming over of people, especially kids, is fraught with uncertainty and discomfort, maybe even a full-on emergency. Kids on the spectrum can\u2019t process all the information that comes from human interaction as one unit, like we can. It all comes in on separate lines. Each expression, each facial part as it moves with lightening speed from one position or nuance to the other, the way the leaves are moving in the background as the wind blows through, the sound of cars driving by in the street behind him, whole body gestures are most likely coming across as a veritable assault of movement, then there is the sound and the words being spoken. They don\u2019t have the ability to assign importance to the stimuli and information. It all comes in at equal weight. Can you imagine? \n\n The other night I was talking about how, one day, we might move to a new place. I was trying to simply describe the difference between the city and the country and then the in-between, saying, lots of people live in a small space in the city, few people live ina big space in the country, and we now live in the middle, where a medium amount of people live in a medium amount of space.

{"date": "August 06, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Family portrait on the beach, 2001. Taken by the long arm of Dave. \n\n \n\n Fluffy started body surfing last week! The waves have been fairly\ncalm and he's been diving in and going for a ride. It's so exciting to\nwatch him experiment with the water, to really feel the power of it and\nthe way he needs to adjust and compensate. \n\n We've been trying to incorporate RDI into all activities and so I\ndecided to work on the Master/Apprentice relationship right then, as he\nwas riding the waves. It was really a struggle at first. This was so\nnew to him and he was reveling in his own newly acquired skill. He\nwanted to be UNENCUMBERED. I held firm as the one in charge, friendly\nbut firm. And he did beautifully.  \n\n He referenced me and the waves; he positioned his body to catch the\nwave, leaping up and then letting the water take him; he navigated,\nadjusted, adapted to all the movement of the water. When the wave was\ntoo big for him I would call out \u201chand holder\u201d and he would come hold\nmy hand. When he went to far I would say, come back and he would.\nSometimes, as a wave came, he would look to it, look to me, and if it\nwas too big, I would frown and hold out my hand. If it was okay, I\nwould smile and nod my head vigorously and he would turn his attention\nback to water and dive in.He wanted to see that I was watching and delighted in my delight of\nhim, and felt SO PROUD OF HIMSELF and saw that I was proud--Mama Mama\ntoo since she was there and also cheering him on and coaching some.  \n So, good Master/Apprentice, good Referencing, good Experience Sharing, good Regulating. He was\nexperiencing such competence. It was wonderful and so encouraging since\nthe beach is a place of much distraction and usually where he is so highly\nengrossed in the sensory experience, he isn't available for much interacting.  \n \n We also did some sand play that worked well--building a castle together. I got the bucket of water, but we did all the rest together: we dug the hole together, we\npoured the bucket of water in the hole together, we mixed it with more\nsand together, we filled up the bucket with wet sand together, we\ndumped it out on the sand together. But before we pulled the bucket up,\nI patted the top three times (pat pat pat) and looked at him; he\nrepeated my pattern. Then I patted the sides the same way. pat pat pat\nand he repeated this. We did this, without words, back and forth about\n6 times. i added variation, but too late I think and he lost interest.\nNo matter. Little by little. We overturned the bucket together to\nreveal our castle and gave each other a high five. \n \n\n \nI need to introduce variation right away. It's funny that our\nkids seek certainty to feel safe and in control, but we need to bring\nin variation from the very start, to introduce slight differences, all\nin the context of a regulatory\u00a0 pattern with a safe, dependable\n\"Master\" or guide, in order to help them open up, allow for, and then\neven desire, uncertainty. So much of current understanding of autism\nwould stress the importance, and even necessity of following strict\nroutines.

I figured, at the very least, I could paste in the photo and jot down the first thing that came to mind. I didn't copy the dates.

He also LOVES figures of speech and often cracks up long before he even knows what you mean when you say, for example, I could really go for a grape. Once he gets it, he immediately incorporates it into his own idiomary. I know. That's not a word. But this is my blog and I can write what I want. La la. \n\n When I was a kid, I wanted to be in the circus. I wanted to be an acrobat or a fly on the trapeze, get shot out of a cannon, be catapulted into the air.  \n\n We went to the Big Apple Circus last month and loved it. It was crowded and dark and booming with live music; Fluffy was mesmerized. He took it all in, wanting to stay until the very last so he could see everything. There were horses and spinning dogs, cats that climbed 30 foot poles and then leapt down onto a red plush cushion, birds walked on wires, humans catapulting through the air. A man tossed a ceramic planter in the air--big enough for a tree; it landed his head where it balanced and then twirled in circles.  \n\n Fluffy devoured cotton candy at intermission with a reverent expression. what is this magic blue packing material that instantly melts in my mouth? When we got home, he climbed and jumped off every surface in the house, asking,  why do they make it look easy when it is actually hard? WHY?  punctuating the word hard with a thrusted fist and emphatic voice.\u00a0  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/08/why_do_they_mak.html", "title": "Why Do They Make it Look Easy When it is Actually Hard?"},

Eat most anything else but go easy on the sausage & bacon and fruits. Berries are A-okay. If you cheat a bit, DON'T ABANDON SHIP. Climb back aboard and continue as if the slip didn't happen.

Why? Why did we move back here? Because it was the only way we could afford a house and make a baby, apparently. We tried and tried for both things while in California, sunny warm California with the rolling hills and steep ocean cliffs and foggy mornings and cool bugless nights. No house. No baby. The IVF attempt in the upscale Marin County office was a bust--maximum fertility doses yielded 2 tired follicles, one of which refused to fertilize; she just slammed and locked the door and stayed up eating potato chips and watching bad tv in her lime-green face mask. So, the single embryo was implanted with all hopes low, and rightly so. No baby.

MASSAGE MY PENIS RIGHT NOW AND THEN KISS IT! for days afterward, in the supermarket, in the park, from the front porch. \n\n We put him on antibiotics and then went for a follow-up ultrasound. We saw his left kidney, beautiful, looking just like a chile bean. They continued to drive the goo-laden probe around on his side and back, looking and looking for the matching one on the right. After a long while, the technician left the room and someone else took her place. A pinch-prober. He finally found Fluffy\u2019s right kidney in the center of his abdomen, right under his belly button. It never ascended. Could be nothing, they said. I thought about the Lorrie Moore story, \u201cPeople Like That Are The Only People Here\u201d about the discovery of a rare form of kidney tumor on her toddler child. I felt sick. \n\n They wanted us to subject him to a frightening and invasive test to find out if he had some floppy valve problem that was sending urine back up the ureters into his kidney, but we said no. It would have involved starving him and then a trip to the scarey hospital where they would strap him down, insert a tube with into his penis, pump dye through that tube until his bladder was full and then watch his system on the screen to see what would happen to the valves. Geez, that sounds exceedingly painful, I said. Well, it\u2019s uncomfortable, they said. OH. UNCOMFORTABLE. I see, like hurling this chair at your head? Or, perhaps, inserting my arm into your nostril?\u00a0  \n\n We took the wait and see approach. We had the local hospital lab on stand-by. We stocked our medicine cabinet with sterile urine collection tubes. We had a prescription for antibiotics ready to be filled in an instant. We were ready to start the cascade of actions in motion any time Fluffy got a fever or clutched his groin in discomfort, anytime his pee took on a foul odor or cloudy appearance. For a year. It never happened. At the follow-up ultrasound, the Pediatric Urologist pronounced his kidneys healthy. Both of them. And we climbed down the look-out for UTI watch. That was well over a year ago. \n\n So, Fluffy has a pelvic kidney. A beautiful, healthy pelvic kidney.

Sure, he screams OW when I brush by him and he rivals my mom with the noises that emerge from that nose of his: the honking! the sneezing! the sniffling! the flushing of the sinuses with that plastic nose hose which, as he says, IS truly impossible to use and look cool at the same time. But he is a riot and a fantastic, devoted dad and makes beautiful quirky children\u2019s books and has a truly courageous and resilient heart.

And\ndragging it to the beach by the raging river as the tide came rushing\nback in, pounding against the upgrade? Having never even seen a surf\nkayak or watched anyone take a wave, read a book, seen a video, dvd, or\neven watched it on Oprah? It was uncharacteristically macho (hi\nhoney!!) of him and even though I applauded his pluck, I was a\nTINIEST bit irritated by his sighs and grunts, the dragging of his club\nfoot around the kitchen, as he tried in vain to butter toast with his nose. It felt, oh, I don\u2019t know, a little overdone? \n\n \nBut that\u2019s just me. I mean, tonight, at around, say 2 am, he\u2019ll be\nsoundly asleep in our cozy bed, ceiling fan whirring above him, ten\npillows stacked just so, supporting his shoulder and arm, while I am poking out at the keyboard with my cramped and shaking fingers,  hi! it\u2019s 2\nam. goodbye. see you in 30 minutes!  or something equally HYSTERICAL. In other words, Dave isn\u2019t going to be burning the midnight oil during\nhis annual Cartoonathon anytime soon.    \n\n \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/08/because.html", "title": "Blogathon 2005 Has Begun!

I'm thinking of doing this  blogathon 2005 \u00a0 to help raise money for some aspect of autism/asperger research (Cure Autism Now or The Autism Project) or to help individual families interested in RDI pay for the RDA since I believe whole-heartedly in the work done over at the  Connections Center  and I want to extend a hand to all the worried and exhausted families trudging out there in the tall grass of ASD treatment.  \n\n It's next Saturday. The overall goal of the 'thon' is to raise a poop-load of money for charity. I'll need sponsors. I'll let you know the charity and post a link for sponsoring me, and then post live every half hour starting at 9 am.

She\u2019s beautiful, funny, playful, hard working, openhearted, and fiercely devoted to her son and all good causes. For reasons I cannot fathom, she is walking around this crazy mixed up world as a single woman and only parent to her super fantastic son. What\u2019s with the guys out there? Hello? She\u2019s right here! The bod, the brain, the heart, the soul!! Oiy. Anyway, she\u2019s been doing a bit of the on-line dating thing. I don\u2019t know anything about dating. I just move in on the first date. And then get dumped 11 years later and pick up the phone and call the guy I dated before I married the WRONG guy and start seeing him. We\u2019re celebrating our wedding anniversary today--been back together for almost 11 years now after an eleven and a half year break up.  So, what do I know? I\u2019m all: Hi! Wanna move in? I hear it\u2019s hard. It looks hard. I don\u2019t even like starting a new job where I don\u2019t know anything and have to sit awkwardly at the empty desk, trying to look assured and involved in a  very big thinking project , stride purposefully down the hall and do the mock, oh! I need that THING! turn around and march straight to the bathroom where I hide in the stall. Miss Daisy told her, he\u2019s coming. The good man is on his way. Mostly likely he\u2019s a Gemini. And so, a new single guy popped up in the Online Man Store, my sister said hi, and they chatted a bit. He passed the first test: operating the phone and forming thoughts into sentences. She liked his picture and found out he\u2019s a Gemini so they were good to go on the first date.  He IS a Gemini, but he\u2019s not the right Gemini. No chemistry, but my sister hung in there, since I said, hang in there. Even if you\u2019re NOT attracted to him, go against type, one time, what could it hurt? So, even though she was stifling yawns and feeling even a tad repulsed, she hung in there until his giant head swooped down with the darting kamakazee tongue. Ugh. I said, meekly, could you try one more date? Maybe something that you would do anyway, like a hike? You could lay down a few ground rules, look him in the eye and say,  We\u2019re hiking. That\u2019s it, okay gemini boy? Keep your slimey wet tongue inside your giant buffalo head. Let's go.  with \u00a0 a jovially slap to his shoulder. But then he called and blew it with some inappropriate line about sex. Guys, news flash: WE DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT YOUR BIG HARD DICKS AND WHAT THEY WANT. You are all so excited about your pulsing rods of manhood, so darn proud, holding them and smiling down like Lenny with the rabbits. You may think it\u2019s sexy to sneak a peek through a gal\u2019s blouse or between an uncrossed pair of summer legs, but if WE catch a sight of those hairy boys peeking out of your shorts, we scream like we're on the set of an Aliens remake. We are not, actually, turned on. We are afraid. Very afraid. When it comes to  your  boys and  our  arrousal, it's all about context and state of mind, if you know what I mean.  Why do I say all this? Because I\u2019m not dating but I am going to do something hard: the BLOGATHON. It will be hard to post something worth reading every 30 minutes for a whole 24 hours but I will give it my best shot. To Kim, Molliebee, Felicity, and Jane, I say THANK YOU, MY DEARS! Like my brave sister, apparently, none of you can say no to a good cause!  For anyone else who wants to come aboard, I say yipee and good for you and rah rah!!

He does all the typical things with them: repeatedly cracking them into each other, flying them through the air, capturing and killing the bad guys, making them all talk in deep throaty voices. Dave is much better at this sort of thing than me, having racked up countless hours of this kind of play as a kid. I don't know if it's a gender thing but I am so pathetic. I make everyone talk in the same stilted voice, I can't make the right noises. Dave looks over at me and shakes his head,  step aside, girlie. \n\n Action figures aside, I still rely on feminine hygiene products to buy me some extra time or entice Fluffy to get into the car. Right now (10:25) he's sitting on the living room rug, exploding an enemy panty liner while the good tampon shooter destroys the maxi launching pad. He knows an awful lot about these products.  Where do you put this, mommy?  he asks while holding up the thin pad.  When do you need the super fat one? What do you do with this shooter one?  My strategy, so far, has been to answer all the questions without actually answering them and without elaboration. You know, like our elected officials. \n\n  My answers: This goes on mommy's underwear. Sometimes I need the big one and sometimes I need the little one. The shooter one is different; it doesn't go on the underwear.  Where does it go?  It goes inside mommy.  Why?  Because ladies need them when they get old enough to have babies . Oh.    \n\n He just called me in to watch what happens when he tears the fat pad in mid-air,  see how it makes dust bunnies that are like confetti celebrating that the good guy penetrated the force field of the bad guy and destroyed him into smithereens! \n\n Yes!

{"date": "July 21, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Watching the race. July, 2005. \n\n Last night I was out until after midnight with some gals and while it wasn\u2019t a wild ruckus time, we  were  out walking and talking and mingling with the grown ups in the night air under the round milky orange moon, the kind that looks so close you start looking for the lucky person holding onto a big string. \n\n We walked and walked and walked and finally ended up at a martini bar where I ordered an ice tea. A regular ice tea. I\u2019m not against martinis as a rule, but I\u2019ve been feeling very geriatric and bloated and headachy lately and I knew that the drink would taste okay going down but then I would swell up and get dehydrated and my little fontanel would turn gray and suck in and begin to pulse, that is, if I were still an infant. Which I would soon become with the complaining and the leaning and shifting positions, trying to find a way to recline at the table. And then there would be the long walk back to the car when no one would agree to carry me.\u00a0 So, I had an ice tea and two sips of an espresso martini. \n\n We decided to walk the 5 miles back to the car by a new route, the residential, unlit route, blocks and blocks of it in our spikey Barbie shoes. And I felt vulnerable and a tad pathetic because I was worried that someone would leap out of the irises or hydrangea or hosta/scented geranium plantings which were really quite eye-catching in the moonlight. My friend Rosemary had her shoes off and I was playing a suburban version of West Side Story behind my eyes, us moms doing the crouch walk in sync, shoes heels jutting out of our hands menacingly like the Jets wielding their switchblades. \n\n And when I got home and checked in on my boys, I started thinking that everybody has a complicated life, they\u2019re dirt poor or can\u2019t have kids so they adopt beautiful babies with heart conditions, or they can\u2019t date or can\u2019t catch a break, or they live with aching loneliness, or in a construction site for 4 years while their elderly mom complains about having to use the toilet in the middle of the newly created hallway, or they have a husband who cheats or tunes them out, or their child\u2019s estranged father promises up and down that he\u2019ll be there this time, up and down, so much the child finally replaces the phone receiver and springs outside to tell all his friends, doing cartwheels and jumping jacks and mock punches, waiting outside on the front steps where he sits for hours and hours, watching every passing car as the sun goes down down down like his heart and hope and crumbling face.  \n\n Everybody wants to feel safe, home, competent, to be challenged, to make connections and discoveries, to see patterns, to feel understood, sought out, appreciated. Everybody. \n\n I\u2019m against pain. Yes, I know, pain provides opportunity for growth, the dark allows the light, there isn't one without the other, and a host of other sayings and truths about how our spirits are forged, the crucibles in life, the pressures that produce the diamonds, the gentle urgings to go into the darkness, don\u2019t brace against it, go into it, right into the center of it, like the pain during childbirth, move closer to it, like the stretch in yoga, okay yes, yes. But is it really the best system? I mean, would we not grow AT ALL if we didn\u2019t have to endure terrifying pain? The emotional, spiritual pain, not physical pain, though while we\u2019re on the subject, I\u2019m against that pain as well. I guess it\u2019s the body\u2019s way of letting us know something is wrong, but isn\u2019t  that  a failed system? I mean, how many people are robustly dancing throughout their lives, breathing deeply, eating well, loving themselves and those around them, only to discover at some tragic later date that a tumor the size of a couch has angrily greedily insidiously devoured and scorched acres of healthy tissue and cells? \n\n I\u2019ve been taking a hot yoga class with the most wonderful teacher who, instead of going around the room correcting our postures, tucking in butts and shoving down shoulders, simply reminds us to listen to our bodies and create mindful intentions. I do a lot of panting and slipping along my purple mat \u00e1 la Lucille Ball, hoping that I don\u2019t release a booming fart into the silence and wondering how in the world the woman next to me can be wearing LONG BLACK PANTS. I pause in the 300th downward dog, my beet red face sending a steady rain of sweat to the mat below, my cottage cheese thighs\u00a0 quivering in the rising heat of the room, and every so often I feel a swell of love and gratitude and free floating forgiveness. Is it near the toxic carbon dioxide levels? Is it relief that my errant boob hasn't slipped out of my top and collapsed my windpipe? Or is it another tiny moment of remembering that we are all in this together, this being human thing, this predicatment of flawed selves and the need for forgiveness.  \n\n That, and a pair of spikey heels.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/07/_watching_the_g.html", "title": "That and a Pair of Spikey Heels"},

I think it\u2019s been going on for a while, ever since this guy took office after  not actually being elected . Didn't that just set the tone? That he could do exactly as he pleased and who could and would stop him?

But, there\u2019s no proving it now. No paper trail. Can\u2019t find out. Oh well. Guess we\u2019ll just have to believe them. Like my neighbor across the street who told me in all earnestness that she\u2019s going to leave the running of the country up to the people in Washington because they certainly know what they\u2019re doing. She\u2019s just going to trust them, she said, wringing her hands just after she called back into the house,  honey? what are we? are we republicans or democrats?  \n\n Let\u2019s throw up our hands and our rights and our future and our environment and, I guess, also many of our own lives because our President needs the big\u00a0 pat on the back from his daddy and doesn\u2019t seem to mind that he wipes his brow from a cloth dipped in the blood of\u00a0 America\u2019s youth. Not to mention the devastation he is causing in Iraq and the many hundreds upon thousands of men, women, and children killed. Let\u2019s also find a place to open a prison where we can torture people in secret without any provocation and representation, in some cases, for years, all outside the law. And sow the seeds of hatred in every corner of the world, creating more oppression, more terrorists, more isolation. Let\u2019s do all this, in the name of what, exactly? Texas? Because it\u2019s certainly not freedom.  \n\n I\u2019m thinking that this administration has the goods on a lot of people and they are using it to bully, threaten, and blackmail dissenters.

WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHEN WILL IT STOP? \n\n I think if you pulled back the lid on the white house you would see a roiling  infestation .

Did we not learn enough from the FAA? \n\n Why does it take less time to approve a vaccine than a shampoo for lice? \n\n Why do 'epidemics' and \"outbreaks\" occur, and are heavily reported in the press, just before a new vaccine is marketed? \n\n Why are vaccines mandated without proper safety studies? \n\n Why are a few weeks of follow-up considered adequate? \n\n Why do the vaccine manufacturers finance safety studies, when they are the very companies, which profit from sales? \n\n Why\ndo we have to prove a vaccine causes a problem when the\nmanufacturer--with all its might-- has no studies to prove that it does\nnot? \n\n Why do we have to give so many vaccines together when we know that they work better singly? \n\n Why do we rush to give combined live virus vaccines to children in the absence of epidemics? \n\n Why do we give them to such young and vulnerable children in such a short period of time? \n\n Why are we obligated to repeat a triple vaccine at the age of five, when we know that 95% of the recipients are already immune? \n\n Why don't we just get titers? \n\n Why do we have to invent a vaccine for every disease? \n\n Why do we suddenly have so many new immune diseases? \n\n Why are we seeing so many recurrent infections? \n\n Why doesn't anybody listen to parents and just consider the possibility that vaccines may cause autism? \n\n Why\nare thousands of children with autism less impressive than two hundred\nwith intussusception or 124 with vaccine induced paralytic polio? \n\n Why\ndo we think that Pokimon toys, infected ground beef, and rear gates of\nminivans deserve our immediate attention when we don't even look at the\npossibility that vaccines could induce autism? Aren't 54,000 cases of\nautism enough to merit a comprehensive and independent investigation? \n\n Why don't doctors know more about autism: its diagnosis, and its treatment? \n\n Why\ndoes my daughter, who is a headhunter, and not even a medical\nprofessional-know more about the subject than most of the medical\nestablishment? \n\n Why do HMOs have to dictate multiple and combined\nvaccinations? They'll tell you it is because parents may not bring\ntheir children back. That is absurd and they know it. Parents are\nindeed more likely to return for a visit if a shot is needed. They'll\ntell you it is because they want to spare the children the pain of\nrepeated injections. That is even more absurd. Show me any family of a\nchild with vaccine-induced autism who wouldn't have gladly returned to\nget one vaccine at a time. \n\n Why do policy groups which formulate\nvaccine schedules allow their members to sit on drug company boards?\nSuch a conflict of interest would never be allowed in business. \n\n Why do we allow anyone who owns drug company stocks to dictate vaccine policy? \n\n Why\ndo we repeatedly vaccinate women with live-virus vaccines when they\nfail to develop protective titers, or lose their immunity over and over\nagain? \n\n Why do we allow doctors to vaccinate women during pregnancy when it is totally contra-indicated? \n\n Why haven't we followed up on the 10,000 people who were included in the original rubella vaccine studies? \n\n Why\nare we giving a triple vaccine at 1 year of age, when just a few years\nago the authorities insisted that it should not be given a day before\nthe age of 15 months? \n\n Why don't we tell mothers it is because\nthe vaccine-induced immunity they are now giving their children is not\nas lasting as that their own mothers gave them following natural\ninfection? \n\n Why aren't people convinced that vaccines are safe? \n\n Why can't families who have doubts, have an option to request mono-valent vaccines? \n\n Why is the triple vaccine mentioned first to prevent the individual diseases of rubella, mumps and measles? \n\n Why\ndo the authorities continue to deny increases in autism, when every\nschool department is going bankrupt trying to educate afflicted\nchildren? \n\n Why is it that a lone, retired pediatrician can\nuncover more suspicious findings of a possible vaccine-autism\nconnection than the vaccine proponents and manufacturers, with all\ntheir power and money? \n\n Why did the Vaccine in Pregnancy Registry\nfail to find a single problem in 19 years? How did they manage to come\nup with a 0% complication result? Has there ever been any study\nanywhere with 0% results? \n\n Why did they only look at the Congenital Rubella Syndromes? Why didn't they even ask about developmental problems? Why did eleven mothers, in just four months, report overt problems with their children, some readily visible at birth? \n\n Why did our vaccine officials endorse Dr. Brent Taylor's findings? Why didn't they question his methodology and his results? Why has he refused to show us his data? \n\n Why,\nwith all the fury about a possible vaccine link, was no blood drawn for\ntiters and Myelin Basic Protein Antibodies testing during the\ninvestigation of a NJ outbreak? \n\n Why haven't the authorities been listening to our plea to look at autism as another disease to be stamped out? Is it because they are afraid of what they may find? Is it because vaccines represent a $2 billion industry annually? Is it because vaccines are BIG BUSINESS? \n\n Why\nare moneys from the vaccine compensation programs not being disbursed\nto the deserving children. What more do you need to prove? \n\n Why are safer vaccination schedules not implemented now that there are no outbreaks? \n\n Why take such risk when there is no real danger? \n\n Why and why and why? \n\n An\nentire generation of children is being needlessly damaged. Their\nfamilies will never be the same again. America is staring down the\nbarrel of a multi-billion dollar, decades-long program to help children\nwith autism. \n\n These are terrible and ugly truths. \n\n These are unworthy and despicable truths in a country such as the United States of America. \n\n Within\nwalking distance from here are memorials that pay tribute to victims of\nhorrible and unavoidable wars. Our autism war is totally avoidable. \n\n I\ncame to this country in 1957, with the belief that America is the land\nof freedom and justice. On the topic of autism, justice has not been\nserved.

I am on time, I am in the front room where I wait alone and wonder, why am I waiting when no one is here? And the lady behind the glass window opens it a crack to ask, has anything changed since the last time you were here? and I think  WHY YES! My son has asperger\u2019s and several friends left me in a ditch by the side of the road, calling behind them, \u2018good luck with that autism thing!!!\u201d and menopause is lurking but we do have a lovely dining room now since the addition.  But I don\u2019t think she really means that, she just wants my insurance card which she takes and then quickly slides the window closed again. Couldn\u2019t she just keep it open during our exchange? Is the air foul out here in the waiting room? Is the glass bullet proof? soundproof? Are they discussing various vaginas of the clients in and out all day long? \n\n And then I am in the little pink room with the blasting AC and the tiny nurse woman who weighs me and takes my blood pressure and I wonder, how can she manage this? this being, so miniature she comes up to my ankle? I try not to stare as she lugs that cuff and tubing, jumping up and down on the pumper in order to inflate and squeeze squeeze squeeze my arm. Afterward, she hands me the paper outfit and assures me that the doctor will be right in. And then more waiting. And waiting. And nothing good to read and nowhere terribly comfortable to recline or sit. I wander around, opening cabinet doors, studying the pap smear kit, listen to my own heart with the stethoscope, attempt to take my own blood pressure only to rip open the velcro and toss it to the floor in a full on panic as the band nearly severs my arm into two pink sausages.  \n\n Still more waiting. \n\n Hello? Hello? I check the cell phone, 25 minutes have gone by. I wrap myself in my pink and white paper dress and walk out in the hallway. The tiny nurse looks up with a candyland smile, \u201cLooking for the bathroom, dear?\u201d  Ah, no. I\u2019m wondering if I should sign a lease or something because I\u2019ve been in that tiny room for like A FUCKING HALF AN HOUR AND WHERE\u2019S THE DOCTOR?   I do use the bathroom because my bladder is old and weak and when I come back the doctor is still not there, I am livid.  \n\n She finally sails in 10 minutes later and tosses off cavalierly,  thanks for waiting!  sits across from me and asks, how am I? Am I having any problems? Is there anything that\u2019s bothering me that I\u2019d like to bring up? \n\n Yeah, how \u2018bout, what the fuck is up with the waiting? Where could you possibly have been all this time since you routinely spend about 5 minutes with each patient and absolutely no one was in the waiting room when I was there, about 5 hours ago when I got here? How \u2018bout, from now on, if I have to wait more than 15 minutes, the appointment is automatically canceled for the day and I charge YOU for MY time? HOW ABOUT THAT? Because unless someone just gave birth prematurely to quintuplets through their nose, or your scheduling is done by chickens pecking away at a keyboard littered with feed, you and your kind here have some explaining to do and some compensations to make.

July, 2005. \n\n I\u2019ve been trying to help Fluffy with the perfectionism, the perfectionism that prevents him from doing things he may not do expertly his first attempt. It\u2019s a pretty common AS thing, and one of the approaches is to highlight my own failed attempts with good cheer, pointing out the mistakes I make during the day.  Boy! mommy must have made about three billion mistakes today! I guess I must have learned a lot! No one learns anything unless they make a bunch of mistakes!  We have \u201cbackwards\u201d games, rolling down the window while trying to roll it up, putting my socks on over my shoes, playing a game called \u2018miss the ball\u2019, forgetting how to write the letter \u2018P\u2019.  \n\n It turns out that he\u2019s getting the hang of it. At least, the Mommy as incompetent boob part. He gleefully points out all my mistakes now, even the ones I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t make, like telling him the lady makes the sperm. \n\n He\u2019s gotten that you need a man and a lady to make a baby, that a sperm and an egg come together, that this happens inside the mommy where the baby grows until he/she is ready to come out. But, up until a week ago, he never asked how the sperm  gets inside  the mommy to the egg, or exactly who provides what.  \n\n I answered his questions without a bunch of elaboration, not because there is anything wrong with the elaboration but because, growing up, I essentially got the Hite Report anytime I came even close to the subject. I would barely get the words out,  Mommy does a boy... ?  when she would launch into GREAT detail about the PEnis and the vaGIna and the OVaries and the TESTicles and BREASTS BREASTS BREASTS as I ran screaming from the room. \n\n So I try to keep it simple with Fluffy--answer the questions, use the right words, be available for follow-up. He takes it all in matter of factly, a little like he takes in death, which I hope is good news and not about some Asperger\u2019s-related detachment so he\u2019ll be spared the death panic that has haunted me for decades.  \n\n Mid-way through bbq tonight, he announced,  I will always give you\nthe crispy part of the meat since you love it so much. When I am fully\ngrown, after my sperm has met with a lady's egg, I will have your\ngrandchildren send you the blackest part of the meat in a letter so that\nyou will always have the part that you love.  \n\n\n\n What a guy. Burnt meat chunks delivered through the post. Pure love. \n\n Even if the Y chromosome really does only contribute a tendency to leave poopie undies on TOP of the hamper lid, I'm darn glad this one found its way into my egg.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/07/ive_.html", "title": "I'm pretty sure I didn't say the lady makes the sperm"},

I am through it. No, not the whole thing, but I have stepped over a critical threshold, I have taken off the heavy coat, I am on the other side, and any other metaphor you want to toss my way. Go on, toss it over! It really is true that things don\u2019t just fall in your lap, plop, and either you embrace it or slap it off as fast as you can or try your level best to ignore it and hope it goes away. Okay, maybe that happens a little with somethings, but that\u2019s not how my lap works. My lap is attached to my body that, from time to time, gets tossed into the dark, the storm, the tall grass, the  something  and there I am, eyes wide, mouth agape-- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?  And the only way out is through.  \n\n I know. Quickly usher me towards the cow killing machine that Temple Grandin designed. How can I be so corny and trite? Because I am  that  good, kids. I am a child of the therapy couch and the metal folding chairs in the rooms where people are all coming to believe things. I am the child of the mom who told me to BE THE HEADACHE and WHAT IS THE HEADACHE SAYING when I was all of 10 and tempted to say,  listen, you in the flat hair and white lipstick, just hand over the johnson's baby aspirin or I burn the Merimekko.  I am the child who owned a small pair of batakas and perhaps the very first inflatable Bo Bo, the punching clown. See how happy he is! Hit him again!  \n\n Fluffy has AS and I don\u2019t care.\u00a0  \n\n No, no! Of course, I CARE. But not in that old way. Fluffy has HFA (high functioning autism). He has ASD (autism spectrum disorder). He is BBCWIA (beautiful boy child whom I adore) and will continue to parent. Only, the parenting will look a little different than kids WAOTAS (who aren\u2019t on the autism spectrum). That\u2019s all. \n\n It\u2019s pretty hands on. But I\u2019m game. \n\n The RDI workshop in Boston was such a shot in the arm. I loved it. I felt inspired and moved and hopeful. The timing was perfect as it came on the heels on my own acceptance and releasing. As if I finally exhaled after the sharp inhalation last fall.  \n\n So, we are living the RDI lifestyle. And continuing with brushing, and social stories, and neurofeedback, and floortime play, and GFCF diet, and supplements, and digestive enzymes, and OT/Speech therapy, and, the very pivotal painting of the nails. Dave was aghast but I say, hey, he wants to have pretty nails like his mommy.  \n\n RDI, check, nail polish, check, light saber, check; we are good to go. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/07/hes_good_to_go.html", "title": "Good To Go"},

{"date": "July 31, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy: June, 2001. \"Did you cue the music, mom?\" \n\n Wha..? Is it Sunday already? Is the Big Man doing speed? Has mother earth become a crack-head? What\u2019s with the time? Is anyone else out there sort of reeling from this? A couple of minutes ago we were gingerly stepping into May and now we\u2019re headlong into August.  \n\n Okay! Well, we\u2019re doing the RDA, relationship development assessment and may I say, that Miss Daisy, the psychic, is one sharp cookie, with her sideways looks and spirit guide gabbing because this is exactly the right thing for Fluffy. Our RDI consultant, L., is amazing. Dave and I spent session 2 sitting in the dark, staring through the magic mirror as she played games with our son, using the most relaxed, friendly sort of firm focus that I have ever seen. I tried it out myself the day after we got home and it worked like a charm. And then it fell apart. \n\n No, not really. It\u2019s just that we are embarking on this RDI at a deeper level now and some of the rules are changing and Fluffy knows it and is none too happy. We\u2019re not wielding whips or checking off drill charts but there is a subtle shift of control now as we begin to lay the foundation for his eventual freedom. And the name of the game is: establishing the Master/Apprentice relationship. This is key. Without this, you might as well break out the ice pick and slam it into my brain because that is the only way I would be able to go on and on and on and on discussing the various properties, characteristics, and differences of public bathroom toilet paper dispensers in between bouts of  through the looking glass  battles between good guys and bad guys fashioned out of torn and sticky bits of my feminine hygiene products.  \n\n But more than that--it\u2019s about him learning how to operate with confidence in the dynamic systems of social interactions, rather than cling to the static world of his own invention in order to maintain a sense of safety and control. That is what he has created over the last four years or so. And I\u2019ve got to hand it to him--him and every other kid on the spectrum because it is no small task. They have worked so hard to make sense out of\u00a0 their world and in the process, used enormous energy and creativity and resourcefulness. Maybe they\u2019re lining up their toys or making exhaustive surveys of oscillating fans or running in circles while they flap their hands in front of their faces, but it\u2019s all the same: designed for maximum control and minimum uncertainty. Because the developmental pathway of a child on the spectrum begins its deviant course before the first year, by 18 months, they are effectively miles away, searching out certainty while their typical peers have already gotten that novelty is where it\u2019s at because they have already achieved a level of competence and confidence in their own ability to master the challenge. And if they can\u2019t, they know they can look to the adult on the scene who will more than likely, steer them toward success. \n\n That is the difference. The autistic child doesn\u2019t know that. They don\u2019t know that when the going gets tough, the Go To guy or gal is right there, trying to keep them from careening into a truck, or their neighbor, to get a straight answer or maybe just to  get a word in edgewise . \n\n The very first lesson to learn is that Mommy and Daddy are the Masters and dear Fluffy is the Apprentice. He must cede the authority and control to us, learn to trust us to guide him through uncertain territory, little by little, to help him gain mastery, leading to a greater and greater feeling of competence. That is what he and every other child on the spectrum lacks--the feeling of competence. And that is the great motivator, for everyone, the drive to feel competent.  \n\n That is what I want for Fluffy, the self confidence that comes from knowing he can handle uncertainty, that he can enter any situation, no matter how unpredictable, and have the resources to deal with it.  \n\n Up until now, Fluffy\u2019s feeling of mastery, aside from information exchange and recall, words, math, computers, and magnatiles, has come from changing the rules and collapsing into a kind of drunken chaos or misbehavior when confronted with doing something hard and confusing like playing with other kids; Or from going limp like he\u2019s leading an antiwar rally and I am the fuzz intent on carrying him to the paddy wagon when I'm merely asking for help with some simple household task, like sweeping up or throwing something away or fishing his underpants out of the toilet; or from scribbling on the wall with his pencil, newly sharpened beyond the point of a bayonet, and then crashing into the couch where the force of his landing plants the pencil lead into the side of his neck.  \n\n That first lesson is going to be fun for the whole darn family.   \n\n Actually, I think it\u2019s going to be a rather long couple of weeks, but once we make it over the hump and accumulate enough energy of activation, Fluffy, my friends, is going to  fly. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/07/gathering_the_e.html", "title": "The Energy of Activation"},
{"date": "July 02, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Flying back to the feeder. Today. \n\n You know what happened? At first, what we were going through was so stressful and scary and I had such grief and desperation in my heart that I wrote to keep myself from sinking into resentment and bitterness. I don\u2019t feel quite that way anymore. I am feeling more hopeful, more accepting. There has been some easing up. Now I am writing from a place of calmer seas but still no land in sight. That\u2019s what it feels like; sorry for the corny metaphor. \n\n I was on the stormy sea, the wind and water wild around me, on that top pole, crazy with fear and grief, feeling alone in it, my friends disbelieving or scared off or simply seeing it as no big deal, like finding out your kid isn\u2019t athletic if you always dreamed of tossing the pigskin around together in the front yard.  Yeah, our kids are never quite who we think they are going to be,  I\u2019ve been told with a shake of the head and a shoulder squeeze. Ah, no. That\u2019s not what I was talking about. But I can\u2019t keep saying this to people. They are either going to get it or not. They are either going to want to hear about it or not. They are either going to be honest, or not. So, I sat up on that pole and screamed into the wind and rain and dark night sky,  mother fucker I am getting through this,  and now I\u2019m on the other side and there\u2019s no need to be up on the pole. Oh. Hello. I guess I can come down now. Dave and Fluffy and I are in our little boat at sea, we have a few ocean charts and I think I can trust them. A couple of people have come along port-side in their dinghies and tossed up a rope. And we can now see other boats out there. Ahoy! \n\n What would I have done differently had I known what I now know? What would I tell other first-time parents were the early warning signs? I don't have it down that way and I don\u2019t know if I could since all ASD presents itself so individually. No two Asperger kids are alike. But I would say, if your child is colicky and has trouble napping; if your child speaks in 3-word sentences and knows his colors by 15 months, knows all his numbers and letters before the age of 2, and has a more than passing obsession with light switches at 9 months; if he can walk on his own at an early age but prefers to reach for your fingers since it means he can access objects of fascination more efficiently; if he shows no interest in other kids and never flirts with strangers; if he positively never says hello to anyone outside of close family members; if he cries inconsolably while making 5 attempts to say goodnight to a small gathering; if he is and always has been a terrible sleeper; if he doesn\u2019t wrap his legs tightly around you when you hold him on your hip; if he has night terrors before the age of 1; if he shows no fear in the great wild ocean; if he isn\u2019t a cuddler but needs to be held A LOT; if he loves computers and can navigate with the mouse like a champ, answering prompts, clicking files open and closed, at the age of 2; if other than this, he looks at you, shows you things he likes or wants, plays peek-a-boo, and seems otherwise normal except for being a high high higher than high needs guy; if he has certain mild quirks and eccentricities but, hey, everybody does! and nobody notices anything but you, as the mom, feel stunned and overwhelmed by how hard parenting is, much harder than you ever imagined it could be, harder than anyone else that you hang out with or talk to about parenting; than I would take your child to be evaluated by someone you trust. Someone who knows. Someone who\u2019s seen a HUGE number of high functioning autistic kids. Maybe an RDI consultant. Maybe a Floortime expert. Maybe a developmental pediatrician who specializes in this neurodevelopment disorder. \n\n Why? Because you can start giving them what they need right away. Because the brain is most plastic at early ages. Because it\u2019s possible to return to where they fell off the typical developmental track and help them back on, little by little, so they can make sense of this world, so they can feel safe, so they can gain mastery in the most important arena there is: the world of social interaction. \n\n Are we over diagnosing our children? Is everything falling under the heading of Autism Spectrum Disorder? Or ADD? ADHD? If we are rushing to drug our kids because they aren\u2019t cleaning up their room fast enough or pass off their care to professionals because it\u2019s too damn much work, then we do have a problem. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. You know what\u2019s funny? I\u2019ve heard this from complaint from pediatricians (including our own), social workers, teachers, and others, but I will wager a bet none of these dissenters, these voices of concern and admonition, have a special needs kid. None. \n\n We have this wonderful bird feeder my sister-in-law,  Annie,  gave us for Christmas. It\u2019s suctioned to the dining room window so when we eat our meal, we can watch the birds eat theirs. Fluffy often forgets what is was saying, or what time of day it is, or what we did during the day, or whether what we are gathered to eat is breakfast or dinner, and so I told him thoughts are sometimes like the birds at the bird feeder, there one minute, off the next on a fluttery set of wings. Days later, we were talking about something and I asked, did he remember that? And he said,  Mommy, when I was little, there were only a few birds. Now there are so many birds in there, I can\u2019t find the one you are talking about .  \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s okay, sweetheart.

{"date": "July 06, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Tiny island off Florida coast, 2004. Taken by Dave. \n\n I don\u2019t think of myself as a violent person,  per se , but I sometimes have thoughts that streak across my mind and in response, I\u2019m like the dotty person in the audience who looks around anxiously every five seconds asking,  what was that?  It\u2019s like a few frames get spliced into the main mind reel and I get a split second visual that actually makes me gasp. Out loud. And then I have to shake my head like I\u2019m shaking off the pitch.  \n\n Usually it\u2019s a gruesome scene resulting from some freak occurrence. Or, it's me doing inexplicable things like when I worked in the lab at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and I had the impulse to slice myself in the eye with the razor blade or slam back a flask of radioactivity like a russian drunk, just slam it back and punctuate it all with a hearty, SVLAKECZ! Sometimes it\u2019s taking the oven roasted potatoes out of the oven with my bare hands, which, sadly, I\u2019ve attempted. \n\n Occasionally, it\u2019s when I am talking to someone, anyone. Could be a perfectly friendly conversation and I\u2019m mostly feeling fine and then I\u2019ll think, what if I shouted obscenities? or poked them in the eye, like one of the three stooges? or punched them in the nose? I mean, really? I would never DO it, of course, and I\u2019m not even saying I\u2019m harboring a lot of ill will or hostility. I\u2019m just saying that sometimes these things pop into my head. And because of that, I\u2019m thinking they must pop into everyone\u2019s head from time to time. And if so, then I think we are all doing a fantastic job out there with the self control.  \n\n Mostly, we\u2019re waiting our turn on line and navigating around carts in the grocery store; we\u2019re slowing down at the yellow lights and waving each other ahead at the 4-way stop; we\u2019re saying hi with a smile, adding something, usually about the weather or parenting, like  hey, what happened to summer?  or,  wow, how \u2018bout this fantastic day!  or  gee, I need to eat a pop in the nude!  har har.  \n\n When I lived in New York, I heard countless one-sided conversations by every manner of person walking, sitting, running, riding, weaving alongside me on the street, bus, subway. I always felt a little romantic about it, like, wow, what a relief! To have the filter completely off, or full, or cracked, or something because it just doesn\u2019t work anymore. Like when you can put on your pjs or unzip your pants after a big meal. I thought of them not so much as crazy but as tired and in a hurry, fitting in too much, conducting the bulk of their life out of the house because most of them lived in apartments the size of a closet, like I did. Next to the bitchy but talented hair dresser who won every poetry slam, and the heavy girl with glasses who slunk in and out with her jangling keys, and the slew of drag queens in silk kimonos and cold cream who got carried down the ladders by the big handsome firefighters the day the recording studio underneath me caught on fire.  \n\n\n\n I don\u2019t know. Today I took Fluffy to ride go carts. We stood in line with all the fathers and sons and Fluffy asked me,  how do you know who wins?  and I said,  oh, honey, it\u2019s not so much about who wins, it\u2019s just fun to zip around the track in those cars . And instantly, there was a chorus around me of all the guys, age 5 - 50 saying,  no no! It\u2019s definitely about who wins, that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s about!  And even though it really wasn\u2019t one of those moments when I lament the dog eat dog american competitive spirit forgetting to stop and smell the go cart gasoline, I did look over to one kid in line, clutching his ticket, with his pants belted up around his armpits. He was in his twenties and though bright and chatting intelligibly about the track and the cars, he was clearly, as  Bud's mom  would say, from France. As a group of carts zoomed past us, waiting our turn behind the chain-link fence, he smile widely and slapped himself, in rapid fire, on the head. And even though I sometimes drive half in the breakdown lane to thwart those trying to get around the traffic, most of the time I feel this big messy love for all of us here, trying to make sense of the scene, wanting to feel welcome and appreciated, wanting to laugh the loose, abandoned, falling down laugh more than once a year. \n\n What if we all were okay, just as we are? Fat, skinny, old, jiggly, clumsy, awkward, blunt, brilliant, dumb as stones? Keen, quick, uninformed, ambitious, anxious, bone tired? What if this really is our only shot, the one chance to tell the truth about what matters, if only to ourselves?  \n\n I don\u2019t know what this has to do with the violent thoughts, but as far as the filter goes, I\u2019m going to try using one that's loose enough to let the bulk of it in and the bulk of it out. And stand closer to the the flapping kid. And talk longer to the bag boy with his clothes on backwards. And offer a hand to the family who's child is flat on the ground in the dinosaur exhibit, hands pressed to both ears, screaming \"NO! NO! NO! GO BACK GO BACK!\" \n\n It\u2019s so crazy it might just work. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/06/vive-le-difference.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/07/benefit_of_the_.html", "title": "As We Are"},

Taken by Dave. \n\n The theory is that we\u2019re waking up parts of Fluffy\u2019s brain with the neurofeedback, special diet, and other therapies and he\u2019s shifting developmental gears. Since we\u2019re a bit delayed around here, he is now going through his \u201ctesting three\u2019s\u201d even though he is closing in on four and a half.  \n\n There is endless negotiating and drawing on the rug and catapulting full cups of water out of the bath; there is crawling on the table to swat at the glass pendant lights and standing outside on the deck, squirting streams of water into the house through the screen door ( but I AM outside! ). There is filling up the sink to overflowing and clamping down on the toothbrush like a mad dog. But the real Fluffy shines through and he\u2019s basically a reasonable, agreeable guy who has this innate fascination and respect for the rules. He is always saying things like,  Mommy, may you please drive us to the beach as fast as you can without breaking the law? \n\n So, today we went to the beach. And I drove as fast as I could without breaking the law. It was cloudy and threatened rain all day; we had the place to ourselves; just a couple bored lifeguards eating fistfuls of twizzlers with no one to see how well their red bikinis framed their belly rings. We raced around the sand and dashed into the waves and played an elaborate game of war between Ritaxis, the rhino king and Babar, the king of the elephants. It involved mounds of sand which were, in turns, the rhinos, the elephants, Ritaxis, Babar, bricks, bullets, and a monkey. I never knew what was going on, really, but Fluffy did and he kept me updated. \n\n When it was time to go, I loaded up the car and Fluffy climbed in, lingering suspiciously over the glove compartment. I thought maybe he was looking for tampons to dismantle and shoot, but in fact, he was scribbling wildly all over the seat and the beach bag with a black uniball pen. There is a lot of scooping him up and redirecting and picking our battles but there is also the old fashioned rule of consequences. I told him, okay, no video time today. And he said,  Mommy, that will not teach me anything. If you really want to teach me something then you should take away stories before bed because that is what I love most of all.

{"date": "June 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Washington, DC; March, 2003. Taken by Dave. \n\n Hi all! I know you all are doing your best to understand, and that some of you are struggling with your own version of this, or some other life challenge. Geez! Are you all ready to shoot me? Have I scared everybody off? I\u2019ve got my sister-in-law sewing my curtains, a friend calling to stress that,  of course she doesn\u2019t get it , but how are things going?\u00a0 Oh dear. Tee hee. I\u2019m feeling better today. I\u2019m off my soapbox for now. \n\n Okay, let me begin by saying, very emphatically, that I LOVE the kids I see in the waiting room at Dr. H.\u2019s, which is also the very same waiting room for neurofeedback--brain training, as we call it. One in the same. Dr. H.\u2019s office is passed reception and straight ahead. Brain training is a hard left.  \n\n We\u2019ve been training the brain a few months now on pretty much the same schedule. Just in the last few weeks, Fluffy allows the staff to settle him into the chair with the conducting goo and the electrodes, selecting the game he\u2019s going to \u201cplay\u201d, and helping him settle back down when he rockets off the chair and starts pulling out wires or discreetly pressing the single button that shuts the whole thing down. And in that time of sitting in the waiting room, I\u2019ve had the chance to chat with a couple other moms and watch the assortment of kids come and go.  \n\n Most of them are high functioning--Asperger\u2019s or PDD, a good handful are ADD or ADHD, some are both. Maybe toss in a bit of Tourettes. At four, Fluffy is one of the youngest, but there is another little guy who will be five in a month. The rest of the kids range from about 7 - 14. You would recognize these kids. You went to school with some of them. Wild girl, her hair strewn about, her shirt untucked, chewing her fingers while sprawling over three chairs, then off to build a tower then flopping onto the floor, then racing down the hall toward the room with all the bean bags. Skinny kid with a shock of wild kinky hair, t-shirt, game boy in his pocket. The clean and pressed, bespectled boy, folded over book after book. Young girl with straight hair brushed into her brilliant and slightly narrowed eyes, in pokeman t-shirt and shorts, pokeman cards tightly contained in her alert hand. \n\n Give me your geeky, your wild, your outcast, your brainy, your bookish. Gather then unto the waiting room of neurologists and psychologists.  \n\n It\u2019s a movie every day, but today, the whole cast of characters was there. Plus a couple neurotypical kids (NTs) in the temporary care of their grandmother.  \n\n Today was also a day of many tiny breakthroughs for my dearest Fluffy. One of which was  almost  parallel playing with these two little NT gals. He listened intently, which was huge, he stayed around, huge again, he asked a couple questions, HUGE HUGE HUGE, no matter that most of the conversation took place with him either under the chairs or the accompanying coffee table. There he was, an army of metal legs all around him, calling out his end of the conversation. I told Dr. L. about it, mentioning that conversing from beneath the furniture might begin to get a tad awkward around the teenage years to which he replied,  well, he\u2019s got a few years to improve . JOKING, DR. L.! \n\n I feel so at home in this room now. So at home with the girl who makes rickety block towers without looking; the boy who hastily covers his ears and says VOLUME! when the towers crash onto the table; the young man who wears shorts and a button up shirt with vest, sandles with long dark socks that match his long waxed mustache, the epee beneath his robin hood hat; the woman who shouts, WHAT IS HE? ASPERGERS? I REMEMBER MY MOM COULD NEVER KEEP MY SHOES ON EITHER. The skinny kid with a red frizzy fro who stares straight ahead. The 8 year-old who attends every pokeman conference and mutters  loser loser  to me whenever I say hi.  \n\n I just love those kids.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/06/i_love_those_ki.html", "title": "The Waiting Room"},
{"date": "June 21, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Living the RDI lifestyle; practicing Referencing. May, 2005. Taken by Dave. \n\n Last week I went to a support group and now I am quite sure I need to populate my life with a huge number of special needs families, where instead of exchanging information about our kids soccer coaches and easy playdates, we swap OT catalogues and tips on how to make a chewy necklace out of medical tubing and craft string so that our kids won\u2019t bite holes in our arms or snip off the dad\u2019s fingers while trying to brush teeth; where jokes about mishandled Social Stories actually crack us up and no one needs to explain why one of the most asinine and unhelpful things someone can do is express self-righteous outrage over high-strung parents\u2019 knee-jerk hyper-diagnosing and neurotic \u201clabeling\u201d of their kids, creating the false rise in reported incidents of autism. These parents! Why don\u2019t they just relax! Let kids be kids! Imagine the STIGMA of a school record identifying them as Asperger\u2019s! The HORROR!  \n\n Let me tell you something, if you don\u2019t have a kid on the spectrum or have a very good friend or a close family member with this kid on the spectrum and I mean VERY close, so close that you hear and see it up close, or you don\u2019t work with these kids in a very progressive, up to date, one-on-one capacity, then you just don\u2019t get it. You don\u2019t. I\u2019m not being bitter here; just trying to let you in on it. Even my neighbor, my AWESOME neighbor who is a pediatric OT and I\u2019m sure, seriously, an excellent one. Even she, who loves kids and has a HUGE big wide open heart, worked at camps for special needs kids, ASD, fragile x, downs, mentally retarded, LD, SB, CF, every kind of disability on the planet, even she doesn\u2019t know because  her  kids are typical. She doesn\u2019t know that social skills groups, like the kinds they have been doing for a while that help make the kids  look  better, aren\u2019t addressing the core deficits, aren\u2019t helping the kids feel more connected, more confident about how to negotiate the millions of nuances involved in a conversation, even a very simple 5 minute one. They learn how to look at you and say hello and goodbye and how to \u2018be a good friend\u2019 say a nice thing to each other, help someone with their coat, etc. etc.--I\u2019m not saying those are bad things. no no very nice things really. But are they giving them the ability to read body language? The foundation skills that are going to be required as they get older and relationships become even more complicated and nuanced? Does it grow episodic memory? The ability to reference? No. Neither does sit there sit there sit there, good boy! here\u2019s a pretzel. Please, don\u2019t get me wrong. ABA has worked miracles with some autistic kids. It\u2019s just not a one-size fits t-shirt for the whole lot of them. I\u2019m going for the custom fit.  \n\n So what I want to say is, if you are not currently doing a good ABA or RDI or SonRise program, or working side by side with Stanley Greenspan or with Carol Gray or traveling the world over with Tony Attwood or the like, then please, try just listening. Really listening with an open mind. What IS it like? What do you do day to day? How IS it different? What DO you worry about? How DOES it feel? What can I do for you? How is it going? How is so and so today? Gee, it must be hard or lonely and isolating and scary. No. It\u2019s not a tragedy or the end of the world. Yes, we all have challenges here. No, I don\u2019t feel sorry for you. But I am thinking of you. I am thinking that at the end of the day, when the kids are asleep, there is no AHHHH down time for you. There is never down time, because even when a chunk of free time presents itself, the psychological toll is weighty and ever-present.\u00a0 There is always more to read, to learn, to understand, to organize, to research, always the need to talk to your husband about your son: how did he seem today? what games did you play? did you try this? what about this? what do you think we ought to try differently? There is the 8 hour DVD of Gutstein, the 12 hours of Floortime, the playroom to organize, the curtains to make for the shelves to block out visual clutter.  \n\n I have an impulse to say all this and then I begin to self edit and I have to say why? Because it\u2019s not funny? It\u2019s not crafty or adventurous? I don\u2019t have anything else to say right now. This is it. This is my life. We don\u2019t go to the playground for hours. 20 minutes in a huge success for us. And it\u2019s me and my guy, side by side the whole time. I\u2019ve never once sat on the bench, having a nice chat with the other grown ups there. Not once. People say, let\u2019s meet at such and such place; the kids can play and we can catch up. Are they kidding? Sure, let\u2019s have a picnic on the double yellow line of Highway 1. We can do our nails. Maybe a little yoga. The kids\u2019ll be fine. \n\n Chronologically, he's nearly 4\u00a0 1/2; socially, he\u2019s 18 months; self-care, I\u2019d say 3; independence, about 2, intellectually, I\u2019d say 7.  \n\n We are close to finding a RDI consultant who can give us a good clean comprehensive assessment of where Fluffy is and then guide us through a home program, month to month. We need it. We need that guidance. Because I can\u2019t become an expert in RDI in my free time. I  need  that down time, to write, to go out, to watch bad tv, to just be Fluffy\u2019s mom, just be Kyra.  \n\n I\u2019m coming to a place where it\u2019s okay that Fluffy has Asperger's. It's okay if he has quirks. We all do. Like Nigel's amps from  Spinal Tap , some of his are just turned up to 11. I know he will learn more and grow and I don\u2019t necessarily need him to take off the whole coat of AS because it\u2019s part of him. I  do  need to keep at it when it comes to laying the foundation for him to feel safe and confident in the world, to know how to relate to other people, to have a healthy strong self image and make friends. I\u2019m not stopping before that\u2019s in place.\u00a0  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/06/turned_up_to_11.html", "title": "Turned up to 11"},

I will say that no New Yorkers are going to be clamoring to get reservations. Funny, I still think of myself as a New Yorker even though I didn\u2019t grow up there and I\u2019ve been gone eight years. But you know, once you\u2019ve lived there you just can\u2019t eat at Applebees.  \n\n c) Parenting, for me, has been like trying to brush my teeth for four straight years and only being up to, say, the fifth or sixth tooth. I have less than the average, having been born with my mother\u2019s horse teeth hiding inside my father\u2019s fruit fly jaw. Many have been extracted so closing my mouth after I hit puberty could be an option. Not that I did that much but my parents were liberal; they wanted me to have a  choice.  I had ten teeth removed in my adolescence--four \u2018eye\u2019 and six \u2018wisdom\u2019. Yes, six. I\u2019m either very wise or I damn well could have been.  \n\n When I gave birth to Fluffy, I stayed wide awake for three straight days, high from the experience of pushing out a human being under my own steam without splitting a ragged path through my butthole because, man, I thought they had to be kidding when they said bear down, push like you\u2019re pushing out a poop. A poop? There\u2019s a friggin sump pump in there. And then this tiny life slipped out and onto my chest in all his vernum sticky glory and it was like someone laid the hearts of everyone I loved times a million on my own and said,  All yours! One wrong move and the planet gets vaporized.  \n\n Now, if you like a freshly brushed mouth, if hygiene is a preoccupation, if you\u2019ve spent more than your fair share in the recliner with the funny bib and oddly placed side lamp, or you just simply like the ritual of brushing at the end of the day, you can imagine what it would be like to, night after night, get in front of the sink, squirt on the toothpaste, hold the brush up to your mouth and then hear, OKAY, THAT\u2019S TIME. You return the next day and the next, ever hopeful, and at about the 8 month mark you get to polish one tooth. But just one.  \n\n Maybe it\u2019s just me. Maybe there\u2019s something wrong with my mouth as the Korean store clerk shouted to my husband years ago after hearing a complaint about a food item. Maybe I\u2019m a loser mom because I\u2019ve found the whole thing so much harder that I thought it would be and I was prepared for it to be hard. I really was. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not talking about the love. I love being a mom. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about it being hard. Being a mom the way I want, to the child I got the day I didn\u2019t rip through bum, is harder than I thought it would be. And lonelier. \n\n Again. Maybe it\u2019s just me, since I moved to a new place when I was pregnant, since my son has been very high needs since the get-go, since the discovery of neurological challenges make it even more important that I be present while those same challenges make classes, playdates, cookouts, and nearly any social interaction with other kids present nearly impossible, since my husband\u2019s commute takes him 10 steps to the basement where he isn\u2019t so likely to wrangle us up a lively social life.  \n\n So many things are left half done or one step done or completely undone. I\u2019ve been living the slogans from my 12-step days: keeping it simple, letting it go, first things first, one day at a time. A couple of days ago a psychic told my husband, my son is in my life to teach me patience. Hey, psycho-lady, come here. I'll show you patience.    \n\n d) 10 pm seems to be the threshold to manic land. If I step over it, I start to charge up, putter around the house alone, brew decaf, google the sign-up sheet for Iron Man Triathalon, and make plans to jog up the side of Mount Everest without oxygen.

Taken by Dad. \n\n I love the beach.  \n\n When I was little, I would dash out of the ocean onto my hands and knees and shovel so many handfuls of sand into my one-piece bathing suit, I looked like a small girl with a large thyroid problem. Then I would lie down and roll back into the waves, legs out, arms long over my head, sand caking my skin and hair and nose. It was exhilarating. I never got dizzy and felt like I was going to throw up and drop dead from a brain hemorrhage like I do now after spinning in a circle with my son or having one go on that vile merry-go-round thing at the playground. I was in sensory bliss: wild water swirling, gritty sand streaming, brilliant sun baking, warm wind enveloping, salty mouth biting ovals on my tingly arm. \n\n Fluffy loves the beach too. From his very first time there, face-out in the bjorn, pinned to Dave\u2019s chest like he was velcroed to the wall in an art exhibit, arms and legs wiggling like a water bug. He hooted and yammered on endlessly, gesticulating all limbs and craning his head up and down like ET: Ah! waves crashing! Oh! wind racing through my two strands of hair! What now? Ah! the swooping seagulls!\u00a0 Meanwhile, our friend\u2019s same-age infant jutted out alongside on his dad\u2019s chest, serene and silent, eying the landscape as if to say,  nature--how she does soothe the soul , and then he\u2019d drift off to sleep for the tenth time that day.  \n\n Now Fluffy tears into the water; waves crash over his head, flatten his hair, and make him gasp but never slow him down. He\u2019s a boy possessed. If they made movie about him, he would be played by Russell Crowe. He\u2019d have to play it young and I know he could, that Russell; he\u2019s very versatile. He\u2019d either do it or punch you out trying. Anyway, there would be Russell, battling the waves, trudging out farther, farther, getting knocked down by the big ones, tossing clumps of seaweed and small children on boogie boards aside with a explosions of maniacal laughter, as if he were going to march all the way to New Zealand. That\u2019s Fluffy in the ocean, shaking us off. Unhand me! Onward! Onward! \n\n I love that he\u2019s like that. It\u2019s a little unnerving, but I relate. I decide it\u2019s because he\u2019s bold and adventurous, taking lusty bites out of life. What I don\u2019t like as much is when he starts to poop in the supermarket and then frantically struggles to whip off his shorts right then and there by the salad bar while I say no no, and make a mad dash for the bathroom. I don\u2019t like that as much though, I suppose, one could argue he is doing the same thing--living large, in the moment, like Hemmingway or someone powerfully alive and in touch with the atavistic. Get the poo-poo  out  NOW! Get the poo-poo  off  NOW! It\u2019s a bit of the Asperger\u2019s--not tuning into surroundings or his body, not being able to withstand a microsecond of discomfort. A drop of water gets on his shirt and it must come off IMMEDIATELY; can you imagine pat\u00e9 poo-poo in the shorts? It must feel like being rolled in tar.  \n\n Last summer, he would wander off down the beach, chasing sea gulls, digging for stones, Band-Aids, and sticky old juice box containers, down down the beach never looking back to see us, trailing him. We used to think he was super confident and secure. We would chuckle and nod in his direction and congratulate ourselves on our incredible parenting. But now we know this, too, is part of the Asperger\u2019s. Typical kids turn and look every so often, to make sure their safety net is nearby. \n\n But, not matter. Fluffy loves the beach. It\u2019s the original sensory gym. The whole family splashes in the shallows, digs to China and frog-hops with a stack of collected sand bombs. We stay close by, keep him in our sight--more like he\u2019s two and a half rather than going on four and a half. I feel such deep relaxation and contentment, until the woman a few blankets over lets her child cry for 30 minutes in the steaming hot porta-sauna only to finally pick her up with sighs and exasperation. As the crying intensifies for another 30 minutes--building to a fever pitch of pure terror and outrage, she rotely diapers and changes her, strong-arming on and off three separate hats, and just generally manipulates her as if she were leaking battery acid. I smile in her direction and offer, WHY DON\u2019T YOU TRY LOOKING AT HER ONCE OR MAKING EVEN THE TINIEST NOISE OF COMFORT OR GIVING HER SOMETHING TO DRINK FOR CHRIST\u2019S SAKE IT\u2019S 100 FUCKING DEGREES OUT HERE?  \n\n I say it silently and with love.

Me either !! \n\n In other news, the painted lady butterflies have emerged from their chrysalides. They are flying around their little pavilion, looking for a way out. Yesterday, Fluffy selected a bright yellow gerber daisy and dripped sugar water on its petals so they\u2019ll have a little refreshment until they are released into our yard. I wish the butterfly bush was blooming or even halfway to its summer size. Right now, only the irises and day lilies have opened their mouths and I don\u2019t think butterflies care for them. I imagine they will make one pass around our yard, sniff in discontent and then flutter off to lay 500 eggs, travel 1,000 miles, breath through their abdomens, taste with their feet, and see through their 10,000 eyes, all in the brief 2 - 4 weeks they have to live.

{"date": "June 20, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Dashing Dad on the Jersey Shore; 1950? \n\n Yesterday, my sister and I took our dad out to a buffet brunch for Father\u2019s Day. My nephew, who is essentially fatherless, came along with his pal, also fatherless. We sat on the shiny vinyl seats of our red booth, watched dad open cards, and ate many rounds of a bizarre assortment of buffet style food.\u00a0 Something about that kind of layout always wakes up the college student mentality in me and it\u2019s all I can do to keep from shoveling buckets-full of sausages into my purse. If I had that kind of purse, you know, the plastic kind with the center clasp. The kind I had years ago when a friend opened it, threw up a night\u2019s worth of drinking, and delicately clipped it closed it again and set it on the floor. Even though the sausages are like, Mrs. Fields, or something. Large quantities? Must have more more more! Must take them home. Must keep eating at all costs.  \n\n My sister had woken up with a slight tummy ache in the morning and felt worried and let down, like getting sick on the day of the big game. But, happily, she rallied like the quarterback star that she is and we made several passes along the banquet tables of silver serving trays. Come to think of it, we\u2019re both remarkably svelte when you consider our capacity to inhale food. Is it because our mother refused to store leftovers? Always handing us the tail end of the salad or meat loaf or mashed potatoes?  Eat this. I don\u2019t want to put it away.  Or that she would put things WAY away in the back back of the fridge like she was growing man in the moon marigolds or some other frightening experiment? Or are we feeding the angry hole?  \n\n Okay--la la! No matter! Back to the brunch. My nephew, Jake, and all his nearly 15 year old energy was there, alternately getting into mock shoving fights with his pal, calling him a girl, telling tumbling tales and then responding in one word monotones, suddenly staring ahead like he was exceedingly over us or just listening to a little Aerosmith in his mind, drumming out a wild rhythm with his chopsticks, excitedly saying \u201cbut mom mom mom listen to this mom\u201d getting into a tiny fight over something, scoring a good point and then whispering\u00a0 \u201cburn!\u201d. I know other people say they don\u2019t want to go back to the teenage years, but, I don\u2019t know, it looked sort of fun to me. So boundless and surprising, like an endless ride in the dark turns of a fun house.  \n\n We all had a great time. We hugged each other and took pictures and crammed a whole day's worth of activity into the 90 minutes I had before I drove the hour home to spend some time with the dad of this household. And on the way home, I thought about the picture I used to make my own dad's card--a dashing picture of him on the Jersey shore when he was maybe just out of high school. I found it in the stack of old photographs. Sometime after my parents divorce, I became the keeper of these memories: an assortment of old photographs, the 8 mm that I transferred to video, the hundreds of slides that I salvaged from those damaged from dust and neglect.  \n\n He worked a lot as we grew up, and then my parents divorced when my younger brother was 7 and I was a senior in high school, my sister already in college a couple of years, so everything changed--the family dismantled and reassembled.\u00a0 But before, he was the family photographer. After my first marriage fell apart, I stayed up one night, watching the family movies, one after another, looking for clues. There were very few images of my father, yet all were taken by him, all through his eyes, his perspective, his view of his children, his family. And I thought of that beautiful thing I read of a widow cleaning out the attic and coming across a beach ball, blown up by her then-deceased husband, and how she picked up that ball, embraced it, knowing that the air inside was his breath, a part of him still here, still real, still alive. And even though my dad is very much here and alive, vibrantly so, I had that same feeling watching those movies and looking at those pictures--of touching a part of him by settling down behind his eyes, seeing what he saw all those years. \n\n I went to see a psychic the other day. She knew everything--that I had a son, that he was less than five, that he was challenged, even that the had autism. She knew he could talk and was very bright, that his challenge was social. She told me my spirit guide was always with me and was, in that very moment, standing beside me with her arm held high, triumphant, a big spirit thumbs up sign, letting her know that I was doing a great job, that my son was well taken care of, that he would continue to improve. She said it all with such a down to earth matter of fact tone that I walked away confident and serene, and then told everyone all about my spirit guide and how this is the first lifetime that we\u2019ve been separated, etc. etc. as if I was saying the most basic and ordinary things, like there's ham for sandwiches and left over soup you can heat up for lunch. I calmly repeated everything she said to everyone even though many simply smile in return, the kind of smile you give someone who shows you the mark where the aliens inserted their probe.    \n\n She said we come to \u2018this side\u2019 to learn things, that it\u2019s all mapped out before we get here, that we choose it, and that everyone on the other side is rooting for us. I began to think of it like our brunch, all of us on the other side, clutching our warm buffet plates, making our way past the cards, making our selections. I can see Fluffy saying to me,  I know! Let\u2019s go over there together--I'll be autistic and you be my mom! Come on! It\u2019ll be fun!  I can see my sister and me, racing up to the spread, opening our purses and shoveling in card after card: hey, look!  failed marriages!  oh-- alcholics!  let\u2019s go meet some of them!  Death of a dear friend or two --hmm, sad, but, okay, maybe we can make it work.  Excellent health , good. Let's see,  stretches of career confusion and failure --grab me a couple of those! \n\n Fluffy\u2019s not backsliding. He never was. Things go up and then they go down. And all the while they progress. It\u2019s like that beautiful quote by Rabbi Hillel,\u00a0 \u201cI get up. I walk. I fall down. Meanwhile, I keep dancing. \n\n Here's to the dance.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/06/the_other_side_.html", "title": "The Other Side of Backsliding"},

Go read a few articles, especially the ones about the Amish, who don't vaccinate their children and where the incidence of autism is  well below  the national average. \n\n And then buy David Kirby's book,  Evidence of Harm . \n\n I tell you, I insisted that all the vaccines Fluffy received by thimerosal-free, and they were. But what I didn't insist on, since I didn't know to, was that all the Rhogam shots I received during my IVF attempts be thimerosal-free. And so, Fluffy received a mega-dose of mercury-compound while he was only a month in the utero, while he was getting direct feed from my bloodstream as the placenta had not fully formed and wouldn't for another two months, while more poison attacked out of the shadows from the Rhogam shot a week before he was transfered as a tiny blastocyst,  and  while perhaps critical neurological development was taking place.

{"date": "June 07, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Rocks on a hill Somewhere not here and sometime before today. \n\n You know what? Things are getting a tiny bit easier and I\u2019m feeling a tiny bit more relaxed. On errands, I walk at a normal speed, moving my cart around like a regular person picking up a few groceries, not like a game show contestant playing for the big money. It feels better. Later this week, Dave and I will have a nighttime date for the first time since Fluffy was born. Really.  \n\n I haven\u2019t writen a lot here about my son\u2019s day to day treatment. I hesitate to even call it that--treatment, as if he is ill or has some medical condition but this brain disorder really is that--a disordering of the brain which makes certain things very hard for him, certain things that other people take for granted and can\u2019t even understand. Like recognizing people. Can you imagine how you\u2019d feel if you went out in the world and nearly everyone you saw was unfamiliar to you? People approaching, calling you by name and you don\u2019t know who they are? How could you feel safe? How could you begin to put characteristic and personality traits to certain people, make determinations about social situations? Oh, that\u2019s so and so, she\u2019s nice and gentle. Oops, here comes so and so, he\u2019s a little scary. Oh! there\u2019s so and so, we\u2019ve played together before and had fun!  \n\n Fluffy can\u2019t do it. Faces are complicated and confusing so why look too closely? It may actually be painful, in a way, to look. On a few occasions, he\u2019s even been unsure of who we, his parents, are.\u00a0 It helps that we have a picture schedule of everyone he sees each day; every morning we put it the photographs and he studies the faces. But still, we see the neighbors every day and every day I introduce them. \n\n So, as much as I am coming to accept him completely with this Asperger\u2019s, that he may always have some bit of it, that he may always have certain challenges and eccentricities, I also will do everything I can for him to help his brain grow and develop, to help remediate this autism. I can\u2019t imagine NOT doing it. I\u2019m not trying to fix him. I\u2019m trying to provide for him. I\u2019m trying to help him make sense of the scene.  \n\n Here\u2019s what we do: \n\n We play with Fluffy everyday, using a combination of  Floortime  and  RDI  (Relationship Development Intervention) that stress energetic, enthusiastic, and highly engaging one-on-one interaction designed to help lay foundation relationship skills, highlighting the message that being with people is the best game in town. RDI addresses the core deficits that define autism (lack of Experience-sharing, Referencing, Regulating, Episodic Memory, and Flexible Thinking) and relies heavily on nonverbal communication. Floortime works on pretend play skills and helps to gently stretch and expand the comfort zone for flexibility in play themes and behaviors. Both of these methodologies are highly respectful of the child and are fun. If the child isn\u2019t having fun, the child isn\u2019t apt to learn.  \n\n Twice a week, Fluffy goes to a playroom where an Occupational Therapist and a Speech Language Pathologist work with him as a team; one of those days he\u2019s there with another similarly challenged little boy--his \u2018dyad\u2019, a place to work on how to play with other children, how to take turns, work as a team, say hello and goodbye. Once a week, we see Dr. H., the Asperger Specialist, who plays with him, tracks his progress, and coaches me in Floortime and RDI techniques.   \n\n Neurofeedback  helps strengthen specific areas of his brain. Electrodes are attached to his ears and head and then to a computer game that responds positively when his brain is more focused and organized (i.e., the space ship flies faster or the little chomper guy eats more dots) and slows down or stops when his brain flags. We\u2019re down to once a week after twice weekly sessions for the past three months. The treatment is painless, risk-free and has helped some kids go off medications like Ritalin, for good. We do not give Fluffy any medications. \n\n We eliminated chocolate, gluten, and casein from his diet in January. Fluffy takes a high dose of vitamins with additional vitamin C and Calcium/Magnesium. He takes fish oil (omega-3s) supplement in little caplets that are much more palatable than the stinky spoonful of cod liver oil I used to give him. His pancreas is not putting out adequate natural digestive enzymes so we give additional digestive enzymes with every meal.  HNI  has a new great tasting chewable Peptizyde and Zyme Prime but we are still putting the No-Fenol for helping with fruits and other foods high in phenols into his drink. We give daily probiotics: L-Glutamine, Acidophillus, Bifidus, and Grapefruit Seed Extract to help replenish his gut with beneficial bacteria and rid his gut of excess yeast.  \n\n We go swimming twice a week. We are just beginning to use  Social Stories . We use a visual schedule board with pictures of who he will see what he will do and places he will go each day. We use sequencing pictures at nighttime to help with getting ready for bed. His playroom has a big mirror, a swing, a trapeze bar, lots of beanbags and cushions, a trampoline and big balls for bouncing & hopping. We\u2019ve got a growing assortment of games suggested for their therapeutic value: kids on stage, twister, face paints, box of costumes and masks for dress up, a doll, doctor\u2019s kit, etc. etc... \n\n In addition to his regular doctor visits, (we don't do all the 'recommended vaccination nor follow the recommended schedule) we take Fluffy to see a naturapath who is guiding us through metals testing, supplements, and homeopathic remedies. Last week, we started weekly cranio-sacral sessions.  \n\n It's all helping. But Fluffy still doesn't want to have any kids around. He tolerates it in the pool. He's getting better with his playmate in the structured dyad each week. It's the biggest area of challenge and I can only imagine it's the area where he feels the most confused and afraid. It's for that reason that I want to homeschool him this fall. Maybe not forever, but for now it feels like the right thing. I certainly never saw myself homeschooling but I've never parented an Asperger child before. As Lise Pyles says in her book,  Homeschooling the child with Asperger Syndrome , '...in the great swimming pool of socialization our kids cannot swim. Throwing them into the deep end of the pool only causes panic and grief...\" She says, walk them to the shallow end and teach them how to swim at their own right pace. \n\n Today was pool day at the \"Y\". The lifeguard said,  I love watching your son swim. He's fearless.  \n\n I don't want the water to be the only place he feels that way. \n\n \u00a0 \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.floortime.org/", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/", "http://www.neurodevelopmentcenter.com/", "http://www.houstonni.com/", "http://thegraycenter.org/Social_Stories.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843107619/qid=1118169846/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-1242959-9579231"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/06/you_know_what_t.html", "title": "The Day-to-Day"},

{"date": "May 27, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t In the corn maze, October, 2004. Taken by Dave. \n\n My sister-in-law-law, Susie, asked me recently for some reading suggestions so that she may better understand what we are going through over here with our son, Fluffy, and his Asperger\u2019s and our attempts to give him what he needs and still find time for what we need, even the barest bit of what we need. I have a growing library of books on the subject and at first, I thought, hmm, let me think about which of these titles would be good to pass along. But you know what? None of them would really do it. Because what we are going through is what we are going through and I don\u2019t know one book that would describe it adequately.\n\n \n\n In addition, I\u2019ve been thinking lately about the have and have not issue. Those who have kids and\u00a0 those who don\u2019t. And while there is no such thing as one being better, there is something very specific about having kids that those who don\u2019t have them just can\u2019t know. The reverse is true, of course, but there was a time when I didn\u2019t have kids--my whole life up until pregnancy at 40, so while I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to not have kids as a 45 year old, I\u2019m pretty clear about what my life was like without them for a large chunk of my adulthood.  \n\n Those that don\u2019t have them will never know the have them part.\n\nAnd saying this brings up a swirl of thoughts and the feeling that I must explain so as not to offend or upset anyone since there are countless out there who would love nothing more than to have kids and haven\u2019t been able to for countless reasons. I, personally, spent from age 27 to age 40 wanting to have kids and not being able to. But I have passed through that threshold into the room with kids of all ages and descriptions and mommies of equally many ages and styles and therefore, can not count myself among those still yearning.\n\n \n\n In any case, after not having kids and now having kids, of this I am clear: you can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have kids until you do. That simple. It isn\u2019t said to exclude anyone or their feelings. It's just a fact. \n\n \n\n I became a big sister when I was 11 and spent hours and hours babysitting my younger brother. I became a champ babysitter to many families, responsible both for kids I knew well and those I had never set eyes on before I walked through the door and was given the low-down on food, bath, bedtime routine, and snacks. Those were the days of land phones and many times the parents were off to destinations completely unreachable for hours. I was in charge of kids who climbed out of the bathtub to leap back into the water from the sink, those who scribbled wildly on the walls with their father\u2019s fountain pen, those who got tummy bugs attacks and threw up the length of the hall, followed by each sibling in ascending order of age and ending with me. One family left me in charge of their two children for the weekend when I was barely out of high school, driving them to the store for milk in my VW bug with nary a car seat in sight. \n\n \n\n All that to say, I thought I knew what it was like to have kids. I had friends with kids and I listened to them. I taught kids. My sister gave birth to my nephew 14 years ago. We were close. I thought I got it. I really did.\n\n \n\n I didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\n \n\n I talk about what it\u2019s like for me to be a mom and in the last year, I\u2019ve been talking about what it\u2019s like for me to be a mom and find out that my only child is on the spectrum. High functioning, yes, but still on the spectrum. I\u2019ve been talking about it to lots of people in different ways depending on whom I\u2019m talking to. When my AWESOME neighbor asks me how Fluffy\u2019s doing, I say he\u2019s doing great. When I run into mommies from our pre-Asperger\u2019s days and they ask, I tell them about the challenge and hope and confidence and light chatter about how great he is responding to various therapies. When I talk to friends, I will share more details about the picture here, about the isolation and the struggles, the worries about giving Fluffy what he needs and how to balance that with what I need so that I don\u2019t give from a martyred place. I talk about how hard it is to find help, my wish that we\u2019d meet an angel who would help us sort through the big picture and lead us to the practitioners that will build the puzzle with us. \n\n \n\n Outside of my husband, there are maybe two people with whom I will swing the door open wide, with whom I will sweep aside one set of very truthful words about how beautiful Fluffy is, how amazing, how brilliant and special, how his being here is a gift, a host of lessons, about the unending gratitude I have about getting to BE a mom, how he cracks me up, about the enormity of the love, the fierceness of the love, the mystery of his smell, his face, his little form and how it feels to curl up with him to read a book, watch his discoveries, about how I love us as a family and even though I wish we could have had more children, how the family we are is precious to me and I can trust it is how it should be, how I am glad to have the chance to focus on Fluffy and not have the overwhelming burden of financial insecurity and the pressure of having to tromp out there in the world and rustle up the cash, to worry about how to pay the rent and also the doctor, how I am lucky I get to have a choice.  \n\n Being home with Fluffy still means struggling with the other set of very truthful words, about what's hard: the tedium; the times I don\u2019t feel like playing; the longing for autonomy and the world of easy self-care and attending to, for the world of complete conversations, movies, plays, travel, shopping, going OUT and being able to get AWAY.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n The sacrifices I have made are the right ones and I don\u2019t feel the, \u2018Oy! What I've sacrificed for you!\u201d lament but still, they  are  sacrifices. Somethings have been given up and it was right but still, sometimes hard. \n\n \n\n And so, the phone rings and it\u2019s my neighbor and she says how are you and I say, Fine. And then the phone rings and it is a friend and she says how are you and I say, We\u2019re okay but it\u2019s been a bit of a lonely year, we\u2019re a bit stressed. And then the phone rings and it\u2019s one of those people from the deep inner circle where I feel invited to let my guard down, where it is an unspoken safety zone and all feelings are fair in love and war because this is a kind of love and war, not to be overly dramatic, and then I say, Oh my god, I don't think I can keep going. It\u2019s too hard. I want more for me. I don\u2019t want Fluffy to have this. I don\u2019t want to be a special mom of a special child. I want him to have friends. I want to have people over. I want to drop him off at school or a class and know he\u2019ll have a good time. I want to go away for the weekend with my husband. I want to freeze time. Can I freeze time? Why do we have to figure all this out on our own? Where are the people to help us with this. Why don\u2019t more people understand? \n\n \n\n One of those from the inner circle isn\u2019t up for it anymore and, I discovered, hasn\u2019t been up for it the whole time. She\u2019s been slowly stepping out of the circle since last fall. I\u2019ve felt it and asked about it but she kept saying, no, no, I\u2019m just very busy. \n\n \n\n I\u2019m very busy too. \n\n \n\n I\u2019m also sad, disappointed, hurt. But what can I say? I can\u2019t step it down now and share about my life from the ground floor, not digging up in the attic or down in the basement where the boxes are strewn about and the shelves are a mess. I DO that with the people from other circles but I can\u2019t go from inner circle sharing to outer circle sharing without a long break in between. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have kids and I suspect that she also doesn\u2019t think there is anything \u2018wrong\u2019 with my son. She doesn\u2019t live around here and doesn\u2019t see me or Fluffy with any regularity. She doesn\u2019t get it. It feels like there is a lot of that around me.\n\nThere are also people who love me and love Fluffy and care about our family and want to get it and want to understand and want to help and do offer warm sincere deeply felt support and are there for me in the way that they can be and I see that and thank you. I don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful or stuck in a place of needing to be on the outside. I\u2019m not feeling either thing. \n\n \n\n If you are a mom, you get a big chunk of it. You get the mama lion love, the wanting to inhale their skin through your pores, to climb through them and hug wildly them from the inside. You get the commitment and preoccupation and fascination with their needs, their desires, their curiosities, their quirks and eccentricities, and also the preoccupation with death--theirs and yours. You get elevator falling in your chest feeling when you are away and hear a siren even though you know it doesn\u2019t make any sense that the siren would or could be screaming toward your imperiled child, stuck in your burning house, trapped beneath a stranger's car, racing him to the emergency room to dislodge the apricot from his throat or the scissors from his eye, yet images like these still flash through your mind. You get the longing for them and missing them when you are away and the equally powerful claustrophobia when they are near with their octopus arms and insistent questioning, their climbing onto your head and sticking fingers in your nose and mouth, their accidental but still excruciatingly painful SMACK to your lip with their rock hard heads. You get the, \u2018get away from me, don\u2019t need me so much, can\u2019t you just take care of yourself for the afternoon?\u201d and the genuine thrill and deep pleasure of spending the day with them, playing games, reading books, talking, doing errands, the gift of their company, their love, their adoration, their innocence and spontaneity, their exquisite and miraculous beauty.\n\n \n\n If you are a mom of an unusual kid with challenges, you get the rest. The urgency and the fear, the drive to give them what they need so they will find their way in the world, not just make a life and be happy but be able to connect and feel safe and have confidence in their ability to make sense of the sensory input of a setting outside their home, recognize who is saying hello, organize their body, mind, and voice to\u00a0 perform an activity with more than two steps, make ONE FRIEND.\u00a0 The confusion about how to give them what they need when you are still figuring it out, the frustration about how to fit in this learning when you don\u2019t have enough help and you are already overwhelmed and under stress. The journey toward acceptance that takes a year, when you go from knowing in your gut that something is wrong to knowing that nothing is  wrong  but that things are decidedly different than what you once thought. You get that giving them what they need feels a little like you are still learning that maybe food is an important piece of the nourishment puzzle. Of course, I\u2019m talking about his neurological diet, his sensory diet, his emotional diet, not his actual diet but that\u2019s how vital these needs feel, like food. It feels that nerve-wracking and desperate at times, as if you are seeing your son crumble and reach around and out, needing, and someone says, hmm, do you think that maybe food is something kids need? Do you think he's hungry? And you say, YES, he needs food but I\u2019m not sure what kind exactly or where to get it or how to give it to him and they say, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get to that, we'll keep researching that and try to get some food to him sometime in the next few weeks.  \n\n I\u2019m his mother. My son is hungry. He needs food now. \n \n\n What book can I suggest to my dear sister in-law-law? Maybe just the one I need to write. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to communicate it well enough for those with no kids or those with typical kids, or even with those with kids on the spectrum. But I can try. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/05/what_its_like.html", "title": "In the Corn Maze"},
{"date": "May 29, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t   \n\n Manhattan from the train; yesterday, early morning. \n\n \n\n\n\n Yesterday was my biggest outing since Fluffy was born. I left on the 7:41 am train and was home by 11 pm. Fluffy and Dave did great together. I thought of them and checked in to say hi, but I'm so pleased to say,  I didn't worry . It was like a play in acts. I loved it. The city was so familiar even though much has changed since I last lived there, eight years ago.   \n\n My friend,  Kim , took me shopping for makeup. She navigated the aisles of Sephora and Bloomingdales, deftly weaving from one counter to the next with me scurrying behind her, clicking photographs and saying,  yeah, that's right, I've got my own personal shopper here and we're doing a piece for a very big magazine, VERY BIG.  She then marched me up to the ladies room for an impromptu lesson in application where she learned me a thing or two, and now I can\u2019t stop looking in the mirror! My eyes are popping! My cheekbones are lifted! My mouth looks like it is quite possibly comprised of two separate and nearly full lips instead of a hastily drawn equal sign! My dark circles and red splotches have disappeared!  \n\n See, Kim is brilliant; she\u2019s the outsider with the inside scoop, if you know what I mean. She has the goods and the stuff plus a sense of the absurd, the gift of riding the ever-changing waves of fashion and style on her own god damn board of freedom. She\u2019s a feminist with a pedicure, a woman of substance with a knock out eyebrow. She\u2019s ravishingly beautiful and she cracks me up. And she\u2019s the mother of an adorable little guy who dives into her chin with open mouth relish and dances down the hallway while reciting poetry and he\u2019s not even 18 months.  \n\n It was so fun to spend time with him. I tried reading him a little pre-nap book but I was going  way  too slow so he took off down the hall galloping, sashaying, skipping, accompanied by a wild arm flutter and slap that I thought might propel him to the ceiling. Then he came tearing right back and correctly named every animal in  Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?  with delight and also a little bit of exasperation, like,  Mom, I am soooo beyond this; get me the book on Obscure Animals of the Central American Rainforest. \n\n Next, I met up with Tom and zipped downtown in his blue honda to see  Ashes and Snow . The exhibit was housed in a nomadic museum, one made of recycled, renewable materials. It was enormous, stretching the length of the pier upon which it was standing. Inside the long and narrow corridor, fabric hung in billowy panels from the ceiling that reached up by what seemed like two hundred feet. It was like walking into a cathedral and it inspired a prayful, sacred feeling. We walked along a wooden pathway as if walking on a nature trail, a sea of stones on either side upon which the shadow photographs spilled down, framed in soft white light. The photographs hung in midair between great pillars made of what looked like gigantic paper towel rolls. They were maybe 4 feet wide by 6 or more feet long, printed on textured fabricy looking material. The images were stunning, moving, deeply restful. It didn\u2019t at all feel like the moments captured were preceded by chaos and artificial lights, last minutes racing around yelling, MAKE UP! GET THIS SHINE OFF THE ELEPHANT. LISTEN UP PEOPLE, GIVE ME MORE GOD, ONE, TWO, LET'S GO! It felt like the whole experience must have been a meditation, an exercise in quieting and trusting and allowing.  I soaked it in. I don't have enough of that in my life and I long for it. I would love to hold Fluffy on a sand dune, and lean our bare skin against the other children in those pictures, fold my arms around his chest and close my eyes while cheetahs pant nearby and then gracefully step over our laps. I want to hang on the tusks of an elephant under the sea, touch the tip of a whale's tail, feel an eagle's wing brush my hair as she passes. We watched a film compiled from moments of the entire project that was projected on the far wall of the building. There was a narration. There had also been quite a bit of standing and shuffle-step walking among a crowd of people filing in on this holiday weekend, a week before the show's closing, so I couldn\u2019t get all that was said, though I think one section repeated:  Feather to Fire, Fire to Blood, Blood to Bone, Bone to Marrow, Marrow to Ashes, Ashes to Snow.  There was also something about burning love letters after reading them, spreading the ashes onto the riverbank of wet leaves and soft mud, something of returning the following year after fallen snow had melted and reading them again with your senses. There was something also about dancing, becoming the dance and dance filled the screen. There was so much sensuality, arching, opening, surrendering, and so much water; women dancing in the shallows with elephants, a man swimming in the deep with elephants, whales, and manatees; a man and a woman underwater slowly intertwining, again and again. No one wore masks or tanks. Breath was held for exceptionally long periods of time as if they were all floating in the womb of the universe.  \n\n I loved my time with brilliant Tom, a guy in possession of one of the most solid foundations of mental health of anyone I know. I can't believe I can say such a thing, but we\u2019ve known each other for 26 years. Yes, we met in the delivery room, getting side by side weigh-ins. No. At acting school. He is a huge talent in the handsomest package with a breathtaking singing voice that wowed them on Broadway when he was the Phantom for years. Yes, THE PHANTOM.\u00a0 The thing is, he can also do every part you hand him, the straight guy, the baffoon, the bore, the sicko, the madcap, the buddy, the heartthrob. Plus, he\u2019s so funny he makes you do the laugh-cry. And the sit-pee. He\u2019s off to LA to stake his claim. Study his face. He's gonna be up on the silver screen soon. After the show, Tom and I had a simple and scrumptious dinner at one of the gazillion places within nearly any 2 block radius and then it started to rain. I threw him my umbrella and ducked into the cab that drove me to my train in that wonderfully terrifying way that New York City cabbies do.  \n\n The train moved me east through the falling night, pulling along on the tracks, away away and back home to my family. I watched through the window as rain blackened the bark of passing trees and turned the station platforms a deep shimmering gray, like the gray of an elephant's skin.\u00a0    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iamprettynyc.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0805047905/103-7053031-5888612?v=glance", "http://www.ashesandsnow.com/index2.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/05/yesterday_was_m.html", "title": "The Play Day"},
{"date": "May 18, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Tiny waterway behind our house; April, 2005. \n\n A mother of two said to me the other day,  You\u2019re lucky you have just one. You can concentrate of giving him what he needs.  I think of all the disorders and diseases and things we could be struggling with, including never conceiving Fluffy at all after the years of trying and the big guns of in-vitro fertilization. Yes. I am lucky. The infertility parted its waters for an instant and one embryo bee-lined to a soft, sticky place on the wall and hung on. We didn\u2019t lose him during the pregnancy. He wasn\u2019t a stillborn. He is a remarkably healthy and fascinating boy. Yes. Lucky. \n\n There is a tendency to tone it down now. Okay, that\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s clean this up and make it into something new...what can it be now? I know! Let\u2019s make a smiley face! Yes, that\u2019s it! Turn that frown upside down!  \n\n I think it would help if I found lots of blogs by moms with kids on the spectrum, or maybe it would help if I had lots of friends around here in a similar situation. Although I don\u2019t know. Maybe we\u2019d all be walking in our own tight circles, picking up pieces of the pictures from our children\u2019s past; what about that moment? Was that the autism? What if I had known about that, then? Bending down to recapture pools of memories, laying sheets of paper towels on top, watching the wetness soak up and through and spread to the edges before it\u2019s engulfed and pulled down to the ground.  \n\n I think I am still in the acceptance stage, still making the adjustments to the picture I thought I\u2019d step into. But the small aches come every day. People open their mouths and tiny darts come out and fly into my chest. They don\u2019t mean it. They are simple innocent things:  He loves his little play group. Oh, she just loves school. He plays with the neighborhood kids for hours. He makes friends with anyone. My kids are so easy. \n\n I was supposed to be one of those moms with kids in crocheted beenie hats, cotton print clothing and striped stockings; kids with wide smiles and open faces who race to the door upon my friends\u2019 arrival, climb into their laps and cup either side of their face to peer sweetly, inquisitively, insistently into their eyes; kids who stand on chairs in the kitchen making cookies with flour on their hands and bits of dough in their wild hair; kids who talk to anyone, play with any kid, run around outside in the sunshine, chasing butterflies and pinocchio seedlings that spin down from the trees like tiny helicopters, who fly kites and dig in the dirt like passionate and single-minded archeologist. I\u2019m a breast-feeding, co-sleeping, groovey, child-centered, artsy mom who was going to have pot lucks and picnics in sculpture parks and go to outdoor concerts where the music spreads into the slowly darkening sky as the kids fall asleep in laps, under quilts, wearing giant sweatshirts that don\u2019t belong to them.\u00a0  \n\n That isn\u2019t this life and I\u2019m still making adjustments and--here I will tell on myself, there are times when I resent those women who don\u2019t get it, this life of mine, who believe in their quiet hearts that I could have more of what they have if only I would breathe, who don\u2019t understand the low grade constant OVERWHELMING reality of a child who isn\u2019t interested in other children, in other people, save a select few, who wants and needs constant one-on-one attention and loving, present, playful connection. \n\n Maybe this sounds like one long whine and that would be disheartening because my life is good and blessed and I AM lucky. Yes, yes. I am. But I\u2019m negotiating a complicated crossing and complicated crossings are hard. This is the climb up before the ride down, the trek through before the view, the moving of big rocks, the clearing of the land to build. And our crew is still too skeletal. We are still doing a lot of overtime. Spirits are waning. We need a company party, like we sometimes got in high school when the principal would announce during morning assembly that school was canceled and the whole of us would rocket out of our metal folding chairs and shout and cheer and pile onto the buses lined up outside the auditorium and ride to the school farm where the field stretched out and leaned obliquly toward a river. It was called a free day.  \n\n We need a free day. \n\n Fluffy\u2019s been asking a lot about rivers lately.  Mommy, what is a raging river? Can a rolling river ever become a raging river? Mommy, tell me about every kind of river. Tell me about the gentlest kind of river there is. \n\n We are on one side of a river and there are places where it really is very gentle and rolling, where we can safely stand and look around, reach down beneath the clearest waters and touch the cool slippery smooth stones by our feet. There are places where the current surprises us with its power and there are places where it clearly rages above the white froth, where jagged rocks menace and sodden logs disintegrate from the brush of a fallen leaf.\u00a0  \n\n I think I\u2019m looking for that soft sticky place where I can hang on, draw nourishment, and let the waters fill up around me as we make our crossing. Let me find my acceptance. Let me step fully into  this  picture and allow the others fall away to be carried down the stream. Those aren\u2019t my memories. Those aren\u2019t my children. You\u2019re not living my life. And I\u2019m not living a mistaken one. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/05/a_mother_of_two.html", "title": "Crossings"},

What is normal?  I know; who knows. Then. I wish he was typical.  Oh goodness, there is such a wide range of typical! Every kid has their own difficulties, every kid has their challenges.  True. True. But I\u2019ve found that most people who say this are people with either no children or neurotypical children. Sometimes I say it too, as do other parents with special needs kids. But what I am coming out of the dark to say is that sometimes I also say, I wish he didn\u2019t have this, this Asperger\u2019s.  Then he wouldn\u2019t be Fluffy , is the next thing said. Really? As we remediate some of the autism, is he becoming less Fluffy?\u00a0 If we remediated the Asperger's altogether, wouldn\u2019t he still be Fluffy? without all the super hard stuff? There would be hard stuff, for sure, but regular hard stuff, the hard stuff I already knew about before I began wonder anything about him, before he started squawking and biting kids on the back.  \n\n He\u2019s not squawking or biting kids on the back anymore, although he does still, from time to time, hold up his hands and scream at a random kid, usually when something about people confuses him. There is always a reason; all his behavior has meaning and purpose. \n\n But screaming is not the issue. It's not what sometimes overwhelms and saddens me. There  is  no one thing. \n\n\n\n He is a remarkable boy  just as he is  AND he is making wonderful progress which means the world to us and  a world for him ; a world that broadens, and as it does, holds more out for him to see and touch and understand, for him to mold into a rich and connected life. \n\n I have a beautiful  Brian Andreas  print,  Unfurled , on our mantel with these words: \u201cThe first time his laugher unfurled its wings in the wind, we knew that the world would never be the same.\u201d \n\n My world never will be the same and for that, I'd sing from the highest roofs man has built. But, you know that quote about driving in the dark with the headlights on, only seeing a few feet ahead of you each moment, but how you can make the whole trip that way? I believe in that. Only, sometimes you need to stop along the road and loosen the knots in your shoulders. And sometimes it's okay to wish for more light. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.artsforge.com/storypeople/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/05/what_are_you_bl.html", "title": "What Are You Bloggin' For"},

The sword of murder is not the balance of justice.\" \nBlood does not wipe our dishonor nor violence indicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plow and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of counsel.

{"date": "May 06, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Roadside on a cross-country trip, newly pregnant with Fluffy; 2000. \n\n Let me just say that earlier this evening I sucked down a caffeinated soda beverage and maybe that was a mistake because I am now walking around the house late at night composing disjointed and jittery blogs in my mind.  \n\n I sucked down the soda with my italian sub, which we call a grinder here in ridiculous RI where I stood as I ate it, along with a side of chips and yes, I stood and ate at the kitchen counter while talking on the phone with  Kim , my back to the pisa-towers of dishes dotting the counters and within the sink because my dear  husband  is away accepting a Blue Crab award for one of his amazing books and so isn\u2019t here to wash, dry, load, and press heavy cycle. Blue Crab. I think I won that award. Isn\u2019t that for being a sad bitch? I\u2019ve been a sad bitch before. I\u2019m pretty sure I was darn good at it too.  \n\n While I was on the phone with Kim, the line buzzed oddly and then I\nheard myself in wide echo through my headset, the one that makes me\nlook like I work at old navy, only I would be  happy  to help\nsomeone look for 5T cotton pjs even if it meant I had to get up and\nmove. Anyway, it echoed in a very eerie way like I was alone in a\ndarkened movie theater or alone in my own house with my husband away\nand my innocent child asleep while someone did something creepy and\nuntoward to the phone lines right outside my window and then the line\nwent dead just before I told Kim I\u2019d call her right back.  \n\n But I\ncouldn't call her back because something really was wrong with my phone\nand I started to feel mildly panicky and quickly tried my other\nphone--no luck. I grabbed Dave\u2019s business line but now Kim\u2019s line was\nbusy or so the recording said but wait, doesn\u2019t she have call waiting?\nYes, I know she does because she\u2019s constantly putting me on hold and\njust then my phone rang and it was Kim and my phone was working again\nand my voice had returned to normal. In the space of 62 seconds, she\nhad the same sort of rising panic. What can I say. Our imaginations are\nlike that. They run and twirl on the hilltop and then go tumbling down.\n \n\n So Dave's away and it was me and Fluffy all day and we had a rollicking time. The thing is, he is so exceptionally funny and interesting to be with and talk to. In the current therapeutic approach, we are to downplay the verbal and up-play the nonverbal communication as we are helping him learn to reference, in other words, look at the other guy, more. Sometimes it's hard to remember but it  is  working and it\u2019s also terribly exciting to watch him progress and we are even getting pretty good at doing more of this sort of thing  all the time  even though it\u2019s not necessarily our style.  \n\n I mean, Dave and I are both very goofy. In fact, I think Dave is an  actual  cartoon character. He is the original lean-into-the-conversation guy, the guy who will turn his face inside out and pull his pants down midway along the crack and do every manner of oddball and riotous thing with all body parts to get and prolong a laugh. In other words, he\u2019s not the guy checking himself out in the mirror (remember the VO5?) certainly not a pocket change jangler, not the guy who crouches low for the mock one-two punch to his buddies so they don\u2019t think he\u2019s gone all soft and girlie. No, my guy IS all soft and girlie and that\u2019s the way I like him. Kidding! What my guy is, is funny. And chatty, and curious, and logical. And he stuffed the whole package into the arms of his Y chromosome as it shot off to its destiny in a darkened hospital room with nearby porno purchased by the infertility lab, into the collection tube on it\u2019s way to the centrifuge for a quick rinse and spin before it slipped in the petri dish and into the arms of my extracted eggs. You know, your every day conception. \n\n I love talking to Fluffy and playing with him and reading with him and trying to answer his questions and, of course, watching him eat and listening to his stories. He told one of a tree that grows and grows, providing oxygen to outer space so everyday creatures can have a peek without all that heavy gear. \n\n I just don\u2019t want to be used as a towel. It\u2019s more than I can bare and I can bare a lot.  \n\n Okay honey, why don\u2019t you go wash your hands. Honey? Let\u2019s go wash your hands. Let\u2019s wash. Time to wash! Go on and give those sticky hands a nice good scrubbadubba. Listen, please wash up. Wash. Wash them. Do it. NOW. No! NOT ON ME!\u00a0 Not on--Ahhhhhhh! \n\n Right after that, he washed hands and we brushed and brushed and brushed teeth and said he was sorry for not being a better listener and that he wanted to be a good listener and do what I tell him and eat good food and get lots of sleep because he wants to live a very very long time.  \n\n I don\u2019t know how it is that I fit into size 6 clothes and even some size 4 but the body is at its most noncomformatist self. Things have redistributed in a way that makes buying the clothes feel okay but wearing them--not. I can\u2019t go back to weight watchers. I just can\u2019t because I can\u2019t figure out how to eat 20 points a day and not be ravenously hungry, mad dog hungry, eyes darting around the room, can\u2019t follow what you are saying to me hungry. Can\u2019t do it. No more weigh-ins with an audience. No acid tabs for me. \n\n And don\u2019t say mean things on anyone\u2019s blog. Just don\u2019t do it. It hasn\u2019t happened to me yet but it just happened to my friend,  Julie , and I don\u2019t get it. Can\u2019t we see this blogging phenomenon as a giant on-going group creativity session that exercises our ability to listen and share and respond from a place of respect? It doesn\u2019t mean you have to agree or like what you read, but either click off or comment like a grown up.

{"date": "May 04, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Senator Chafee, Jane Young Brown, me, and Laura Bushwack at the meeting's end, last night. \n\n At the last meeting of Write For What's Right, we sent off a letter to Senator Lincoln Chafee, asking him to come to our area for a town hall meeting. He agreed, and last night was the night. \n\n\n\n As I was just about to leave to help set up the event, all dressed in my presentation outfit, washed and blown dry and make-uped and high heel shoed, Fluffy had a complete meltdown, the kind I\u2019ve been trying to avoid since he was born. Great gobs of snotty rivers overflowing mixed with ketchup and mustard all over his face, fingers, and body came at me from all directions. He was fried--the cumulative effect of losing an hour of sleep since daylight savings coupled with a new therapy schedule. He was devasted. I might as well have been tossing him to the side of the highway from a moving car in the middle of the night.  Don\u2019t go. Mommy. MOMMY!  Racing after me in the front yard, grasping at my arms, my hair, and the only decent dress shirt I own. And I was trying to calm him without getting any of it on me.  \n\n It was an awful feeling, the stiff arms, slipping out of his reach, looking for a dishtowel or something to drape between us before he latched on like a terrified baby octopus, all sticky tenticles and suction cups. Dave kept urging me to go, go, it will be fine if you just go, but I couldn\u2019t with Fluffy as strung out as he was. So, I went back inside and brushed teeth with him. I went into his room and we all sang one of our nightly family songs,  Spring Has Sprung , and by the time it was over, he was ready to give it a try. Thankfully, Dave called on the cell to report that Fluffy was peacefully asleep just minutes before I made the Senator\u2019s introduction.  \n\n By all accounts, the evening was a success. We met in Council Chambers of our Town Hall, a beautiful old room with high ceilings, wood beams in the rafters, wonderfully rich acoustics, and comfortable seating for about 100. I\u2019d say we nearly filled them up; our best count came in at 90. The Senator was on time, I didn\u2019t do a pratt fall on my way to the podium, the questions were articulate and passionate, and we even had some local press coverage. \n\n One woman in the audience blew me away. This woman was a powerhouse. She spoke about the prison camps in Guantanamo with such authority, the gravity and outrage simmering below the surface, her words clear and eloquent. She equated the detached scientific deliberating on the part of our government in searching for and selecting a prison site where the torture and abuse could be carried out outside any jurisdiction with the detached deliberations of the Nazis designing the ovens at the concentration camps. She said many things, including that she was in constant communication with the Senator\u2019s office.\u00a0  \n\n Constant communication.  \n\n I came away from the meeting with these two thoughts:  \n\n A handful of gals put together this meeting with all manner of small children hanging onto our legs. We passed out flyers, hammered up signs, and made calls in between tossing salads and prying small objects out of toddlers throats, between trips to the hospital, midnight fevers, and therapeutic office visits.  \n\n What if we all were like that woman in constant communication with her elected officials. I mean it. What if we picked up the phone every day and spent 3 minutes voicing our concerns and our outrage.   \n\n How could that not make an impact. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/05/town_hall_meeti.html", "title": "Town Hall Meeting"},
{"date": "May 05, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy adoring my mom, Mama Mama; December, 2001. \n\n We spend a great deal of time over here, pantless. By we, I mean Fluffy. The main reason = toilet training. Having everything out and ready, helps. He\u2019s getting the hang of it. We think the brain wave computer training is key. It's helping him tune into his body and notice when he has to go whereas before, there didn\u2019t seem to be any warning signals being transmitted at all. \n\n We were told to give him instant rewards since delaying until charts were filled with stickers made the whole thing too abstract and unrelated for him, a little as if someone were to wake you up with sudden cheering and shouts of TIME FOR A TREAT!! Wha...? So we gave him candy. Every time. Two for pee pee, four for poo. Then we cut it in half. We\u2019re talking little candies, jelly beans, But you know, we just got back from the dentist where it was discovered he has 2 cavities and I feel like I might as well have been sneaking into his room at night to yank out his tiny teeth from the roots. In addition, we had only been brushing once a day--I, foolishly sawing endlessly over the molars, ignorant of the fact that kids this age chew in the front.\u00a0 So now he\u2019s a pantless sugar junkie with rotting teeth.  \n\n Only moments ago, he was on the couch casually playing with his pantless self while Dave read from  Lilly and Her Purple Plastic Purse . Fluffy was looking over at Lilly as she danced and celebrated her movie star sunglasses with attached neck chain and musical purse, a look of deep contentment on his face, happy hands busy below, when suddenly he leapt up and raced into the bathroom to pee.\u00a0 As great yellow arcs sailed over the toilet and into the corner heater, I quietly asked Dave if this is how guys relax together after a hearty meal and would he like me to bring them in some Vogue magazines or would the Style section of The Times do for now? \n\n Now we are giving him money. Cold hard cash. He has a propeller plane bank with his name on it that he absolutely adores. He gets a nickel for pee pee and a dime for poo. Is this too much? I don\u2019t know how to navigate the world of excrement transaction. What is poo poo going for these days? We just started tonight and once he plinked in his pay and sang a little song he said,  when I grow up, I will be a builder and I will build a plane bank for whoever is still alive that I love. Will Mama Mama will still be alive? I will make it for her and I will write her name on it and I think she will love that plane like I love my plane, Mommy. I love my plane more than I love you.  \n\n Which is okay.\u00a0 Love that plane and drop in the coins, son. There are adults with Asperger\u2019s at home right now, still trying to fill their banks. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/05/filling_the_flu.html", "title": "Filling the Fluffy Plane"},
{"date": "May 08, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n  With my Mom on the Princeton campus; 1961. Taken by Dad. \n\n When my mother gave birth to her first child, they knocked her out cold--bam--for the whole thing. When very pregnant with me a few years later, they wheeled her down the hall on one of those gurneys while she screamed, I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM at the top of her lungs and then they knocked her out. By the time she had her third and last child, 11 years later, she was determined to take back the night; she wouldn\u2019t let them give her a thing.  \n\n She was Awake and Aware, just like the book she had studied during her pregnancy. Dad was her coach, but in those days, he was only allowed to help her pant and blow until she was ready to push. Then they scooted her into delivery in front of a mirror for her to watch the miraculous event only they didn\u2019t know she was blind as a bat without her glasses and the only contact lenses they made at the time were little saucers made out of glass or concrete or something astoundingly hard that she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear. Dad was on the other side of the door calling to them, Her glasses! Get her glasses! She needs her glasses! I think of that and I feel so tenderly toward them, Mom for reclaiming this passage, Dad for scrambling to help as he nervously chewed stimudents into splinters, barred from watching the arrival of his own son. My sister and I were at home under the charge of our basement tenant who was called up to babysit but was more accurately sleeping one off as we watched from the doorway and giggled each time his legs went straight up in the air, hesitated and then crashed down on the bed, flipping his whole body sideways and causing him to mumble incoherently. We thought it was a riot. Look at the funny drunk! \n\n When my mom was in her twenties, she had two small children, a husband, and a house to take care of. She was a college graduate with a flare for design and liberal politics. One wall of our dining room was taken up entirely by a huge McGovern banner, and she would often host parties with my father\u2019s architecture students and sit cross legged on the floor and sway to Dylan and Baez. She would start a round of  Kumbaya  in earnest, in her long hair and Merrimeko pantsuits and once a few years ago when a Peter Paul and Mary came on the radio singing  We Shall Overcome , she grew still and looked faraway out the window and softly cried.  We really thought we could change things. We really thought we could make it a different world. \n\n You gotta love a mom like that. Of course, she also chased my 13 year-old sister around a field with a wooden spoon held high after being called a bitch. She never made it to her, never made contact. I mean, she was a pacifist really, just trying a bit of the hard line like the time she threatened to wash our mouths out with soap but ended up lightly tapping the Ivory bar on a washcloth and swiping it halfheartedly on the tongue's surface. It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t be tough, she just wasn\u2019t strict--tucking me into bed with my high school boyfriend doesn\u2019t really qualify as strict, but we cleaned and cooked and worked odd jobs and learned to process our feelings and get in touch with what our headache was saying to us until the cows came home. \n\n Today, my sister and I made the sweetest little earrings for her, ambers and browns, earthy, just this side of jungle fever which is very her. She\u2019s a big jewelry, bottom jutting-out dancer, a cause-fighting, premie baby-holding bundle of love. If it\u2019s true what they say, that life is the school and love is the lesson, then she\u2019s on board for the whole curriculum, signing up for nearly every class and even extra credit projects, stumbling into class breathless with some exciting discovery or fresh outrage, coming in just a little late, making every kind of noise imaginable on her way to her seat, dropping things, laughing, sneezing, coughing, clearing her throat, grunting as she lowers into her chair and then, just when you think she\u2019s all settled in, out comes the Tupperware and she methodically puts together a little snack, silverware clangs to the floor, she licks her fingers, bites, chews, and swallows so audibly you swear she\u2019s been miked. She\u2019s a noise machine. A noise machine wrapped in batik and natural fibers, infused with a stunning amount of energy and a longing for fun, for being a part of things, for being let in. She\u2019ll about die for a good time. In fact, one night during dinner she almost did; Dave was cracking her up so much she fell off her chair and to the floor. Dave carried on with his funny story because sometimes Mom  can  be theatrical but thankfully we caught on in time, picked her up and gave her a good slap on the back.   \n\n She\u2019s one of the people who\u2019s hasn\u2019t figured it all out yet and this I relate to. She\u2019s out there, in the big messy world, giving it her best shot, trudging along, despite her preoccupation with getting the right fabric for the new pillows and planting herself on the couch with stacks of Home Goods catalogues and occasionally going blank when I\u2019m telling her something because she\u2019s sifting through her To Do list in her mind, despite her absolute compulsion to correct and ever so slight allergy to being wrong, she is out there mixing it up, trying new things, running around in the playroom with Fluffy, wanting the closeness, wanting to connect, wanting her glasses on until the very end.  \n\n Listen, I\u2019m with her. Don\u2019t knock me out and make sure to always help me find my glasses. It might be scary to be awake and aware sometimes, but that\u2019s what I want, too.

Taken by Dave. \n\n Listen, stay closely tuned because any minute I'm going to spill what I heard a kid say in the pool the other day about exactly what kind of a poopy head he thinks his brother is AND reveal whose nose I nearly wiped with MY OWN HAND and guess what? Unbeknownst to me, Fluffy came into my room last night as I was bent over in the nude, reaching for my pjs, and in the blink of an eye, so to speak, he stuck out pointer and poked me right in the butt hole.\n\n \n\n In less than a week, United States Senator Lincoln Chafee will be arriving in our little town to lead our community in a town-hall-style meeting in response  Write for What's Right's  request and I am slated to introduce him. Okay, maybe I will be addressing a couple of bums as they roam the back wall, looking in vain for Lorna Dunes and bad coffee or maybe it will be an audience of the half dozen W4WR members with a few of their neighbors in tow, or maybe we will get a good turn out and fill the beautiful old room with its high rafters, cushioned seats, and framed black and white photos of our quaint township from years past dotting the walls.  \n\n All I can say is that I will be at the dais, reading the BIG-LETTERED, double-spaced, hopefully appropriate, introduction into the mike in front of grown ups and everyone's pointers will be in their own laps. Or up at their mouths should I misspeak which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do but I was always the gal who worried that I would fart loudly in an interview or blurt out something incredibly ghastly and humiliating and then have to stand there and take it, the horrified expressions, the deadly silence, the pulse pounding inside my ears, my red, red face. \n\n I\u2019m out of practice. I\u2019m out of practice in the big world, the world where conversations flow and people go to the bathroom on their own, where passengers sit right up front beside me and don\u2019t require a constant stream of snacks or the occasional retrieval of gagged-out bites of p&j. But more than that, I have entered the land of spazz. Perhaps it\u2019s fatigue, deep fatigue that has permanently shut down certain reaction pathways or rerouted them because although my reflexes can sometimes still come through, (I can catch a rolling egg or a falling glass container with astounding alacrity, compute the disastrous outcomes of every little kid maneuver) in most ways, the nerves and coordination centers are shot. \n\n I put the OJ away with no top only to take it out moments later and vigorously shake it--cascades of sticky juice rain down, I gasp and sputter. I snip the phone cord in two with the kitchen scissors while unpacking a box, talking on the phone, cleaning up, and making lunch. Tonight, I dropped the tin foil wrap as I took it out of the oven; searing hot filet of cod flew through the air and landed on my foot, the oven door, the floor, the rug, splattering up the side of the island counter.\u00a0 I guess it\u2019s an issue of over-multitasking but I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s the waitress in me. Or the mother in me. Or the panic in me. I let plenty slip, but overall I feel like I\u2019m unicycling down the street with about ten flaming torches circling in the air while my husband, god bless him, lumbers along next to me, dribbling one enormous beach ball: concentrating, exasperated, overwhelmed. \n\n To be fair, this is not a his versus hers issue but I can see how that happens, I can see how the sexes start lining up on opposites sides of the room, whipping out their notebooks and jotting things down. We don\u2019t do that, or haven\u2019t yet, but maybe the point is I should trade in my unicycle and flamers for Dave\u2019s big ball, bring things down a few notches so maybe I won\u2019t keep bumping into everything all the time. \n\n See, I\u2019m trying to be true to myself, lead a life that reflects who I am, what I want and need and long for, feel inspired by. I want time with my man, real time, like when we slept on the shores of Lake Tahoe and woke up to stare over our own bare feet at the majestic mountains reflected in the cool limpid waters; I want time with my dear son, digging carelessly in the spring sand, playing car crash, curling up with his strong small form on the couch to read books that make him laugh out loud with delight; I want time alone in my office with the orange wall, writing writing writing; I want time with the grown ups, shaking our fists, sending out letters, saying enough!; I want time to touch fabrics, turn them over in my hand, to string beads, to sketch faces and birds dragging dried straws of grass across the front lawn. I want the house to be familiar, funky, cockeyed, welcoming, comfortable, relaxed, warm, and clean enough. I want there to be some systems, places for things and not because I will start ticking or hacking up bodies if things are OUT OF ORDER but because I DON\u2019T WANT TO WASTE TIME LOOKING FOR THINGS.  \n\n So, the town hall meeting is coming up and my morning writing time is sucked through the open door as I race out to print flyers and mail reminders and call the local papers. And then add another project to the mix, and a SEWING one at that, and I wonder: am I taking care of myself or am I tossing more torches to the air, like a trick pony, like a gal in the middle ring? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thismom.blogs.com/write4whatsright/"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/pointer_in_the_.html", "title": "Torches in the Air"},

I\u2019m going to perch it on the shelves behind my computer so I can see her every time I sit down to write.  \n\n The very first words out of my mouth were, \u201chi, birdy\u201d and either because of that or because I have always loved birds, it became my nickname. My mom still calls me Bird from time to time and I feel dear and safe when she says it. Moms have a way of doing that for you.  \n\n I had a pet finch for a while growing up and got a hand-me-down cockatiel in my early 20s.\u00a0 I never kept either one in their cage for long; they would fly around my room or around my apartment dropping poop splatter bombs everywhere. Chauncy, the cockatiel, would flap over to my bed, land on my chest, and gently peck at my mouth for good morning kisses.  \n\n Birds are wonderful, quirky, beautiful, oddball creatures, both magnificently agile and comically awkward. But not bird brains. Really. What about Irene Pepperberg at the  Alex Foundation  who taught that parrot to communicate? Not just to mimic words, but to THINK and REASON? And the experiments comparing crows and ravens? Okay, apparently the crows are dumb as stones, but ravens... now that\u2019s another story. They problem solve and use tools, steal the sun from the house of the  sky chief  and fling it into the air, returning light to the rest of the world. \n\n A couple of robin red breasts have been busy building a nest in the crook of our roof by the front windows. We have been watching them every morning. It reminds me of our stay at my mom\u2019s summer house during our second IVF attempt, the one that worked, the one that made Fluffy. A house wren built a nest on a heart shaped basket hanging by the side door. We watched her progress, watched her sit still and attentive, keen to every sound and movement around her through her side-staring eye, watched as 5 delicate eggs appeared the day we discovered that the megadoses of hormones shot into my butt had created the same number of eggs in me; we watched them hatch and silently scream, tiny beaks opened impossibly wide, necks scraggly and desperate like they were choking on air. We watched them shuffle about in the close quarters, fledge, and fly. \n\n Today is the first IEP meeting at the public preschool where Fluffy had his evaluations. We don\u2019t want him at that school, but this is the first step in documenting what is right and good for him. Dave and I have written our goals which may look a little different than the assembled team expects. We want Fluffy to wake up to his  own authentic desire  to connect to his peers, we want him to look at the teachers and fellow students because he is interested in what they will do and say and not because he is being asked to look.  \n\n Fluffy still is one of those little baby birds from the days of his conception, shuffling about in the nest of our house, getting ready to move to the edge. And I\u2019m just like any other mama bird in the land. I won\u2019t take him to the edge of the nest until my instincts say he is ready. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://birdinthehand.blogspot.com/", "http://www.alexfoundation.org/research/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0152656618/qid=1114778846/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6397802-2908930?v=glance&s=books"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/its_anbsp_mod_m.html", "title": "Toward the Edge of the Nest"},
{"date": "April 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy making sand bombs; April 20, 2005 \n\n Dave put Fluffy to bed on Wednesday. This is HUGE. Aside from a handful of days last fall, I have put Fluffy to bed for the last 1,507 nights. Fluffy was game but a tad anxious--he\u00a0 tried to negotiate for a one day stay, but it was a no-go; I left after dinner, as planned.  \n\n I wish I could tell you I sailed off to some hip coffee shop or browsed the aisles of an eclectic bookstore, sipping seltzer, head jamming to the inspiring music pumping from the sound system, took in an independent film, met some friends for Thai food, etc. etc. But no. I live in the boonies; at this time of year after 7pm, there\u2019s the grocery store and the CVS, maybe Applebees and the local theaters showing strictly mainstream doo doo. So I sat in the car and talked on the cell with  Kim \u00a0 until my bladder nearly burst, ran to the grocery store to pee, and then drove around aimlessly passing the time. I was too exhausted to embark on any real adventure, too dog tired from yanking giant plants out of the ground, dragging whole trees across the bald expanse of dirt and stones in my maniacal attempts to restore some balance and charm to the construction eyesore that is my front yard. I must have moved about ten large bushes and had the wide-leg-hobble stagger to prove it.  \n\n So finally, I went over to my friend, Rosemary\u2019s, even though it was smack in the middle of the bedtime routine for her two kids and all attempts to call first were thwarted by her failure or refusal to sign up for call waiting. I\u2019m such an INSTANT junkie. When I call someone and get a busy signal I am alternately outraged and confused like suddenly I have to communicate by smoke signals or pony post. I arrived and was welcomed in, while Rosemary\u2019s elderly and ornery mother hid in her grandson\u2019s room, calling for MORE WEIGHT WATCHERS ICE CREAM POPS, refusing to come out for a hello.  WHO?  NO, I  DON'T  REMEMBER KYRA.  \n\n Four-year old Aiden, and his 16-month old sister, Elise, were in their pjs, all scruffy headed and adorable, in fine form for the end of the day, happily marching about in that very kid way. Elise offered me soggy biscuits from her saliva hand, and talked in whole paragraphs of animated gibberish, tossing in the occasional perfectly enunciated real word, head tilted to one side, flirting, running in and out of the room playing her own brand of peekaboo. Aiden wielded his grandmother\u2019s walker, equipped with a handy lidded compartment, wheeling the entire thing around like it was his own street corner food cart, selling us cookies at exorbitant prices, extorting us, returning to serve up banana splits, double decker chocolate cookies, and then, of course, our bill. It was a seamless and glorious stream of pretend play and something that no one in the house thought anything of. It\u2019s just what kids do. But for me, it was bittersweet toddler/little kid anthropology. Of course, I remember doing that, and the kids I used to baby-sit did that, but if Fluffy were to suddenly start pretending to be a food merchant, asking for payment, delivering bills, etc. it would be a MILESTONE EVENT, the kind to send Dave and me into wild embrace, tossing popcorn in the air.  \n\n I heard a dad with a child on the spectrum say that you never stop grieving. He said it gets easier and milder but still, the grief is always there.  \n\n I don\u2019t know.  \n\n At the last therapeutic play visit with Dr. H., Dave wore a soft sheep mask. At first, Fluffy wanted him to take it off right away. It\u2019s not that pretend play is too pretend for him, it\u2019s that it\u2019s too real. When Daddy wears the mask, he BECOMES a sheep and Daddy disappears. But they kept practicing, a few seconds here, a few seconds there and after a while, it had become a little game of phew! Dave wore the mask, then took it off and, phew! Here\u2019s Daddy! They even got Fluffy to put on the mask, only for a few seconds; but, he did it. Dave would flip a phantom switch--Click! Oh, look! A sheep! Where did Fluffy go? Click! Ah, here he is! Hey, where did that silly sheep go? And in this tiny baby step way, the pretending became tolerable and then, even fun. \n\n I got the call at 8:15 from Dave that the eagle had landed, that Fluffy succumbed to the land of sleep. It had gone remarkably well. Some whimpering and calling for me at the end, but nothing serious. They hadn\u2019t even needed to resort to the emergency video. A far cry from the last attempt two months ago with 40 minutes of refusing to get into the bed with Daddy, calling out for Mommy and racing to the window, hoping to glance the white beams from the headlights of Mommy\u2019s returning red car, returning just in time, to save him--save him from this terrible fate, the awful assault of being put to bed by his gentle and adoring father, the man who loves him more than anyone on the planet. \n\n  I stayed for a little while longer at Rosemary\u2019s, drinking my chamomile tea, stealing a little grown up conversation, and when I drove home, I felt only mildly sad. I think it\u2019s because I believe that Fluffy is learning how to do the things that most kids do without thinking, how to be a kid. It\u2019s not the typical path, it\u2019s not the typical house, but there\u2019s something about slowing things down so much and paying attention that is, well, a gift. That's what the therapist I starting seeing back in the fall when the shit first hit the fan said; there is a gift in all this. You just don\u2019t see it yet, but it\u2019s there. Part of me felt comforted and hopeful and part of me felt like slugging her repeatedly with my purse. \u00a0 Find the gift in THAT.   \n\n But I think she was right. I think there\u2019s a whole pile of gifts in all this.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iamprettynyc.com/index.php"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/dave_put_fluffy.html", "title": "Me: 1,507, Dave: 4"},
{"date": "April 19, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t In our house, we ration out tampons. Fluffy gets one a day. He loves to play with them. He makes them into guns; he calls them his shooter. The college gal who plays with Fluffy a few afternoons a week arrived as we were playing out in the yard on a glorious spring day. Mr. and Mrs. Robin Red Breast were hop-hoping around with what looked like, whole bales of hay in their beaks, daffodils were smiling their cheerful yellow faces by the front picket fence, and Fluffy and I were playing with his tampon shooter.  I call these my shooters but they\u2019re really Mommy\u2019s tampons , Fluffy explained to our dear mortified college gal. \n\n It's funny because I know they're not the usual toy for a 4 year old, but it's really just some string, cardboard and a wad of cotton--your basic craft supplies. Anyway, it beats the panty liners which would get torn into little sticky bits that got positively  everywhere . At least when the shooters lose their appeal, clean up's a breeze: just grab them by their tail and scoop up the tiny cardboard tubes, which make pretty good mini-spy scopes, by the way.   \n\n Later that day he asked me,  Mommy, how do tampons help ladies have babies? \n\n Fluffy asks the tough questions. While driving home from a country hike, he wanted to know,  once the dinosaurs became extinct, how did people get here on planet earth? since a person has to be born from another person?  Well, a looooong time ago, a certain kind of ape slowly became a cave person and then that cave person slowly became a person like us.  Yes, but how did that ape that became a cave person who turned into us, how did HE get here?  Well, blah blah about evolution and the early mammals.  Yes, but how did that first mammal get here? since that mammal had to come from another mammal?  And on to a brief discussion of the theoretical primordial pool of elements and sun and bolts of lightening.  \n\n You know, scratch that. This guy, Adam, sprang from the god's garden of eden, leading the earliest known GOP meeting of one where it was discovered that the pain in his side was actually a woman who needed a good plucking and so, Eve arrived and immediately began searching for snakes.  \n\n Or so they would have us teach our children in school. \n\n Which is partly why I'm considering home schooling. That, and the 14 other kids in the class who have to spend 70% of their school day waiting, waiting, waiting. Sit down. Raise your hand. Sit down. Wait. Are you waiting? Are you ready? You don't look ready! I don't see your hands on your lap! You don't look like you're ready to make your diamondback snake out of this one snake cut out and these four diamond-shapes and this one rattle shape and this one crayon for the eye-dot! Won't that be fun! To make this scary snake that you must never touch because they are scary look how scary the scary snakes are! Aren't they scary? In my classroom, kids would freely choose the materials they needed to decorate their fantastic, fascinating snake; they would reach their curious and energetic hands into overflowing bins of assorted paper scraps, buttons, macaroni, crayons, markers, and tampons.

He directs and I comply and the whole thing feels like a bad audition.

Just play around, you know, really have fun with it. \n\n I\u2019m trying to decode and decipher, all the while wishing Dr. H, Fluffy\u2019s Asperger doctor, would magically appear and lead me inside his brain and point to the folds that could take a little stretching because all my attempts fall flat.

I bought this, or rather, Santa bought this for our household at Christmas time because our old coffee pot was a million years old and you couldn\u2019t adequately clean inside it and who knows how much micro-organistic growth I\u2019d been consuming for years and years. In fact, maybe that\u2019s why I've developed such early alzheimer\u2019s, an overgrowth of fungal and bacterial colonies in my brain, crowding out the thought processes or maybe it\u2019s like a frat party in there and everyone is baring their bellies and doing their best cabbage patch and drinking jello funnel squirts or whatever the kids are doing now and it\u2019s so damn loud, the brain cells are all, Dinner...whha\u2019?  \n\n Anyway, my finger is so f'ing burned I had to take off my wedding rings (now we\u2019re married, and now we\u2019re extra married!) because of the burn bubble, right up under the ring area.  \n\n\n\n I blame Dave. I do. I bought this coffee maker, thinking I was doing a GOOD thing. It has a timer so you can set it up the night before and wake up to the gurgling sounds of coffee brewing while heavenly aromas fill the house, like the cartoon hand dancing in the air--finger beckoning your sniffing nose to the kitchen while you are still in dreamland. It\u2019s handsome, a Krups, with what I thought was a warmer tray at the base but, in fact, turns out to be a black circle, colored differently for reasons unknown to human kind. No warmer, no heater, just a different color for show. It has a button that gets depressed when you put the carafe on the fake warmer, and a button on the carafe lid that also gets depressed when the carafe is in place and coffee starts streaming down from the spout.  \n\n Problem #1: the carafe lid button is also \u2018open\u2019 whenever it\u2019s in\nplace, so once coffee finishes dripping, air flow exchange continuously\ntakes place and the coffee immediately begins to cool off. Problem #2:\nnothing keeps the continuously cooling coffee warm. Problem #3:\nscrewing on the lid is a process that takes enormous concentration and\neffort, something I\u2019m usually in short supply of at the end of the\nevening and something I\u2019m almost never availed to first thing in the\nmorning. Problem #4: Coffee streams out the faulty lid and pools all\nover the counter no matter how carefully you aim it over the cup. \n\n Anyway, blah blah blah. Dave is always lacing into this coffee pot and even though I agree, I tend to ignore him or defend the kruppy pot. This morning I agreed to hear all his complaints as we were standing counterside, anticipating our morning transfusion. \n\n And at the tail end of the litany, I joined in, which felt very liberating. I leaned over and angrily pushed in the brewing button, the one that is depressed when the coffee is dripping into the carafe and lets in all the air that further cools the coffee that is never really hot to begin with in our estimation, and lo and behold, scalding hot coffee screamed out of the top and onto my hand, my left hand, directly onto ring man.  \n\n I guess, if we were to split hairs, it really isn't Dave's fault. I mean,  he  didn't buy the thing; technically,  he  didn't push that button, it wasn't  his  hand foolishly shoved directly under the path of newly brewed coffee. All I know is, that thing is now atop the plastic mountain of garbage bags that graces our front porch and Dave is off to pick up its replacement. And one of my many buttons has gotten a little depressed. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/you_know_i_burn.html", "title": "That Coffee Pot"},

In his whole 4+ years of life, he\u2019s never thrown up and so I\u2019m not used to it, not used to him clutching his tummy, crying ow ow and then watching as partially beaten egg whites erupt and cascade and spew forth from his mouth, his little ashen face up against the silver salad bowl, eyes rolling back in his head.

It\u2019s just the flu. We\u2019ve called the doctor several times; everyone is getting it. I know this. But there is some small part of me that wonders if he is going to die. \n\n I think I\u2019m slightly hysterical in this area--hysterical in the way that looks calm on the outside but inside there is shallow breathing and fingers fluttering and clutching up at my neck. My imagination is too vivid or gory--grotesque really, sidling up against all the freak ways my child could die and no one would believe it but still he\u2019d be dead and I\u2019d never get over it. But, you know, the second I sit down to write fiction, my head rattles like a petrified hard boiled egg: Ah, let\u2019s see, this is a story about a girl who wakes up one day and looks\nout the window and then, she, then, she looks out the window and then,\nshe wants to do something but then, someone stops her and then, she\ntries a bunch of stuff and eventually prevails and at the end, we all\nfeel joyful and teary and ready to conquer the world.  \n\n So, I have a slight panic disorder and Fluffy is sick and the little white torpedo disappeared inside his vulnerable and warm bum and now the fever\u2019s down to 100 and he\u2019s been sleeping most of the day but hasn\u2019t peed since 5 am and the doctor says that if he doesn\u2019t by bedtime we should take him to the ER for IV.  \n\n An IV? \n\n Why do they say things like that and then hurry to get off the phone, like, okay, just try to get him to pee and if he doesn\u2019t then bring him in for open heart surgery; have a nice weekend! Okay, thanks! We\u2019ll try to get him to pee by the end of the day and if he doesn\u2019t, well, we\u2019ll come by and slash your tires and squeeze crazy glue in your armpits; have a great night! \n\n Maybe I\u2019m too angry these days, maybe I need to rethink wanting the doctors to be sort of  into  helping sick people and schools to actually  follow  the IEPs and therapies to be  provided  in a timely manner to kids on the spectrum rather than to ask the families to go through an 8 month evaluation process, a 4 month application process, and then wait up to 2 years for services to be provided when everyone keeps talking about time being the most critical factor for healing.  \n\n Maybe someone can help me find a suppository suitable for  my  vulnerable, hot ass. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/tummy_bug.html", "title": "Tummy Bug"},

{"date": "April 02, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n \n\n Well, he didn\u2019t pee and we went to the ER for IV. Fluffy was passed out in my arms as we loaded into the car. The newness of it all woke him up and he wanted to know why he was allowed to be riding in the front seat\u00a0 on my lap with no seat belt (the hospital is, literally, around the corner) and I told him we were going to the hospital to get liquids to hydrate his body. Oh. He dozed off again, probably wondering if they would taste like the wierd Gatorade were were plying him with or the vile Pediolyte or maybe like the yummy ginger ale that he wanted more and more of only to expel it fountain-like into the silver salad bowl. (More lettuce, anyone?) \n\n They took us right away and I made a mental note to make sure all future emergencies would occur on a Friday night around 6. After the initial intake, we were led to our curtained room and Fluffy wanted to know what were the fluids? Would it be water? I told him it was salt water and that they were going to put in inside him through a tube! Right into the little tubes inside of him! So he would soon feel much better and get lots of liquid but his tummy wouldn't have to feel crampy and bad and there would be no throwing up! \n\n The doctor came in with two nurses in tow. I told Fluffy they were going to put the tube in his arm and that at first, it would feel like a pinch, like a bee sting, like a shot. Maybe the nurses were doing a fine job; maybe it's that Fluffy has no veins--he\u2019s just porcelain skin and puff over bones. But they wrapped that elastic around his upper arms and squeezed like they were making a balloon animal, like they were making sausages, squeezed so he was crying and panicking while they pushed and patted and poked at his inner elbow as if he was part of a practicum and not an  actual patient . He wanted it off, immediately. He didn\u2019t know it was the easy part, he didn\u2019t know that very soon he would be begging for the big, fat, blue rubber band.  \n\n I wanted the nurses to be like magicians and do the insertion, blood drawing, and drip set up thing in seconds, flash flash, all done! Tiny pricks and lots of distraction and humor and before you know it, fluids are pumping into my son, erasing the hollow eyes and blue chapped lips and listlessness. Truthfully, they didn\u2019t seem that organized, didn\u2019t have quite the right blue top or flush set up or something they were talking about. They looked around as if they were prepping for a patient who might show up not one upon which they were displaying all their various tubes and wrappers and needles, slap slap, still looking for a vein and I tried to stay calm but said, \u201cMaybe you ought to have gotten more organized before you came in?\u201d and \u201cDo you think you could do this whole thing more, um, efficiently?\u201d \n\n When they finally stuck the needle in, Fluffy screamed the no sound scream and his whole body went rigid. At this point, a third nurse came in, very LOUDLY making silly conversation, asking him if he was 10 years old, no? 14? or perhaps the new doctor?? I started to wave her off, IX-nay on the OUD-lay, too many people in the room, it\u2019s going to overwhelm him, but it turned out Fluffy liked her; she produced a big electronic toy that we used to play  Joy To The World  and other Jewish favorites until the IV had started its countdown. He only tried to pull it out once. When I held his arm very straight, he started to relax and, surprisingly, fell asleep watching the numbers tick down, listening to the swoooosh click beep beep.  \n\n It dripped for an hour. He peed by the time we got home; we gave him one more suppository for the fever, and he slept solidly for hours, his pj bulging where the box of gauze had been taped to the hole in his arm. \n\n This morning, he is still sick but the little sips every 15 minutes are staying down. I\u2019m relieved and tired in that way that robs my body of all coordination and sense. I open a door and walk into the wall beside the hinge; I take the juice out of the fridge, set it in the sink, and close the empty glass inside on the top shelf by the milk. While brushing my teeth, I tossed my brush in the air, loaded with toothpaste all lathered up from sawing it across my teeth, just threw it up in the air like a baton and reacted like a TV drunk, looking quizzically at my hand and then the mirror, like, huh? what the? before I pieced together what happened, picked it up, wiped the excess paste with a little quick foot shuffle and continued brushing to the sound of a thousand peepers outside in the marsh waking up to spring. Spring is here! sang the baby frogs; time for IV fluids! \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/er_iv.html", "title": "ER IV"},
{"date": "April 05, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy with balloon, February, 2004. Taken by Dave. \n\n My neighbor\u2019s daughter rang our bell last night. She was clutching a box of Honey Graham crackers that hadn\u2019t gone over big at her house and wanted to know, did we want the rest? Fluffy, clutching my neck like a monkey, especially needy after 5 days of illness and one nightmare memory of needles the size of toothbrushes being shoved into his threadlike veins, reached for them like Juliet did the false poison in the Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s movie version, all raspy-throated and passion and risk, \u201cGIVE IT TO ME!\u201d  \n\n\n\n Oh, no. Thank you, but we can\u2019t have that. Why? Because it has gluten in it. What\u2019s gluten? It\u2019s a wheat protein that clogs up your brain, dear. Bye bye! And so, the neighbor\u2019s daughter flipped her hair, said, \u201cOkay!\u201d and skipped back home. \n\n Poor Fluffy. I made pizza tonight, and while I must say, it was some of the best darn gluten free casein free pizza I\u2019ve made thus far, it's still a far cry from the real McCoy. I see his eyes light up when I say Pizza Night. He races to the table, grabs a slice, tears into a bite, and then chews it like a floppy muppet, his nostrils flaring like a diplomat dining on doo doo in front of an esteemed head of state.  \n\n You\u2019d think I\u2019d be tagging everyone\u2019s kid as on the spectrum--one moment of inflexibility, one story of sleep resistance, one instance of not saying hello. But it\u2019s actually the opposite. Everywhere I go I see normal, typical kids. I hear well meaning moms laughingly complain about driving their son EVERYWHERE because he has so many friends; I see countless kids on our blocks darting beneath the new spring sunshine in short sleeved Ts with softballs and hockey sticks, on bikes and scooters--part of a pack, the pack that IS kids.   \n\n Of all the many kids I know and people I know with kids they know, there was only one child for whom I had the tiniest bit of concern and this was only from stories her mom told me, not from direct observation. Because I wish we could have known about Fluffy ages ago, because I think that may have given us the magic jump on treatment that could mean the difference between his recovery or not, I wanted to say something to this mom, my friend, about her child. But it\u2019s tricky. For as much as everyone says to me that Fluffy is wonderful and look at all his other strengths! and that autistic kids are gifts, and you know, none of our children end up being who we think we want them to be! the truth is, hearing someone wonder if your child might be anywhere on the spectrum is an affront:  Oh, yeah? Well, you're bloated and jowly and we always thought your son was a bit off.   \n\n If you know someone who\u2019s child is autistic, you might think you know what it's like but you don't. If you're  really  asking and  really  listening, you may get a pretty good idea. I think the truth of it is so scary or so unfamiliar that most people say, oh dear, how hard, and mean it but then tuck all further feelings and thoughts away, far away like the first handfuls of stuffing in the turkey hole. Neighbors who circulate around the perimeter of special needs children in the work place still don\u2019t have much to say to an actual family living across the street other than cheery hand waving and smiles and how is Fluffy doing? to which the only reply is, great, because he is.  \n\n Yesterday, I saw a mom of a girl who goes to the preschool that Fluffy had to leave last fall. She co-owns a funky eclectic gift and clothing store in town and I skipped in during a quick playroom break to buy something for my mom\u2019s upcoming 70th birthday and there she was--very sweet and friendly, asking things in general, about Fluffy in particular since, it seems, their goat gave birth to triplets that morning and her daughter wondered out of the blue if Fluffy would like to come see them? Her daughter was there, as it happens, standing in her little skirt outfit, hair a lopsided pony tail with beautiful tendrils askew. She was breathless in her animated description of the baby goats and how big she, herself, is now, almost 4! \n\n She looked right at me and told her story and smiled and nodded and wiped stray hairs out of her eyes in that charming way little girls do that never does seem to get the hair out of their eyes and when she left, I said to her mom, we\u2019d love to come see the baby goats, but do you think your daughter will mind if Fluffy doesn\u2019t pay attention to her? And she said, no no, she just LOVES to share things with all her friends. And then it happened, that ache in my chest, that ache that tugs at the muscles in my face and I have to go into overdrive to make sure my face remains somewhat stable because of course she loves to share with her friends.  \n\n The mom asked about Fluffy, (Oh, he\u2019s great!) and about us, and here I paused because I wanted to say, well, you know, we\u2019re hanging in there but this has been the hardest, loneliest, most emotionally stressful year of my life, but I was at the check-out counter and there were customers behind me and she was working and we don\u2019t even really know each other, so instead I added a few worry stones to my order on the counter and said, We\u2019re okay. \n\n They say it\u2019s an epidemic, that one out of every 166 children born now is on the spectrum, and that number may increase in the next five to ten years as we stockpile toxins in our environment and our bodies. I hope that\u2019s not true. But since it is  Autism Awareness Month , I\u2019ve decided to order some  pins and bumper stickers  and slap one on my shirt and one on my car and start opening up the dialogue. Because there is still secrecy and shame and fear and misunderstanding about this perplexing condition. Because these children  are  wonderful  and  gifts and do have  amazing  strengths but listen to me now, having them sends you into a  whole new realm ; you pass through this painful slit in the everyday and into  something else . Even when you're used to the view, it is not having kids + autism; it is, most assuredly, something completely different.   \n\n I went to the State House last week to an Autism Rally (give me an A!) and came home wearing an Autism Awareness Pin and Fluffy said, what\u2019s Autism? I was about to tell him when something else got his attention but I know he\u2019ll be back and I know the next question he\u2019ll ask is, do I have it? And we need to come up with an answer that tells the truth, the truth I choose to believe about his Asperger\u2019s, not necessarily the truth that is shared by some of the experts. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/cs/awarenessmonth/l/blaware.htm", "http://www.victorystore.com/magnets/car_magnet/autismmagnets.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/april_autism_aw.html", "title": "April = Autism Awareness Month"},

So alive about vagina love rockets! I don\u2019t know what it means but it sounds so celebratory, so spring-like, so full of life!

And do images like that fill us vagina rockets with feelings of being so alive? I think not. Furthermore, what about broadcasting products that are all about vagina rockets? Products that would fill women with overflowing rivers of wetness and tissues ripe with pulsing blood vessels and the promise of explosions that crack and then spill off the sides with a rushing warmth all around, like warm eggs breaking open and streaming into crevices. What about products like that promising to last for 48 hours on end? Hmmm? \n\n So alive about the tree guy! \n\n What?  \n\n Oh. Well, as an aside of sorts, the tree guy did come by the other day and he was cuter than I remembered from the last time he was here last summer, slicing down 40 foot tree rockets in seconds flat to make room for the addition that we slapped on over the fall and winter. Also cooler, hipper. He strode in decked out in his work clothes--I\u2019m a sucker for guys in their outdoorsy work clothes (but nothing compares to what my guy wears to work everyday! Hi honey!!) and after he commented on how great the addition looked, he said, \u2018Man, you must be STOKED!\u201d to which I replied, Yes, we are stoked, like that: Yes. We. Are. Stoked.  \n\n I just don\u2019t sound cool, certainly now, but really, ever.

I\u2019m wandering around with my time card looking for the clock so I punch-out from my mothering position. Where is that damn clock?\u00a0 Where is that long metal column of slots that cradles the cards until everyone comes streaming back in on Monday morning, clutching to-go cups of joe like I did at Academy Studios north of San Francisco back when I was a fabricator? \n\n That\u2019s right, I told lies for a living. \n\n No. A fabricator: one who fabricates things for museum installations. I worked in the plant department and if that sounds at all glamorous, let me draw your attention to the tree outside your window and let\u2019s begin counting the leaves, shall we? Yes, I cut leaves for the trees and then painted them green, all the billion shades and hues and nuances of green with veins, and bits of browning and yellowing, and a spattering of bug bites and various other imperfections.  \n\n It reminded me a little of working at the lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering extracting the DNA out of the snips of mouse tails in its overall tedium but, in that case, you really couldn\u2019t go all foggy because the next thing you know, you\u2019ve drooled in the microtube and that sample is now a wash, quite literally, awash in your saliva. Or worse, you\u2019ve skipped a tube along the 126 samples and now every one after that skip is, of course, mislabeled and the whole rack is scrapped.  Mice, beware; the technician has re-entered the Mouse Room.   \n\n This, or course, is strictly hypothetical since I was a clear-eye technician who spent every moment at the bench in wide awake efficiency, though thoughts of slicing myself in the eye with one of the ubiquitous razor blades and visions of me slammin' back the flask of radioactivity like a shot of tequila did streak across my consciousness from time to time. \n\n What was I, insane?  \n\n At Academy, sitting in the parking lot under the glorious California sun where my leave-cutting partner and I would roll the table, supplies, and our chairs, I could lapse into bouts of neglect; who\u2019s gonna notice the extra lobe on a handful of maple leaves once you\u2019ve tossed together an entire tree? Mixing paint was another thing; can you even imagine the multitudes of greens required to realistically recreate the vegetation all around us? This challenge was only exacerbated by our Plant Team Leader who really  was  insane. She had to approve our color but was not equipped with any skills in the color mixing department; frankly, all she knew how to say was that our green was either \u201ca bit too blue\u201d followed by \u201ca bit too yellow\u201d or the other way \u2018round, or\u00a0 \u201cyes! That\u2019s it now; do you see?\u201d even though in many instances, my partner and I had done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW TO THE SAMPLE between repeated visits to her office. \n\n She knew about plants but nothing about management and even less about art. I had been hired as a trainee and I longed for someone to, well, actually train me. She was, though, a little, like, totally into communication, and so for a while, the entire plant department was made to sit in a circle and process, making sure to sign for and receive the \u2018talking stick\u2019 before speaking our truth.  I come in peace.   Gather round whilst I stab you with this talking stick.  Once, while talking out a particular fabrication strategy with my dear coworker, Cheryl, our Team Leader gently touched our shoulders and with a rueful smile and an amused shake of the head, allowed that I was PINK while Cheryl was clearly PURPLE and therefore, we would not, and could never, see eye to eye. After she left, Cheryl looked at me blankly and said, \"Let\u2019s never speak of this again\u201d. \n\n It was all far superior to my cold-calling stint, attempting to sell partial rights to a TV documentary that I grew to believe wasn\u2019t even being shot, and doing this all on spec. At least at Academy I got a paycheck, once my time card was punched and signed. \n\n Which brings me back to the currently misplaced time clock. I\u2019m ready to punch out now. Really.

That would be the end of Susie; there would be a red face of outrage, an explosion, and then wisps of hair and ragged fabric floating down to the floor.  \n\n I think death is on my mind these days. I know, the dream was of pregnancy, but that brings death to mind for me because it\u2019s since birthing my child that death has sidled into the room and picked out a permanent place to take a load off. I don\u2019t know if anyone else feels this way but having a child has made me acutely aware of death, that it\u2019s coming, that I can\u2019t know anything about it, anything, when, where, to whom first, and what it will be like. Fairly large chunks of time are whizzing by and although I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve got a good stretch in front of me, there's no escaping the fact: I\u2019m getting closer and closer to the end.  \n\n Making meaning out of my turn here matters more and more to me. I never pulled a career together, never made my mark in that way. And it looks like the three kids in the kooky big house in the country with the dog suddenly tearing through the hall knocking over the bowl of clementines which roll in every direction while the husband trots down the stairs securing his necktie only to topple over one of escaped pieces of fruit making further merriment and hilarious calamity--all that isn\u2019t happening anytime soon. And I don\u2019t think it makes so much sense to send in my application to the Peace Corps or to Harvard Medical at this point. \n\n What I have been doing is living with Fluffy and his darling Dad. A glorious adventure, goofy long-hair dog or no. Every day I thank the stars, those holes to heaven, as Jack Johnson sings, because heavenliness does shake through and bits of it are all around on my life, this life, this road. Life life life. It\u2019s a blessed trip, full of heartbreaking loss and tremendous gifts and its own mysterious momentum. I\u2019m going along and suddenly I look out the window at the turn I\u2019ve made, usually long after the fork because I\u2019m always quite a bit down the road before I even notice it. Huh! Look at that. I guess we\u2019re headed in this direction. There\u2019s a kind of surrender that has to happen because you really would get torn apart if you tried to hang on to the other road, to where it forked off, to where you thought you were going. So, even when it feels like what happened was fucked, I think mostly it was just forked. Things forked up.  \n\n The other day from the back seat of the car where he had been peacefully staring out the window, Fluffy said,  Mommy, how many hours until I am dead?  To Fluffy, this is just a math equation for us to puzzle out, to pass the time, like, how many seconds until we get home? But it still sent a small tidal wave through my chest. Oh! So many hours, honey, I said, soooo many.  How many? Mommy! Do the math!  He isn\u2019t scared of death. In his world, he gets stronger and faster and stays up later the older he gets so by the time he\u2019s ready to check out, he\u2019ll be lifting cars over his head as he races past them on his midnight run around the block. \n\n My dear friend\u2019s dad died a week ago tonight. She said, he was such an amazing person, such a good good man.  Sweetie, you make a list of everything you need help with and Daddy\u2019s gonna take care of it.  That kind of dad. The kind who hears you mention the washer is making a funny noise on the spin cycle and next thing you know, he\u2019s taken it apart and pieced it back together and it's up and running like a honey. One day he wasn\u2019t feeling well and two months later he was dead. Cancer of the everything. He died in the hospice wing surrounded his wife and daughters. The morphine dripped its steady pulse and each daughter took turns leaping into his outstretched arms when he would reach up and call out in a small, quavering voice, \u201cHelp help Mama Mama!\u201d his eyes closed, lost in infancy, searching for warmth, comfort, protection. I guess we don\u2019t always get to have a good death, my friend said, I guess we don't always get to have the death we deserve. \n\n No. But I think we have a shot at a good life and, this life of mine, it is good.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://phreeque.tripod.com/hensel_sisters.html", "http://phreeque.tripod.com/bettie_lou_williams.html"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/last_night_i_dr.html", "title": "The Lizard Child"},

{"date": "April 13, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy in a rare moment of daytime sleep; November, 2004. Taken by Dave. \n\n I just have one tiny question: who is sneaking into my room at night and siphoning off my blood? I\u2019m not sure why anyone would want it, this blood of mine, with its pack of overwhelmed red blood cells, slow-shuffling through my veins, clutching their clipboards, checking off their lists: Okay, so I went to the arms, did you get to the fingers? All of them? I think she\u2019s got 9, or is it 10? What about the brain--listen up, people, has anyone been to the brain?  \n\n Or maybe it\u2019s the sleeping sickness or the curse of the tse tse fly. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m in a perpetual state of exhaustion, as if the whole day long is a moment of first awakening at 3 am to pack up the car for an important trip. You don\u2019t even bother to take a shower because you can\u2019t spare the time; you can always shower after you arrive, after you unpack. Yet, the only place I\u2019m going over here is through the day, over and over again.  \n\n I\u2019ve hit the point where the plate is so full that it continually overflows onto the table and that\u2019s the way the plate and table etc. etc. are going to look for a while, just until, perhaps, Fluffy is off to college. Life is churning into higher gear and consequently, there is a new standard in place. I never was one for extreme orderliness or spic and span presentations but I have my little systems for managing the household and addressing piles and stacks.\u00a0 I used to actually fold the clean laundry that I heaved onto the living room rug within a 24 hour period. I used to crawl around under the table with my wet cloth and knife to extract and scrape the Jackson Pollack that Fluffy created through the course of a day of eating.   \n\n When Fluffy first started peeing in the toilet last summer, he would often turn his whole body to me and announce, I\u2019m pee-peeing in the toilet!! as streams of pee arched up and splashed delicately down 180 degrees around his small frame. I used to dive into the corners with my handy clorox wipes with a quick flourish around the base of the toilet because why not? it could always do for an extra wipe down there. But now the wipes are somewhere under the pile of things that multiplies in configuration and content as it gets moved from the kitchen island to the kitchen table to my office floor and back again in a little game called I\u2019m Putting This Here For Just A Second.\u00a0 Now, when I happen to see the yellow splatter from Fluffy\u2019s more recent stabs at potty training, I nearly reach down and give it a quick wipe with my shirt sleeve and carry on in that unfocused squinty eye, slightly bent over at the waist, pants undone at the top sort of way.  \n\n Is this it for the duration? Would exercise really wipe all this out and see me sprinting out of bed, leading my family in robust rounds of Alternate Nostril Breathing and Salutations To The Sun while I rustle up a hearty porridge of quinoa and nuts? Do the daily handfuls of potato chips and wads of salami really drain my subtle body of that tingly can\u2019t wait to dive into the day feeling that camp counselors and my neighbor seem to embody every moment of the blessed gosh darn AWESOME day?  \n\n Maybe there\u2019s been a big mistake and very soon the sleeping sickness tse tse fly and his army of blood suckers with syringe-fulls of my sagging blood will pack up and move on to someone with a open dance card. Because, you know, mine is currently full with the Infertility and the Asperger\u2019s and now the metabolism on its extended Floridian white-plastic-shoed cruise. I think that\u2019s about all the dance I have in me. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/04/full_dance_card.html", "title": "Curse of the Tse Tse Fly"},

{"date": "March 25, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Grandad & Fluffy looking in the magic cup, March 2005. \n\n I love Easter. I love emerging from winter darkness and dying eggs; that\u2019s really it in an eggshell. I love to break out the vinegar and boil some water against the backdrop of spring, the valiant and erumpent leaves of tulips, crocuses, and grape hyacinth scattered among dirty islands of snow.  \n\n Dave is Jewish. I was baptized Episcopalian which means I am not Jewish and therefore, neither is Fluffy, though to my goyish figuring, he is lots Jewish. Technically, I\u2019d say, half. But what do I know from Jewish? What is it my business? \n\n We don\u2019t keep a religious house; we're not kosher; we're not really anything. We fry bacon and slice lots of ham: ham for sandwiches, omelets, soup, snacks, icings, milkshakes, etc. etc., Fluffy will likely not be Bar Mitzvah-ed and he certainly did not get circumcised. My friend said, Hey, why allow the guys MORE nerves in that area? Aren\u2019t they overly involved with their genital sensations as it is? And I say, that\u2019s why we should leave the men intact LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THE MALE POPULATION ON THIS  PLANET . Let them cash in on all the sensation the good lordy lord intended and maybe the blood can return to the brain more often and power a few synaptic pathways so the garbage can make it to the cans outside rather than grow into enormous plastic mountains on the front porch. \n\n I love continuing family traditions because I love families doing things together, I\u2019m very  Sound of Music  when it comes to that. Not just my traditions either; I\u2019m all for Hamantashen and Menorahs and Succoths in the front yard. Not all at once in a big pile, though, on second thought, why not? I'd eat Hamantashen by candlelight in a homemade hut, wouldn't you? If it was mild? Or dye eggs by an illuminated pine tree while in costume?  \n\n I think it\u2019s because holidays in our house were the most successful family time we had; we always rallied for a project. On Easter, my dad broke out the big guns and loaded up a corner of the table with all his paraphernalia: rubber cement, knives, candles, crayons, string, scotch tape, ink, food coloring. We would join him, giddy to have his company and attention, and lay down newspapers, carefully carry bowls of boiled eggs to the table, drop the colored tablets into cups with vinegar to watch them sizzle and spread.  \n\n I remember the magic of finding the basket on the table Easter morning, finding the treasures and treats and a triplet of fused peepers hidden inside the fake grass. I loved tracing the baby powder bunny prints from the front door to my basket. I never wondered why there was only one set of prints coming to the table. I never wondered how the Easter Bunny got  out .  \n\n I see people in my neighborhood walking home with long palm fronds and dressing up on Good Friday and I know there is a whole church ritual to this time of year that is deeply meaningful to many. Save for one particularly angry time during my teens when I punched every hard boiled egg on a someone\u2019s Tsoureki, I feel reverence for people\u2019s customs, for what they treasure. In fact, there are times I am so overcome with love of humankind that I have to restrain myself from engulfing strangers in teary-eyed bear hugs as we pass each other in the crosswalk. We are all out there trying to figure it out, putting one little foot in front of the other while stray squares of toilet paper cling to our shoes and the back of our skirts get stuck in our underpants.  \n\n For me, Easter is about gathering the family for an art project, of feeling mostly relaxed and hopeful, of discovering, failing, experimenting, and delighting in making eggs, eggs, extraordinary, mysterious, smooth eggs. Some of them make it to the wire stand while others become snacks or crack at the bottom of cups or escape across the table and roll off the edge, making that unmistakable sound on the floor.  \n\n Everyone says it\u2019s a time of miracles, of rebirth, of awakening, of returning light, and it\u2019s true, it\u2019s true. In our house, it seems to be coinciding with a wider internal view, like the slow but sure advancing of day. There won\u2019t be any chocolates for Fluffy, but there will be a single glorious, carob bar, the return of the plastic chicken that lays jelly bean eggs, and visits from family, including my dad, Grandad The Great, with his stash of art tools and a small box of magic tricks he taught himself just so he\u2019d have a way to catch his grandson's eye.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/majority.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/eggs.html", "title": "Eggs"},
{"date": "March 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Reading non-fiction with Fluffy, 2004. Taken by Dave. \n\n Somehow I inveigled Fluffy to play Silly Faces, a game where everyone starts with their own blank board; it\u2019s an empty head--an oval on shoulders. The players spin the spinner, land on a feature and fill in the face: a set of eyes, ears, mouth, hair, a hat, etc., lots of  silly  versions of the things that make a  face  a face.  \n\n Wyatt spun and got a mouth and he looked up at me, mystified: what to do with it? Well, the object of the game is making a silly face so really, you can do anything with it, I said. You can put the mouth where it goes or wherever you want. Mommy, you do it. Make it like a face really is. Let\u2019s do it together, I say. Look at my face, where is my mouth? Silence. Perplexity. Mounting anxiety. I say, is it way up here (point to eyes)?\u00a0 No. Is it here (point to nose) in the middle of my face? Yes. It is? Or maybe is it here, way down here, at the bottom of my face (open mouth wide) by my chin?  \n\n This from the little guy who can tell you the soft inside of your bones is a factory for making blood cells, that electricity is a stream of electrons running inside a wire, that a day on Venus is longer than a year. But a face? No clue.  \n\n This is what it\u2019s like:  \n\n Fluffy and I are reading a story, cuddled up in his big boy bed. It\u2019s one of those simple tales about, say, a boy who wants a puppy, wants one with all his heart, asks his parents every day, clasps his hands and wishes for it at bedtime. Page after page we hear of his love of puppies, his fervent desire to have one, please, please, can he have one. Please! He\u2019ll take such good care of it. Finally, he awakens on the morning of his birthday; he dashes out of bed, runs downstairs, and sees his parents sitting on the couch with a big smiles on their faces and a barking box by their feet. The boy jumps up and down in excited anticipation and drops to the floor to open the box. And that\u2019s when I pause, finger the next page by the top corner, and look down at Fluffy\u2019s expectant face. \u201cWhat do you think is in the box?\u201d I ask, and he quickly looks up at me with a deeply troubled expression and says, \u201c What , Mommy? TELL ME!\u201d \n\n It's a little puppy, honey. A puppy. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/curious_details.html", "title": "Curious Details"},

{"date": "March 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Fluffy, a few weeks before his arrival, 2001. Taken by Dave--who else? \n\n I guess, like a lot of women, I used to fantasize about the moment of conception, about whether or not I would KNOW I was getting pregnant. Would it be one of those fun, sexy, wild romps that suddenly became a locked-eyed moment of intensity as we swirled inside the primordial pool of life, the magnificent power of creation, thunderstruck by the knowledge that we were making a person that has never before existed and will never again? \n\n As it turns out, the moment of Fluffy\u2019s conception involved a few more people that I had previously imagined, namely, the Reproductive Endocrinologist and the laboratory technician on staff that particular Sunday morning nearly a week after the hCG was shot into the flesh of my rump at the tail end of our second IVF attempt. I lay on the table staring up at the monitor screen in the semi darkness, holding my husband\u2019s hand and watched the thin catheter thread through my ghostly cervix into my waiting uterus while three other couples waited in the cold hallway for their turn in the suite, where, in lieu of a heart-shaped bed, one heck of a flashlight zeroed in on the action. \n\n The technician came in with the tiny petri dish of embryos--the ones we had just seen a picture strip of, not unlike those taken at the 5-for-a-dollar booths because there were exactly 5 of them that day. Our doctor had been called away and the attending physician turned out to be the very same doctor that had performed my abortion years before. It seemed fitting to me that this very dear and gentle man who helped me make decisions about my life at 17 would be on hand to help me create a family after 10 years of trying. My husband and I had been clear that we were not producing a litter and therefore, agreed to put in only 2 embryos, cross our fingers, hope one sticks. But when the doctor told us that given my age, we should roll the handful, we very quickly nodded in agreement. So much for scruples--gimme that baby! Toss them all in and update the registry later, which wasn\u2019t necessary since Fluffy was never anyone\u2019s fool; we\u2019re pretty sure he nudged them out at the wall, one by one. \n\n I really don\u2019t mean to offend anyone, but for a time, I pimped for mice. Caged mice. A pack of old butt-scratching lascivious geezers divided into those who shot blanks and those who shot the real deal. I paired them with matronly mice with wide hips and benevolent temperaments and prepubescent honeys barely out of pjs with feet, respectively. It sounds sordid, I know, but it was all above board and done with grant money from the NIH and Dana Farber Institute, etc. etc., in pursuit of nobel causes like a better understanding of various surface proteins of our T-cells, essential players in the world of immunity. And to this end, I was sometimes in charge of caring for mice embryos for the few days as they divided inside petri dishes placed in cozy incubators before they were implanted into the able bodies of the matronly mice mentioned above. \n\n So, as we waited back out in the hallway within our curtained-wall cocoon for the requisite 20 minutes for things to \u2018take\u2019, I thought about the mouse embryos I used to routinely hold in my own hand, inside the tiny petri dish, exactly like the one that held Fluffy, inside pink culture-media dots covered with paraffin oil to lock them in place. And I thought about the time I dropped a petri dish to the laboratory floor, sending microscopic embryos to scatter and pool and then disappear into the top layer of waxy build-up on the linoleum. And I wondered how careful this technician had been both in the handling and the labeling of this tiny, crucially valuable and vitally important polystyrene container.  \n\n Was that, in fact, my embryo? Made from my eggs harvested with an eighteen inch needle poke through the vaginal wall and into the ovaries where it sucked out the contents like a mini-vac, while I was under date rape sedation, talking trash and perhaps even repeating the ridiculous jokes and impressions my husband and I had nervously entertained ourselves with since the beginning of this high tech approach to pregnancy?\u00a0 Was it my egg + someone else\u2019s sperm? someone else\u2019s egg + my husbands sperm? Egg + sperm of two entirely different people? And, at this point, did I really care? If it meant I could have a baby growing inside of me, give birth, and get me some of that bone-crushing fatigue I\u2019d heard so much about? \n\n Anyway, I\u2019m quite sure the technician\u2019s gaze above the surgical mask was honest, her hand steady. What could I do if I\u2019m wrong? Send him back? Meet halfway and make the trade? Oops, sorry! Here you go! As if I\u2019d strolled down several aisles with the wrong cart. \n\n Fluffy is Fluffy, and he is glorious no matter where he came from. And while I don\u2019t tell him this story, I do tell him about the day he was born, something he loves hearing about over and over. They say birthing stories are like dreams, endlessly fascinating only to the one who did the birthing or dreaming, but it\u2019s not true; it\u2019s also fascinating for the one who was birthed.  \n\n Tell me about the day I arrived, about the day you stood with legs so wide one foot reached clean into the other world. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/where_he_came_f.html", "title": "Where He Came From"},
{"date": "March 23, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n  Today; My Cyber-Child.   \n\n We\u2019ve decided to take the guess work out of parenting and have since hooked Fluffy up to a computer program, Neurotypical Trainer 2.0.  \n\n No! That\u2019s actually  Space Race , one of the more exciting of the  neurofeedback  games offered at the center where the A.S. doctor works. It\u2019s sounds so science fiction-y and,well, it sort of is. The wires from my son\u2019s ears and head connect to a computer program that measures and responds to his various brain waves. The game responds favorably when his frontal lobe does what they want it to do--get more organized and focused, and when that happens, his blue space ship blasts faster past various planets, occassionally even clicking into hyper-speed.  \n\n I\u2019m considering asking if they could roll one of those machines into our bedroom at night and hook me up with a Chick Super Hero program; I\u2019d like to tighten up the old frontal lobe while I kick a little ass. \n\n I tell you, I don\u2019t get how this thing works; it\u2019s a computer game with no keyboard or joy stick. Just plug in a monitor and wires, add brain waves and your good to go. We\u2019re working up to 45 minutes twice a week; today was session number one and Fluffy was riveted. We ought to know by Session 5 or 6 whether this will be a magic cure of sorts. Not that it would knock out the Asperger\u2019s altogether, but it has been shown to open up similarly affected kids in remarkable ways. \n\n We were sent home with instructions to watch for and record any noticeable changes. This is hard. He looked the same on the way home as I watched through the rearview. Once home, he went through a period of repeatedly jumping down from the table and racing through the house making rocket sounds but who wouldn\u2019t after single-handedly winning a race through the solar system on your own blue rocket? Then he knocked over the coffee table and rolled it over to the glider rocker where he successfully wedged it under the left runner. Now that  could be  a bit of hyperactivity but once he managed to get the coffee table all the way over to the top of the stairs leading down to his playroom and, as far as I know, there weren\u2019t any wires dipped in conducting goo anywhere on the premises. \n\n The rest of the afternoon progressed as usual except for one period of about\u00a0 20 minutes during which Fluffy played on his own with such animated focus and delight that Dave snuck out of the basement where he draws cartoons and said to me, \u201cHe's gotten so independent ever since we started the shock treatments!\u201d And of course, I laughed.  \n\n I just hope he doesn't say that to anyone  out there .    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.neurodevelopmentcenter.com/index.php?id=31"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/session_1.html", "title": "Session 1"},

You can answer them, or not; post them, or not. It's a free Tuesday. \n\n What was your favorite place when you were a child? I think it was Maine. My dad was a teacher for many years and so the whole family spent a good chunk of our summers in a tiny coastal town called Harrington. It was very idyllic and old fashioned romantic, with gas fridge and stove and kerosine lamps, no electricity and only cold running water. Sitting here now, I'm remembering when some family friends made the 7 hour drive to spend a few days with us. One of those evenings, the grown-ups drove 40 minutes to Ellsworth, a big enough town to not only have a movie theater, but one playing Deep Throat. It was the mid-1970s and they were off on a lark as much as anything, leaving us kids to fend for ourselves and fight off the boogie man that was surely lurking in the dark pines.  \n\n As it turned out, the thing that got us was a leak in the gas light line that sent up a small bonfire of blue and white flames to lick and flicker at the ceiling and sent  us  to screaming down the dirt road with flashlights frantically darting at nothing in particular since we were too petrified to aim. The neighbor down at the point came back and\u00a0 turned off the gas, located the leak, and adjusted the remaining gas lights that were completely fine. We had no phone to call our parents and even if we had, this was long before everyone and their teenage child had a cell so a house phone would have done us no good. So, we entertained ourselves in that loaded spring sort of way that kids do, with high squeals and cartoon vertical jumps and lots of climbing on each other; we played cards and kept our eyes on the path that led to the road and it wasn\u2019t until we saw the headlights beam through the window of the front door that we bragged about how brave we had been. \n\n\n\n\n\n What would you like to learn someday (a language, an instrument, mathematics, whatever)? I would like to learn how to let my husband be a different person than me. What is your favorite thing about the process of writing? Being surprised by what slips into my mind. The other night, while staring up at the glow in the dark stars and planets in Fluffy\u2019s room, a few lines were suddenly spoken in my head as if I had tapped into someone else\u2019s cordless channel. I spend a lot of time in tight little circles of thought so it\u2019s always a treat to experience moments of freedom when someone else is in charge.   Have you read any good books lately? I am reading  The Big Rumpus  and it\u2019s cracking me up.  \n\n\n\n What's your favorite color? I love the trees at this time of year when you begin to see the faint clouds of color return to the reaching tips of the branches; when you are not quite sure if what you see are the actual leaf buds or just the memory of colors you held behind your eyes, stored up, like Leo Lionni's  Frederick .   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.anamaria.typepad.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580050719/qid=1112098821/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-7732678-5652667", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394826140/qid=1112098893/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/103-7732678-5652667"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/what_was_your_f.html", "title": "Some Questions"},

There was a lot of jocularity as everyone jockeyed for the 'best' scale although all the gals with clipboards get assuring us that, 'We've tried them all, they're all the same!'\u00a0 When it was my turn, I took off my coat, scarf, purse, shoes, and was considering stripping down a bit more when modesty took hold.

Watch your portions! Keep your food journal! Stick to the Core Foods! Order off the children's menu!

{"date": "March 20, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n  Fluffy, in a rare moment of repose; April, 2001. \n\n My neighbor cleans her house every day. It only takes about an hour!  \n\n In our house, when the toilet starts to grow hair, we call Marriah, the flat-tummied college gal who\u2019s been helping us on and off for the last 3 years. She has enormous betty blue eyes that blink under ever-changing hair color; she laughs a lilting giggle sound and cheerfully says \u201csweet!\u201d whenever I give her special projects like scrubbing black mold with toxic X-14 or washing the unrecognizable crap out of the cracks beside the dishwasher or applying bleach to the inside of fridge, with orders to dispose of Tupperware that moves independently. \n\n Nothing fazes her and we adore her although often feel parental concern about the calamity her circle seems to encounter with some regularity. Cars get hit by trucks, relatives get raped, parents drop dead from heart attacks, and boyfriends suddenly start stalking at the CVS.  \n\n\n\n Was it so perilous when I was younger? Back then? Way back then? \n\n Sometimes I think that Marriah and I are contemporaries, you know, both figuring out what we want to do in this crazy mixed-up life, and then I see her, dusting with her sweats rolled down midway on her hips, thong straps slung high over her protruding hip bone, legs long and lean, the whole world--her oyster, at her fingertips, and I am slapped back to reality. I am so not in my 20s anymore. Seriously, that book is closed. I want to flutter over to her, grab her by the pink belly T and shout, \u201cMarriah, Marriah, listen to me! The world is your oyster. YOUR OYSTER, I TELL YOU! Rip it open! Suck it down!\u201d Most likely she would tip her head to the side and say,\u201cOysters. Sweet!\u201d \n\n But you know, it WAS perilous when we were young. My sister, for one, lost a classmate to suicide at 15 and then saved her best friend from the same fate later that year. She SAVED her, can you imagine? My friend\u2019s sister was kicked in the head by her beloved horse and was instantly killed, my other friend\u2019s mom just didn\u2019t wake up one day, and my best friend\u2019s brother was thrown from a car on his way back to college and broke his neck. Countless kids endured their parents divorce, me included, and countless again stood by and watched at least one parent\u2019s alcoholic spiral. Another dear friend was molested by a stranger when she was five, endured two kinds of cancer in her early teens, recovered in time to watch her dad die from AIDS, then eight years later, her only sibling drowned in a boating accident. What the hell are those cards?  \n\n This life, clearly, isn\u2019t a field day.  \n\n And I haven\u2019t even started with the friend who was raped by a family member and the parents whose children get terminal illness and the young women I just heard about who died of pancreatic cancer leaving her 6 month old child motherless. I could go on and on and on and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d do it alone because who would stay logged on to this litany of the tragic? And how did I get here from Marriah, our dear and delectable housecleaner? \n\n LOCK THE DOORS DON'T GO OUT NEVER LET YOUR EYES OFF YOUR CHILDREN TRUST NO ONE EMBRACE ALL PEOPLE BREATHE DEEPLY GRAB ONTO THE DAY BITE INTO LIFE LOSE EVERY ARGUMENT \n\n Life is so perilous, dangerous, treacherous, and don\u2019t take one minute away from me, not one. I know this is familiar territory and I am saying all the corn ball things but don\u2019t you feel it too? I want it, this life, I want every second of it but why do I wish away hours and months, trying to rush past things that are hard or boring or tedious or painful when if I found out I had pancreatic cancer tomorrow I\u2019d sign up for 100 straight years of standing in the the slow line at the grocery store behind the lady whose every item needs a price check if that was my one shot at breathing in after the out, again and again and again. And thank god for the autonomic nervous system because if it were left up to me to remember to oxygenate and circulate the blood I would have left this world exactly on minute after I entered. Born: 7:48-Died 7:49. Or if was something we were all meant to take charge of at a certain age, like making an income and our own doctor\u2019s appointments; okay, you\u2019re on your own, ready, set, heart beat! there would be no parking problems, anywhere. \n\n What I think I object to is not so much the cleaning of the house everyday because if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, I say, right on, fill the bucket, grab a sponge. Maybe it\u2019s not such a bad idea because think of it, how dirty can the house get if you really are cleaning it EVERY DAY? What I object to is the regimentation, the orderliness of it because things over here, across the street, are decidedly not orderly. As much as I know that kids like schedules and we do certainly change the photo magnets on Fluffy\u2019s picture calendar every morning to include daily events in the order they occur, it\u2019s all an illusion anyway, isn\u2019t it? \n\n Because my neighbor\u2019s own brother fell off his roof while putting up Halloween lights a number of years ago; just a simple chore on an ordinary ladder by a very handsome and coordinated guy. And while you may be able to confidently slice the veggies for the stir fry on the bathroom tile, the great and disinterested hand still swipes across the land without so much as a glance, knocking ladders to the ground. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/great_disintere.html", "title": "Great & Disinterested Hand"},

{"date": "March 18, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n \u00a0  \n\n Fluffy, making his point; Fall, 2003. Taken by Dave. \u00a0  \n\n I walk through the day imagining all sorts of things, rolling over and over them, sometimes shh\u2019ing someone who\u2019s talking to me so I can continue with my fantasy. And lately these fantasies have been all about Fluffy moving toward more wellness, moving toward connection with others.  \n\n He is making progress and it\u2019s exciting and scary. I feel like saying, \u201cCome here, look at this! Isn\u2019t it amazing? CAREFUL, DON\u2019T TIP HIM!\u201d like he\u2019s a precariously stacked tower of china.  \n\n Taffeta darling. Taffeta, dear. No, the dress; it\u2019s taffeta. Don\u2019t touch it.  \n\n I imagine him having a sleepover and calling into his room late at night, \u201cHey guys, settle down in there\u201d, or puttering around upstairs in the kitchen while he and a playmate race around downstairs, jump off the trampoline and crash into the beanbags. I imagine coming in to his room to find him and his friends camped out beside the bed pushed against the wall, the only nice tablecloth I own soaking in a bowl of ketchup, leaves, and ice cream. Eat it. Dare ya. \n\n Fluffy is changing. It\u2019s subtle but significant. Not just one thing--several things, intertwined. Maybe it\u2019s something only I can see at this point, the mother view underground, like peering through the earth after rainfall to see the mushroom mycelium arms and legs extending in all directions; the bulk of the organism unseen yet reaching until the day it sends up little umbrella shoots for a peek at our world. Hello up there. Now you can see me but ah! I\u2019ve been growing underfoot for weeks.  \n\n But listen: we go through hours at a time NOT playing with MagnaTiles. He\u2019s dressing himself. True, sometimes his pull-up goes over his pants immediately followed by a concentrated attempt to put his shirt on over the pull-up, but still, HE\u2019S DRESSING HIMSELF. He dragged a chair to the countertop and rolled out pizza dough rather than rolling the ingredients onto the floor. We saw my friend\u2019s son at the pool and, for the first time in 8 months, Fluffy called him simply Sammy, not BAMMY, DAMMY, FLAMMY or some other mockery shouted in a jeering tone.\u00a0 And today, we sat down and played Bug Bingo. He took turns and followed the rules. He picked up each bingo chip and set it down on the corresponding insect rather than picking up a handful of them and releasing them into the air, like doves at a magic show.  \n\n He\u2019s noticing things, as if a cloud around his periphery is drifting away, or at least, further out, allowing for a greater view. He\u2019s pointing to things and sharing them with us. He\u2019s playing the therapeutic games we\u2019ve been learning which are all about tuning into the other guy, moving in synchrony, where the point is, say, landing on the pillows at the same time not racing ahead to a solo victory. We\u2019ve been slowing it down, exaggerating our expressions, inserting the absurd to illicit his own genuine desire to check us out. And he\u2019s checking us out. \n\n He\u2019s more flexible, less tantrummy, there\u2019s less hell to pay when we don\u2019t accurately read his mind. AND HE\u2019S BEEN FORGETTING COMPUTER TIME. Not every day, but in this past week, he has \u2018forgotten\u2019 twice. That\u2019s like me forgetting to eat or Dave remembering, well, something.  \n\n Some relatives came by the other day: an aunt and uncle who\u2019ve never met him, and my grandparents who met him once, two years ago. They came bearing gifts, so dear and sweet, and Fluffy went right for them. He ripped open the paper, gritting his teeth, arms shaking with the effort like he was lifting a car off a trapped child. He got a playmobile panda bear family on an island with small trees and leaves he could put together himself, the kind of gift normally as appealing to him as a real-time video of heavy-set geeks writing computer code would be to me. But this time he got right down on the rug and played with it; he put the leaves on the trees, moved the panda family around, and gave them bites to eat. Occasionally, one of the trees would lift off and zoom through the air a bit, shooting laser bullets, etc. etc., he is a BOY after all. \n\n He\u2019s outside now, among the distractions and unpredictability that the world of his neighborhood holds, playing in the sandbox with the college gal who's here on Fridays. And I\u2019m inside, watching through the window, imagining the day when I dig in the yard and smile as bits of conversation drift over from where Fluffy and his new friend from school are happily tromping about.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/i_walk_through_.html", "title": "Little Umbrellas"},
{"date": "March 15, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n December, 2003. Self-timer. \n\n I love a lot of cheering and encouragement and praise, as I\u2019ve mentioned, but let me say right here than I don\u2019t mean hollow praise like the psychologist during Fluffy\u2019s evaluation who kept chirping \u201cgood boy!\u201d only she said it like \u201cGOOD BO-EY\u201d high on the \u2018good\u2019 and breathy on the \u2018bo-ey\u2019 many many times while insisting he sit down in this saccharine sing-songy voice. \u201cSit dow-ow-n, GOOD BO-EY! Sit dow-ow-n, GOOD BO-EY!\u201d.  \n\n It was all I could do not to body check her into the tiny chair and call out \u201cGOOD GIR-RAL!\u201d as Fluffy and I made our escape down the rainbow stripes of the school hall. Instead, I smiled a tense smile and said, he won't sit down because he doesn\u2019t like you. At least, I said it with my eyes.    \n\n I mean real praise, praise that acknowledges when someone is trying something new, doing something hard, fighting the noise of the internal committee, the critic, the one with the blow torch aimed at all the baby green shoots just coming out of the ground. I mean real praise that comes with some truth telling about how it might feel to you to see someone move toward something that you long for or how it might feel to see someone struggling with something you deeply fear.\u00a0 Hooray for you out there in the tall grass with your big boots on! Look at you trudging away, through uncharted territory, always uncharted, whether the grass is sleek and beautiful and dancing or dangerous and scratchy and weaving.\u00a0  \n\n But I guess everyone is busy. Busy busy busy. So very busy. I know. I\u2019m busy too. Maybe I\u2019m letting other people down in this area but don\u2019t know it because I am swimming inside my own bubble with its distorted view around the curves. I don\u2019t like being so busy and I don\u2019t like other peoples\u2019 busy. Too much busy. Have I used busy enough in this paragraph? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m too busy to count. \n\n I try to listen and be supportive, to cheer from the side lines or the front lines, toss my poms poms in the air, maybe even bend way down although the hips are a little crunchy of late, so I don\u2019t know about going all the way down to the ground, but I\u2019m close; I\u2019m in the deep knee.  \n\n Maybe it\u2019s because of what I am going through these last many months, but I either want to engage in light chatter that lasts about a minute or I want to discuss your darkest thoughts and most tender dreams the moment our carts touch in the health food aisle. I think our mail man is up for either thing, to snack on a couple of cheese crackers or to rip into a steak. He smiles so serenely and stands very still when we say hello. He is so present as he hands me my mail, rubber-banded inside this week\u2019s Pottery Barn catalogue. \n\n I will say that my sister and I broke all the rules a number of months ago and conducted an all-out fight over the internet via email. We really let it fly. I\u2019d say, we went about 10 rounds. She initiated and while I, at first, tentatively pulled out stray post-it sized concerns from my drawer, it wasn\u2019t long before I was hefting out unruly files from the cabinet. And here\u2019s the shocking thing: so was she. It\u2019s so funny how these things go because for all the talk about how there is no ONE truth, that all you need to do is count the number of people in the room and that\u2019s how many truths you\u2019ve got on your hands, I am always taken aback by the evidence. I\u2019m as sputtering and aghast as if someone suddenly squirted me with the hose on high. \n\n There was much compulsive email checking, much reading and rereading, and ultimately, much relief in the clearing even though it came after expressions of disbelief and hurt, after times when I was so unnerved that her next email would sit unopened for a few hours or days. I sent a number of unnerving emails of my own, mind you; we were well matched. But in the end, we returned to an easy trust and a down-right giddy mutual adoration. I say hooray to us for hanging in there during that snarly patch of the grass.  Richard  would have been glowing.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/the_tall_grass.html", "title": "Walks in the Tall Grass"},
{"date": "March 14, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Nightblur, 1998. \n\n See the problem is, I simply love eating potato chips and as much as it\u2019s clear to me that the days of eating whatever I want and only doing sporadic exercise, like sprinting to the toaster and lifting additional loaves of french bread, are not cutting it in the lean mean bikini-wearing machine department, I am also not quite ready to shift into neutral and coast down that hill where lavender sweat-suits and one-pieces with skirts are waiting in the valley below. \n\n And, by the way, what the hell is going on with time? I keep thinking there's got to be a way to organize it differently. Must get more efficient. Must streamline. Must puzzle this out. I spend a far amount of time on this, almost as much as I do on redesigning the climate and season length in our area to better suit my taste and temperament. This is like the game that Dave and I play a lot, the \u201cWhat would you rather...\u201d game although I don't always do it correctly. Recently, I said to my sister, \u201cOkay, what would you rather do: have your little finger chopped off or get to eat whatever you want and never gain weight or have health consequences?\u201d and she just stared at me for a full minute: wait, what are you saying. I don\u2019t get it.  \n\n Of course, it\u2019s meant to be something like, what would you rather do: lose a finger or never eat french fries again. See? You get the idea. What would you rather do: eat cat food or make out with Larry King? What would you rather have: severe and untreatable acne all over your face, neck, and arms, or the assurance that your child will be happy and successful and live a long and meaningful life.  \n\n Oh, I\u2019ve done it again. Another blank face. I mean, what would you be willing to endure: the complete removal of your nose for the complete assurance of your child\u2019s long prosperous and joyous life, OR the guarantee that you will never feel any emotional or physical pain, even the passing discomfort of still air in rooms that lack ceiling fans, for your child\u2019s incredibly joyful existence that is tragically cut short at 20. In other words, you could suffer locked-in syndrome and no one could know the screaming pain you\u2019re subject to every waking minute and all you could do was blink  Adagio ,  Allegro , or somewhere in between, BUT your child would live to a ripe old age. \n\n When the sleep in this house was at it\u2019s most dire, when it was through the roof, off the charts bad, I used to play this game like a champ.  Would you cut off your finger if it meant Fluffy would sleep through the night.  Absolutely.  A hand?  Done.  An arm?  Deal.  A leg?  Okay, how long is this sleeping through the night going to last--until he leaves home?  Yes.  Then, chop away.  Both legs?  Hmm. Give me a minute... \n\n Back when I was a kid, everything was weighed against eating cat food. And I don\u2019t mean the crunchy little X\u2019s that come dry in a bag. I mean the stinking cans of schlop with the snotty island of gel at the top that made a vile sucking sound when spooned into my cat\u2019s plastic dish like innards draining at the meat packing plant. I think it still tops my can\u2019t handle list now. For example, what would I rather: eat a can of cat food or have my hand chopped off if it meant that Fluffy\u2019s Asperger's would disappear tomorrow. Start sharpening. \n\n But what does any of this have to do with potato chips and my love of them? Nothing. Except what would I rather? Eat potato chips whenever I\u2019d like for the rest of my life, or not. And I say, wait, what are you saying? I don\u2019t get it.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/start_sharpenin.html", "title": "Start Sharpening"},

I only wish I could get myself into some pants.  \n\n The situation has clearly gotten out of control and today I feel mad about it, like my body is a naughty toddler. No, I said no and she goes ahead anyway, playing catapult with the fork or with the food, either one.

It\u2019s like back when I was trying to do Atkins but the only rule I successfully followed was using heavy whipping cream in my coffee.

Where outside a couple of the dads are tossing nukum-size balls to kids several inches away who still fail to catch them and who keep trying to escape back into the house where it\u2019s less bright and, well, outdoorsy, and Fluffy is in his playroom ordering someone around in his diapers.  \n\n Then I can pass on the chips and salami rolls and nosh on celery sticks and overflowing bowls of tossed baby greens, a tall glass of seltzer and lemon effervescently by my side.

When my nose and I have to see people in this state, I fluctuate between wanting to talk with my hand casually draped in front of my face or aggressively leaning in to intone, \u201cLick It\u201d.  \n\n We were running late for our time with Miss Pam. Fluffy was on the living room rug trying to put his pants on over his head, complaining noisily that his socks were making his toes go in the wrong holes. I was dispensing cheers and encouragement and some instruction as I packed a bag with snacks and enzymes and extra clothes and pull-ups and wipes and car toys. I was breathing through the clogged pores in my nose, making my way through the dark of my impatience, advancing in tiny steps as I clung to the length of rope that would take me to the light, when we would open the door and actually be outside on our way to the car, that vehicle of freedom, when suddenly I felt the snap and looked down at the fraying end: no more rope.  \n\n I stomped over to my son, picked up the boot he was trying to put on backwards and whipped it across the room with a single, violent jerk. I stood him up, my hands tight around his wispy arms, and said, \u201cSTOP F'ING AROUND\u201d through clenched teeth. I really did say f\u2019ing and not fucking--my slippery victory, and I\u2019m glad for that because immediately Fluffy brightened up and started marching in place happily chanting, \u201cStop f\u2019ing around! Stop f\u2019ing around!\u201d. \n\n Now, I\u2019m a gal who can hit my keyboard with both hands when the processor spins incessantly and I\u2019m trying to edit--slam! slam! slam! like Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein when Igor says you haven\u2019t even touched your food. I\u2019m a gal who can shake out the contents of my purse all over the floor to find the keys when I\u2019ve had it with the blind hand hunt. Not always, but it happens. \n\n When it comes to Fluffy, however, I have remarkable patience. It\u2019s not something I can take credit for since it seems to have come with being a mom, like the cellulite on my arms and the inability to pin point where my leg begins and my butt ends. I suspect what really happened is that as Fluffy was being pushed out, patience from every other area of my life was drained and rerouted exclusively, to him. I can lie on his bed for an hour telling stories, singing lullabies, reading, scratching his back until he gently falls asleep but if my husband takes more than 35 seconds to make his point, I snap like a crack whore.  \n\n People say a lot of asinine things when you\u2019re pregnant for the first time. They jovially shout, with knowing smiles and a bit of the nudge-nudge, elbow in the side--something I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of, things like, \u2018Stock up on sleep!\u201d and, \u201cGo see every movie made 'cause the next time you get out, Claire Danes will be the Grand Dame of film\u201d and, \u201cRemember to stoke the coals between the sheets!\u201d\u00a0 but what they don\u2019t mention is that sometimes you\u2019re going to want to scream, \u201cSHUT THE FUCK UP\u201d to your innocent infant, or slam your toddler against the wall. They don\u2019t let it slip that rage can explode inside your body like a heroin rush and for a split second it seems like it would feel good to hit your child.  \n\n I\u2019ve never done it, never came close, I'm enormously relieved to say, since right after that feeling threatens to flood, culverts magically clear and the waters drain. But it feels profoundly awful to get that mad, so toxic and ghastly, like morphing into a grotesque monster. My friend and I used to call them \u201cmonster mommy moments\u201d and sometimes we would call each other up and say, okay, I\u2019ll tell you a monster mommy story if you tell me one first. We shook our heads and understood child abuse for the first time. It\u2019s hideous and inexcusable and damaging beyond repair, but take away the husband, income, home, any therapy, or add more kids and I can see how it happens. Or simply add an upbringing where violence was endured or witnessed, and you\u2019ve got a whole different story on your hands. \n\n It\u2019s the secret most people don\u2019t talk about. Most moms don\u2019t even say it out loud, don\u2019t even want their own consciousness to hear it.  \n\n On the drive over, I checked Fluffy's face in the rear view, wondering, is he okay? Does he think the bare trees along the highway look sad and lonely? Is that what he's thinking as he stares out the window?   \n\n Miraculously, we made it to Miss Pam\u2019s playroom without losing any time; there was a cancellation which allowed us to extend into the next hour. I mouthed \u2018rough morning\u2019 out of view while Fluffy labored over his snow boots and then they left me and went sailing through the magic door. \n\n I read and listened and waited for Fluffy to tell Miss Pam to STOP F\u2019ING AROUND but it didn\u2019t happen. Instead, he built soft block treehouses and ran and climbed as the Psicomotricita thera-play was progressing with ease. And after an hour he raced back out to me and climbed on my lap, his face flush with enthusiasm and confidence. \n\n I guess, as Anne Lamott would say, I haven't ruined him yet.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/mother_rage.html", "title": "Mother Rage"},

My favorite house was at 13 Cushing Street. It was the house that my younger brother first came home to, the one to which my father once nearly didn\u2019t return; it was the house where I saw my cat walk through the room months after he had died while I practiced piano in the dark.  \n\n There was a guy who used to visit my parents at that house. His name was Peter and he would never knock or ring the doorbell. He had something that now would surely have a name and therapeutic attack strategy, but then he was just Peter who didn\u2019t like to touch things on the door. Every once in a while, when we would open the door to leave, there was Peter, standing on the front steps. He looked like a photograph you almost forgot to take.  \n\n I may have this all wrong but as I recall, he sometimes ran with the avant guard art scene set in New York City and once came to our house to offer an investment opportunity to my parents: a hip new idea from this chick, Yoko Ono. She was trying to market body bags that allowed people privacy in public places. They were these amorphous things you could climb into and do your own thing while you were also, say, riding the uptown express or having a quiet moment at the park. My parents declined, but I think of that from time to time and wonder if we all would have hung out, if I could have met John Lennon and maybe talked him into going somewhere else that December night.  \n\n And then I was flipping through some occupational therapy supply catalogues, looking at tactile balls and weighted vests, and I saw something oddly familiar--stretchy body sacs for kids with a proprioceptive yearning; sacs for a child to crawl into, lean against, feel the power of their weight and get a sense of calm.  \n\n Huh. I guess Yoko was on to something. Maybe her patent ran out? After all, that was over 35 years ago, shocking as that sounds.\u00a0  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/13_cushing_stre.html", "title": "Peter in the Doorway"},

That's 214 weeks, or 1,503 days--just off the top of my head. \n\n He awoke once, a couple of hours after falling asleep, and did his usual--sat up, weaved in place, called for me, then crashed back down like a felled tree the moment I was bedside.

I don\u2019t know how it is that I DO go out and drop a chunk of change but still don\u2019t have anything to put on when I go to the closet. Really; there's NOTHING in there, just dingy hangers swaying in the dark. \n\n \n\n I want to be wearing things that are much more fun. I want to feel more alive in the fabric. I want to design a line of clothes and have them made by a team of swift and gifted seamstresses.

Other than pajamas, those I gratefully climb into every night at 6 o'clock while Fluffy is brushing teeth with his dad--while we're both getting ready for bed.

She's got two small children and so, has been off the career track for the last 5 years. During that time, she's been lollygagging around the house in her bathrobe, eating truffels and soaking her brain in poo poo water or at least that\u2019s what you\u2019d think if you were one of these pocket change janglers out there in the business world. Everyone is full of advice: Don\u2019t mention the kids! Wear something tailored without stains! Oops--better borrow it from your childfree girlfriend! Don\u2019t offer anyone a boobie! When they ask if you\u2019d like anything while waiting for the interview, lean all the way back in your chair and say, I could really go for a lovely storage bench for the bedroom. And a footrub; just a little one. Make it snappy.   \n\n In the world of jobs, I\u2019ve always been confused about where to place my final loyalties: to my heart or my boss. I can only remember a handful of jobs I\u2019ve liked and I worked loads of them, thankless jobs, grunty jobs, mostly giving them my all, and then feeling confused by the ensuing bouts of rage and depression. If something really amazing had come along, I fear I would have said, Oh Marty, that sounds great! I\u2019d LOVE to shoot a scene in your movie but I said I\u2019d ring up groceries next to the dwarf and the Stop & Shop. I promised.  \n\n So, it\u2019s a funny thing, me helping with this effort, sort of like sitting down with Fluffy to get a little relationship advice, or asking my husband to help me organize a system for collecting the laundry. I\u2019m sorry, did you say something? This dear man continued to put the laundry on TOP of the basket, on the lid that Little Cindy Loo Hoo Who Was No More Than Two could lift in her sleep. Just take the lid off and no one will get hurt. I finally tossed the thing under the bed so he is now forced to comply. Brilliant stroke, that. It only took about 10 fights to figure it out. \n\n So, my friend and I are brainstorming to fill in the gaps of the resume and part of me wants to rip it up and throw the torn pieces in the street as I storm the corporate centers of my town.

{"date": "March 08, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Fluffy in Florida, February, 2004. Taken by Dave. \n\n Does it ever just boggle your mind that we all once breathed and ate out of our belly buttons as we endlessly floated in water, fluid filling our eyes, ears, and mouth?  We went swimming today--Tuesday, that\u2019s pool day. Fluffy loves to do this thing with one of the balls from the toy bin. He holds onto it and keeps himself afloat, treading water in his wild little frog kicking way.\u00a0 He drifts along, floating and kicking, and then shoots the ball out of his hands through the top of the water, splashing himself and me in the face. Both of us laugh at the slapstick.\u00a0  \n\n Last week he starting spinning himself in circles while holding the ball; he is amazingly good at it. He can go a long time before catapulting the ball into the air. After it makes its trajectory, he keeps himself afloat on his own for 30 seconds or so, body straight up and down like the pool thermometer, his little mouth, eyes, and nose just peaking out of the water like a curious fish.  \n\n Today he said, \u201cGive me some room, Mommy\u201d, so I gave him about 6 feet and off he went, treading, circling, treading, spinning, holding onto the green ball, his favorite color. I must have looked away for a second because one minute he was spinning with little sounds of concentration and effort and then next minute, he was gone. My mind and body didn\u2019t understand it. I looked again and saw that he was backwards underwater, his arms waving the way they do when he\u2019s making snow angels on the ground, the green ball drifting away out of the corner of my eye. I pushed through the incredibly thick and viscous water and scooped him up in my arms. He had been holding his breath and he inhaled with relief as alarm spread across his face and said, \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to come up.\" \u201cI got you, honey\u201d, I told him, feeling wobbly, aware of the heartbeat in my neck. He leaned against me, both arms wrapped around my neck and said, \u201cThank you for saving my life, Mommy.\u201d \n\n It was one of those moments when you realize how thin the line is between this world and the next, an opaque membrane like that one that clings to the underside of a hard boiled egg. One tear.  \n\n And even as I held him and made a tiny game of retelling the story, \"You were like a porpoise, diving backwards in the waves!\" I was aware of the other Fluffy who\u2019s still under water on his back, arms and legs flapping like a turtle on his shell. Only in the that rescue, seconds take months or even years and the water feels like clay. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/rescue.html", "title": "Pool Day"},

My body hair is my vain and petty preoccupation. I think it has aspergers. It\u2019s not flexible and easy and reticent. It\u2019s rigid. It dominates the conversation. It preseverates, if you will. It juts out angrily from underneath my arms and threatens to take over the whole leg--stand back, this thigh IS MINE.  \n\n You wouldn\u2019t necessarily think it to look at me: I don\u2019t have great masses of luscious tendrils tumbling around my face or Mediterranean skin. But I\u2019ve got groopy hairs that circle the nipples, radical hairs that march down my belly, a dozen dark hairs that pop out on my chin and a few squatters on my cheek. I don\u2019t have a big mustache, that I\u2019ll say, but I make up for it under my nose--two little nostraches. This morning I got a long overdue bikini wax. Before the appointment, it looked like an actual hedge hog was clinging to my crotch. Sorry for the visual. \n\n I tried to surrender a few times; I threw up my hands and threw out my razors and all I can say is that this sort of thing works for those lovely Sonya Braga types who are sultry and mysterious, with their gentle curls peekabooing out from under their arms, or for our italian family friend who wears her bikini sans waxing and looks sexy and deeply female, like she is Earth sprouting life in ways that draw you close to inhale her richness, her fecundity. But for me, it elicits shudders and whispering asides; it\u2019s like I\u2019m NUDE, bottomless, a gal version of the Pantless Paul that roamed the neighborhood when we were in high school. \n\n Truthfully, I judge not the hair follicles of others. I don't care if your pubes are long enough to braid, if you are sporting so much facial hair that you lather up alongside your man. Really. I extend the arms of embrace for the whole of woman kind. But when it comes to my own presentation, I just feel better when my chin is smooth and I don\u2019t have to worry about food sticking to the hairs under my nose, like someone came in on me snorting bread crumbs. I like the sleekness of a freshly shaved leg. After a waxing, I feel free to cartwheel and tumble on the beach like the teens in a sugarless gum commercial rather than stand around tying and retying the fish towel around my waist.  \n\n I\u2019m aging. That\u2019s the thing. The body is slowly taking over and this is one of the signs. The skin has been patiently biding her time, bulking up, spreading out, creating curious eruptions of growth until the critical point at which the surface cells yell down to the dermis below, Send up the hairs! Start the blossoming of brown spots and tiny red specks! What are those? I thought it was splatter from spaghetti sauce but they aren\u2019t budging. The elastin, sucking in its tummy and smiling tensely for years like a 50s hostess, has its awakening en masse: Fuck it. We\u2019re taking a break. Get your own damn moisture.  \n\n Truth is, I\u2019m LUCKY to age. I\u2019m standing on the hilltop of my 40s and from here I see not only 50 in all her splendor, but also the bodies of those who never saw this view: Johnny, Mike, Nancy, Nephi, Siva\u2019s mom--the list is too long to continue. When I think of it that way, I say bring on the skin tags, sign me up for the gorilla girl booth at the circus.  \n\n I guess we\u2019re no different from the land upon which we walk. The shaping and reshaping happens all the time. It\u2019s only the later acts of expanding, erupting, sprouting, and sinking that get us nervous. As much as I\u2019d like to watch the drama unfold with eyes of wonder and appreciation, and while I\u2019ll certainly never go under the knife or consent to temporarily liquify the top layer of my skin, I think I will continue to stock up on shaving cream and pencil in my dates to see Olga in the wax room 4 or 5 times a year.\u00a0 For now. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/im_not_sonya.html", "title": "I'm Not Sonya"},

Spring, 1999. \n\n During our engagement, my husband and I saw a therapist to help us iron out some tiny wrinkles like why Dave wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to follow through with the wedding and why I wasn\u2019t sure his basic character was up to snuff. Of course, neither of those things were really true, we were both just a bit rattled by the idea of such a heady and complete commitment, I, since my first husband ducked out the door while I was, essentially, in the bath, and he, because his own dad did a pretty similar thing although in that case, his dad kept stopping by for impromptu visits like he was a family friend and not the actual father of three and errant husband of one who positively adored him. Once he let himself in when no one was home, helped himself to a sandwich and then ate it in front of the tube, nude. That\u2019s how my husband found him when he ran home after school to grab his cap for a walk in the oil fields with his crazy neighborhood pal. Oh, hi Dad, what\u2019s on? Clearly nothing, on you.  \n\n Anyway, Richard, our therapist, was the real article. Navigating relationships was both his passion and calling. He was was tickled pink by conflict, by the gems discovered in the mud and prickers of disagreement and judgment. He seemed to be positively giddy at the onset of a fight.\u00a0 Oh goodie! What can we learn today!  \n\n He helped us talk and listen, something we thought we had down for a number of decades but his way was all about invitations to spread things out on the table like we were snuggling inside by the fire on a wet day to piece together a jigsaw puzzle. It was about practicing curiosity and learning to live loosely in the knots of our differences. Judging by the time we had a session at his estate in the northern California hills, we weren\u2019t the only ones stuck inside a couple of tightly pulled tangles of string. We made our way down the long and curving driveway, waving to the gardener busily pruning in the orchard. Wow, this is nice, we offered to Richard, once we were inside. It\u2019ll do in a pinch! came his delighted reply and then he sort of danced around like the Martin Short character who\u2019s instrument was the triangle: giggle giggle ding ding. He flopped down in the chair across from us, sitting at opposites ends of the couch, and beamed his full attention, smiling so widely I thought his head would split in two.  \n\n What\u2019s going on with you two? He said, pen poised above his notebook, twinkle in his eye, like he had let us in on the investment of the century and we were there to tally off all the many things we\u2019d bought with our windfall. I guess that\u2019s how he looked at it since he believed a certain attitude coupled with a handy bag of tricks was all you needed to reap the riches of intimacy and joy and discovery for a lifetime. In his view, one didn\u2019t overcome judgment, jealousy, fear, or longing but just approached them as if they were fascinating travel companions.\u00a0  \n\n I think of him a lot, about his gleaming forehead and his unselfconscious and gangly outbursts of laughter and how much he helped us. He reminded me of a different Richard, a fellow acting student at the conservatory, who genuinely liked hearing other peoples\u2019 opinions. He knew his own mind, but he seemed to light up in the company of dissenting points of view; it was so interesting and lively, like bird watching in the rain forest--Oh, look at that one! \n\n Sometimes I can do it, and when that happens I always feel like giving mental health a big old hearty slap on the back, saying, you know what, pal? You\u2019re okay.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/03/richard.html", "title": "Richard"},

{"date": "February 22, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n Summer, 2004, taken by Dave \n\n I know a lot of what we go through in this house is simply raising a 4 year old. Still, it\u2019s hard to tease apart what is the normal experience and what is the aspergers. I imagine if I compared notes with other mothers, we'd nod and chuckle until I got to the parts that are decidedly unique, like diapers at 4 and squawking at the approach of another child. That is, if I ever went out and talked to other mothers. \n\n Anyway, none of us have gotten sick all winter--it\u2019s the up side of being a shut in.  \n\n During a recent patch of mild weather, I did cajole Fluffy outside. We walked to the neighborhood park. It\u2019s a safe destination because it\u2019s nearby and usually deserted. As we approached the jungle gym, a little boy came into view and Fluffy immediately froze and covered his eyes. Then he covered his ears and yelled NO! I said that\u2019s okay, honey, you can both play on the jungle gym, and we walked closer.  \n\n I could see that the boy was younger than Fluffy, maybe the very early side of 3. I could also see that he was one of those kids that absolutely LOVES other kids, especially older boys and right away he was smitten. He ran up to Fluffy and threw his arms around him, a friend! a friend! Fluffy stiffened, but kept it together pretty well. He walked around the boy and tried to go up a different set of stairs. The boy tailed him and they ended up smack next to each other by the side by side slides. Fluffy then looked at him and said \u201cYou go down that one and\u00a0 I\u2019ll go down this one. Ready, set, go!\u201d\u00a0 The clouds parted and the angels sang, but at the bottom I could see that Fluffy was done. He had tried it and now he wanted to be solo.  This boy , though, was now Fluffy\u2019s love slave. \n\n Fluffy went back to the stairs and the boy followed. When they were safely out of ear shot, I turned to the older man with gray hair whom I, given my advanced maternal age, had foolishly assumed was the dad. I spent a short minute blinking with the embarassed realization that he was the GRAND dad, and then said, \u201cMy son has a hard time with other kids.\u201d\u00a0 I smiled, and tried to communicate with my slightly pleading expression: please help your little grandson give my child just the merest bit of space. All along, I had been monitoring things in that alert way I do when I am ready for Fluffy to collapse into tears and topple backwards off the stairs or whip out a kiddie switchblade--ready for it, but adopting a manner that says, I simply can\u2019t recall a time when I\u2019ve felt more at ease.  \n\n I was saying things like, Okay guys, give each other a little room, Okay, let\u2019s take turns now, Oops, hang on! Wait until he\u2019s all the way down! You guys are doing great! \n\n Meanwhile, the old guy was doing a lot of spacing out and jangling the change in his pocket. Fluffy was giving all the signals, get back, give me some breathing room, I don\u2019t want to play. He\u2019d go the opposite way, switch back, recoil--yet the boy pressed on, trying to merge. Fluffy finally jumped off the climber and ran toward the swings. When the boy bolted after him, Fluffy veered off to the length of plastic dividers that he likes to traverse as if he is on the balance beam. The boy abandoned the swing in mid air and chased him, trailing so closely behind he kept bumping into him and knocking him off the beam, like Curly in a Three Stooges movie. I did my best to coach from the sidelines but it was too late, Fluffy had reached his limit. He turned to him and shouted NO STOP IT. The boy, in neurotypical bipolar fashion, changed on a dime, bared his fangs and shot back NO YOU STOP IT holding up his hands to push. Fluffy hit the ground, sobbing and screaming, kicking the wood chips into a frantic design. THAT GOT THE OLD MAN\u2019S ATTENTION; he swooped in and scooped up the boy.  \n\n I held Fluffy while he cried and flailed around. I said yes, he was walking too close, you can tell him, you can tell him with your big boy words to give you some room. After a long while, Fluffy rose unsteadily. His eyes were splotchy and red; gobs of snot streamed out of his nose. He turned and said to the boy, \u201cGive me some room\u201d, who was by then, a hundred yards away.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/trip_to_the_par.html", "title": "Trip To The Park"},

{"date": "February 27, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n Flying Fluffy, 2001, taken by Dave\n\n \n\n Things are opening up here at Fluffy Central. We are moving out of the aby-normal life and approaching the peri-normal; we are circling normalcy. A shape to the day is beginning to take form; an approach to the growth we are asking for from Fluffy is coming into view. Some help is on the way.  \n\n And just in time. For as much as I worked on visualizing myself doing arching back twirls in the warm enveloping water, as much as I tried to lean into the belief that having Aspergers doesn\u2019t have to mean anything about my son\u2019s future, I have felt the choking panic of what could lie ahead for him. If you thought your child may never experience the joy and spontaneity of true emotional connectedness, that he could endure years of ridicule and get beaten up by fellow teenagers because of his eccentricities, that he might have to painstakingly work to decode the rules of social interaction for the rest of his life in order to hide his confusion and fear, I think it would feel like an emergency to you. I imagine you would sometimes want to run through the streets screaming, HELP STOP DO SOMETHING WE MUST DO SOMETHING NOW.  \n\n So, from this vantage point, on the floor next to my child\u2019s confused little body, I hear the sirens approaching and I am breathing easier. The adrenaline pumps are slowing down. \n\n My husband and I have been struggling with the how how how of this playwork. How do you teach friendship skills to a 4 year old? How do you ignite his passion for connecting to people? How do you entice him to leave the safe and predictable world of information, facts, and computer games for the unwieldy, fluid, and highly variable world of relating to other human beings? Well, Dr. H., the Asperger Specialist, is saving the day. \n\n She presented her formal diagnosis and put Fluffy squarely in the Asperger camp. She enumerated his strengths and weakness and recognized his warmth and sense of humor as atypical. Hooray for atypical! She agreed to work with Fluffy and us on a weekly basis--to teach us techniques to use in the playroom.\u00a0 And she introduced us to the brilliant and clear work of Dr. Steven Gutstein.  \n\n We instantly ordered  Solving the Relationship Puzzle , Gutstein\u2019s first book that describes the difference between the neurotypical child and the high functioning autistic child. He outlines the typical child\u2019s developmental stages that allow for Emotional Sharing, a social interaction where being with the other person is the point; where children discover, share, and connect, as opposed to Instrumental Interaction, which is scripted and directed to a specific end. We need both in this world. Things would descend very quickly into chaos if we marched into the bank and gruffly pushed the queue aside to secure the top space, if everyone randomly abided traffic regulations or came and left classrooms and the workplace on a whim.  \n\n But scripts do not govern the emotional experience of human interaction. Instead, there\u2019s a constant dance of adjusting, readjusting, gathering, and interpreting enormous amounts of information. The very heart of satisfying interaction is the introduction of novelty and the element of surprise. It\u2019s a never ending improvisation requiring a host of processes working together seamlessly and with lightening speed. That is a \u201cfluid\u201d system and that is the very system the autistic cannot navigate.  \n\n Many now believe that autism can be seen as an information processing disorder--that any one or two or an infinite combination of factors involved in processing information can be affected, which would account for the high degree of variability in the expression of those with autism, AS and PDD. I\u2019ve been told you would see 100 unique versions of Asperger Syndrome if you came upon 100 people with Aspergers gathered at one time.  \n\n Can you imagine the scene? Who would be doing the listening? \n\n Gutstein\u2019s  program  is tangible and exciting and incredibly accessible and I am about to board a plane for his home town of Houston where I will clean his toilet with my tongue. That\u2019s the level of gratitude and relief and enthusiasm I have for him and his work. He\u2019s teaching us how to go back to the beginning, back to when Fluffy was less than a year old, when he began to fall off, when he began to gamely build his little house on a foundation of splintery toothpicks. He\u2019s teaching us how to get Fluffy to pay attention to us not because he's going to get an M&M but because he is genuinely interested in us, in what we will say, what we think, what will happen next. \n\n And you know what the first step is? SHUT UP.  \n\n 70% of our communication is nonverbal but kids on the spectrum have a NON VERBAL LEARNING DISORDER. They\u2019re not picking it up, not cluing in. Gutstein says use less words, slow down, pause frequently. Whenever possible, nod or shake your head, shrug shoulders, look confused or excited or surprised using your face and body. Get their attention with a strange sound or a stutter, a whisper then a shout, insert a nonsense word, collapse to the ground mid-sentence. \n\n It\u2019s already working. Yesterday I told Fluffy I was going to have my hair fixed and he looked at me for a moment and said, \u201cWhy Mommy? Your hair already looks pretty right now\u201d\u00a0 and you know what I did? I cried. I cried because that was the first time he had said anything like that to me. I would have cried if he told me I looked like Larry King, well, who wouldn't, but the point is, he made a spontaneous observation about me that seemed, at its heart, to be solely about connecting. It wasn\u2019t about building a bad thing out of MagnaTiles; it wasn\u2019t about how many backup guys were in his favorite computer game. \n\n And there\u2019s more: we\u2019ve gotten more help in the playroom. We're hired a gifted Speech Pathologist and Occupational Therapist who will soon begin working with Fluffy, pairing him with an appropriate playmate when he is ready. And we are back to swimming after three months away. Fluffy loves the water. He is free and spontaneous. He is slips off the noodle and leaps from the edge of the pool, laughing as he breaks through the water's surface, blinking his star-lashes open and closed. Afterwards, he leans against me while the hot shower massages his back. It soothes and relaxes him. So little does.  \n\n You know, I need to space out of the couch and flip through a magazine; I need to spend an hour trying on clothes, doing my nails, attending to my body hair, I need to luxuriate in the bath with the luffa, shave my legs, get a bikini wax, and have a massage; I need to walk around with no timers set, and listen to a whole song through to the end rather than to a few seconds of baffling sounds over and over and over as the stereo locks into the result of the latest \u201cpeak search\u201d Fluffy has programmed, something even Sony didn\u2019t include in the specs.\u00a0  \n\n But for my entire adult life, I\u2019ve also needed to get up early and write. I\u2019m finally doing both and it\u2019s all because of Fluffy.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1885477708/qid=1109534802/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-9064198-9556845", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843107147/qid=1109534915/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-9064198-9556845"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/circling_around.html", "title": "Circling Normalcy"},

Cookies are out but all bets are off on the salami.

{"date": "February 13, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n \n\n My Nana died with unsightly facial hair. It\u2019s true. She suffered a terrible stroke and spent the last years of her life in a home, doubled over in a kind of yoga posture resulting from severely weakened neck muscles. I don\u2019t know if was a case of a neglectful staff or a tweezer shortage or simply if hair plucking hour was scheduled directly after my departure, but when I was there I could not keep my eyes off the hair. I sat there frozen in place by the little hair soldiers marching across her face. WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE DO SOMETHING? Why didn\u2019t I do something? I suppose I was young and selfish and made skittish by the sour smell surrounding her stillness, but I vowed then and there I would write an electrolysis clause into my living will as soon as I gathered the paperwork because clearly you can\u2019t depend on the kindness of strangers or the decency of remaining family members.  \n\n Nana lived far away and I only saw her occasionally. We never had the kind of Grammy close relationship you see on the Lifetime Channel. Still, I harbored her no ill will and even loved her. My childhood was filled with visits to her former home and even now I see and hear and smell the house with a sharpness that surprises me. I see the cupboard where the Pop Tarts were kept next to the door leading down to the cellar where my sister and I successfully cracked open a golf ball and unraveled the ten thousand feet of elastic string, where we played ping pong while Pop Pop whistled aggressively throughout his chores. I smell the musty staircase to the upstairs where we slept and hear Nana emitting little bursts of gas like a kid playing putt putt with a toy boat, her charm bracelets jingling and swaying on her wrists. \n\n Those last years must have been tortuous for her. She was a gifted seamstress and practiced meticulous hygiene. In that nursing home, her face was left to sprout like a spring lawn and her outfits grew more juvenile until at the end she was dressed in pink onesies and a floral bib. Still, when she was propped up in her wheel chair by the window getting a little air and visitors sat a number of yards away engaged in their own lively chatter, through the distance and jumble of words, someone would misspeak and she would gather the strength of the gods and lift her head. \u201cNo, her maiden name was Garret\u201d she would say, or, \u201cNo, it was 1954\u201d\u00a0 or, \u201cNo, we met them in  Cairo .\u201d\u00a0 It never ceased to amaze me. She had a mind like a hawk and a compulsion to correct, a trait that has yet to fade from her lineage.  \n\n There wasn\u2019t a viewing but I saw her one final time at the funeral home. She was the only dead person I\u2019d ever seen and I was shocked by how small her body had become, like a young girl\u2019s. Her skin held tightly to the bones of her face. Thankfully, someone had taken care of the hair; in fact, her body seemed completely smooth save for long wisps of gray on her head. I thought, it really is true what they say about completing a circle, returning to the mystery from whence we came. She looked like an ancient queen and I felt a holy reverence for her and for all of us here. Right on cue, my aunt and her daughter lit bundles of sage and starting smudging up a small dust storm. I swatted at the smoke, vaguely annoyed because, after all, none of us really  are  native americans or even massage therapists and Nana would have found the ritual absurd.  \n\n I don\u2019t know why I thought of this tonight all these years later but it probably has something to do with my own facial hair and its relationship to aging. You can smudge over my body, but please, have the lady with the high voltage tweezers come to my room if half my face slips to one side as I drool on the sheets. I don\u2019t want to scare Fluffy's kids out of giving me a goodbye kiss. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/facial_hair.html", "title": "Facial Hair"},

Maybe I\u2019ve been\npassing it around--coughing into the wind and neglecting to wash my\nhands. Letters do make an impact. Maybe if we all spoke up the voice of\nreason could find its way back to the center of government. Because,\nthe truth is, I\u2019m afraid. I may not be qualified to give congressional\ntestimony or address a crowd of dissenters, but I want to be heard.\nDon\u2019t you? \n\n I want the mercury out of vaccines, out of the Rhogam that was\ninjected into me several times during my pregnancy that quite possibly\ncontributed to my son\u2019s Asperger Syndrome. I want to protect a woman\u2019s\nright to her make decisions about her own body. I want to KEEP the\nseparation of church and state, and protect our civil liberties. I say,\neliminate electronic voting NOW.\u00a0 The federal government spent 1\nbillion dollars for the 2004 elections, quite possibly so that they\ncould manipulate the outcome again, and this time, no one could trace\nit. I hate this war in Iraq. I ache for the many thousands of Iraqi\ndead--men, women, and children. I greive for the over 1,000 Americans\nkilled, the hundreds more maimed, and the countless soldiers who will\ndie an excruciating death, long after they're stateside, from\nexposure to the radioactive munitions our military insists we need. \n\n\n\n I suppose it\u2019s possible that a steady stream of lettes from\nregistered voters would fall on deaf ears, that larger forces are at\nwork and can\u2019t be stopped until the next election. But the only way to\ncreate the unlikely is to first believe it can be done.

I\u2019ve been making everything talk: the board games, the chalk board, the crayons. I\u2019ve dancing around to \u2018Ring Around The Rosie\u2019 with BoBo the punching bag clown in tow, dragging him behind me and tossing him into the pillows at the end with gusto. I\u2019ve been adding a little finger puppet named Mousie to our MagnaTile play, only he\u2019s a bit of a wild card; he can\u2019t talk and so is often misunderstood. He\u2019s frequently scared and frustrated and prone to fits of temper--wildly destroying structures we are trying to build. When that happens, Fluffy stares and stares at Mousie and then gently reassures him that it\u2019s okay, just keep trying, we can rebuild. \n\n Challenging in the playroom is all about persistence, something you\u2019d think I\u2019d be good at since I can harangue with the best of them. I think I was being a little too shy before, taking Fluffy\u2019s no at face value. I have to remember that stretching is scary. Every time I ask him to consider a new game or a new approach to a scripted game, I am asking him to do something harder than I can imagine. It\u2019s not hard for me: (a) I'm not 4, and, (b) but I don\u2019t have Aspergers. For him, it\u2019s like I\u2019m saying, Come on honey, try a little brain surgery, just  try  it.  \n\n For him, all relating is hard. All of it. And so, I am going to ask myself to do something hard too, in solidarity. There are so many things to choose from, like allowing my husband to finish his sentence, put the dishes in the dishwasher during the day instead of stacking them in Pisa towers all over the counter a la welfare hotel, taking the garbage right out to the bins rather than leaving it on the front porch for the raccoons to gut overnight. It\u2019s a nice look for the neighborhood; Dave thinks we ought to just stamp \u2018Welcome\u2019 on the trash bags and call it a day.  \n\n I\u2019ve decided I am going to ask myself to meditate every morning. I used to do it, twice a day, all before becoming a mom, mind you. Since then I have only done it sporadically and superficially like when I attempt to read  The Week In Review  on Sunday. Let\u2019s face it, when it comes to The Sunday Times and the  available  sunday time, I\u2019m grabbing the Arts and Leisure, period. ARTS and LEISURE, mmmmm.  \n\n So, morning meditation it is.

Is there some small thing you\u2019d like to add or return to, but that takes an extra bit of effort? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/ive_been_pullin.html", "title": "Show of Solidarity"},

But not at Roxie's, the fabulous upscale consignment shop where I spent a raucous hour with my sister and her friend, the eponymous owner; where we interrupted our own conversations to gyrate and cabbage patch to tunes on the radio and lasso a couple of dummy torsos for some nudge nudge wink wink asides. It was a giddy time for me, the gal who sings songs of freedom when sprung for the weekly solo trip to the dump, to be in the company of these smartly dressed women.

{"date": "February 20, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Sister, left, behind Dad, in backpack.   \n\n \n\n Yesterday I went on a big adventure to see  Christo and Jeanne Claude's ,  The Gates , in  NYC.  I almost bagged out since our babysitter called in sick the day before--something about a high fever, throwing up, oozing skin pustules, blah blah blah...I couldn\u2019t hear the rest because the news sent me into such a tailspin. Dave had just taken over in the playroom for an hour and she was set to cover the next 2 which gave me 3 hours--my emancipation. I had been clinging to the promise of this time all morning; hang on, hang on, you\u2019re almost there. It\u2019s a terrible way to feel and not something I ever imagined I would go through as a mom. But there I was: watching the clock\u2019s interminable progress, rolling the stone ball uphill, pulling up telephone poles by hand.\u00a0  \n\n To be fair, I\u2019m sure she really  was  sick; she\u2019s been a life saver, our one and only helper in the playroom. She has enormous quantities of patience and calm--she\u2019s the Go To gal at the daycare where she works for the two kids with Authoritative Disobedience Disorder. Fluffy has fun with her once he passes the transitional period of rigidly extending his arms, screaming NO! and JUST WATCH! and hurling the occasional MagnaTile bomb at the peek-a-boo band of her tiny twenty-one-year-old tummy.\u00a0 Our schedule is so absurdly overwhelming, we are stretched so thin, any dips into bits of free time send shock waves through the earth of my stability and threatened to tear open up a ragged split stretching for miles, revealing roiling lava pits below.  \n\n We\u2019re dangerously understaffed. We\u2019re the triage unit with one nurse on 24-hour duty. Administration keeps meaning to beef up the department but they haven\u2019t had the time. No one wants to let go of their coffee break to get out there and follow up on the initials leads.  \n\n When the call came in I immediately left the house. I thought the frigid air might snap back some sanity, and if that didn\u2019t work, I could always fall back on a little scream therapy. When I lived in NYC, I used to freely cut loose in my own apartment until my reclusive neighbor carefully asked how I was. FINE!  Really?  she answered, unconvinced as she shakily maneuvered her keys and withdrew inside her door. After that I took to the the high-rise elevators in midtown in times of stress. It was easy to know when to stop and smile serenely at the wall if you tuned into the whirring hum rising and falling in the shaft. Now that I have a car, I can sail along the highway, slamming the steering wheel and bellowing at the top of my lungs. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s an eyeful, but between stop lights and with the windows up, it\u2019s my own little portable padded room.  \n\n Yesterday, I discovered a new patch of privacy as I vented under the wailing drone of the industrial vacuum at the car wash. The attendant came by to fill up his metal bucket with a stream of quarters and said something. I was blindly launching french fries, mangled cassette tapes, and empty water bottles behind me into the air. \u201cWHAT IS IT?\u201d I turned on him, brandishing a hairbrush I had been trying to shove into the glove compartment. My hair was wild and my glasses were akimbo and I\u2019m sure I looked more like a gal on a weekend pass than a suburban stay at home mom neatening up the wagon before a road trip. He may have said, \u2018Feels good to get things done!\u2019 or, \u2018Feels good to be out in the sun!\u2019 or even, \u2018Feel in the mood to get hold of a gun?\u2019 I don\u2019t know, but he was holding his happy pail of quarters and I managed to smile back and chat a little about the miles of fabric floating above Central Park. \n\n I didn't cancel my trip. My sister, who roams the dark and mysterious realm of newpaper-delivery people, provided the much-needed inspiration for our early start, my dad covered all expenses, I did the driving, and my nephew just prayed none of us would embarrass him. \n\n  My nephew monitoring his mom   \n\n\n\n\n\n I grabbed the cell phone and left my lovely husband and child at home to fend for themselves, babysitter or no. I piled my camera, sister, nephew, and Dad into the Subaru and we barreled down 95 with snacks in our laps and adventure in our hearts. Everything was with us: the sun was wide awake, the sky had shaken the clouds off the page, the roads were easy and clear. We found perfect parking around the corner from a Starbucks where we were relieved and fortified. We walked the few blocks to the 79th street entrance of the park, passing the National Hair Removal and Cellulite Institute, a deeply reverential moment for me. \n\n\u00a0  \n\n We walked under and through the yards of swaying saffron with the sea of humanity. I heard accents and other languages, watched toddlers push strollers into small dogs and park benches, saw up-towners, down-towners, in-towners, out-of-towners; those stopping often to look up and snap photographs and others hurriedly passing by on their way home or to work.  \n\n\n\n The Gates  are not like a large painting, they're not something you can see at once; they're spread throughout the whole 843-acre park, like fantastic fabric and steel dominos. They are something you have to  be with , as you walk along the crossing and intersecting paths of the landscape, with all the other people walking too. You are  part  of  The Gates , and it feels eastern and wall-like--not confining but defining and connected in a subtle but powerful and pleasing way. I wished there had been snow on the ground; I would have loved to see the deep orange set against the white. Instead, we had a brilliant day; the light was part of the show, casting shadows and illuminating the material in sometimes breathtaking ways. There were great spaces of air moving in and around the mottled trunks and bare branches of the trees. \n\n    \n\n\n\n It was a bit unreal to zip up and down 95 as if it were a neighborhood street in order to spend a few minutes in Central Park among the installation that will soon vanish into thin air, or more likely, be transform into whatever recyclables the artists have in mind. But it was a wonderful day. I miss living in New York. All that stimulation would probably flatten Fluffy like a fly, but it  is  so alive and pulsing and interesting. Everyone looks and no one looks.  \n\n While we were there, a smartly dressed fellow in Carol Channing eyewear and sparkly nail polish dashed over with pen and paper requesting some help writing a cursive capital L, a woman videographer took a small statement and some footage of my bright orange scarf and my sister's soft orange mittens, my dad pointed out the serendipity of  The Gates  reflected in the polished marble bases of sculpture after sculpture within the park. And no one got shot, something that both relieved and dissapointed my nephew.  \n\n I made it home for Fluffy's bedtime routine, a tough feat but a requirement for me to take part in the whirlwind event. We were all exhausted but giddy with our grand success. In fact, we're thinking of going to see  this  next.  \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://christojeanneclaude.net/", "http://www.centralparknyc.org/", "http://www.bebeyond.com/LearnEnglish/DailyReadings/Arts/DesertSculptor.htm"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/my_escape.html", "title": "My Christo Escape"},

It\u2019s about the only place that I can cut loose now that the sun set, long ago, on the wild days of my youth. I don\u2019t drink, smoke pot, do \u201ce\u201d or any other drug named after a single letter. I almost never sniff the hose-y part of the whipped cream except if there\u2019s a chance I\u2019ll score the last bit of the cream, it\u2019s all about the cream, the sweet delicious cream. I don\u2019t debt or act inappropriate sexually (or even appropriate sexually, come to think of it), steal my boss\u2019s colorful stockings, lift passages from my sister\u2019s diary and copy it into mine as if it represented my OWN PERSONAL THOUGHTS, or pretend to guess the amount of money my parent\u2019s wallet holds only to exclaim \u201cyou\u2019re right!\u201d as I palm the extra bills.  \n\n No, I\u2019m the model of maturity, except when it comes to swearing. Or eating. Or farting. Or forgetting to throw my tampon out after leaving it on the bathtub rim like a luckless mouse during a shower. Okay, but those things aside, I really do inhale still waters and exhale the storm. At least I try, when I\u2019m not pointing out the section of the countertop that was neglectfully left a-crumb or stomping around wondering aloud why it is only I who holds the torch in the planning and scheduling and meal-making and relationship-tending category.  \n\n And I\u2019ve gotten very attached to it--swearing, that is. I know it\u2019s offensive to some, and I really do apologize for stepping over the line, for saying \u2018Fuck it\u2019 when I guess I could just as easily say, \u2018Oops\u2019; or 'What the fuck?' when \u2018Are you closed?\u2019 would do or even trump it since it adds that extra old-time charm, like \u2018Oh my stars!\u2019 or \u2018What in the world?\u2019 but there you have it, there is proof that the entertainment cupboard is currently bare. Perhaps it points to some deeper issue but right now that will have to take a back burner to saving my sanity and laying a relationship-building foundation for my son. La la. \n\n This has been going on for a long time starting way back in my early adolescence when my parents gave my sister and I one minute of swearing when we needed to blow off a little steam. At the time, we lived in a beautiful old victorian, the grand sweeping variety with 12 foot ceilings and velvet wallpaper and pockets doors throughout. There was a long butler\u2019s pantry on the way to the kitchen flanked by glass-door cabinets, copper countertops, and an old dumbwaiter at the far end. We would open the door to that dumbwaiter and curse into its darkness at the top of our lungs while our mother stood by, watching the second hand. We tossed them all into that well with gusto, including VAGINA and PUBIC HAIR and even MRS. WATT, the vice principal who was rumored to have 3 boobs. The whole episode never failed to bring on cascades of nervous and tumbling laughter and left us breathless and invigorated, like a country run. \n\n I don\u2019t swear when I\u2019m with Fluffy and I\u2019m with him a lot; the pressure builds, as you can imagine. What helps is when Dave does something kind, like when he brings hot tea to the couch where I\u2019ve collapse in disgust at having found dark facial hair now on my CHEEK. In these such instances, I used to say, \u201cYou are so fucking great\u2019 but that fucking just wasn\u2019t cutting it and so now I say \u201cYou are so fucking fucked up\u201d\u00a0 or \u201cGod, you\u2019re fucked up\u201d and then we bask in the glow of our mutual love. He does it too now. When I told him I loved him dearly and couldn\u2019t imagine going on this crazy ride with anyone else, he got all misty and said \u201cAw, honey, you are such a piece of shit.\u201d Isn\u2019t he the best? \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/caution_contain.html", "title": "This Chick Was Made For Swearin'"},

Anyone who thinks there is nothing unusual going on here should get their ass over to my house and give it a try.  There is no flexibility, no fluidity, no improvisation.

Instead, I say, Okay, because, after all, it\u2019s the convention to ask, everybody asks. When they ask how Fluffy is I tell them he\u2019s fantastic because of course, he is; he\u2019s a fantastic guy, the guy I love To Infinity and Beyond and Back Again, Infinity Times.  I know there are many people who are struggling with MUCH bigger challenges, who have more than one child, in some cases, two, or five, who have terrifying financial situations or kids with crippling diseases, or several children with special needs. Maybe one of the parents up and leaves, or gets sick, or just has very bad breath or a jarring profile, or maybe a homeless family of ten has to sleep standing up against damp laundry in the basement of a passive aggressive neighbor, or I DON'T KNOW, you get my point. Yes, things in our house are pretty darn good, really. We\u2019re all healthy, we eat in our newly expanded dining room, baby diarrhea rugs are purchased and returned, the marriage is hanging in there on this leg of the obstacle course, the tag-team stretch when we spend no time together except to argue over who gets less down time or who is more tired (me, and me). I guess I could say it\u2019s a litle like having cancer in the way that it puts things in focus, or rather snaps in a lens that has an odd perspective but a resolution that kicks fucking butt. I can see things I couldn\u2019t see before and it is allowing me to cut through uncertainty with precision--my uncertainty. For example, I really couldn\u2019t care less what my neighbors think of me and I say that without malice. That extends to everyone I know, for that matter, because no one can know what this is like and I can\u2019t know what any thing else is like. I need my hope intact. I need my focus crisp. There is no room for mommy to have ADHD or to collapse into explanation or bitterness.\u00a0 I need Lush Possibility, my own little rain forest, teaming with movement and undiscovered species, ripe with smells and rebirth, thick with symbiotic systems and torrential rains that flood but also feed, trees that hold ground and nests and plants that simply hang from the branches and dangle their roots in the air. I need those trees and their oxygen, I can\u2019t afford any amount of deforestation. When people say, gee, you\u2019re son\u2019s no different from any other, what\u2019s the problem? I swipe my hands through a stack of stills and clips in my mind for a handful of evidence and then I stop, because what\u2019s the point? Either they\u2019re right and I\u2019m a loser and Fluffy is a completely neurotypical kid and Dave and I are certifiable or they\u2019re not right because they simply don\u2019t know. No, Fluffy is not slapping himself in the head and barking incoherently, he wasn\u2019t born with fins for hands or with his heart on the outside. But there are some things you have to get closer to see. They don\u2019t know that my son looks terrified when I pretend to be anything, or that his arms dart in the air and he squawks like a bird on fire when a child approaches him at the Y or that he sometimes doesn\u2019t recognize me when we\u2019re in a crowd due to face blindness. They don\u2019t know that as much as Fluffy wants to play with me that I\u2019m really besides the point. I may be his favorite besides the point person but I\u2019m besides the point none-the-less. It\u2019s not about our connection, the playing with or being with the other person, it\u2019s about fulfilling some rigid and necessary role dictated from deep within his brain, instructions that are out of his own control. Interaction is not fluid, there is no turn taking, conversation is a ride on a number of predetermined loops, all new things are rejected at first because their very newness is threatening.  Right now, Fluffy\u2019s like the bromeliads that suspend from the canapy, that spend a lifetime without being grounded, without reaching their roots into the dark wet soil of the earth. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen because this tree\u2019s gonna fall one day and then what. I don\u2019t know. Today, I just don\u2019t know. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/horsetails_i_do.html", "title": "Dangling In The Branches"},

Everything feels like an emergency and I have to let down or the sparks are going to snap my connecting wires and send them thrashing in all directions. The racing does not translate into getting more done or finding a break, it just creates this deeper need for finishing. There is no finishing.\n\n \n\n I\u2019m not sure what happened. Did it really all start when Fluffy was born and I was suddenly gripped by knowing I could not survive his death? It was like being informed that I would have to raise my son on a high rise window ledge, but hey! Relax! Take a break! Go out and have a little fun! \n\n \n\n I never imagined I would find motherhood so code red. I never thought of myself as a tense person. Was it just that I wanted it so much, tried for so many years, that once it finally happened I couldn\u2019t believe it would continue? Trust it? Was this hopeless neurotic hidden behind a nude body stocking that was torn and tossed away after the birth with all that water and blood and placenta or liver or whatever that enormous, thick, slippery thing was?\n\n \n\n I have an odd capacity for sacrifice, only I hesitate to call it sacrifice because I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve done because it was the only way I knew how to be me, to express me as mother. If I believed my son needed a small chunk of my actual skin every few months in order to create a solid foundation, a feeling of belonging, of deep rightness with self, it would be like, okay, let\u2019s get some alcohol, honey, and clean up mommy\u2019s embroidery scissors.  \n\n What am I, insane? \n\n \n\n I\u2019ve been true to myself by giving my son what he seemed to need and need and need and need but how can it work because I also need and there often isn\u2019t room. And now, at the very start of this challenge, at perhaps, this critical window of brain plasticity, it would be like reaching down during the pregnancy to tell Fluffy to shove over; I need a hit off that uterus, big guy. The water he was in then is the water I need to be in now, to suspend and slowly roll around. \n\n \n\n And then the sun came out this morning and laid claim to the sky, inhaling the chill and exhaling a veritable heat wave for the east coast in February. 50 degrees. Fluffy and I went to the beach to shoot off balloon rockets and dig in the sand and while we were there, I stared out at the bay and remembered this game my sister and I used to play at the seashore. It was called Dead Fish and it was one of those most exhilarating and relaxing games of my childhood. We would lay flat in the shallow waters and go limp. The waves would come in and crash down over us, push our bodies up on the shore and then drag them back out, turn us over onto our backs, our sides, our bellies, and backs again. Sand would coat our skin, creep inside our swimsuits, tangle our hair in fists. The sun baked our bodies; the water was warm, indescribably soft and enveloping.\n\n \n\n I need that. I need a little Dead Fish. I need to go through my day in slower motion, to keep the image of doing arching back twirls, over and over, of rolling in and out with the waves, of hearing that low steady pulse. Even now, as I type this--to allow my fingertips to move across the keyboard with calm. \n\n \n\n There is no emergency; all is as it should be. There is no need to manage anything. I can open the flood gates and feel the power of the tide. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/post.html", "title": "Dead Fish"},
{"date": "February 11, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t (Washington Air & Space Museum, 2005, taken by Dave) \n\n \n\n Fluffy was a star at Dr. H.'s, the Asperger Specialist. Such a star that Dave and I were in danger of being carted away by the people with the extensive white jacket collection. Day after day in the playroom, I suggest a game of ball, a toss or kick or roll or bounce? No go. Dr. H points to a dirty yellow plastic thing and says, \u201cHow about playing a game with Mommy?\u201d to which Fluffy cheerfully replies, \u201cOKAY, I know! I\u2019ll throw it to Daddy, he\u2019ll throw it to Mommy, and she can throw it to me!\u201d\u00a0 Sure! And then let\u2019s put on a play! Order a pizza! Grab the cell and hook up some playdates for Christsakes, what\u2019s a guy got to do around here for a little SOCIAL CONTACT?  \n\n She was great with him, we wanted to hire her for the playroom. We figured we could go up to $12 an hour.  \n\n He transitioned like a champ, kept her company while she pretended to mix up food for the baby doll; he didn\u2019t want to answer any of her pretend play questions and even once simply said \u201cI don\u2019t want you to pretend anything\" but he did bend down and gently ask the baby whether he liked pudding or cookies best. He built a small train track with calm and concentration while we all chatted in her office at the end of our session. The last time he showed any interest in his train box at home was when he hurled a hefty section at Dave\u2019s head.  \n\n There was of course, the typical stuff, the acting drunk when things got hard like playing follow the leader, the light switch fascination that we exulted three years ago (and spent hours holding him up to self-click or standing guard while he balanced on chairs) but that has now lost some appeal. He bolted for the door and nearly cracked the 2-way mirror with a set of drumsticks.  \n\n All in all, we were beaming.  \n\n We need to go back to get the formal results, but Dr. H. recognized the high register and the lack of visual referencing. She recognized  him  and confirmed what we already know: that Fluffy is very high functioning, that he has Asperger Syndrome, and that there are things we can do to help him. She's on board.  \n\n We don't have enough players for a game but Team Fluffy is slowly coming together.    \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/fluffy_was_a_st.html", "title": "Team Fluffy"},

{"date": "January 29, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Teething, 2001, taken by Dave \n\n\n\n Despite my better judgment, some of the computer games my son plays involve shooting, like the one about kids who don\u2019t fit in, mail-order assault weapons and shoot their neighbors while they sleep. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!  \n  \nBut there is one called Captain Bumper, about a pilot who gets hit by a rock in the asteroid belt while returning to his home planet with a ship full of bananas. As you can imagine, his ship is badly damaged and the crates go everywhere, including the many landscapes of the Mystery Planet where the Alien Queen Zeurbella and her troop of lowly Zeurbs reign evil and capture the beautiful and innocent Princess Lavita, locking her in the Queen\u2019s Fortress for all time.\u00a0 Captain Bumper, who is GOOD, jumps into his relief vessel to retrieve his bananas and rescue the princess who is also GOOD. Along the way, he navigates underground mazes, fights countless Zeurbs, flying fish, swarming mosquitos, attack coconuts, and the monster Queen herself, all of whom are BAD. It's mind-bogglingly complicated--diamonds, bananas, fuel, and protective shields float in heavily guarded airspace, or hide behind walls pulsing with lasars, generators must be disengaged or blown up by buttons found at great distances from the source. It is a land where creatures hatch out of cackling eggs, health goes up or down, and extra guys are scarce. And so much more that I can't keep up with since my knowledge of computers begins and ends with the letters and maybe a couple punctuation keys that are embedded in my keyboard.  \n\n So his Daddy does the computer thing with him, hence the acquisition of said computer games of death. Our son may not reference us during the course of the day, but he does, Dear Asperger Specialist, reference the computer. Does that count? We say, \"Wanna play tag?\" and he says, \u201cPress any key to start!\"\u00a0 If the game got off to a bad start, he does an impression of a flashing computer message by opening and closing his hands and intones, \u201cAbort. Game Over.\" \n\n Back to the shooting and the killing of alien Zeurbs. I'm not square with it, but it doesn't seem to disturb Fluffy. He's not afraid of death. And, so far, he's not methodically tearing the shells off turtles or stonily lighting bugs on fire in a pool of alcohol. He talks about death with a calm and comfort that I envy. And he talks about it a lot. To me--me of the midnight death panic. Let me pause here and toss a hearty thanks not just to my husband who downloaded the computer games, but also to my brother who launched into a detailed description of his own son\u2019s obsession with death on the car ride home from the airport last summer while my son was in the backseat, innocently tracking the passing trees with frightening alacrity, until he abruptly stopped and turned his gaze to the front seat. \u201cWhat is Uncle A. talking about, Mommy?\u201d \n\n Death makes a kind of fluid sense to his mind; it's orderly and malleable. Daddy is the oldest in the family, so he will die first, then me, and then him. When he wants more playtime (which happens during the day) he'll announce that he wishes it would be daytime until everyone was dead. He tells any one of the characters we pretend to be that if you don't eat your vitamins, you will die even before you're supposed to. He wonders aloud as we are walking by a cemetary, will he be buried there someday? (Gulp.) He considers the sun and wants to know how long it will be before it runs out of fuel, and will it then implode and create a \"dark space\" (read: black hole) like some super novas do? \n\n I don't know. Maybe all this talk will help me overcome a certain degree of terror over the inevitable end of my journey here on our own mystery planet, as it continuously spins and orbits until the day it won't anymore. \n\n \n\n \u00a0   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/despite_my_bett.html", "title": "This Mystery Planet"},

{"date": "February 02, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t The Berkshires, taken by Dave \n\n \n\n Have I mentioned that my son has a little bit of a sleep challenge? Have I let it slip in conversation that it\u2019s been 4 years plus one day since I got more than a 5 hour stretch of consolidated sleep? If I brush aside the stack of self-help, reach behind  The OASIS Guide To Asperger Syndrome, \u00a0  Enzymes for Autism, \u00a0  Children with Starving Brains, \u00a0  Finding Ben,   and other assorted current nighttime reading, I would find piles of dust-covered books entitled,  How Everyone But You Can Get Their Child To Sleep Soundly Without A Peep Of Protest.   \n\n I\u2019m a complete failure in this area. Okay. I said it. I knew it would be hard but I didn\u2019t know it would be THIS hard. I sometimes stand at the living room window and shake my head. My neighbor\u2019s house is Camp Kids. Packs of them, assorted ages, gravitate to that house year-round. They make tight circles on trikes and bikes in the driveway, frolic in the snow, play hockey in the street, bat balls in the yard, and chase each other around while happy screams and yelps of laughter sail through the air. Even when no one is home, stray children ricochet into the garage and help themselves to all manner of pull-toys and sporting supplies.   \n\n The dad is The Physician\u2019s Assistant Who Can Never Be Rattled; his wife, the invigorated Pediatric OT who runs her house like a PE teacher flying high on endorphins and discipline. She\u2019s forever returning from a morning 10 K or a bike tour of the state, infant in the backpack, the twins, smiling like dolls from the trailer hooked up behind. This woman is fit fit fit. At the state tennis finals, she rips through the competition and ends up going long in the men\u2019s double round. How d\u2019ya do? I yell from my porch in my bathrobe, dried toothpaste stuck to my chin like the old guy who walks by our house everyday and calls out \u201cShe\u2019s a cutie, that one!\u201d about my son. She holds up 3 trophies in victory and sings out, \u201cOne for each kid!\u201d \n\n It\u2019s the land where Everything is Awesome. During the power outages that happen in our neighborhood with odd regularity, their house remains lit, aglow with a warm yellow flicker. I keep thinking that if they were running a Son-Rise program, there\u2019d be a line of volunteers backed up to the highway. No one has sleep problems. Their's is a Weissbluth household, the guy of  Healthy Sleep Habits: Happy Child  fame, while I prefer,  Chronic Sleep Problems For Old Chicks With Facial Hair . It\u2019s a little controversial, but it works for me. \n\n I can\u2019t toss out a judgment to any mom out there when it comes to how they handle the sleep issue. We can only be who we are--the first rule in parenting: be true to yourself. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m missing some critical thing. All I know is, our own particular sleep situation needs a major relaunch. Although, what\u2019s left to do? I\u2019ve tried it all: throwing in the towel, sucking it up, taking no stand at all, giving in entirely, dashing to his side at the sound of a whimper, doing a total prat fall on the way up the stairs as he calmly calls my name, giving up the idea of ever sleeping with my husband again, and nothing works. \n\n I actually did do the dreaded cry it out. Fluffy was hopped up like a crack baby after weeks of enduring 15 hour stretches of wakefullness and popping up over and over like a burnt toaster waffle every 30 minutes during the night. Dave and I looked haunted and fried like our fingers were perpetually locked inside the light sockets. We were beaten down. Pressure came from all sides: family, friends, lactation consultants, the noted sleep clinic. We braced ourselves for a couple of bad nights; by all accounts, he\u2019d be sleeping like an angel on the third and we\u2019d comically smack ourselves in the head for waiting so long to Ferberize, right? I gave up on day 17. SEVENTEEN.  \n\n I couldn\u2019t take the crying. I couldn\u2019t put a lock on his door. I did what I could: rocked, nursed, walked, cooed, sang. I did the pick up put down, the pat pat resettle, the slow-mo arm withdrawal and whole body sneak away. I made charts and books and posters. I played the heartbeat, crashing waves, white noise, the scary clown music with nursery rhymes, and of course, classical hits soaring over subliminal messages about killing the president.  \n\n And still, he wakes.  \n\n Perhaps it\u2019s the mark of my eternal optimism or a kind of brain poisoning due to profound neuron death, but each night as I climb into bed I whisper, maybe tonight? Maybe it will be different tonight?  \n\n Or maybe 20 years from now, Fluffy will swing by after work for a quick diaper change and a boobie, and I will dash over to his house throughout the evening and gently lay his weaving form back to sleep.   \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0609608118/qid=1107371261/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5494121-7187366?v=glance&s=books", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0972591877/qid=1107371475/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-5494121-7187366?v=glance&s=books", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/188364710X/102-5494121-7187366?%5Fencoding=UTF8", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/007140225X/qid=1107371023/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-5494121-7187366"], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/02/have_i_mentione.html", "title": "Maybe Tonight"},

{"date": "January 30, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n I read  David Hochman's article \u00a0 in the Sunday Styles section of  T he New York Times and then I read  mothershock.com \u00a0 and  tomoma.blogs.com  and felt better, but not completely settled down. \n\n I think the piece was belittling and missed the point. A belittling point misser. Why isn't writing by mothers about their lives viewed simply as that, writing? And discussed from that perspective? Is it well written? Funny? Evocative? Moving? Does it express something about (forgive me) the human experience? Or simply, does it help someone feel less lonely, maybe give a gal permission to start her own blog or finish the painting she started for her sister\u2019s birthday gift, several years ago?  \n\n Let\u2019s start with the title: \n\n \"Mommy (And Me) A generation of new parents are telling tales from the crib in blogs that revel in self-absorption\"  \n\n Why is it, necessarily, self-absorbed to write nonfiction? What, pray tell, is the definition of memoir, anyway? I mean, aren\u2019t all stabs at self expression and creativity essential self-absorbed? Narcissistic? We look at ourselves to bring out what lies deep within in order to be more authentic and feel more fully awake in our lives.  \n\n Hochman says that blogging  \u201cshines a spotlight on a generation of parents ever more in need of validation, an insecurity that doesn\u2019t necessarily serve the cause.\u201d  He goes on to say  \u201c...the more parents blog, the less likely they are to get the attention and validation they seem to crave.\u201d \n\n I don\u2019t think\u00a0 people are blogging to  get  validation. People are blogging to save their sanity, to give  themselves  attention and validation. In fact, I think this generation of parents is  less  in need of validation and much more willing to stand up and say, this is how it looks over here and I\u2019m writing it down. If you\u2019re interested, come have a peek.  \n\n In the article, Professor Meredith W. Michaels is quoted as saying that parents blog to turn \u00a0 their  \"life into a story that answers the question \u2018Why on earth am I doing this?\u2019\u201d ? Really? The blogs I read don\u2019t seem to be probing the question of WHY\nthey are raising children, they are chronically the HOW of raising\nchildren. \n\n More people are blogging. Hooray! Enormous amounts of writing is available at a click--writing that creates community and breaks isolation. And Thank God, because sometimes the echo, she is loud. If you don't like what you read, use your mouse. Now, if that was only as effective in the three-dimensional world, we'd all be clutching them like Chauncey Gardener clutched his remote in  Being There .   \n\n\n\n\n\n Anyway, what would be the harm if every parent in the world really  did  start to blog? We\u2019re all in this together. Whether you choose to have kids or not, nobody gets into this life without transporting someone to parenthood.

What would be the best present ever? \u201cMommy, the AT-Mos-Theer protects the earth from the BURNING HOT FIERY HOT FLAMES of the sun.\u201d  Fluffy doesn\u2019t really care about presents or special meals. He cares about candy, computer time, and MagnaTiles, in that order. He gets candy once in blue moon, a small bit of computer time daily, and MagnaTiles to the exclusion of games, songs, music, drawing, painting, and outside. Except yesterday. We walked in the brilliant sunshine and shot balloon rockets off at the park. We extracted the tricycle from the deep freeze in our yard and went for a ride. Fluffy raced through the house on 3 treasure hunts, drew a bit on the blackboard, didn\u2019t ask for computer time all morning, and spent only a very small portion of the day with his MagnaTiles.\u00a0 And he built a\u00a0 breakthrough: An Indestructible Church.  It\u2019s not a bomb, plane, rocket, computer game character, jammer race car, or Bad Thing. On occasion, he\u2019s made a wall and tower, although mostly he directs us to build them, and their sole function has been to be a Bad Thing so that his Good Thing can destroy them. This is the first real building he's ever made. He made the whole thing. In the photo above, he puts the final touches on the bomb deflecting shields. In the foreground, a Raptor offers protection and various bombs stand ready.  No Bad Thing catapulted into it. In fact, it still stands in his playroom, 24 hours after its completion.

It\u2019s funny, but we always remarked on Fluffy\u2019s voice, long before we thought there was anything different about him (other than his commitment to breaking the world record for most consecutive hours awake as a newborn, then baby, then toddler...). Once he became bilingual and starting conversing in english as well as HimCheeChee, his voice register dropped ever so slightly and he left the exclusivity of falsettoland for the inclusively of the full range of human speech. Now he can go high or low or chatter somewhere in between, but all of it's delivered with great passion and urgency, punctuated by dramatic full-body gesturing.  \n\n Except for every once in a while when he drops into a low, driving monotone. This usually happens when we are laying in his big boy bed during the several hours it takes for him to wind down into sleep. After we have read stories, talked about his computer games, sung songs, and scratched his back, arms, legs, feet, and head, we stare silently up at the glow-in-the-dark stars, comets, and all the planets that hang at various distances from the ceiling-light sun. (It is usually during this stretch that I lament my own inadequacies as a mother in the sleep-training department.)\u00a0  \n\n About a year ago, he asked (or rather announced) in this flat, matter of fact way: \u201cDO-YOU-KNOW-ITALIAN.\u201d I was a little startled since we hadn\u2019t been talking about Italian then, or well, ever. \u201cNo, honey. I don\u2019t,\u201d\u00a0 I answered. \u201cWhy, Mommy\u201d came his genuinely puzzled reply, which began a rather odd conversation during which I forgot I was talking to a 2 year-old who may not really have been interested in the foreign language choices available to a gal in high school in the previous millennium. I\u2019m afraid that happens a lot. Recently he intoned: \u201cMOMMY-TELL-ME-WHAT-YOU-KNOW-MORE-ABOUT: TELESCOPES-OR-MICROSCOPES.\" And so ensued another bizarre conversation between a mother and her toddler son about the time she was a laboratory technician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Sometimes he adds \"or not\" to questions he already knows he'll be denied, like he\u2019s prepared but figures--what the hey, might as well give it a try. Things like: \"MAY-I-HAVE-CHOCOLATE-CANDY-NOW--OR-NOT.\" or \"MAY-I-ERASE-YOUR-HARD-DRIVE-NOW--OR-NOT.\" \n\n I\u2019ve come to see this part of the day as a kind of space travel, through the darkness of the room to the particular planet my son inhabits, a place where chemical impulse is channeled to him from the Zone Of Mystery where inflection is besides the point.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s not very different from any of us with our own peculiar slant on the world, when images and words spring from a strange and unknown universe as we approach the land of sleep. If I can only just keep it in my goey mind, that he will, in fact, at some point, fall asleep, I could lean back into the mountain of pillows that cover his bed and simply enjoy the ride. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/_a_lot_of_kids.html", "title": "On The Way To Sleep"},

It\u2019s an endearing yet completely mystifying trait to a gal who looks in the mirror possibly 15 to 35 times a day. I've been doing it since middle school when I first started acting out commercials and now virtually anything will draw me there: the fantasy of a camera lens, the shocking discovering of my old lady cleavage, a deeper examination of the skin tag that started growing on my eye lid during pregnancy, and of course, compulsive haircutting that skyrockets during times of stress.  \n\n Because of my husband\u2019s lack of vanity and his reluctance to \u2018waste\u2019 time on grooming, every couple of months, I cut his hair. It\u2019s a favor but I also like cutting hair and it\u2019s actually healthy to cut someone else\u2019s hair. It relieves the internal pressure, like a bloodletting. \n\n The problem is, lately, like nearly the past 4 years, I\u2019ve been a little pressed for time, and so I avoid it. I don\u2019t know why since it\u2019s only a half-hour and he never pressures me; this guy can let it go and go and go until total strangers say \u201cMay I have a pretzel, Madam?\u201d like Kramer did to George when he was wearing a pair of giant girlie glasses on Seinfeld.

I think half the planet has it. I\u2019m quite sure my friend\u2019s colleague has it in his looks normal-seems-cool-and-regular-out-in-the-world way. See, he can\u2019t hear and doesn\u2019t know he can\u2019t hear and so she ends up saying the same thing over and over and then when she does the thing she\u2019s been talking about endlessly, he says, wow, I\u2019m really surprised, and she wants to jerk her cup of hot latte at him the way this guy did in the bakery on a cross country trip only he did it in some fugue state that none of us ever understood that left him pale and spooky afterward while the waitress went screaming through the double flip doors never to be seen again. \n\n My friend\u2019s colleague is like my husband.

{"date": "January 25, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t\n Eating, 2002: 3 of 3,000, taken by Dave \n\n \nI wonder if I will always find the eating so incredibly cute to witness. Will I be staring with doe-eyes at my son when he\u2019s standing in front of the refrigerator, inhaling large volumes of food without so much as a gulp? While entire packages of sandwich meat and fruit by the dozen are consumed in one swallow the way my brother did during the peak of his adolescent years? Back when he would unlock his jaw like a snake and I would watch in alarm as the outline of say, an entire chicken, slunk down his ever-thickening neck in spasms? I mean, I know at some point the eating can get tough--the noises mostly. I know my sister ran up against her limit listening to me and my morning cereal back in high school, something I was completely oblivious to, but became acutely aware of later, when it was I sitting across from the offending sounds and first tuned into the frequency of my husband and his corn chex; I couldn\u2019t believe it had been going on for years without my noticing. \"OH MY GOD, the slurping! What are you, a SAINT BERNARD? Is it even possible to eat that without all that dripping and slobbering?\" Or maybe not, since I seem to recall my sister abruptly stopped using milk and for years now eats her cereal dry, tucked into the corner of the couch, hunched over a small bowl.  \n\n Some people are very touchy about it. My mom and her boyfriend had a fight that lasted 3 days over how she was approaching a particular jar of jelly. To be fair, I think it had to do more with a kind of double dipping infraction which I do think is an important point, but still, 3 DAYS? My friend Lisa describes herself as mentally ill on this very issue: most specifically, eating on the phone. I don\u2019t mean, in lieu of a plate, I mean listening to others eat while they talk to you on the phone. I try to be sensitive to it but I\u2019m all over the place, I admit. It goes person to person which isn\u2019t very fair of me, but, what can I say? I\u2019m a neurotic mess. My husband, poor soul, gets absolutely no leeway whatsoever. My friend, Lisa, can practically barf into the phone. My mom, well, the mere hint of a swallow sends me over the edge, while my friend Kim could slam down an economy size bag of chips and end up sounding like Marlee Matlin may have when she first got up the nerve to bring in audio (her own that is), and I wouldn't bat an eye. \n\n But back to my child, my darling and dear nearly 4 year-old son. It still makes me swoon. Really. It\u2019s the consideration of food items before they are plopped into his mouth. It\u2019s the far away look he adopts, as if he is going over his day or something a colleague told him at the office. Sometimes it\u2019s the single-mindedness: I am this, I am eating machine, like the time he polished off a quart of blueberries in one sitting, delicately selecting each blueberry between chubby thumbkin and pointer before sending it down the shoot. It\u2019s not just my kid, it\u2019s all kids. There\u2019s something about watching them eat that gets me.  \n\n Except for the choking. That is the yang to the eating yin. I must have choked in another life or stood by helplessly while hordes of toddlers choked to the death because it is the one thing that fills me with instant panic. Ages ago, I fed my nephew for the first time. We were dining on peas and even though he was happily chasing the little green balls around on his expansive food tray, I started spooning them into his eager mouth. Spoon spoon spoon. Look! He loves these peas! For some reason, I felt as if it was somehow because of me that he loved the peas, as if my very involvement in the pea eating was making them more appealing. I felt, well, proud of myself for spooning in the peas.  \n\n Maybe that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t notice that, between the two of us, the contents of a 15 oz bag of baby peas, most of them still quite whole, was amassed inside his cupid mouth. For a brief instant. That is, before his eyes widened, started to water, and the gagging began. Maybe I\u2019m still so petrified by the choking because aside from saying \u201cYou\u2019re okay\u201d in mock calm, and watching like a hawk until the gagging stops, I don\u2019t have the slightest idea what to actually DO during the choking. Yes, yes, I took that CPR course and I was a champ at doing the one-finger sweep down the plastic babydoll\u2019s throat, holding it upside down, methodically checking again for the obstruction, etc., etc., but IN REAL LIFE I am hopeless. Thankfully, my sister leapt across the table, tipped him forward, poured him out and replaced him all in one swift, graceful move. Then they both carried on as if nothing happened, as if I hadn\u2019t just come THIS CLOSE to killing my only nephew. He\u2019s fourteen now, and I still love watching him eat, though I'm decidedly less tense about the choking--with him. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/_i_wonder_if_i.html", "title": "Some Thoughts On Eating"},
{"date": "January 23, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t   Fluffy in the hat from Aunt Susie and Uncle Steve, taken by Dave \n\n My son was an early talker. We\u2019re quite sure he was saying a large handful of words (most of them commands \u201cout!\u201d \u201cup!\u201d \u201cmore!\u201d ) when he was 10 months old. Long before that, he would point to me when I said where\u2019s mommy and to himself when I said where\u2019s Fluffy. So we figured it wouldn\u2019t be long before he was referring to himself in the second-person royal, the way all kids do at first, before they master the first person pronoun thing. (\"Fluffy want cuppie\u201d Oh does he? Well, chop chop! Let\u2019s dash it into him.) As he got older, it was clear that he was one of those kids that seems, to all who don\u2019t spend 18 hours of their waking life with him, to be talking in a very foreign language, like HimCheeChee. He\u2019d talk high and fast and work up quite a lather of saliva (Oh! The drool! Great gobs of froth dangling off his chin like a baby goatee) and so, when anyone else was around, they would stare wide-eyed at him and me and then say something to wrap the whole discussion up, like, \u201cWell, okay! That is something!\u201d\u00a0 It became like a scene from a Christopher Guest mockumentary: he would talk in HimCheeChee and I would repeat what he said in english. \"He said, 'Mommy has two big boobies'\" and then he patted them proudly, his prize possessions. It was a bit awkward when he struck up a conversation with the only other dad around.  \n\n As it turns out, what he started calling himself, was Larret, a far cry from his actual name. He\u2019d utter it in a breathy whisper, as if he was speaking the forbidden. When he got tired of the humiliation we caused by giving him such a difficulty name to pronounce, he moved on to Bobby, as in \u201cBobby do it\u201d. At first we\u2019d look around. For Bobby. Pretty soon (duh) we got that HE was Bobby. My mother jumped right on the band wagon and out and out called him Bobby at every opportunity (\"Does Bobby want some help with that push pin?\"). She'd ask him his name and smack her leg noisily when he answered. (What a riot!) Kids in the neighborhood would look up at me and say \u201cWho\u2019s Bobby\u201d? Mothers on the playground would smile into my face and say, \u201cIs Bobby his brother?\u201d\u00a0  \n\n We just went with it. He said Bobby and we said you, or Fluffy, or Snoodles, or Mookaloo, or Lovebug, or a host of other nicknames that were sung, chanted and danced to until some of our neighbors dropped by with curtains. And then one day he said his name with clarity and precision and Bobby was gone forever. Before long he was flinging around me, I, you, us, we, and a host of pronouns like a champ, tossing them here and there in conversation like a BeniHana chef. He\u2019s always had a remarkable grasp of language. \n\n But sometimes I kinda miss Bobby. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/bobby.html", "title": "Bobby"},
{"date": "January 28, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \nA puzzle, taken by Dave \n\n Fluffy doesn\u2019t like to go outside. He\u2019s more of a house-son. Unless it\u2019s summertime; he loves the beach. For some reason, all the stimulation doesn\u2019t overloaded him. Maybe it\u2019s because the ocean is so powerful and intoxicating that he can surrender, like he\u2019s falling into the arms of a wild but extremely competent therapist. Splashing in the surf must be like working out at a giant sensory integration gym--the salty water enveloping his skin, tossing and tumbling him around, all that proprioceptive and vestibular pressure and feedback, just what the disorganized brain ordered.\u00a0  \n\n But we are a long way off from frolicking at the sea shore. The sky just dumped another foot or so into our front yard so that now only the tips of the fence can be seen out by the street. Where do we live, Tahoe? We are house bound. Not because of the storms, but because of the life we are leading.  \n\n It doesn\u2019t feel normal. Nothing feels normal right now. Really, this is the most aby-normal life I can imagine. Family is too far away to offer any consistent help, every other mom I know either doesn\u2019t get it or has their own hands full with several bottoms and super-toddler egos to wrangle. We got kicked out of the grooviest Waldorfy preschool in the area, winter has sunk her claws into the heavens above, and I\u2019m the only one that can put Fluffy to bed at night, which, on a good night, takes an hour.  \n\n The entire household is home every day, all day long. Dave draws cartoons in the basement, I steal away to write or monitor the hair growth on various parts of my body, and we take turns doing the Son-Rise program with Fluffy in his playroom. No one comes over. We don\u2019t go out, unless one or the other of us makes runs to the dump, the grocery store, or the health food store to stock up on gluten-free, casein-free products. I\u2019m used to \"vinging it\u201d\u00a0 in the kitchen (as my friend Wolfgang says) but these days it's like I stepped through the looking glass. The things I make are unrecognizable to me: pancake goo refuses to congeal, loaves of breads develop unsettling fissures and shrink while they bake. My family approaches the table with a new caution.  \n\n The program tells me to get volunteers. I\u2019ve pasted my flyer in all the appropriate places but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that people are going to see this as a disturbed ploy to secure free babysitting. I mean, there are people WE KNOW who don\u2019t think there is anything \u2018wrong\u2019\u00a0 with Fluffy, who, I can only imagine, must think we are Hysterics or suffering from Follies de Deux (or Trois, in this case). Granted, these are people who only see us once a year for a few hours or people who haven\u2019t spent any amount of time with us since the summer when the picture only just started to come into focus. But still, I can see their point.  \n\n My son is animated and verbal and very bright. He doesn\u2019t flap his arms or spin plates in the corner or scream when he\u2019s touched. Aside from a tendency not to look at most people and to never say hello or goodbye, he can look pretty normal at first. If you peeked in the playroom, you\u2019d most likely think, huh, there\u2019s an energetic, bright kid who really really loves playing with MagnaTiles. Okay, he\u2019s still in diapers, he seems a bit bossy, and maybe he does have more than the usual number of mini-meltdowns if you accidentally touch what he\u2019s building or fail to read his mind. But all in all, for a kid a few days away from his 4th birthday, all he really needs is a firmer hand in the toilet-training department.  \n\n For Fluffy, being with other kids is like going for a bike ride; he\u2019s interested but he wants it to be over as soon as it starts. It\u2019s confusing and scary, too much information whizzes by, nuances are missed, flashes of things coming near or are they coming AT him? Faces don\u2019t make sense and kids are completely unpredictable. I bring a figurine of a boy to the playroom; he prefers to use the equilateral triangle. His \u2018Silly Faces\u2019 board looks like a Picasso painting--the mouth is pasted up by the eyes, the ears perched on top of hair.  \n\n It\u2019s hard to explain to others because aspergers, at least in this household, strikes at the very stuff we all assume to be quintessentially kid. He'll grow out of it, right? I mean, kids are kids, they work it out, playing is their life, their best friend is the kid they met 10 minutes ago. All kids have a burning desire to be with other kids.  \n\n No. And maybe. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the playroom everyday, trying to teach our son that connecting to other people is the best game in town. I just wish we could feel less cast away. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/the_abynormal_l.html", "title": "The Aby-Normal Life"},
{"date": "January 27, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Feeding My Glowing Newborn, 2001, both taken by Dave, the only one not crying at the time \n\n\n\n As Fluffly's birthday approaches, I walk around stunned that 4 years has passed and I haven't even had time to return some of the calls I got congratulating me on his birth. Even though it's the corniest things in the world to say, the time truly did fly by. Come with me while I reminisce a little on the blissful events of the first 12 months. \n\n As you can see in the first picture, I am nursing my 5 day old son. What you may not so easily see is that my milk has not yet come in and so an SNS is strapped to my head in the manner of John Travolta\u2019s dance partner during rehearsals for the big contest. My tiny son is encased within a Bili Blanket that is zapping out the unwanted bilirubin (created in the \"normal and pathological destruction of erythrocytes\") that cruises through his bloodstream like aimless teenagers. This blanket, so called by, perhaps, denizens of an alternate universe who curl up at night beneath cozy slabs of concrete, is really a belt, a stiff belt, hastily sewn within a thin cotton cover and crammed with ultra violet coils. It attaches to a big metal box, the transformer or power supply or mothership communication device, by a large coiled pipe that looks like the vent from our dryer. When plugged in (as it had to be for 24 hours straight) it makes a loud vibrating hum and shoots a stream of hot air out a vent in the back, like a slide projector after the show. \n\n The SNS got tied to my head when my husband needed a break from holding it above my boob line since it didn\u2019t work well when it dangled around my neck like the beautiful necklace it, indeed was (even though the lactation nurse assured me that was the most effective position). A little tube came off the SNS bottle which had to be taped to my nipple so that when my delicate newborn sucked, he stimulated my own (languishing, stubborn, decrepit) milk production, got sustenance, and was initiated into this new center of his universe. My milk finally came in, the jaundice passed, and Dave and I breathed a sigh of relief. We had made it through the tough part. \n\n And then came the colic. Great walls of wailing and scrunching and thrashing about that could last for 20 minutes or stretch across hours like the time he cried from midnight to 6 am. It began to feel a little like the ER; (although we weren't as good at the jocularity and quick sex in the broom closet) you never knew what was going to burst through the double doors. \n\n Next, on to the night terrors that started on his exact half birthday, August 2, 2001, the night my husband finally took himself out to the Newport Folk Festival to hear Gillian Welch and even though I was envious, I was also experiencing a kind of dementia in which I couldn\u2019t bear to be separated from my child, although who knows why since he had only just barely stepped out of the howling from hell colic attacks that came at anytime, in any place.  \n\n So, on this night, he woke up screaming with his wild eyes open, and could not be consoled.\u00a0 You\u2019d think I was an old pro by then, but this was a different cry, a cry of pure terror that sounded like he had been plucked from his crib by the devil. I woke up the neighbor (Flanders) the goodhearted totally awesome father of twins and also, by the way, The Physician\u2019s Assistant Who Can Never Be Rattled, and he brought cases of Motrin and Tylenol since, in the absence of fever, gaping wounds, and an actual pitch fork, he determined Fluffy must be cutting teeth. It didn\u2019t help, nothing helped. I called Dave on the cell but couldn\u2019t get through and so I pulled out every trick in the book, fairly certain it was all in vain as my son was surely going to die. And then he stopped, stopped cold, and instantly returned to a sound sleep. The night terrors came about 4 times a week after that and then vanished as abruptly as they began, 7 months later.  \n\n I wish I had an amazing pediatrician, a brilliant, warm, intuitive, available pediatrician who could have done something, anything, during all the angst-ridden days and nights of\u00a0 Fluffy\u2019s allergic reaction to sleep: the grunting, the hooting, the smacking of\u00a0 lips, the mad-dog stare, all leading up to that pinnacle of pain--the no-sound cry that reached and reached so far into the silence of his throat that he would pass out. And what did my doctor say? Babies cry. Or, Oh, no no, he\u2019s much too young for night terrors. Oh, really? Well, lemme just put him on and you can set him straight. Oh, but alas, I can\u2019t because he is currently SCREAMING LIKE I'VE JUST TOSSED HIM OUT OF A PLANE. \n\n Of course, there has been far more than tears and bone-chilling fatigue. Dave and I have been captivated by our son since we first met him. Clearly, parenthood is a love affair like no other. I wish I had written more down but I guess I'll have to settle for the hundred hours of video shot and the several thousand photographs clicked. Many images of Fluffy in his first year have, miraculously, not slipped out of my geriatric mind. Here are a few: cupping my breast with both hands like he was drinking from a Shakespearean goblet; sleeping with his arms in delicate gesture high above his head; tipping so far forward during the first few times he sat up that his toe got stuck in his mouth; the months of passionate sweeping, banging, and dragging of the little broom we bought him for his first birthday, the concentrated inspection of tiny specks on the floor in a low, low crouch--lower than the guys who cut the string beans for Fat Poo Pod. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/post.html", "title": "Some Early Memories"},
{"date": "January 28, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n My husband and I have been trying to buy a couple of things for our newly expanded living-dining-kitchen room area, and, let me just say, when it comes to making decisions, we have vastly different styles. Mine is that we must make the purchase before the kidnappers make good on their threat; his is that the decision we make will very likely change the course of human kind. \n\n So, we\u2019ve been looking at rugs on the internet and in magazines since we live in the friggin' boonies where there isn\u2019t a decent rug for 60 square miles. We could toss Fluffy in the car for an hour's drive each way and spend an excruciating afternoon stealing glimpses of rugs that hang like carcasses as we nervoulsy dash after our son whose response to the people and the lights and the noise level is to act not like a child with a neurological disorder, but like one who\u2019s been raised by Helen Keller\u2019s parents before Annie Sullivan showed up and laid down the law. I want to tell all the tight and disapproving faces, \u201cHe\u2019s AUTISTIC, OKAY?\u201d which is technically true but doesn\u2019t quite feel fair. \n\n So, every night for a couple of weeks, I come stumbling out of Fluffy\u2019s room into the rest of the house, momentarily blinded by the lights blazing everywhere like we\u2019re lit for a night game.\u00a0 At that point (hours since the start of the bedtime routine) I usually feel vaguely like an escaped animal: disoriented, slightly angry, yet giddy with relief that I\u2019m awake and can salvage what's left of the evening--scrape together a tiny bit of a life. Woohoo, let\u2019s part-ey! Call some people! Slip in the Netflix! Roll in the hay!  \n\n Dave putters about, cleaning the kitchen in his headphones and audio-pack, listening to his most recent talking book. He takes off his gear when he sees me and we convene to family room to talk about the rug. (It briefly reminds me of working in the lab, when the pipette sales guy would come in with his Product Book and a stack of samples bungee-corded to his handy frame on wheels.) Dave collects his pile of notes and catalogues and we walk somberly to the couch.  \n\n In the Myers-Briggs personality test, he comes in as a \u201cP\u201d and I come in as a \u201cJ\u201d and as we talked nightly about the rug, I tried to keep that in mind. I'm jonesin' for the rug, ready to lunge for the phone like my pants are on fire, while he calmly collects and analyzes the data.  \n\n So, during the Rug Summit of 2005, he took measurements, compared the image on-line to the one in the catalogue, tore out the page and held it up in the room where it was slated to rest, and squinted. I walked along behind him and tried to breath like the ocean, occassionally making a tiny face behind his back, but mostly letting Dave be Dave. I KNEW the rug was perfect, the color was fine, and 9 x 12 was the only dimension to consider, but I was practicing patience, biding my time until the rug arrived and I could stand tall atop is plush expanse. \n\n It arrived yesterday. If you\u2019re looking for vast stretches of wool in baby diarrhea green, this is the rug for you. We're going to have to roll it up and send it right back. Dave is probably making a tiny face behind me now as I eat the last bite of crow pie. \n\n I don't know what I was thinking. After all, this is a guy who had packages arriving to the house, DAILY, in his quest for the perfect hat. Dozens of them littered the entranceway. Many jokes were made at his expense. But, in the end, he strode through the snow in style, warmth, and comfort while I pondered the thing I must have bought when one of my alternate personalities got a hold of my wallet. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/_my_husband_and.html", "title": "Touch\u00e9"},
{"date": "January 23, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t Computer Time, taken by Dave \n\n \nMy husband and I came up with this plan to eliminate Fluffy's computer time during the week and only allow it on the weekends. We told him about it on Saturday, in that Oh So Cheerful way parents say things they know will be met with screams of protests, as if saying it with big smiles and in a sing songy voice will elicit reasonable alternatives--Oh, no more computer games? Okay, what shall I do instead? Neatly put my toys away? Brush and floss my teeth? Shovel the driveway?  \n\n The weekend went swimmingly since he was getting EXTRA computer time, the trinket we tossed him to soften the blow of the new schedule that began this morning, the moment there would suddenly be NO computer time after 6 months of 30 minutes of computer every day beginning at 7 am. (He routinely wakes at 5 am, cranes to see the glowing numbers in the dark, and asks \u201cIs it computer time yet?\u201d) Of course, we went over and over this new development countless times with much enthusiasm, as if we, Mommy and Daddy, simply COULD NOT WAIT until monday when we would YANK AWAY Fluffy's lifeline and rip the keyboard out from under his pudgy little 3 year old hands, this computer, the thing he loves more than more than french fries, more than making a Bad Thing out of Magnatiles that the Good Thing out of Magnatiles can shoot and destroy.  \n\n And so this morning he woke up, singing and gesticulating, and wondering aloud \u201cIs it 7 o\u2019clock yet?\u201d just as the numbers on the digital clocked clicked to 6:59. One minute. Dave and I exchanged \u2018get ready\u2019 glances although mine was a \u2018get ready\u2019 and his was more of a \u2018let\u2019s forget it because I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s gonna blow and does it really matter if he ever relates to another kid because he loves his computer time so so much\u2019 sort of a look. The clock clicked again and BING! Yay! It\u2019s computer time! Confetti floated through the air, trumpets blazed, and Fluffy raced down the hall and flung open the door to the downstairs playroom. We followed behind, walking to the dirge that played in our heads.  \n\n He was at the bottom of the stairs when we broke the news, and all that preparation didn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans. He was devastated, thrown to the ground by his own grief and outrage. Tears came in great gushes. His nose immediately began to run. Then the bargaining began in that confused way that kids do where he offered that maybe he could have just ONE HOUR of computer time and then FOUR HOURS on the weekend? How about that? Wouldn\u2019t that be a good compromise? \n\n It went on for a while. Dave and I kept exchanging looks. Much was discussed silently with our contorted faces and drooping postures. And then I caved. Ah, the bedrock of boundaries!\u00a0 When Mommy speaks all you need to do is rat-a-tat away at her jello resolve and, poof, she\u2019s a bowl of artificially colored juice. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/my_steely_resol.html", "title": "My Steely Resolve"},

{"date": "January 24, 2005 ", "body": "\n\t\t\t \n\n mini snow drift on back deck \n\n Over the weekend, we hunkered down in preparation for the great blizzard of \u201805. The kitchen was stocked with gluten-free, casein-free morsels of taste-free deliciousness, the shelves of the Son-Rise playroom were stacked with the many games that Fluffy will decline to try, the computers were plugged into surge protectors so the neon glow could light our way to the drawer that overflows with candles, flashlights, thin silver blankets, an old fashioned plug-in phone, and various other emergency items that my husband monitors on a daily basis.\u00a0  \n\n The snow did come. It was blustery and exciting and beautiful to behold; the tall dark trunks of the red maple trees swayed in great arcs. Dave shoveled, bless his heart, and took Fluffy out to climb the enormous snow-plow mountains, and yelled a conversation across the street to our neighbor in that jovial, we\u2019re all in it together way (although our neighbor, in true Flanders \u201cOkaleedokalee\u201d form, spent the afternoon shoveling other people\u2019s driveways since his had been cleared for hours--why put off for tomorrow what you can do today, is his motto. Mine is, why go out in the snow where it\u2019s cold when you can stay in the house, where it\u2019s warm.) \n\n This morning, the sun sparkles in the icicles and casts a long and jagged shadow in the front yard from the fence and naked tree branches that reach up into the single digit air. It all puts me in mind of the great blizzard of '78 which I was old enough to not only remember but to spend a good portion of one evening pressed up against our darkened living room window with my sister, flashing our boobs to the National Guard as they passed by in army tanks hitched up to plows. See, Bush? I've been supporting our troops for over a quarter of a century. \n\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/01/over_the_weeken.html", "title": "Blizzard '05"}
