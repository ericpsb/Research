Now you\u2019ll take  note they were in splendid bloom last week and we went outside to observe, write, and paint.   Two classmates and [Joy] and I settled in at the horseshoe table where first we watched then I offered her choices of color which increased her attention to task.  No kidding with little hand over hand you got a lovely swoop and motion piece of art. ... [JoyMama],  I am blown away daily when she initiates or comes to her learning table so naturally.\nSo much to be thankful for. \u00a0So very, very much.\n\nAnd yet, yesterday I was not in a very good place. \u00a0I found myself wistful about the little plastic stand in which the artwork had been lovingly placed. \u00a0The backpack had been tossed around quite a bit, without Mama knowing that it contained anything so precious -- and by the time I opened it, the stand was broken into three pieces, not harming the art but not possible to repair.\n\nMany second-graders, with such a treasure for Mama in the backpack, would be brimming over with the delight of the gift they were about to bestow. \u00a0We'd have been digging in the backpack before we even left the school yard, or maybe\u00a0refusing\u00a0to let the backpack open, carrying it home like the crown jewels and teasing Mama about the secret.\n\nDid Joy even know that the art was in her pack? \u00a0Did she know it was for Mama? \u00a0Did she remember that it had been in a plastic holder before? \u00a0Did it bother her that now it wasn't?\n\nThere was another bit of the e-mail that rocked my boat too:\n\nYour other treasure, the pencil topper as well was completed with her Buddies.\nPencil topper? \u00a0What pencil topper? \u00a0I didn't know anything about a pencil topper.\n\nI had to go back to the backpack and look -- and fortunately there it was, in the take-home folder that I'd failed to open in my mixed delight and angst about the beautiful painting and the shards of plastic. \u00a0(The stem of the flower is a pencil.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time, I found myself wistful that I'd missed it on the first round, and once again missing the component that would have involved the excitement of Joy presenting her creation to me. \u00a0All the overt excitement had to come from my end -- \"Prompt + Model\"\u00a0-- sigh.\n\n\n\nTwo things helped pull me back out of the wistful place. \u00a0Two things from Facebook, as a matter of fact.\n\n\n\nOne was a post called \"Happy Mother's Day to Moms with Kids with Special Needs.\"\n\nOften the child who made her a mother can\u2019t understand a holiday, can\u2019t carry a tray to give her breakfast in bed and won\u2019t be bringing her a bunch of violets or a card made all by himself. These moms celebrate their day with their different child in a different way.\u00a0\n\nAnd celebrate they do. They find joy in the knowledge that they are nurturing a child\u2019s spirit as well as her health. They take satisfaction in knowing that each accomplishment, however small it may look to others, is a major victory. Each of her child\u2019s achievements is at least partly her own. She knows the value of her efforts and the importance of keeping a positive attitude and counting the blessings of every day.\n\nSo many things to celebrate. \u00a0SO many things to celebrate. \u00a0So MANY things to celebrate. \u00a0So many things to CELEBRATE!\n\n\n\nThe other was a video-setting of a speech made at Kenyon College in 2005. \u00a0The title on the video is perhaps a little breathless (\"The Earth-Shatteringly Amazing Speech That\u2019ll Change The Way You Think About Adulthood\"), but the content is a powerful reminder of the importance of choosing one's emphasis, choosing one's attitude. \u00a0A reminder that it's all too easy to let annoyance and pessimism be the default path of least resistance -- when the more aware, the more educated path involves a deliberate self-reminding of that which is sacred in the most mundane.\n\n\n\nUsually I do a pretty good job of reminding myself, but this weekend I did need the reminder.\n\n\n\nAnd this, here... this is sacred, and actually not mundane in the slightest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Mother's Day!\n\n\n\nAnd now, Joy and I are going to go out and play in the sun.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8pwbTenmHLY/UY-SxIdBiuI/AAAAAAAABJY/mMqU8rB6WWg/s1600/2013-05-cardfront.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ixNI8ELIGZU/UY-SxH0FUGI/AAAAAAAABJU/cvwMa1GlCxA/s1600/2013-05-cardback.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MrDCLbFuN50/UY-Sw-JSsRI/AAAAAAAABJQ/M_81vDiulSI/s1600/2013-05-penciltopper.jpg", "http://psychcentral.com/lib/2013/happy-mothers-day-to-moms-with-kids-with-special-needs/", "http://www.upworthy.com/the-earth-shatteringly-amazing-speech-that-ll-change-the-way-you-think-about-adulthood-4", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--yKmDvu22WU/UY-3MCOTCbI/AAAAAAAABJ0/Y0qDLd-zzbc/s1600/IMG_6165.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bOmNFlyZUNo/UY-3M8_zQ8I/AAAAAAAABJw/XpdQyrCR580/s1600/IMG_6166.JPG"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2013/05/mothers-day.html", "title": "\nMother's Day\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "body": "\n\"A burden,\" Wisconsin state representative Dan LeMahieu (R-Cascade) called my daughter, speaking before a gathering of school board members and public school administrators in Madison last week. \u00a0\"A burden on our schools.\"\n\nOK, he wasn't singling out Joy as an individual. \u00a0He was talking about students with special needs in general, you understand. \u00a0But especially the more disabled ones, the more expensive ones. Speaking in Joy's own school district, about students with extra challenges... so yes, in a very real way, he did refer to my daughter as a burden.\n\nRep. LeMahieu probably didn't know it, but his choice of words has a long and dishonorable history when it come to people with developmental disabilities. \u00a0Consider the words of Samuel G. Howe, 165 years ago, speaking in 1848 before the Massachusetts legislature on the subject of people with developmental challenges (emphasis mine):\n\nThis class of person is always a burden upon the public. \u00a0Persons of this class are idle and often mischievous, and are dead weights upon the material prosperity of the state. \u00a0They are worse than useless. \u00a0Every such person is like a Upas tree, that poisons the whole moral atmosphere about him.\nAt least Mr. Howe was \"only\" arguing that people with developmental disabilities should be institutionalized apart from the rest of society, thus setting up over a hundred years of segregation and horrible conditions at immense taxpayer expense. \u00a0At least Howe was \"only\" recommending putting people away, not putting them to the unspeakable experiments and gas chambers of the concentration camps, where people with disabilities were tortured and slaughtered not a century later.\n\nSpeaking of poisoned moral atmosphere -- in the year of my own birth, 1968, some so-called thinkers were still stuck in the same atrocity-level patterns. \u00a0Here are the words of \"ethicist\" Joseph Fletcher writing in the Atlantic, arguing that putting to death was an acceptable choice for infants with Down syndrome: \"True guilt only arises from an offense against a person, and a Downs is not a person.\"\n\nLet that one sink in for a little bit...\n\nForty-some years later, my wonderful daughter is a welcomed and contributing member of her classroom community, together with her delightful and accomplished classmate who has Down syndrome, guaranteed by our country the right to a free and appropriate public education.\n\n\"A burden,\" Rep. LeMahieu called them last week, in the language of those who would have denied these girls their humanity not a generation ago.\n\nThen an orator from the audience took the microphone, a school superintendent from Pulaski, Wisconsin by the name of Mel Lightner.\n\nDr. Lightner drew applause from the crowd as he spoke truth to power. \u00a0He identified himself as the parent of a student with special needs, as well as a school administrator. \u00a0And he reframed the education of students with disabilities in these words:\n\n\nI do want to make one comment before I get to my question, and I don\u2019t know if the gentleman up there meant this, but you said special education is a burden \u2013 that\u2019s what he said, is a burden to school districts.\u00a0\n\nActually it\u2019s an obligation, a responsibility, and it\u2019s an HONOR to educate children with exceptional educational needs or special needs.\n\nAs the applause swelled, Dr. Lightner moved to his next point, to take on and expose the special needs vouchers, a harmful ALEC proposal that was blocked in Wisconsin last year. \u00a0Unfortunately this year it's been slipped into the 2013-2015 state budget where it's even harder to kill, greased with barrels-full of out-of-state campaign cash.\n\nYou should listen to the audio clip itself to hear the scorn drip from Dr. Lightner's words as he speaks of the special needs \"scholarships,\" as they're called in the budget, as he tears apart the manufactured demand for this proposal that did NOT originate in the communities of Wisconsin. \u00a0Here is the transcript:\n\n\n\nBy the way, my name is Dr. Mel Lightner, I\u2019ve been a school superintendent for twenty years in the state of Wisconsin \u2013 and I am alarmed and shamed at the movement to privatize and de-fund public education. \u00a0I think that\u2019s the national movement, and at least two of the people up there are part of that movement in my eyes. \u00a0Kudos to [Sen.] Jennifer [Shilling, also of the panel], who\u2019s a strong advocate for our children. \u00a0\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we are at the crossroads in the state of Wisconsin. \u00a0And I want to get back to the special education issue, because I have a special needs child. \u00a0Here\u2019s my question. \u00a0My question is this: Special education \u201cscholarships\u201d or vouchers, private school vouchers, we have a mass of Wisconsinites who have come to you and said \u201cLET\u2019S DO THIS\u201d?!?\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t see it. \u00a0I don\u2019t see it in my community, I don\u2019t see it in the state, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being responsive to the Wisconsin people. \u00a0You\u2019re part of a national movement that is hunkered down and coming through with massive private dollars. \u00a0I think that\u2019s where you are, and my question is: Is that not the case? \u00a0[Applause]\n\nI wish that I could tell you that Rep. LeMahieu and his fellow panelist from the Joint Finance Committee, Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) saw the light and were swayed by Dr. Lightner's words. \u00a0Alas, this was not to be. \n\nSenator Darling didn't address the source of the voucher legislation, responding with rote talking points about \"choice.\" \u00a0Even worse, Rep. LeMahieu defended his use of the word \"burden.\" \u00a0He didn't really mean \"burden,\" you understand, it's just that special needs students cost more, which makes them a financial... well, BURDEN! \u00a0He kept using that word, over and over, just like his counterparts in shameful years gone by.\n\nIt's not a burden, Rep. LeMahieu.\n\nThese are our children. \u00a0And in the words of Dr. Mel Lightner of Pulaski:\n\n\nIt's an obligation, and it's a responsibility, and it's an HONOR.\n\nStop Special Needs Vouchers, Wisconsin!

{"date": "Friday, March 1, 2013", "body": "\nI sent a letter this morning to four people: President Obama, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Representative Mark Pocan.\n=======\n\nDear President Obama,\n\nYesterday afternoon, my husband and I sat down with a team of seven educators and administrators to write this year's Individualized Education Program (IEP) for our daughter's upcoming school year.\n\nOur daughter Joy is a cheerful, bright-eyed second-grader, full of energy and laughter.  She can ice-skate, she can snow-shoe, she can manipulate an iPad like nobody's business!  Joy also only speaks a few words.  She has a sobering catalog of developmental challenges, including autism, epilepsy, and a rare genetic condition called Linear Nevus Sebaceous Syndrome.\n\nThe team around that table had been working with Joy since the start of the school year, putting in untold hours above and beyond the school day to make our daughter's education possible.\n\nTears threatened to flow as we evaluated Joy's phenomenal progress this past year, and pegged her reading-goal for next year to the emerging-skills level for first grade.  First grade reading skills, for a child who as a pre-schooler was unable to imitate, unable to do a 3-piece puzzle, unable to follow most one-step directions!\n\nAnd then we returned home, and read this evaluation of the effects of sequestration from the National Council on Disability:\n\n* $978 million in comprehensive funding cuts would affect 30.7 million special education students.\n* Funding for special education, specifically, would be slashed by nearly $600 million, reducing supports for students with disabilities to 2005 levels.\n* Federal funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will be reduced by 28 percent, totaling a loss of one billion dollars.\n* Close to 15,000 special education teachers could lose their jobs resulting in larger class sizes.\n\nTears DID flow as we considered the impending devastation: to our daughter's progress, to the educational prospects of so many children with educational challenges like hers, to the future of so many beloved young ones.\n\nFederal funding for the IDEA has fallen short of its promise ever since the program's inception.  Our schools are already patching services together out of insufficient resources; in Wisconsin, the public school system is reeling from a massive two year budget cut in the last cycle.\n\nWe fear that this will be the blow that shatters special education beyond repair, and truly handicaps our daughter's future.\n\nPlease, Mr. President, please do everything in your power to halt these cruel, senseless sequestration cuts!\n\nSincerely,\nJoyMama\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/022813"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-letter-on-sequestration.html", "title": "\nA Letter on Sequestration\n"},

The \"safe\" place for the little artificial tree (as safe as it gets, anyway) is on top of the stereo cabinet. No glass ornaments, just in case.\nMaybe next year, we could consider a real tree, I said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas tree 2008\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, the little fake tree was up on the stereo cabinet again, and I wrote a longer and somewhat frustrated reflection to the effect that holidays only come around ONCE a year -- and how do we expect our kiddos who learn things by routine and repetition to master things that only come around as exceptions? \u00a0(Christmas comes but once a year, and\u00a0Einmal ist keinmal!)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas tree 2009\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, it looks as if I had other things to reflect on in December, including what happened when Joy encountered Santa Claus in the mall. \u00a0But if you look at our Christmas Day photo, there's that little tree up on the stereo cabinet again -- and the presents didn't come out until the girls were in bed Christmas Eve. \u00a0It looks like I pulled a Cheater McCheaterpants in January 2011 reflection on Inchstones\u00a0--\u00a0not having actually taken a tree-alone photo, and the tree was down by then, I re-used the 2009 photo! \u00a0The \"inchstone\" that year, though, was that we were able to replace the tree with a potted plant when it came time to take Christmas down -- and the plant became an unmolested part of the year-round decor. \u00a0(Well, I think she's stashed little items in the pot from time to time. \u00a0But other than that!)\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas 2010, with tree\n\n\n\n\nChristmas 2011, and I apparently had nothing new to say about the darn little tree, and can't find as how I took ANY real photos of it. \u00a0There were other good things happening with Joy, though. \u00a0And Rose came to the rescue with an arty shot on her new Christmas camera. \u00a0Maybe she was using the paranormal setting (her charming misreading of the label \"panorama\")? \u00a0Anyway, there it is, little tree up high once more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas tree 2011\n\n\n\n\nAnd now it's Christmas 2012, and once again the time rolled round to decorate a tree. \u00a0December crept up on us fast this year, and I keep falling down on the job of early-purchasing an Advent calendar (it was something that my mother used to do for me, and she passed away in 2005, and darn it if I still haven't quite come to terms with the Advent calendar responsibility being mine. \u00a0Miss you, Mom!) \u00a0However, this year it worked out all to the good, because finding the bookstore sold out of Advent calendars, Rose and I ended up devising a home-made Christmas-tree Advent calendar for Joy instead! \u00a0Instead of opening fiddly little card-stock doors, Joy gets to move a numbered sticky-note each day from the \"Ornaments\" page to the Christmas tree. \u00a0Rose did all the artwork, and is so excited to see Joy move the ornament each day. \u00a0Joy, meanwhile, needs some support to make it happen, and is happier to take on the task some days than others, but she hasn't refused yet! \u00a0Here's how this tree looks -- don't you just love the \"star\" effect of the camera flash?\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas tree Advent calendar, 2012\n\n\n\n\nAnd so this is Christmas, and once again we come to the tree... and perceptive readers will notice something just a little bit different this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristmas tree 2012, with Nativity set\n\nIT'S SIX FEET TALL!\n\nJoy has come so very, very far this past year. \u00a0It was clear that this was a year that the big tree was worth attempting. \u00a0We were still a little bit too wary to attempt a real tree, given that there's water involved if a real tree were to take a tumble. \u00a0So we dug way back into the most-hidden of our storage -- we hadn't used our big artificial tree since we moved into this house in 1999! \u00a0We found it, though. \u00a0And Rose was ALL agog to help me disembowel the box, and put the tree together. \u00a0And Joy sat on the couch, playing with her iPad and taking it all in, in the indirect way that she has. \u00a0We called her over to help put some of the branches in, and then again to help us hang some of the easier ornaments. \u00a0She let us take her through those tasks, but didn't ask for more. \u00a0And she hasn't given the tree any trouble at all, in over a week.\n\nThe Nativity set, though, is a toy as well as a decoration. \u00a0Though the tree above it is off-limits, the creche is hers for the playing. \u00a0And she does, flawlessly making the distinction between the off-limits tree and the all-hers Nativity. \u00a0Her favorite characters are the camels.\n\n= = = = = = = =\n\nIt turns out that einmal im Jahr\u00a0(once a year) is not negligible after all. \u00a0She remembers. \u00a0She's learning. \u00a0We see it with all the holidays, not just Christmas -- she can collect colored eggs into a basket at Easter now. \u00a0She can knock on doors and take a piece of candy for her bucket at Halloween.\n\nNext year, we're going to a tree farm to cut our own, Lord willin' and the creek don't rise.\n\nMerry, merry Christmas!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B2iM6waU9Jo/UMHddklGH5I/AAAAAAAABHI/HqBTAv3OgDk/s1600/XmasTree08.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aHRqfl2mAqY/UMHdeAKCtVI/AAAAAAAABHQ/4MU3O-Gx66E/s1600/XmasTree09.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CRy4C8ASt6E/TRsl_WDlcqI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/LXbMO0pWfI0/s1600/Dec2010Presents1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EV2wruDWgx0/UMHdH8VyovI/AAAAAAAABGo/ALo0OLgeA5w/s1600/2011-12-tree.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7-YWWXrnC_E/UMHdKJZkJNI/AAAAAAAABGw/1lunlteSYJE/s1600/2012-12-calendar.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kg2JzCuPP8g/UMHdMAJzqhI/AAAAAAAABG4/JDWDlJQOUUU/s1600/2012-12-tree.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/12/o-christmas-tree.html", "title": "\nO Christmas Tree\n"},

We've got a tradition of coming-as-we-are to worship, secure in the belief that God loves us as we are and we don't need to prove our devotion with fancy garb.\n\nHowever, the other Sunday a group of young men from the Mennonite Voluntary Service household showed up wearing neckties, something we'd never seen them do before!  One of the volunteers is getting married soon, and they invited us to help him get used to the idea of dressing up for the wedding by wearing ties on Sunday evening in solidarity.  So ties have been appearing around the necks of unexpected people at church recently.\n\nLast Sunday I saw a delightful interaction.  Joy's former daycare buddy has a younger sister, an adorable curly-haired toddler, not yet two.  Little Sister was sitting on her daddy's lap during the service, giggling over his necktie, which he never wears ordinarily.  She was trying to stick the end of the tie into his mouth, and he was playing along, lipping at it and then pretending to spit it out.  Just the sort of playful little back-and-forth interaction that automatically happens when you enter the average little tyke's world during the peek-a-boo years.\n\nNot every family gets to have that experience with their toddler, though.\n\nJoy certainly wasn't interested in that kind of back-and-forth interactive people play at that age.\n\nSo I'm feeling extra-blessed and grateful that we're getting it now.\n\nThere's been just an explosion of back-and-forth giggly-games in the past few weeks, building on the \"funniest things in the world\" snippets that I've posted about occasionally this past year.  The game might involve yawning back and forth.  It might involve her greeting one of her therapists with an expectant \"woof! woof!\" at the door (shades of John Elder Robison!)  There have been \"in, out\" games involving toys and a bucket.  There have been \"on, off\" games around stacker-toys (and, less ideally, light switches!)  Lots of peek-a-boo, with variations: \"bye-bye / HELLO!\"  \"Where's the turkey? / GOBBLE-GOBBLE-GOBBLE!\"\n\nMy favorite recent game, though, goes like this:\nJoy comes over and leans on me for a cuddle and says \"NNNNIGH-nigh!\"\nThen I hug her, stroke her hair, pat her shoulder.\nThen she pops up with a mischievous twinkle and announces \"GUCK-guh!\" (wake up!)  And then we giggle and do it all over again -- JoyDad and Joy are upstairs playing the nigh-night game as we speak.\n\nY'know, I could tie myself into all sorts of regretful knots, in the comparison that Joy is only NOW doing -- at the age of almost seven -- what comes naturally to a kiddo five years younger.\n\nI choose instead to rejoice in our blessings, and to enjoy this delightful interactive peek-a-boo stage to its fullest.\n\nMaybe I'll celebrate by wearing a tie to church tonight...\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.halfwaydownthestairs.net/index.php?action=view&id=85"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/05/fit-to-be-tied.html", "title": "\nFit to be Tied\n"},

My guess is that the combination makes her, yes, one in a million.  At least.\n\nNobody really knows what the numbers mean (though opinions abound) -- how much of this increase heralds a new and dramatic change for who we are as human beings collectively, and how much involves increased recognition of who we've always been.  And here we sit at the close of Developmental Disability Awareness Month (March) and the opening of Autism Awareness Month (April) and I find myself wondering together with Commissioner Sharon Lewis of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities:\nAt what point do we move from seeking simple awareness about intellectual and developmental disabilities to expecting meaningful respect for people with ID/DD?\nHere is our beautiful one-in-a-million Joy:\n\n\nThe artwork above is courtesy of a drawing program on Joy's new iPad, whereby we can easily take photos and trace them via the touch screen.

But I think I'm going to need an entire post or more for the iPad, and this one isn't it.  The rest of this one is actually about an outing last weekend to the local arboretum, on a one-in-a-million spring morning that came five or six weeks early for how Wisconsin usually operates.

It's good cheap entertainment, seeing as how we weren't winners of $640 million... (Yes, JoyDad did go and drop $5 for the thrill of it all.

In the 2007 version they ended up voting instead on an altogether-different (and unacceptable) substitute amendment; the 2009 version was then incorporated into budget legislation so it wasn't a separate vote.  So we don't have a voting record on autism insurance in the Assembly.  We do know, however, that the following currently-serving Republican state senators voted for autism insurance on 2007 SB178:\nSen. Robert Cowles (R - Green Bay)\nSen. Alberta Darling (R - River Hills)\nSen. Michael Ellis (R - Neenah)\nSen. Sheila Harsdorf (R - River Falls)\nSen. Dan Kapanke (R \u2013 La Crosse)\nSen. Luther Olsen (R \u2013 Ripon)\n\nThat makes a total of eight currently-serving Republican Wisconsin state legislators who took tangible recorded legislative action in favor of autism insurance.\n\nBefore their party / ALEC wrote the (not-yet-introduced) legislation that would kill it.\n\nThen there are the Democrats on the record -- voting or co-sponsoring -- in support of autism insurance as well.\n\nCo-Sponsoring Democratic Senators:\nSen. Spencer Coggs (D - Milwaukee)\nSen. Jon Erpenbach (D \u2013 Middleton)\nSen. Dave Hansen (D - Green Bay)\nSen. Robert Jauch (D - Poplar)\nSen. Julie Lassa (D - Stevens Point)\nSen. Mark Miller (D - Monona)\nSen. Fred Risser (D \u2013 Madison)\nSen. Lena Taylor (D - Milwaukee)\nSen. Kathleen Vinehout (D - Alma)\n\nAdditional Aye-Voting Democratic Senators:\nSen. Tim Carpenter (D - Milwaukee)\nSen. Robert Wirch (D - Pleasant Prairie)\n\nCo-Sponsoring Democratic Assembly Representatives\nRep. Therese Berceau (D \u2013 Madison)\nRep. David Cullen (D - Milwaukee)\nRep. Jason Fields (D - Milwaukee)\nRep. Tamara Grigsby (D - Milwaukee)\nRep. Gary Hebl (D \u2013 Sun Prairie)\nRep. Andy Jorgensen (D - Fort Atkinson)\nRep. Margaret \"Peggy\" Krusick (D - Milwaukee)\nRep. Cory Mason (D - Racine)\nRep. Joe Parisi (D \u2013 Madison) -- just elected to Dane County Executive!\nRep. Mark Pocan (D \u2013 Madison)\nRep. Sondy Pope-Roberts (D \u2013 Middleton)\nRep. Jon Richards (D - Milwaukee)\nRep. Donna Seidel (D - Wausau)\nRep. Jennifer Shilling (D - La Crosse) \nRep. Christine Sinicki (D - Milwaukee)\nRep. John Steinbrink (D - Pleasant Prairie)\nRep. Robert Turner (D - Racine)\nRep. Leon Young (D - Milwaukee)\n\nIf you live in the district of any of the aforementioned legislators, here's how you can help.\n\nContact your legislator by phone, e-mail, or postal mail -- you can look them up online.  Consider postal mail if you have time and can spare the stamp!  They get less of that than they do phone/e-mail these days, so the impact may be greater.  There's also plenty of time for a letter to arrive and be processed, since these bills may not be introduced until the legislature convenes in the fall (but if we put legislators on notice NOW, maybe we can even keep the measures from being introduced?)\n\nTell them these things:\n\n1)  Thank them for their past vote / co-sponsorship for autism insurance.\n\n2)  Tell them that autism insurance not only helps people who are able to access it, but also saves the state on Medicaid expenses!  (Your personal autism-insurance story goes here if you have one.)\n\n3)  Ask them to be consistent with their previous stance by joining you in opposing LBR0373 and LRB1529, which would undermine all of Wisconsin's insurance mandates (including autism insurance)\n\n4)  Make sure to include your full street address with your signature.I've already made a personal visit to Sen. Darling's office, with Joy at my side, to address this issue.  Since I'm not a constituent of hers, I didn't get a direct visit with the senator, but I did make an appointment and had a reasonably good conversation with a staff member.\n\nMore opportunities to get your lobby on!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.examiner.com/health-news-in-phoenix/fight-over-health-insurance-bill-intensifies", "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/waml/waml.aspx"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/04/autism-insurance-they-were-for-it.html", "title": "\nAutism Insurance: They Were For It!

They were to write an \"A to Z\" poem in rhyming couplets about what they did during their break!

{"date": "Sunday, May 22, 2011", "body": "\nThe end-of-year field trips are flowing thick and fast around here.  Several times while I've been down at the Capitol in the past weeks, I've seen gaggles of kids going through the (in-defiance-of-court-order) metal detector screenings to get into The People's House.  Rose will get her turn to visit with her class this coming week, though given our spring-break advocacy, she's already got some experience!\n\nFor Joy, the whole field trip thing has been a different story.\n\nThe field trips for her kindergarten class started way back this fall when we were still struggling to make it through the day without injury.  Technically we would have been within our rights to demand that Joy's school personnel find SOME way, ANY way, to take her along on each and every field trip.  However, we also prefer to avoid putting people in unwinnable situations.  Sooo many field trips involve standing in line, waiting, lecture situations, sitting through performances.  They're generally things that Joy wouldn't... well, enjoy... and I wouldn't attempt with her myself, even in the absence of the crowd-control aspect... so why would we make Joy and everyone else miserable by forcing them to go through it?\n\nBut finally with the end of the year nearing, her classroom teacher sent home a notification in the class newsletter that made my eyes shine.  A field trip to a kiddie gymnastics facility!\n\nI made known right away that I thought this field trip had \"Joy\" written all over it, and her staff agreed.  There wasn't even much advance prep to do, at least that I knew of, other than the fact that she needs one-on-one supervision both in school and out.  Joy has been generally cooperative on city bus rides, so I didn't think the transportation would be a problem.\n\nFriday was the big day!  And when I came to pick Joy up at the end of the day, when her classroom teacher came leading her classmates out of the building, he gave me a great big grin and high sign.  \"It went great!\" he said!  Sure enough, when her special-ed teacher brought Joy to the doors, she confirmed that it had been a grand success.  Joy had sat independently on the bus on the way there, gotten her wiggles out enthusiastically at the gym, and snuggled happily on her aide's lap on the bus ride home.\n\nRose told me later that when she'd seen Joy & her aide in the hall that afternoon, the aide told Rose that she wished they could have something like that for Joy every day!\n\nIt's hard to believe that we're just a couple of weeks from the end of the school year.  Joy will turn seven soon, and she'll be done with her kindergarten year.  I'm just so pleased that she got to have a successful field trip to help round off her first year of elementary school.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/05/joy-rocks-field-trip.html", "title": "\nJoy Rocks the Field Trip\n"},

Talent, the girl's got talent! \n(I Photoshopped out her signature & JoyDad's for anonymity's sake, but Joy's signature manages to be pretty anonymous with no help from me.)\n\n\nJoyDad got me a box of chocolates.  The good stuff.  I tried to share a piece with Joy, who nibbled a corner but then pushed it away.  (Aw, shucks, had to eat it myself.)  She was thrilled to be given the chocolate-brown ribbon from around the box to paly with, though.\n\nThen we had home-made waffle-breakfast with Rose's friend Elizabeth and family, complete with maple-syrup and the last of the frozen strawberries from 2010.  Spring came late this year, but the first strawberry blossoms did open this weekend.\n\nThen we got out the bouncy castle for the first time this season.  Joy was delighted.  She bounced and bounced, both on her own and in the middle of a boisterous ball game between Rose & Elizabeth.  I had to remember how tentative Joy was about her new castle when we first bought it almost three years ago.  Some gifts she just has to get used to, maybe grow into. (Maybe if I plied her with high-end chocolates at regular intervals, she'd learn to appreciate them?  The world may never know...)\n\nAnd if all that weren't enough, the whole family went downtown to the Capitol Square for an activist Mother's Day picnic event and Solidarity Singalong. I made a new ALEC sign:\n\n\nThis one is protesting yet another piece of ALEC legislation that is fast-tracking its way through the Wisconsin legislature: AB110, the \"Special Needs Scholarship Program Act.\" (They say \"scholarship,\" I say \"voucher.\")  Parents whose child has a public-school IEP would be able to take that child's share of public-ed tax dollars and spend it to send him or her to private school -- losing all their IDEA rights in the process, with no guarantee of any special-ed services at the private school.  Though some families would surely benefit (most likely middle-to-upper income families, because the family pays the difference between the voucher & private school tuition), the big winners are those with corporate and religious interests in pushing private schools, and our public schools would be the big losers.  (Here's a document of myths and facts about the bill.) So many things to protest, happening so fast!\n\nBut that's mother-commitment in Wisconsin, these days.\n\nI hope everyone had a wonderful Mother's Day!  I'll close with a salute in the form of a Facebook status-post that was making the rounds on Sunday:\n\nFor all the moms out there who had to wait longer (or still wait) to hear a first word, who spent more time in doctor's offices with their child than on playdates, who find joy in the uniqueness of their child even when others don't get it....For the moms who promote the ABILITIES and gifts of their child everyday, we salute you.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jf9fRaE8EAI/Tcrv4aRZHEI/AAAAAAAAA0I/T7FQDMy07EU/s1600/2011-05-mothersday.jpg", "http://www.infusionchocolates.com/", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/05/05/973075/-WI-Solidarity-Singalong:-Aint-Gonna-Let-Nobody-Turn-Me-Round", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zQ_sx1LXOW0/Tcrvy6HIsmI/AAAAAAAAA0A/1ZpQdjm5KHU/s1600/alec-protest3.jpg", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/05/08/973973/-Piratizing-Special-Education-in-Wisconsin:-AB110", "http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Myths-and-Facts-Special-Needs-Scholarships.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/05/mothers-day-2011.html", "title": "\nMother's Day 2011\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "body": "\nRose and I held signs at the front of the room at a press conference yesterday. The event was held to draw attention to the stealth attack on Wisconsin Medicaid in Governor Scott Walker's \"budget-repair\" bill. Several hundred people overflowed the room, braving freezing rain to come out and show support.\n\n\"Stealth attack\" is not too strong a term. As I've written before, the Medicaid-related part of the bill is flying almost entirely under the radar, overshadowed by the outrage over the attempt to break public-employee unions (including public school teachers & librarians, setting the stage for immense cuts in education to come.) Now that events in Wisconsin have hit the national news, the story line is still all about the unions.\n\nThere's an excellent new article in the Capital Times called \"Why Such Little Outcry Over Bill's Impact on Medicaid Programs?\" (The same reporter interviewed Rose after the press event. We shall see...) It's been a complex story to try & tell, because the upcoming cuts aren't actually in the current bill. What's in the bill is the unprecendented and undemocratic authority to make future cuts behind closed doors, with neither legislative oversight nor public input.\n\nNow that the press event has given me an eagle-eye view of who all could be affected, I'm more appalled and worried than ever!\n\nMedicaid, otherwise known as Medical Assistance (MA), provides a health-care and community support safety net for the most vulnerable in our state -- seniors, people with disabilities, people with mental illness, people with low incomes -- using a combination of state and federal funding. Over 1.1 million people in Wisconsin, around 20% of our state's population, use some form of Medicaid. Numbers have been on the rise due to the impact of the recession.\n\nThe newly-formed Medicaid Matters Alliance, the organizers of the press event, provided the following information, which I quote here directly with a few asides:\n\n\u2022 775,000 children and adults have basic medical coverage in BadgerCare\n\u2022 90,000 Wisconsin children and adults with severe mental illness use Medicaid services\n\u2022 9800 children and young adults (0-21) with severe disabilities utilize Medicaid community based supports and medical coverage [Personal note -- Joy is among this number]\n\u2022 20,500 people with developmental and physical disabilities stay independent at home and in their communities with Medicaid funded supports [Personal note -- Joy will be among this number in the future, if the program is not eviscerated]\n\u2022 18,000 seniors stay independent at home and in their communities with help from Medicaid\n\u2022 90,000 Wisconsin seniors rely on SeniorCare for affordable prescription drugs\nWe don't know yet who amoung those 1.1 million will be targeted in the upcoming cuts, nor to what extent those targeted will be hit -- and if the bill passes, we won't know until after\u00a0the cuts have been made and it's a done deal.\n\nThe speakers at the event were varied, passionate, compelling. We heard from:\n\n-- A retiree for whom Medicaid is the only thing that has allowed her to scrape by and live in her own home, after the recession decimated her retirement savings.\n\n-- a woman who has spent half her life with quadriplegia due to a car accident, whose active and productive life in the community is at risk (and who would rather die than be warehoused in a nursing home)\n\n-- several people for whom Medicaid is a lifeline for aid with mental illness issues, either for themselves or their children\n\n-- a woman who lived with an abusive partner for 12 years, who could not have taken care of her injuries without MA, nor could she have left him without MA healthcare for her children (2 of whom have disabilities)\n\nAnd the stories kept coming. This has the potential to devastate SO many people, each with their own story that has brought them to need medical-assistance help.\n\nThere should be thousands of people storming the Capitol on this issue alone!\n\nBut the word is only starting to spread.\u00a0 And the people whom this most affects -- seniors, people with disabilities, people with mental illness, people with low incomes --\u00a0are not the ones with the resources to be easily able to hit the streets.\n\nAnd if Governor Walker had his way, the stealth attack on Medicaid would have already been passed by now.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nPeople in Wisconsin: Governor Walker is saying that he's only hearing from people who support his position. Contact him and tell him that you oppose the undemocratic Medicaid process changes, and that they need to be removed from the bill. 608-266-1212, or govgeneral@wisconsin.gov.\n\nThere are four Wisconsin state senators who have yet to state a position on the bill. If you live in their districts, contact them with the same message as for Gov. Walker -- or if you know anyone who does live in their districts, get them to make the contacts! Click the links for contact information:\n-- Sen. Dale Schultz of Richland Center, District 17\n-- Sen. Michael Ellis of Neenah, District 19\n-- Sen. Sheila Harsdorf of River Falls, District 10\n-- Sen. Robert Cowles of Green Bay, District 2\n\nFor Anyone: To get updates directly from the coalition fighting to preserve our voice on Medicaid in Wisconsin, sign up at\n-- \"Like\" the Save BadgerCare Coalition on Facebook or visit their website.\n-- Join the Medicare Matters Alliance Google Group\n\nAnywhere in the US that the Wisconsin story is being reported at all, a letter to the editor of your local paper would be a welcome help.\n\nAnd finally, a fun morale-booster action step: Buy pizza for the protesters! Ian's Pizza by the Slice just off the Capitol Square, 608-257-9248, has been getting orders in from all over the country (& world). JoyDad and Rose and I availed ourselves of the pizza-generosity after the press event. Good stuff, great morale-booster!\n\nThank you so much for all you do.

And panda / Santa?\n\nThis April, just in time for Autism Awareness Month, she's picked on an especially good one.\n\n\"Together!\"\nIt actually comes out somewhat like \"GEH-guh!\"  But she wants people around her to say it right.  She'll come up to you and say \"geh-guh\" to request that you say \"together\" for her.  Her school staff put this together (heh!) with the song:\nThe more we get together, together, together,\nThe more we get together,\nThe happier we'll be!Four \"geh-guhs\" for the price of one, what a deal!\n\n\"Together\" is a powerful core for Autism Awareness Month.  Awareness leads to action, and action gains power when people work together.\n\nI've been running around like crazy these past weeks, trying to get set up to take advantage of Autism Awareness Month opportunities for letting people know about the autism-related issues in Wisconsin around the state budget legislation (Medicaid! and Education!) and threats to the autism insurance mandate.\n\nOne result of that scrambling has been a new advocacy page on the website of the Autism Society of Greater Madison.  There's been a press release.  There's been a legislator letter.  There's been a budget handout.  There's been the organizing for a presentation on autism and the Wisconsin budget (at which it looks like I might even be doing a little bit of presenting, though I'm not the main attraction by any means.)  I've been meeting lots of people, doing lots of autism-related networking.\n\nBut it's a bigger \"together\" than that.  With all the new legislation-based threats to people with autism in Wisconsin, not a single one of those threats is specific to autism.  In fact, the word \"autism\" is not even mentioned in either the budget or the health insurance mandate-busting bills.\n\nWhat a stunning opportunity to join coalitions and make common cause with other disability groups and other issue groups!\n\nThe coalition groups have really been out in front with legislative positions and actions.  Remember the Medicaid-related press conference back on February 20?  A coalition effort.  There's a coalition that's working on the mandate-busting issue -- based on a coalition that originally formed in support of mental-health parity a few years back.  There there are longer-term established cross-disability organizations and coalitions that throw events like the Disability Advocacy Day that just happened in Madison on April 6, and put out materials like this impressive suite on the budget.\n\nIt is good to be tapping in to all these levels of group action.  There's something of a progression that could almost be charted like this:\n\nautism ==} developmental disabilities ==} special healthcare needs ==} health care\n\nor\n\nautism education ==} special education ==} education\n\nWhen you get to the bigger coalitions staffed with professionals, there's a whole new level of access and clout.  I'm really looking forward to seeing what connections I can help foster, and what my special-interest (autism) group can both gain from, and contribute to, larger group efforts.\n\nTogether.\n\nToday I'm headed out for more networking at the Autism Society of Wisconsin annual conference.  Tomorrow our whole family is participating in a local Autism Awareness Month fundraiser, \"One Walk, Big Strides for Autism\" walk.\n\nLots of \"together.\"  Happiest thing in the world, right now!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5pWKbno5LTY/Ta4VeCh21VI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/_ZMw26KR5ys/s1600/Apr2011-autismaware.jpg", "http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/response-to-proposed-education-budget.pdf", "http://autismmadison.org/advocacy/", "http://autismmadison.org/2011/02/18/budget-bill-threat/", "http://autismmadison.org/2011/04/07/asgm-letter-to-representatives/", "http://autismmadison.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/adv_alert.pdf", "tp://autismmadison.org/2011/04/05/419-autism-the-budget-and-beyond/", "http://www.savebadgercare.org/", "http://www.wi-bpdd.org/projects/wiadvocacyday/", "http://www.dawninfo.org/co/sc/survival_coalition.cfm", "http://www.asw4autism.org/", "http://autismmadison.org/2011/04/06/one-walk-big-strides-for-autism/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/04/together.html", "title": "\nTogether!\n"},

(The Capital Times, 2/20/2011)\n\nFor a summary analysis of the bill from the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, see pages 8 & 9 of the following:\n2/14/2011 LFB Memo on Budget Adjustment Legislation (.pdf)\n\nAutism-related Press Releases\nAutism Society of Wisconsin: Sweeping shift of authority for setting Medicaid policy threatens Medicaid programs, including autism services. (2/18/2011, .pdf)\nAutism Society of Greater Madison: Budget Repair bill a threat to autism services\n (2/18/2011)\n\nA couple of contact-your-legislator Action Alerts:\nFrom Access to Independence: Budget Repair Bill should not Limit the Power of People with Disabilities and their Families to Provide Input!\nFrom DAWN News Service: Take Medicaid Out of the Budget Repair Bill \n\nAnd the latest status of the bill, as of early-morning Sat. 2/19:\n-- It has passed the Joint Finance Committee, with the addition of an amendment that \"sunsets\" the Medicaid-related process changes on Jan. 1, 2015 -- which is the end of Gov. Walker's current term, preventing any new administration from using the same ugly undemocratic process to change everything back.  (It seems that the emergency only lasts as long as the Walker administration?)\n-- The State Assembly did not vote on Friday, but adjourned till Tuesday.\n-- The State Senate is currently unable to vote, since all the minority-party state senators have crossed state lines in protest of the lack of conversation/negotiation with Governor Walker and the incredibly rushed timeline for such controversial far-reaching changes.  The Senate cannot vote, due to lack of quorum, until at least one of them returns.  (Stay strong in your undisclosed location/s, Senators, and thank you for your courage!)\n\nAnd finally, a Joy-story to tell. \n\nRegular readers will remember that Joy re-started swimming lessons this January. After she had a wonderful first-lesson with a new teacher, that teacher left the swim school.  We were reassigned to someone who didn't connect with Joy for the second-lesson.  Then we had the chance to switch to yet a third teacher, who happens to be the same one with whom Joy had her first wonderful swimming-lesson experiences back in 2008.\n\nJoy has now had two lessons with her third/original teacher.  She is responding enthusiastically.  I learned yesterday that the swim school has a new approach -- in addition to the report cards at the end of the session, they now give ribbons to mark when a swimmer accomplishes each skill in their level.\n\nJoy got the following ribbon yesterday (it's really a neon-yellow with gold letters):\n\n\nNote the Guppy logo!  Woo hoo!\n\nI look forward to being able to step back from blogging the politics of Governor Walker's disastrous budget, and tell more Joy-stories, but I'm also pretty much the only one I know who's blogging this part of the story, so it's a personal mission with me to keep the information flowing.  I do plan to take a blogging Sabbath for an upcoming day here, take a deep breath, relax at least a little.  But I hope to see folks at the event on Sunday afternoon, even if it's ice-and-snowing! \n\n===================\nPress Event to Support Wisconsin Medicaid and Raise the Voices of Working Families, Older Adults, People with Disabilities and Others with a Stake in Wisconsin\u2019s Health \n\nSunday, February 20, 2011 1:00 pm\nMadison Senior Center, 330 West Mifflin, Madison, Wisconsin  (Google Map)\n\nWhat: A press event to raise awareness of what\u2019s at stake for recipients of Medicaid \u2013 including BadgerCare, SeniorCare, Family Care, children\u2019s waivers and other vital programs in the Governor\u2019s Budget Repair Bill.\n\nWhen: Sunday, February 20, 2011 1:00pm\n\nWhere: Madison Senior Center, 330 West Mifflin, Madison, Wisconsin\n\nWho: The Save BadgerCare Coalition and the Save Medicaid Coalition that includes a broad and diverse alliance of advocates for public health, disability rights, women\u2019s health, the aging community, children\u2019s health along with working individuals and families that depend on Medicaid including BadgerCare for their health, well-being and economic security.  \n\nBackground: The Budget Repair Bill, even as amended by the Joint Finance Committee, threatens the future of Wisconsin \u2019s Medicaid programs that provide critical supports to more than 1.1 million people in the state.  The bill gives sweeping authority to the Department of Health Services (DHS) to enact \u201cemergency rules\u201d that could significantly change the Medicaid programs and reduce BadgerCare eligibility for children, parents and uninsured adults; or reduce benefits in programs that serve older adults and persons with disabilities; and change co-pays and premiums without legislative oversight or any public input, which could have dire consequences for Wisconsin residents.  \n\nThese significant changes to the administration of Wisconsin\u2019s Medicaid programs are in danger of being overshadowed by the proposal\u2019s other provisions which involve the rights of public employees. The public needs to be aware of the implications this bill will have for all those who rely on Medicaid; and that changes made today will have dire consequences for years to come that should not be underestimated.\n\n========\nP.S.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2011", "body": "\nFor years, advocates in Wisconsin have been working to make life better -- in some cases, make life possible -- for people with disabilities.\n\nThe process has been slow.  It has taken years to create the programs and put the funding in place to allow people with disabilities to live a meaningful life in their communities, in their homes, with the healthcare support they need.  Bit by bit, but with much further to go, the argument has moved forward: if you don't want to go back to the bad old days of warehousing people in very expensive institutions where lives were unbelievably difficult and generally much shorter, the public needs to step up and provide support.\n\nThis successful argument has won us the MA waiver that provides intensive therapy for children with autism.\nWe've won funding for health care.\nFor respite care.\nFor the home modifications that keep people safe and mobile.\nFor the supports that allow adults with disabilities to live in the community.\n\nOn Friday February 11, Governor Scott Walker proposed a so-called \"budget repair\" bill that will allow him and his appointees to restructure and slash Medical Assistance programs in Wisconsin.  If this bill passes, the future slashing will take place...\n\nWithout public notice.  Without public input.\n\nThe budget bill was released on Friday.  A public hearing was announced Monday noon to take place on Tuesday at 10am, less than 24 hours notice.\n\nThey want the legislature to rubber-stamp this bill with a vote THIS WEEK.  (And they claim they have the votes to do it.)\n\nVery few people even know about the provisions of the bill impacting Medical Assistance.\n\nJust so you can see I'm not making this up, here are some links to news articles...\nWalker budget proposal would impact how health care works in state\nBudget repair bill gives Walker free hand to revamp, cut Medicaid programs\nState attorney said Walker's Medicaid plan raised \"potential constitutional issues\"\n\nThe bill also eliminates outright the agency that coordinates Joy's respite care services, the Wisconsin Quality Home Care Commission.  (The cuts in the respite funding itself will surely come later.  Without public input or notice.)\n\nWhy don't people know about this?\n\nTwo major reasons:\n1) The bill is loaded with outrages.  The one that has been in the headlines, that people know most about, is the proposal to strip most collective-bargaining power from public employees, so that (for starters) the governor can implement a massive cut in take-home pay via drastically-increased employee benefit contributions.  [For JoyDad and myself, the loss of income amounts to half our mortgage payment every month, the equivalent of a 150% income-tax hike.]   The union-busting, an outrage in and of itself, also sets the stage for immense cuts in public education...\n\n2) The timeline is appallingly, undemocratically short.  The advocacy groups have not had time even to properly analyze the Medical Assistance provisions in the bill, let alone inform the public to get to the hearing and tell their stories.  The hearing, by the way, is technically still underway as I write, though they adjourned temporarily at 3am and cut off the ability for further people to sign up to speak.  People are sleeping-over in the Capitol rotunda in Madison tonight.  I submitted my written testimony yesterday morning, but could not stay the whole day awaiting my turn to speak.\n\nAs I said in a letter to the editor that was published yesterday, nobody is arguing that there's not a serious budget issue in our state.  Some pain will have to be shared.  Tax increases will have to be a part of this puzzle.  \n\nGovernor Walker's approach so far, however, has been to hand over millions of dollars in corporate tax giveaways during a special-session in January this year.  In other words, making the hole bigger, so that the coming cuts will be even greater.\n\nAnd the mechanism that allows unfettered cuts to Medical Assistance, without so much as public notice let alone public input, is moving through practically un-noticed.\n\nSpread the word.  Call the state legislators, or e-mail them if their phone mailboxes are still jammed full like they were yesterday!  Write to your local paper.  Hit the streets if you're anywhere near a rally.  The Capitol will be alive with protest today, what with the Madison schools closed as the teachers go out to advocate for Wisconsin public education -- JoyDad and I support them wholeheartedly. \n\nBut if the MA issue continues to fly under the radar, the protests won't get that part of the bill so much as tweaked.\n\nPlease help!\n\n\n==========\nP.S.  A little bit of wonky sausage-making detail for those who are interested in such things!  According to the balance of powers in the State of Wisconsin, MA changes have had to go through a legislative process, either through direct legislation or through administrative rule-making.  Both approaches require public hearings.\n\nThe budget proposal changes the requirements for the process.  Changes would be able to be made via \"emergency rule,\" regulations which could be created by the Walker-appointees in the Department of Health Services.  Ordinarily, hearings must be held on emergency rules, and then after a specified period of time, the emergency rules must be converted into final rules, with another round of public hearing.  However, according to the budget proposal, the new \"emergency rules\" slashing MA could be passed without hearing by the Joint Finance Committee, simply by the committee declining to take them up.   The JFC is currently 8 Republicans, 4 Democrats.  The committee WILL DECLINE to take up any proposed emergency rules that result in MA cuts.  So the emergency rules will simply pass into effect in 14 days.  No public notice, no public input.  The bill also waives the requirement for the emergency rules to be revisited and converted into final rules.  No chance for public input and changes there either.\n\nP.P.S.

{"date": "Friday, February 18, 2011", "body": "\nMy protest sign and I got our democracy on at the Capitol last night, to spread the word about the Wisconsin budget-repair bill's assault on Medical Assistance.\n\n\nHere's the text from the sign as held by JoyDad in the photo.  It says:\nDid you know?  This bill gives unchecked power to gut Medicaid with zero public input to a Medicad-hater you've never heard of!*  \nAsk me more...\n*DHS Secretary Dennis Smith\nAs outlined in an earlier post, Smith is the new secretary for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, who has advocated that states should drop Medicaid entirely.  The bill would give him sweeping powers to change Medicaid without public input.\n\nI couldn't get down to the Capitol until after Joy went to bed last night.  The schools are closed as the teachers take their consciences to the street, an action that JoyDad and I support even though it's been a challenge for Joy.  The change in routine comes hard, not to mention having to deal with preoccupied parents, so she's had a short fuse and is really giving us a run for our money.\n\nSo my sign and I went downtown and the first thing that happened was, we got on national TV.  The Ed Schultz show on MSNBC (9pm Central time) has been broadcasting live from Madison, doing a fantastic job of covering the protests and connecting the dots from Wisconsin to the corporate-funded effort to break public-employee unions nationwide.  But he hasn't spoken about the Medical Assistance issue, so my sign and I went to see if we could be a presence.  Alas, I landed on the wrong side of the crowd to be in the primary crowd-shots.  But the people in the crowd where I landed let me through to the front line once they saw my sign -- \"This is an important sign, let her through, we've got to let people know!\"  My big pink sign and I got a direct crowd-shot during the part of the show where Ed was talking with a state senator from Ohio, where the assault on the unions is now underway as well.  JoyDad reports that the sign half-hid my face... but that's OK, I was holding it up on purpose so the camera could see.\n\nI was on the right side of the stage to get a word with the producer of Schultz' show.  I asked him if the Medicaid issue would be covered, and got a \"no.\"  Which I understand -- as I said, they're doing a great job of what they're doing.  But perhaps Rachel Maddow's show might be willing to range more broadly...\n\nACTION STEP:\nIf you feel so moved, contact Rachel Maddow (Rachel@msnbc.com) and ask her to run a segment on the assault on Medical Assistance in Wisconsin.  Send her a link to the story from the Capital Times at http://tinyurl.com/45qn78f\n or send her to this blog!\n\nI also got a chance to thank John Nichols of the Capital Times for their fine coverage of the issue -- but it needs to go national.\n\nAfter the show, Ed himself came down to visit our part of the crowd.  I got his autograph on my sign!\n\nThen my newly-autographed sign and I went into the Capitol Rotunda, where I met a friend of mine.  By this time it was well after 10, but the rotunda was full of fired-up protesters, led by students who took turns standing on a barrel in the center of the Rotunda to lead chants and keep the energy going.  My friend offered me a ride home (since I'd come on the bus, which is also under attack in this bill), so I was free to stay and talk to people.\n\nThe sign, word-overload and all, did a great job bringing folks to talk to me, who had no idea about the Medicaid issues.  I was able to tell the story to a fellow who happened to be in a major education-related organization, who promised to spread the word widely to educators in this state who don't yet know.\n\nThen a young woman popped out of the crowd to see my sign and ask questions.  When she heard my explanation, she was horrified.  And then she said, \"Can you tell them (gesturing to the crowd) about this?\"  Before I knew it, I was being led to the barrel in the center of the Rotunda and handed the bullhorn.\n\nThe crowd was amazing.  They had a mutually agreed-upon signal for \"quiet down, someone needs to talk,\" so the two-raised-fingers peace sign popped up on hundreds of hands and they stopped the drums and jumping to hear me speak.  And I told them, in short phrases, what the bill says about Medicaid.  What the bill does to public participation on future changes to Medicaid.  Who Dennis Smith is, and why it's so dangerous to give him this power. Where to go for more information.\n\nHundreds, maybe a thousand? activists at the Capitol now know that the assault on Medicaid must be removed from this bill.\n\nKeep spreading the word, everyone!  Keep calling & e-mailing your legislators, if you live in Wisconsin.  Contact the White House, tell the president that we need his support here in Wisconsin.  Come to the Capitol if you can. This is too important to stop now!\n\nYou can also \"like\" Elvis Sightings on Facebook in the right-hand sidebar to follow new posts.  Only a part of my writing has been political, but right now this is where I get to spread the word.\n\n(To my regular readers: JoyMama, standing on a barrel, in the Capitol Rotunda, at 11pm, with a bullhorn.

If you put your hands around the most bulging part of the balloon and squeeze, the air will move over and make another part of the balloon bulge instead...Or that classic bedbug baby-toy, where there are four bedbugs and two are always \"up.\"  Hit one with the little plastic hammer, and it pops down but another pops up.Take, for example, Joy's stims.  She's not pulling down Christmas cards or plants (yay!)  But she is getting so insistent on snow-stimming that it's harder and harder to make even a short walk between car and school, even if the sidewalks are clear -- she dives and kicks into the snowbanks on either side, and then goes limp when you try to get her to stand and walk.  And she's getting terribly insistent on \"making friends with the pillow\" if left to her own devices for any length of time at all.  That lovely fleece boa I made her for Christmas, that I was hoping would be a socially-acceptable twiddle-stim?  She lo-o-o-o-o-oves that boa, and not in a way we can take out in public.  And if we take the boa away, the house is full of usable substitutes.Then there's the \"acts of ow.\"  She's hardly pulling out her own hair any more, and the self-injurious stuff has dropped to near zero (yay!)  But guess what has gone way up instead?  Outbursts directed at other people.  Hitting, kicking, hair-pulling, as a very touchy and very immediate frustration response.I don't like the balloon/bedbug-toy analogy nearly as well as I like comparing Joy's development and behavior to a mixer board (with sliders that go both up and down but don't necessarily have to be zero-sum.)I'm pretty sure that the stimming does have to happen in one form or another, though I wish we would be able to have more influence as far as what the range of preferred stim would be. [Update: TherExtras reminds me to link to our joint-post from a year ago, Stim-Sense, that explored stimming issues.]   Even more so, I wish the acts-of-ow weren't acting like a squeezed balloon.  Because as far as I'm concerned, I'd rather have that acts-of-ow-balloon just pop and disappear altogether.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TTl2JFBLV7I/AAAAAAAAAvA/BlMg66cwmEk/s1600/bedbugs.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/01/squeezing-balloon.html", "title": "\nSqueezing the Balloon\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2011", "body": "\n\"Budgets are moral documents.\"\n-- Jim Wallis, Sojourners\n\nIn my Saturday morning post, I spoke of taking a Sabbath and not posting on the 20th.\n\nMy congregation was holding a weekend retreat at a center about an hour's drive away, and the JoyFamily drove there Saturday morning for a 24-hour getaway.\n\nWe needed the break, from the news and the protests and the computers.  The week had been exhausting, days on end with insufficient sleep and way too much adrenaline.\n\nHowever, the retreat also provided a safe space to go in deeper.  With our friends, we were able to explore the moral dimensions of the budget proposal and the protests, in thoughtful conversation and in prayer.\n\nI also brought a bunch of posterboard and a fistful of markers to offer an additional option for a craft project activity: making signs to highlight the Medicaid issue, to be conveyed to the press event on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\nSeveral of the signs alluded to the moral implications of the budget-repair bill.  I particularly liked the ones that said, \"Don't deny a voice for the vulnerable.\"  Two of those signs wound up on the wall right behind the heads of the speakers at the press event, in direct camera view.\n\n\nBut even more touching to me was a sign colored by a little fellow of the age of six, just two days older than Joy.  For the first two years of Joy's life, our family did a daycare swap with this little guy's family, so he and she were daycare buddies up to the age of two.  They've not been close lately, as he is on a typical developmental path and she is on a path all her own; but he really wanted to create a sign, and his mom traced the words \"Protect Medicaid\" for him to color and explained just a little bit that this was to help Joy and others like her.\n\n\nHis was the sign I chose to hold at the front of the room at the press event (held here by JoyDad on the bus on the way home.)\n\n\n\nIf you follow the online debate about Wisconsin's budget, or listen to certain newscasts, you will hear the protesters described as greedy, as rioters, possibly even as un-American.\n\n\nI'd offer the personal view of protesters as people of peace and conscience and deep conviction, many of us as people of faith.  I'm reminded of the children's book that was inspired by our congregation in 2005, Praying with our Feet, about taking peaceful, prayerful action for a peaceful world in the face of an unjust war.  (The book is out-of-print but can still be acquired through various vendors at the link.) \n\nWe're praying in many ways this week.  With our feet at the Capitol building.  With our magic markers.  With our letters to the editor and our calls and e-mails to our legislators.\n\nPlease add your prayers / thoughts / positive energies to ours, in any way you feel so moved.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xgsQVOw41Vc/TWMRbeQVa-I/AAAAAAAAAxc/K0bPdLPsKoI/s1600/signs-table2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mhf9PWYO-n0/TWMRiT7eI2I/AAAAAAAAAxk/KB4AcFmSS60/s1600/signs-table1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-is5QW5f0VWI/TWMRN5j7jjI/AAAAAAAAAxU/7gBA7lVYnjU/s1600/signs-buddy.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eMU-SOuLSgQ/TWOhl4XBQRI/AAAAAAAAAx0/o4uykwy5JGs/s1600/signs-protect.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gavhW4hotlw/TWOhtfBcGeI/AAAAAAAAAx8/0SEgcXAp9cw/s1600/signs-praying-feet.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Praying-Our-Feet-Out-print/dp/0836193067/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/02/praying-with-our-feet-and-our-magic.html", "title": "\nPraying With Our Feet -- and Our Magic Markers\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "body": "\nI got introduced to a new word the other day over at Special Needs Disability Parenting: BLOOM.  The author was reflecting on how daunting the typical \"milestones\" can seem, when they feel so few and far between for our kiddos (and typically-developing kids are just galloping along.)  She spoke of giving due celebration instead to the advances that would to others seem small.  The baby-steps, the inchstones.We've had some very nice inchstones with Joy lately.Schoolwork is paying off!  It's rather a new phenomenon for Joy to suddenly show us something that we haven't been working on at home and weren't particularly tracking with from school.  Recent example:  Joy has been excited to play catch at home lately, with a soft inflated kick-ball-size ball.  All of a sudden, we started seeing her do occasional two-handed throws over her head, something we'd not taught her.  \"Oh, we learn that in gym!\" cried Rose.  And sure enough, Joy had been working on it both in gym and with her one-on-one staffers.Another was when we went to the library earlier this week and encountered a chunky wooden bead-stringing set that went with Eric Carle's classic book The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  There was a wooden butterfly attached to the far end of the string, and the \"needle\" was the caterpillar, and all the foods that the caterpillar ate were the beads to string.  Joy knew exactly what to do, even though the \"needle\" was a long rectangle and had to be inserted just-so, and we hadn't done beads at home for a quite a while.  But she's got a bead-stringing task-box at school!Another delightful set of inchstones stareted with the Christmas tree and stockings and cards that she left unmolested this year.  Right behind her dining chair, those cards are.  Easy reach, and stimmy-favorite material.  And yet she hasn't pulled down a single one.The tree as well, she only made a very few grabs for it this year, even though she was easily tall enough to take it down with one good pull had she chosen to do so.Emboldened by our success with the tree, I tried something new when we took the tree down.  I replaced it with a plant that's been exiled to the back bedroom (now Rose's room) for years.  I can't even remember when we pulled the last plant out of our common living area for Joy-proofing purposes.  Long, long since.The plant has now stood in place of the tree for a week and a half.  We had to warn Joy away a couple of times, but she has mostly let it be.This plant is a survivor, and not just of Joy-depredations.

{"date": "Monday, December 6, 2010", "body": "\nWe got about four inches of lovely fluffy snow on Friday night into Saturday, the first snow of the season!  What a perfect first snow -- waking up to it on a weekend rather than having to go to school, enough for sledding but not so much that sleds would get stuck, warm enough to play but not enough to melt the stuff before you get your fun in.Rose and Joy both adore the snow, but in very different ways.Rose looks at the snow and makes a plan -- and she's old enough that she can carry out those plans herself when they're on our property!  She gets herself all dressed and then goes forth and shovels, makes snow angels, and sleds or snowboards down the gentle incline in our backyard.  Alas, we had mistreated the snowboard over the summer, such that it had warped in our garage under the weight of hoses and a bicycle(!)  She still managed to make it work for now, though, even when we took a family jaunt to the fairly-steep hill at their elementary school.Joy, on the other hand, inhabits the snow.It takes quite a bit of adult interference to get Joy bundled up appropriately -- but once you let her out the door, she's off with a bound.  Snow is an amazing stimmy!  It's everywhere, and (unlike dirt or woodchips), it can actually be OK to throw it in the air!  She blazes trails through it (the above pic is at the school grounds), she rolls in it, she trickles it from her mittened hands, she makes her best attempts to consume it -- if she can get her face into it before a JoyParent can get to her....At the schoolyard, she was thrilled to go speeding down the long hill on a sled with mama, but then not much interested at all in working on getting back up the hill.  I eventually towed her back up in the sled, a long slow process because she kept dragging her mittens in the snow and I kept stopping to request that she get her hands back into the sled.  At least she stays in the sled, which wasn't the case as recently as two years ago!  And she was happy to announce \"Go!\" to get me to start pulling again -- over and over and over.Alas, this week the temperature is going into the deepfreeze.  The snow play bouts will be shorter and chillier, I'm thinking.  But we'll do our best to enjoy it while it's still got the novelty factor!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TPzStpL-fUI/AAAAAAAAAsU/OaZ-2djgXDc/s1600/Dec2010RoseSnow.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TPzSdSrKo2I/AAAAAAAAAsM/wIkmX9I8QWA/s1600/Dec2010JoySnow.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/first-snow.html", "title": "\nFirst Snow\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 17, 2011", "body": "\nI've circled back to blogging about tagging several times now.  My first Tagged post was about Joy's Project Lifesaver radio tag, for tracking purposes in case she wanders.  (Now that she's in kindergarten, we're extra-glad to have that safeguard.) Just lately, I succumbed to the lure of tagging via blog-meme.Our latest new form of tag in the JoyFamily is a disability hang-tag for access to priority parking spaces.Parking lot safety for Joy has long been a concern of ours, but the possibility of a hang-tag didn't really click for me until I had a conversation with Joy's special educator about dropping Joy off at the start of the school day.  I've got my work-schedule arranged so as to be able to do both drop-off and pickup for the girls at school, so we aren't taking advantage of the \"short bus\" that drops kids right by the back door.  If you don't bus, parental drop-off is on the far side of a busy street, with a walk either up or down-hill to the crossing guard.  As an alternative, Joy's special educator mentioned that some parents do a quick drop-off in the handicap spots.  Of course, for that you need official dispensation.Earlier in our journey I'd have had more of an internal debate.  (\"But she's not handicapped -- she's just delayed a little -- we don't really need this -- why mark her as more different than she already is\" -- etc.)  At this point, though, I've learned to agonize less over taking advantage of available resources and designations that can make our lives easier.  The application for the tags was a simple form, just a download away.  It needed a physician's approval, which Joy's doctor gave easily on request.  Two hang tags soon arrived in the mail, one for each car's glove compartment.So far, I have used them sparingly: only at school, and only at drop-off.  In general I'd prefer to have Joy learn to walk with me and her sister and the other kids.  Sometimes we make it the whole 15-minute walk home!  However, if there's rain and puddles, or new snow, the walk becomes too much of a stimmy distracted battle.  It's exhausting, not entirely safe, and sets up a miserable mood for turning Joy over to school staff.  So on those days, out comes the tag and we drive practically up to the door.I haven't yet used the tag in a public parking lot yet, but I sure feel better knowing we have the option.  Parking lots can be scary-rough -- there was a set of helpful parking-lot tips the other day at Stuart Duncan's blog with suggestions for the situation.  (I added the hang-tag suggestion in the comments!)It has crossed my mind that, with Joy's invisible disability, we might come in for some pushback from the self-appointed parking lot police -- the folks who see fit to call challenge if they see someone they don't think looks disabled get out of a car in a handicap-accessible spot.  I was reminded of this yesterday when Rachel posted at Journeys with Autism about the barrage of doubt and disbelief that people with invisible disabilities often face.  She mentioned one woman who developed a snappy comeback for the doubters: when someone issued a \"you don't look disabled\" parking lot challenge, she'd fire back, \"And you don't look like a doctor!\"  (Rachel's post and the comments were much more detailed and nuanced than this little example; well worth the read.)I gave a quick delighted high-five in the comments about that comeback -- it's so the perfect response that you wish you'd thought of at the time!  I've been re-thinking my enthusiasm somewhat, though.  It strikes me that if any parking lot pushback were to come our way, I'd rather be prepared with a gentle, educational answer than a snappy zinger.  That way if the challenger turns out to be a well-meaning soul and open to new ideas, I might be able to send them away thoughtful rather than cranky/defensive.  And if they really deserved the edgy comeback after all -- well, then I'll have been nicer to them than they deserved.  Which wouldn't be so bad.I should make clear that my re-thinking is in no way meant as a prescription for how I think everyone ought to react to a parking lot challenge.  Just my own thoughts and planned approach.  A person with an invisible disability who has had it up to HERE with spending precious energy trying to educate people who won't listen anyway -- may well choose a different approach entirely.The snow has been falling all day today.  Glad we've got that hang-tag for tomorrow.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TTTnTq_1T1I/AAAAAAAAAu4/IQwzwlZCO5U/s1600/HandicapHangTag.jpg", "http://www.stuartduncan.name/autism/the-scariest-part-of-going-grocery-shopping-with-our-son/", "http://www.journeyswithautism.com/2011/01/15/ondoubt-and-the-doubters/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/01/tagged-redux.html", "title": "\nTagged, Redux\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 5, 2011", "body": "\nThis Christmas Joy and Rose both brought gifts home from school for their parents.  Rose's gift to JoyDad was especially fine -- a calendar with the following image:\"Hot peppers are redYour guitar is blueYou are my dadAnd I love you.\"As far as gifts from Joy went, it felt like something of a new era.  There was a little \"I (heart) Mom\" pillow for JoyMama, a calendar for JoyDad (what are they trying to tell him?), and a lovely pair of red beeswax candles for both of us that we've been lighting for a festive touch at meals.It felt really sweet to get gifts from Joy.  I was happy to see the inclusion aspect of it too -- this was something the rest of her classmates were doing, something the teacher had thoughtfully organized and parent volunteers had facilitated.  I witnessed some of the other kids taking their turn to make candles and saw as how it was mostly grown-ups doing the work, though I think the kids were proud of \"their\" candles.  I do wonder to what extent Joy had any idea what was going on.  She may or may not have been able to have any hand at all in the making of them.I have some similar wonderings about another procedure that's a regular part of Joy's school day.  It's the routine during circle-time at the beginning of the morning where the kids take turns standing up and sharing their news since last they met.  Joy participates in this via a GoTalk 4, on which we can record spoken messages that play back when she pushes a picture-button.  The standard picture for \"news\" is a star.  (The other button you see on the image is how she says \"yes please\" or \"no thank you\" to hot-lunch for that day.)As with the gifts, this is a routine with a very sweet feel to it.  Every morning, I come up with something for her to share.  Monday it was \"My Grandma and Grandpa came to visit from Kansas.\"  Tuesday we had \"I sat on my new rocking chair.\"  I always try to make it something relatively normal-sounding, that the other kids can relate to.  After all, this is one of the few consistent times of the day they'll be in one another's company!  Rose provides the voice, and does a fantastic job.  Joy's teacher and I are both charmed at the way Joy \"speaks\" in her sister's voice.The benefits of this are many.  Joy gets to take part in a classroom routine.  Rose gets to help her sister.  Classmates get a little window into Joy's world.And yet, we're putting words into Joy's mouth every day with this routine, words she did not choose.  Words that she can't (yet) choose.  Is this befitting the dignity of a six-year-old human being, who does after all have her own thoughts and feelings and opinions?  Is it that much different than if one used the GoTalk to make your favorite dolly \"talk\" by hand-over-hand causing dolly to push that button?I'm not entirely sure.  At this point, I feel we can justify it from a \"fake it till you make it\" perspective -- one day Joy will learn to share her own news, while dolly never would! -- in addition to all the other positives I pointed out.As with everything we do in service of inclusion, we'll have to keep re-evaluating as we go.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TSMNh27hlgI/AAAAAAAAAuA/jjBrGClnSrU/s1600/calendar.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TSMNWA0hTII/AAAAAAAAAt4/v8s_OX76CwU/s1600/Dec2010JoyPresents.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TSRdGwqFAHI/AAAAAAAAAuI/EgWFLqAhNDo/s1600/Jan2011GoTalk.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/01/included-gifts-in-her-name-words-in-her.html", "title": "\nIncluded: Gifts in Her Name, Words in Her Mouth\n"},

I started feeling achy a week ago Thursday, and Joy began fighting a cold that week.  We went downhill from there, and JoyDad eventually joined us on the slide.  Monday Joy got diagnosed with an ear infection (and got a not-strong-enough antibiotic that we had to replace later); I got diagnosed with pneumonia.  JoyDad joined us on antibiotics later in the week.  Much doctor-appointment-ing, wearing of masks, chest-X-raying, etc. Meds, meds, and more meds!  Analgesics for the aches and fevers and chills; codeine-laced syrup for the cough; antibiotics for the infections; laxatives for constipation side effects; sleep aids for brain-racing side effects; more analgesics for headache side effects.  Then there were the merely annoying side effects that didn't rise to the level of further medication: loss of appetite, bad taste in the mouth, mild nausea, a diuretic effect.

One of the songs she has introduced to us is the South Africa World Cup theme song from this past summer, a song called Waving Flag:When I get older, I will be stronger.In the mouths of second and third graders, it's an encouraging note for the future.Sung by adults, it's encouraging in another way (with maybe just a hint of \"when I am an old woman, I shall wear purple!\")I want this encouragement to apply to both my daughters.The other Friday, I had the opportunity to hear a brown-bag presentation by Dr. Paul Shattuck, autism researcher and professor of social work at Washington University of St. Louis.  He's on the cutting edge of a new trend in autism research -- a trend that recognizes how very much autism-research-attention has been devoted to children and how very little to adults.He's been working with data from a U.S. Department of Education study called the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2.  This study has been following a huge sample of young people receiving special education services, starting with youth age 13-16 in the year 2000.  They followed the same youth for ten years, with five sets of interviews at 2-year intervals.  The interviews (with parents/guardians and with youth who are able to interview) explore special education experiences and the students' transition into post-school, adult life.  There are over 900 youth with autism in the survey.  Dr. Shattuck and his team have been analyzing data from the fourth set of interviews, from 2007 when the youth were 20-23 years old.A couple of findings in his presentation stood out for me.One was the comparison of services received before vs. after high-school graduation.  As one might guess, there's a substantial change and drop-off.  Most dramatic: speech services.  Fully 75% of the sample with autism received speech services in high school.  Of those who had transitioned into adulthood?  Sudden drop to 9%.  Because magically at age 21 the need for speech therapy goes away, right?  Yeah, not so much.  It's all about the service system -- schools provide the therapy, insurance and adult services don't.  (The way autism insurance is written in Wisconsin right now, speech therapy IS covered for adults, by the way.  I wonder how many will be able to take advantage of it.)The other big one: Dr. Shattuck looked at how many of the post-high-school contingent were completely disengaged -- that is, no employment, no career counseling, volunteer work, education, vocational training, outside commitments, nothing.That number was 20%.  The only other subgroup in the study with a slightly higher number on that score were the young adults in the \"mental retardation\" category.The disengagement level was hugely associated with family income level.  Only 3% of the young adult autists from families making over $75,000 were totally disengaged.  In families making under $25,000, the number was 36%.It makes me wonder a lot of things.  One thing I wonder is what exactly it would take to bridge the engagement inequities -- which of course exist amid so many other inequities.I also wonder... what's the ideal?  Surely the appropriate engagement level varies from one person to another.  I don't suppose total disengagement can be spun as a good thing, although there are probably hermits and mystics throughout history who might disagree.  But I'm guessing that there are as many forms of ideal as there are adults with autism.I also wonder what the engagement level was for those who didn't fall into that totally-disengaged category.  How many have just one small lifeline into the outside world, for example, versus those with multiple means of engagement?I also wonder what this survey would look like with 30 year olds.  Or 40 year olds.  Or beyond.I also wonder how different / better / worse things will be for youths with autism who are ages 13-16 in the year 2010.  And finally, I wonder what will be the outcome of something else that Dr. Shattuck noted.  He spoke of the valiant lobbying efforts of the many families who helped drive the cause-and-cure research that has been where the money and effort has poured -- and pointed out that many of these parents now have kids in their late teens.  He sees some of these people turning their well-honed talents to lobbying for adult services.  A trend worth watching -- and worth supporting / joining.I hope for all of us that we will continue to find our strengths as we get older.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/warning/", "http://www.nlts2.org/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/09/when-i-get-older.html", "title": "\nWhen I Get Older\n"},

First off, it was a family party, so there were parents floating around along with kids of various ages, meaning that not all the kids had to be involved in any one activity all at once.  Then there was a meal that Joy appreciated heartily -- pizza, grapes, baby carrots, and birthday cake! all things that she loves to eat.Most importantly, J-Cat's mom had Joy-proofed the living room area and filled it with things she's liked on our playdates: an exercise ball to bounce on, scarves and ribbons and noisy toys.  Other kids could come join her there, and some did for little stretches -- Rose helped take the lead with that -- but Joy could also happily play alone while adults talked nearby.  She also went outside to swing on their swingset, while other kids ran around with their games.Birthday cheer to J-Cat, and thanks to his mama!

Blessed are those who are faithful to their rituals, for to them all the world can be a holy liturgy.The author acknowledged in his post that he is not on the spectrum himself, and solicited feedback from readers who are.  I feel a little hesitant myself, as I stand on the outside of Joy's twirling and stimming, at the prospect of assigning meaning to it.  What is happening in her mind as she spins the stems or spins herself?  Is there a fundamental difference between her quiet leaf-stem twirling, and her teeth-gritting intensity as she stims on a set of car keys?  Is it over-romanticizing to think of these things as a potential meditation or liturgy?  How similar, and how far apart, are the intense stim-experiencing of a set of Mardi Gras beads and the deliberate, specific prayer experience mediated by the counted beads on the rosary?  What level of intentionality does it take for an experience to belong in the realm of prayer/meditation?I'll likely contemplate these things further next time I find myself with an apple or a leaf in my hands.  Meanwhile, I'd love to hear any responses from you!UPDATE re: responses -- In addition to the thoughtful discussion in the comments, Professor Mother has posted an insightful reflection on stimming and meditation from her own experience.  Well worth checking out.  See also (don't know why I didn't link this before) the piece I co-wrote earlier this year with Barbara of TherExtras -- not addressing meditation specifically, but lots of thoughts on stimming.

{"date": "Friday, August 13, 2010", "body": "\nA week ago Thursday, Joy's day had an unusual little glitch.It involved one of Joy's fine-motor practice tasks, putting coins into her mission-bank from church.  The bank is a globe-shaped receptacle to help kids save their coins for denominational projects (we've helped dig wells in Haiti, and support an orphanage in Benin).  For Joy to practice dropping the coins in the slot, an adult gets the small stash of quarters out from the base of the bank and gives them back to her to drop in.In general, she's gotten very good at it.  But a week ago Thursday, she tried a new innovation.  With one of the quarters, instead of putting it in the bank, she put it into her mouth.I bet you can guess where it went from there.  Her babysitter said that the look on her face as it went down the hatch was priceless!  She was so not expecting to consume that coin.We've not been particularly worried, having seen no particular ill effects.  We did call the doctor, and they pretty much told us to watch for the quarter's exit -- and we probably don't need to worry as long as we don't see any signs of discomfort, lack of appetite, coughing, etc.  She's continued to eat well, and doesn't seem distressed.I guess we maybe should've been addressing Joy's constipation issue before this happened?  It makes it... how shall I say... challenging to determine whether she's successfully gotten this thing out of her system or not.  We have not yet observed its passage, four... erm... movements later.  It's possible that we missed it.  I guess if it doesn't show up soon, we'll have to call the doc again.Poor kid, coins and cherry bombs.  I'm amazed that she still enjoys food at all.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TGXVRb1vqVI/AAAAAAAAAnk/UwBCiCTPmNQ/s1600/Mission_bank.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/08/money-hungry.html", "title": "\nMoney Hungry\n"},

According to my hit-count stats, someone actually came and visited Elvis Sightings via a Google search on \"horrid kindergarten transition stories\"!It's probably just as well that I held off on posting during the long weekend.  I wasn't very good company -- I'm glad that we're on to the second week of school here.Day Two of school, Thursday, got off to a better start for Joy.  We avoided the noisy playground and the teacher had altered the routine such that snacks were not out on the tables.  I learned later that Joy had actually managed to hang with the class for the gathering time, and got to use her GoTalk for sharing time and to indicate that she'd brought a bag lunch.  But then she started getting warm and lethargic -- I got a call late in the morning that she was running a low-grade fever.  I requested that they feed her lunch and call me if things got worse, and didn't receive a second call, but only because she'd crashed out at naptime and they didn't really get her up until time to go home, because it was a shortened day.  Her fever at that point had climbed to 101.Day Three, Friday, I stayed home with her.  The lethargy had passed, the cranky took its place.  We had varying levels of cranky all weekend long, with lots of swipes and bangs and hair-pulls (particularly on Rose, poor kiddo).  Not a good weekend for me either, especially compared to how energized and excited I was at the beginning of the semester last year.Today was better.  And I think it's time for a blessing count.1)  Joy made it through a full day today, no calls to work.  She even made it to music class with her classmates, and hung with it much longer than I'd have expected.ONE!  ONE WONDERFUL BLESSING!  MUA-ha-ha-ha!2)  When I went to pick her up, she wrapped me in a huge hug while her aide filled me in.TWO!  TWO WONDERFUL BLESSINGS!  MUA-ha-ha-ha!3)  We invited friends we ran into on the schoolyard for an afternoon playdate.  Joy was laid-back, happy, giggled when playdate-dude came popping out to say \"peek\" at her (rather than yowling and swatting at him)!(OK, you can fill in the count in your own mind from here.)4) I'm so fortunate that I got to experience an ideal kindergarten transition, three years ago with Rose.  Rose was so ready for kindie when her turn came.  Huge grins in her first-day photos, no tears either from her or from me.  Pretty much as smooth as it gets.5) I managed a bike-commute home this afternoon in the face of wind-advisory-level winds.  I am bike-commuter, hear me roar!  Plus I realized that coming home at 2:30, I'll not have to worry about the encroaching darkness that traditionally has made me put my bike away for the season when we \"fall back\" for Daylight Savings.  I can actually wait for the snow to fly!6)  Zucchini flowers.  Which turn into zucchinis.  Which turn into zucchini bread with mini-chocolate chips.  Yum.  (Can you spot the actual zucchini in the photo?)SIX!  SIX WONDERFUL BLESSINGS!

We used to put things up there to be out of her reach.  Must create new strategies.More on growth:  Rose started soccer practice last night for the upcoming season.  When we tried on her cleats (which she was able to wear through the end of the season in May), it was like the stepsisters trying on the glass slipper.  We went up two and a half sizes to get her comfy with room to grow for the fall.Still more on growth:  When it rains a lot (and it has), the weeds in the garden go crazy!  But at least it's easier to pull weeds from damp soil than from hard-baked soil.On peek-a-boo:  Joy has created a delightful new twist on an old game.  When you put a blanket up to your face for peek, she doesn't yank it down -- she lifts the other side and burrows under to join you.  And then says \"peek\"!On switch-flipping: Guess what has faded back into Joy's communication repertoire.  Self-biting (and to some extent, chomping others).  She's doing some swatting & hair-grabbing too, and not excluding her daycare buddies.  Just in time for kindergarten.  Would like this to fade back the other way very quickly.On school administration: A new principal has been hired for Joy & Rose's elementary school.  Must get him introduced to Joy.  I hope he's easy to work with.

Every now and again she'll make a break for it, tear into the kitchen and snag an apple.  Or a peach.  Or a big ol' tomato from the garden.

And then gave a great big grin, apparently loving the way the word felt, exploding through her lips.  Lots of \"peh-puh\"s and giggles for the rest of the meal, and ate the whole helping!Then a little ways into her evening therapy session, she led her barista-dude over to the gate by the basement stairs and signed \"open\".  \"Oh, do you want to go downstairs?\" he asked.  I don't know as how I can properly represent the version of \"downstairs\" that she echoed, but it was definitely an unsolicited imitation.Then after the session was over and she & I were hanging out on the living room couch, she reached for the buttons on the fleece cardigan that I wear around the house.  She's fascinated with those buttons, but had never named them for me.  I said nothing, she said \"buh-buh\"!And last but not least, we had a spectacular unexpected while getting ready for the bath.  Joy has been on an anti-potty kick lately, preferring to throw herself to the ground or anything else but sitting on the seat -- and here we'd been planning a big potty-training push over the summer.  So I did a little experiment.  Brought in a candy treat, and when she threw herself to the floor I caught her eyes and told her, \"First potty, then candy.\"   And she let herself be led to the toilet to sit.  Then I told her, \"We'll count to ten!\"  And I counted out slowly, \"One, two, three...\" and when I hit \"nine,\" she finished up for me with a great big \"TEH!\"This is even more amazing in that we almost NEVER count all the way to ten with her.  Most often we'll go to three, in a one-two-three-GO context.What else does Joy know, that I don't know she knows?

{"date": "Tuesday, April 6, 2010", "body": "\nBefore the Autism Society of Wisconsin conference slips entirely out of sight in the rear-view mirror, I want to report (as promised) on the second keynote, Temple Grandin.  [Note - I'll be calling her by her first name, as I did with Paula Kluth and Eric Courchesne, though in each case the more formal choice would be the title \"Dr.\"]Temple Grandin's book Thinking in Pictures was the first book I read after Joy's autism diagnosis that presented a perspective from within the autism spectrum.  Her account sparked some of my first searching questions about the nature of autism (such as, does everyone with autism think in pictures?)  I was so pleased to get a chance to shake her hand at this conference, and get her autograph on a copy of The Way I See It, which I thought I might read on the Kansas car ride, but it keeps slipping down the stack as I take one other books with deadlines like library due dates...The talk was called An Inside View of Autism and ranged across a variety of topics.  As I look at my notes, they're rather a collection of insights rather than an arc of a lecture-long argument -- but it was engaging all the way through.  Temple is an accomplished lecturer, an achievement that is reportedly the work of many years.  A friend of mine who was also at the conference had heard her speak over a decade ago and compared the two: at the earlier talk, she had relied on self-talk techniques such as \"OK, I need to tell a joke here so you won't all get bored.\"  Over the years, she has taught herself to weave the jokes in seamlessly and to move about the stage as a comfortable speaker often does.Here are some nuggets from the presentation:Remember how I mentioned in my GFCF post that Temple Grandin was a proponent of \"the diet\"?  Well, she is, but in a more nuanced way than the folks who claim a 90% success rate.  Her take: \"Out of ten kids with autism, it might work for one or two.\"  But for the people for whom it works, like herself, the improvement is a powerful change for the better.  (She also mentioned Omega 3s, and cutting sugar and carbs as well as going GFCF).My skeptical heart rejoiced to hear her lay into the \"rubbish on the Internet\"!  She directed people to PubMed, the database search tool from the National Library of Medicine that searches published articles in biomedical sciences.  (Librarian-ish note -- unless you're affiliated with a university, you'll mostly be able to get just citations and summaries of the articles.  But still.)She had high praise for the Temple Grandin HBO movie with Claire Danes.  She said that the movie succeeds in portraying how her visual thinking works.  As for the acting, \"Claire Danes became me in a way that was really weird!\"  (I gotta see this movie.  I usually don't miss having HBO at home, but this is one exception!)Temple had an interesting take on behavior and manners.  She has a hearty appreciation for how manners were taught when she grew up in the 1950s.  It makes sense to me that a well-defined system of rules would be appealing to a mind of a certain structure!  However, I've recently seen this used negatively in comments relating to a bloggy dust-up about how people see \"us\" (kids on the spectrum and their parents), as in: if Temple Grandin thinks that kids with autism should be taught 1950s manners, then it must be the parents' fault that they're acting out in public.  Which doesn't sit well with me, having just been party to a clean-up of fist-flung jello.  It's not that easy.  And I'm not sure that Temple was saying that it was.One final quote-nugget, which Temple offered in response to a question regarding trying to get appropriate services from a school district in a difficult situation.  \"Your project is for your son to be successful.\"  The corollary was that being right in fighting with the school was less important than being a clever negotiator, swallowing pride when prudent to get to a place that would better support the child's success.Our project is for our child to be successful.Yes.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed", "http://www.hbo.com/movies/temple-grandin/index.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/04/conference-report-part-2-temple-grandin.html", "title": "\nConference Report, Part 2: Temple Grandin\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 23, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the JoyFamily's favorite TV shows -- other than anything on the Food Network -- is the Discovery Channel's Mythbusters.  As their website describes it, the MYTHBUSTERS mix scientific method with gleeful curiosity and plain old-fashioned ingenuity to create their own signature style of explosive experimentation.What the show's five attractive but geeky mythbusting co-hosts do is take a pop-culture myth, often a common trope from movies or cartoons:  Can you really slip on a banana peel?  Is it truly possible to knock someone's socks off a la Charlie Brown on the pitcher's mound?  Then they plot out test-able hypotheses, generally involving a healthy dollop of physics and preferably involving either explosions or car crashes.  And then they perform the experiments, record and examine the results, and re-formulate for follow-up attempts.  Many shows end with a solemn-yet-gleeful declaration that \"This myth is... BUSTED!\"  Or in some cases, the myth is confirmed, but with caveats -- they were, for example, eventually able to knock the socks off a crash-test dummy, but it took a semi-truck to generate the appropriate impact!And it doesn't even feel like a science lesson, and is aimed to appeal to adults as well as kids.  Magnificent.  (JoyDad and I think that the co-hosts have THE BEST jobs!)Well, out there in the real world, scientific researchers actually do sometimes get to bust myths, though it's rarely so quick and flashy and explosive and definitive.There's been some fascinating reporting on the annual IMFAR conference, the International Meeting for Autism Research, coming out of the blog Left Brain/Right Brain these past few days.  Two presentations in particular had interesting myth-busting overtones.One of the studies took on the widely-quoted but poorly-sourced notion that the divorce rate for couples raising children with autism hovers around 80%.  A certain set of bloggers have suspected for some time that the rate is way overblown; I think I first read about the lack of a scientific source for the 80% figure on AutismVox.  The mythbusting study presented at IMFAR this weekend came out of the Kennedy Krieger institute in Baltimore.  Brian Freedman and his co-authors examined data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health and found, as reported at Left Brain/Right Brain,The weighted unadjusted percentage of children with ASD belonging to a family with two married biological or adoptive parents was 64%, as compared to 65.2% for children who do not have an ASD.In other words, the percentage of kiddos with ASD living in two-parent families is essentially the same as for kiddos without ASD.  In the absence of any evidence other than hearsay to support the 80% figure in the first place... this myth is BUSTED.It's important to have the record straight on this because when a child gets a diagnosis of ASD, it's an immense thing for parents to process.  Now imagine that when you're told that your child has autism, you're also told that the chances of your marriage breaking up are 4 out of 5.  As the lead author of the study put it, it's \"almost like getting a diagnosis of autism and a diagnosis of divorce at the same time.\"  Here's hoping that this study really does put the autism divorce rate myth out of its misery.I hadn't been aware that the divorce-rate study was underway, but had been tracking another study that was presented at IMFAR -- this one out of the University of Rochester, looking at the gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet for autism.  I blogged about this back in February when I and two fellow trainees presented on the GFCF diet in our LEND seminar.  The GFCF diet is a hot topic in autism treatment, with lots of families on board and claims of efficacy rates as high as 80 or 90 percent.The double-blinded, placebo-controlled study at the University of Rochester took on the difficult task of getting all the children in both study groups onto the same GFCF diet and similar behavioral treatment programs, and then gave one of the groups small amounts of gluten & casein in \"challenge snacks\" to see whether it would make a difference.  The children had been screened in advance for celiac disease and intolerances to wheat and dairy; it's already known that GFCF can help in those situations, but the study wanted to examine whether the diet \"worked\" when THE issue was autism.  The findings?  In the words of Susan Hyman, the principal investigator, It would have been wonderful for children with autism and their families if we found that the GFCF diet could really help, but this small study didn\u2019t show significant benefits.The tangled thicket of gastrointestinal issues and autism won't be solved by any single study.  The GFCF episode of Autism Mythbusters isn't over by a long shot.  But this study is an important piece of evidence on the -- dare I say -- \"busted\" side of the ledger.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters/", "http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters/", "http://www.autism-insar.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=79", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://blisstree.com/live/how-high-is-the-divorce-rate-among-autism-parents/", "http://www.nschdata.org/Content/Default.aspx", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/blogging-imfar-autism-and-divorce-debunked-among-others/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/gfcf-of-no-benefit/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/05/mythbusters.html", "title": "\nMythbusters\n"},

And no, it's not about how the one ice-dancing team got decked out in faux-aboriginal costumes and skated to music that included the didgeridoo.It's about Special Olympics and public health.One benefit of the Special Olympics program that I had not been aware of is the component that offers health screenings to the athletes.  In the 1990s, Special Olympics began compiling some alarming statistics based on the results of their screenings in their Healthy Athletes program.  They were finding uncorrected errors in vision (up to 85% of the athletes), and major oral health issues (68% of the athletes screened had gingivitis, 33% had at least one obvious dental decay).  They ended up referring some athletes directly to the emergency room for acute pain!Special Olympics commissioned a literature review through the Yale University School of Medicine, which reported in Dec. 2000 that compared to the general population, people with intellectual disabilities -- then called mental retardation -- have:Four times more preventable mortalityLess access to primary and specialty health care providers, including physicians and dentistsHigher rates of obesity, otitis media, asthma, cardiovascular disease, depression and other mental health conditions.A Special Hearing on Promoting Health for People with Mental Retardation was held in the spring of 2001 by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, and the Surgeon General called a conference on health disparities that December.  Health disparities for people with disabilities, developmental and otherwise, have thus been on the national radar for about a decade now.  There's a section in the national Healthy People 2010 goals that recognize the disparities, and the next round (Healthy People 2020) now includes draft goals like:Reduce the proportion of children and adolescents with disabilities who are reported to be sad, unhappy, or depressed. Increase the proportion of people with disabilities who report having access to health and wellness programs. Reduce the proportion of people with disabilities who report unmet need for assistive devices, service animals, technology services, and accessible technologies they need. One slide in the presentation that struck me in particular involved numbers coming out of Oregon in 2006 on health/behavior risk factors.  27.3% of the people with disabilities in the survey were smokers, as opposed to only 19.3% of people without disabilities.  30.1% of the people with disabilities had obesity issues, compared to only 17.9% of people without disabilities.Another slide came out of Ohio State University on what health-care providers were likely to talk about when seeing a patient with a disability.  Providers were more likely to ask about pain, stress, depression, work and hobbies.  They were less likely to discuss smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, mammograms, colorectal exams, or sexual activity. The class session was a teleconference, reaching multiple LEND programs across the country.  It was inspiring to be a part of a group of up-and-coming professionals who will be working with people with disabilities, discussing how one might incorporate awareness and progress on these issues into one's personal practice but also on a larger (leadership) scale.  I hasten to add that we did not manage to solve the world's problems in a single teleconference... but even just having the awareness among the LEND group was an important step.  I know that I'd never thought about this on a macro level.Micro level... keep advocating for your own child, and don't let the basic health stuff get too drowned out by the special needs.Macro level?  Whew.  Big issues.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/02/healthy-people-with-disabilities.html", "title": "\nHealthy People With Disabilities\n"},

It compels us to let go of focusing on dogged accomplishing and doing, and instead to simply be open and vulnerable to the mysteriously wonderful presence that is God-With-Us.The above quote was part of an e-mail message that stopped me in my tracks on November 22, a week before Advent.  The message came across the church mailing list from our pastor, inviting us to prepare our hearts for Advent, and introducing the season's worship theme: Seized By Wonder!The message included specific statements of invitation for each of the weeks of Advent, and said, \"If one of these statements of invitation reminds you of a story or some thoughts you'd like to share with the congregation, please contact a member of the committee...\"The statement of invitation for November 29 was \"Share the ways you see God here and now.\"  November 29.  One week away.  Sunday after Thanksgiving, a weekend of travel.  End-of-semester crunch.  Surely that message wasn't for me.But it was.I found myself in worship-committee conversations, and writing a reflection (which pretty much wrote itself) on the bus to work and in the car on the way to Thanksgiving celebrations.It was a strange paradox, that being open to being stopped in my tracks, and releasing the load of accomplishing & doing, entailed taking on one more accomplishing/doing task.  Yet who am I to argue with the Spirit?  Besides, I had been preparing for that reflection for over a year.

Instead, I've been writing about moments worth sharing.  Happenings that make me think.

God is here.Breakthrough moments of wonder = God sightings.It was a privilege to share some of these reflections with the congregation.My wish for you this new year -- and maybe it can count as a resolution for myself -- is that we pay attention to the moments of wonder in our lives, taking a few additional moments of contemplation and gratitude.May your \"sightings\" in 2010 be frequent and marvellous!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/12/god-sightings.html", "title": "\nGod Sightings\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 4, 2010", "body": "\nThis post is a cross-pollination between Barbara at TherExtras and JoyMama at Elvis Sightings \u2013- co-authored by two bloggers who have never met in person, but hope one day they will.  When we move ourselves our bodies are wired to feel that movement.  We humans have beautifully intricate wiring (nerves) connecting feeling (sensory) with movement (motor).  Some movement feels good.  And with that basic understanding, seeing children who repetitively moved in (sometimes unusual) ways, charter psychologists called this behavior self-stimulation.  Early in Barbara\u2019s career, therapists commonly shortened this to self-stim.  Currently, parents like JoyMama and others who encounter or engage in self-stim have learned to call these behaviors \u2018stimming\u2019.Stimming is part of the DSM definition of autism, though the definition does not use the word, perhaps because it is not technically-defined, nor even in the dictionary.  \"Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements).\"  However, one can receive an autism diagnosis without meeting this particular criterion -- and stimming is associated with other conditions as well.  Not everyone who stims has autism.Repetitive movement is important for learning -- a mantra of Barbara\u2019s if you read her blog regularly.  But stimming does not fit the \"important for learning\" category in the same way, and can actually impede learning.  Most educational/therapeutic references to stimming are made with negative overtones.Stimming is sometimes described in words like these:  unproductive, obsessive, obstructive, annoying, consuming.  These perceptions of stimming are common among people who are observing it, such as parents, educators, bystanders.In the autism community, some think that since stimming is part of the autism definition, reducing the stimming amounts to a reduction in the autism.  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), an educational technique intended to reduce autistic behavior, is associated with that approach.   But another list of descriptors implies a different perspective on stimming: pleasurable, centering, meditative, regulating, communing.  You are more likely to hear these from people who engage in stimming themselves.Within this second perspective stimming is viewed as similar to what neurotypical individuals do to calm or entertain themselves: thumb-twiddling, pencil-tapping, leg-jiggling, even knitting. Stimming as regulating activity is seen as beneficial for helping people \"keep it together,\" allowing them to block out negative or frightening input and keep from feeling overwhelmed.    One particularly thought-provoking insider-view comes from Amanda Baggs, an autistic self-advocate.  In the first few minutes of the video \"In My Language\" below, she shares some of her \"stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms,\" as the DSM would say.  The latter part of the video gives Amanda's own translation of the meaning of her movements, using a voice synthesizer (Amanda's means of speech).Families of children with autism struggle to find a balance between stimming and education.  How does stimming interface or interfere with learning?Does the behavior stand in the way of beneficial play? Learning is the work of childhood.  And stimming can indeed impede learning when it consumes the play-time and energy, or turns educational objects into stim-objects.  JoyMama and Barbara offer the following ideas... in two categories. (This is a brief listing.  To find out more, ask the professionals who work with your child.)  Reducing or preventing stimmingregular (daily is best) \u2018heavy work\u2019 or strenuous activity/exercise consultation with a psychiatrist to rule-out or treat co-morbid mental illness consultation with a neurologist to rule-out or treat co-morbid seizures structured lifestylediscovering and avoiding an individual's triggers for stimming (for example, Joy stims on ribbons and strings.  Her family sometimes \"disappears\" such objects when the focus needs to be elsewhere). Using stimming to benefit the person or enhance their lifestimming as reward-breaks between learning activitiesallowing some stim that can be done simultaneously with learning activity - maybe chewing a tube can help your child focus on a book or drawing  use stimming during learning-play -- place a stimmy-toy into a tunnel to crawl & retrieve, take turns with tossing/catching a stimmy-objectenter into the stimming-world together -- letting gravel run between your fingers and toes feels good!Therapists have a saying that if you take away one stimming preference, another will develop in its place.  Complete elimination of a stimming habit might be unrealistic, and not even desirable, depending on what function the stimming serves.  Stimming-related goals, like all goals, are best seen in the context of the whole child. Re-evaluate on a regular basis whether you are satisfied with the progress of your child or the effectiveness of the therapeutic and educational methods being used. Update September 2010: There's an excellent insider-perspective post at Reports from a Resident Alien about stimming and its purposes and the sensory channels it affects.Would you share approaches you have used to prevent or incorporate stimming in the life of your child?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.therextras.com/", "http://theautisminfo.com/autism_dsm_definition.htm", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S2o8WwrbThI/AAAAAAAAAc8/YPBHFRNrFjc/s1600-h/stimmy-ribbon.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S2o9FjDCXEI/AAAAAAAAAdE/tnLr_suVmyw/s1600-h/stimmy-gravel.jpg", "http://chaoticidealism.livejournal.com/83950.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/02/stim-sense.html", "title": "\nStim-Sense\n"},

He was speaking in long, complex, difficult-to-understand constructions.Joy was with him, maybe on his lap or next to him.  And she was translating for him.  He'd say some long wordy something, and then she'd say just a few simple words that distilled it down and made it understandable.My friend said that in the dream she was motioning to me, \"JoyMama, come see this, did you know that she could DO this?!\"Joy already helps me understand some things that I might never have come to on my own -- about difference, about acceptance, about hope, about God working in the world.I fully expect that she will continue to be an intermediary to my understanding, and the understanding of others around her.

Just when I say I've never done one of these seven-things-about-yourself memes, I get tagged honored with the Stylish Blogger award, courtesy of my splendid recently-acquainted bloggy friend Professor Mother.The rules of this award-game are that the recipient post seven things about herself and then pass the award on to three other stylish bloggers.  I've been ridiculously non-compliant with meme-awards in the past, but I actually feel like doing the seven-things part this time, so here goes:1)  My three words for 2011 are: active, tidy, relax.  (See Both Hands and a Flashlight for more about the three-words thing.)2)  On the \"active\" front, I've actually biked to work a couple of times this week, courtesy of a major snow-melt between Christmas and New Years that left the paths clean.  Nine degrees Fahrenheit on the way there Wednesday morning, snowing on the way back.  Woohoo!3)  \"Tidy\" applies to things like the filing of papers and the more deliberate tracking and attending to loose ends in various aspects of my life.  It does not, however, mean that I'm going to buy back into the societal fetish that says grown women's legs need to be baby-smooth-depilated, either by razor or other means.  Because I gave that up in 1987.  (Got me a career and a JoyDad anyway.  Heh.)4)  In 1987 I was studying in Germany for a semester.  The other additional country I've lived in, besides the US, was Botswana, when I was a pre-schooler and my parents were on a two-year assignment with Mennonite Central Committee.5)  JoyDad and I went non-traditional when it came to engagement rings.  Instead of spending money we didn't have for sparkly rocks from the mines of southern Africa, we bought each other ten-dollar sterling silver pinky-rings.  They seemed to work!  (Our wedding bands are gold and plain.)6) I read around 30 new books a year, not counting re-reads.  Some of my favorites from 2010 were The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and Playing the Enemy.7)  I re-read The Lord of the Rings about once every two years.  My first time through was in 8th grade.==========OK, there's my meme-fulfillment.  Here's where I break the rules -- like Jess (another of Professor Mother's awardees), I don't feel like figuring out whom to pass the award to.  So I'm not going to do that part.

Hope you're up for some randomness, 'cause that's all you're getting today!What a whirlwind of a holiday weekend!  Much baking of pies Thursday morning, much gobbling and chattering Thursday evening at Auntie S's place.  Different lodgings both Friday and Saturday nights, several sets of family gatherings, whoo!I'm not going to see the movie \"Four Christmases.\"  Who needs to go to the theatre to experience multiple family holiday gatherings stacked one atop the other?Joy was a super little traveler.  She's so content to ride along in her carseat, especially if we toss her a toy now and then.  Rose actually demands more attention than Joy, can you believe?Thursday night we stayed over with Uncle Marathon & Auntie Save-the-Tatas.  They have a brand-new kitten that Rose just swooned over (the more so because I have allergies so she can't have a kitty of her own).  Joy was willing to give the kitty a pat or two, but she REALLY wanted to play with: the cat toys.  We came home with a toy which has a ball & jingle bell on top of a spring growing out of a stand.  I am not exaggerating when I say this toy had a catnip-like effect on Joy!!Our Friday visit was to my grandmother, who turned 100 last May.  Our visit happened to fall during her move from her retirement apartment across the street into an assisted-living apartment.  I want to be not-quite-ready to move into assisted-living when I'm 100...  I hope that her new place, bright and sparkling, begins to feel homelike soon.Grandma took us out to dinner Friday night.  Joy drank from an open plastic-glass at the Old Country Buffet!  Without spilling a drop!  Two glasses of lemonade and was asking for more!Saturday we got to see Auntie RatM and Auntie Meerkat -- it had been a long time!  We got to take them to the park to play with the girls.  Rose swirled herself down the firepole over and over, with great drama.  Joy let me guide her in climbing up a somewhat wobbly web-like climber up to the slide platform.  What a trooper.More Joy awesomeness, quoting from her OT's update last week: \"This kiddo is pretty amazing at motor planning those activities which she's motivated for!  ...  When [Joy] wants something she's crafty, smart, clever, strong, and fairly precise with her movements.  What a great kid!\"When I read an update like that, it's no wonder I get confused about labels.  In a good way, though.I wonder how many blogposts are waiting for me in my Google Reader?

Finding the deck-steps to be a solid hill of snow, Joy attempted one step... and then turned to me and ASKED FOR HELP!!  (OK, so she used the \"more\" sign.

Mid-way through her evening therapy session last Wednesday, poor Joy suddenly began to empty the contents of her stomach onto the dining room floor.  I could not believe that one little body could hold so much!  We ended the session, bathed the girl, started the laundry, and then had two more rounds of heaving as the evening went on.  She slept through the night, but there was no way that we were going to be able to go with the Thursday as planned.  JoyDad & I were both scheduled to work, but decided to split the day at home to take care of Joy.So who did we need to contact?1) Lynda, Joy's regular daycare lady, to let her know of the incident and ask if Joy was the only one.  (She wasn't - the bug had been going 'round the daycare, but at least we learned that the barfing was short-lived and the recovery was only about a day.)2) The babysitter for the day, the new one we've hired to come into our home on Thursdays to supervise the Thursday therapies, thus shaking loose the hours I need to do my LEND leadership training program this semester.3) Four regular baristas (therapists), plus a supervisor and a trainee.4) The neighbor who walks Rose home from school, to let her know to call our home number and not try the babysitter's cell if they decided to play at the park on the way home.5) My workplace.6) JoyDad's workplace.7) The evening babysitter - who actually got to us first because she wasn't feeling well herself!

She figured them out herself.  At first she was going over on her back with a big kaboom (and putting her hands down was optional, yikes!) but now she's got the trick with the hands and at least a certain degree of tucking and rolling.Now if only the roll would start in the correct locations!  She's got a good one going in the photo, but she's just as likely to start it going in the opposite direction, and slam into that little window ledge as she goes over.  Oww.She's also doing her tricks on the living room furniture.  Imagine walking up to a glider rocker, putting your head down and somersaulting INTO the rocker.  Such that your back and legs whomp up into the back of the chair, knocking the whole operation over onto the hardwood floor.  Then there's doing the somersault on the couch, or starting on the couch and flipping to the floor....She's also got the trick of the gymnastic mount onto the dining room table.  No need to climb on chairs anymore.  She just puts her hands on the table, makes a little jump so she's supported on straight arms, and climbs from there.  And then jumps off, in a glorious flying leap.I suppose we ought to put her in a gymnastics class (maybe she could wear a velvet leotard...)  Alas, there's no Special Olympics gymnastic team for her at this point.  There's a gymnastics class for special-needs kids at a very cool facility not too far away, but time and dinero are both in pretty short supply at the moment.A gymnastics class also wouldn't resolve the aspect of Joy's delight in making us react (and we HAVE to react, for safety reasons).  Between her seeking of the reaction plus the sensory bang, it all adds up to a lot of scrambling for the parents and the baristas.  And she's so fast.Has anyone else got a furniture gymnast?

As I was looking through past posts in search of the top ten, I discovered a duplicate draft post that was being counted in my total.  Once I deleted it, I was down to 198.  This post is 199.  Next one will be 200.  So, we're still on the edge of 200.  Ooops.  The good news is, there's still time to nominate a favorite post for inclusion in the top ten!Also on the edge (and I am obviously brazenly stealing this edge-concept) is what's up with me for this next year.  I have the potential opportunity to take a fantastic one-year university program, as a parent of a child with special needs, that focuses on special-needs systems and family services, and entails intensive mentoring and leadership training and much additional coolness.  It's designed to be about a 10-hour commitment per week.  But first I have to get accepted, then I have to scrounge an extra day of childcare for Joy, then I have to re-arrange my life to accommodate this huge additional spinning plate (which right now looks like a huge serving-platter complete with Thanksgiving turkey).  I'm thrilled, apprehensive, excited, busting at the seams with ideas -- wish me luck, y'all!If that all weren't edgy enough, I've been thinking about Joy and physical edges lately.  She has long been one to climb and teeter, generally scaring the wits out of whomever witnesses it.  An early teetering favorite was the low windowsill in our living room (just barely visible in her somersaulting photo).  One of her first occupational therapists suggested that the urge to get off-balance may be, for Joy, a way of feeling where she is in her skin, establishing where she is in space.  Yikes!These edges were much scarier when Joy was having daily seizures.  You'd think we'd have been familiar faces at the local emergency room.  That's not how it has worked out, though Joy's legs often have more bumps and bruises than we'd like to see.  Amazingly enough, Joy seems to have developed rather a remarkable sense for how high is too high, how teetery is too teetery.  Even though she scares us, her sense of the edge is actually pretty sound.I've been seeing more and more evidence of this lately at parks this summer.  She flings herself happily off of playground equipment ledges up to about 4 feet high, but avoids the edge when it's any higher.  She has also been gaining confidence in climbing, not only going up standard ladders and ladder-grids, but also going up the kinds of climbers that look like string-art, with cables at odd angles, and climbing structures that are made of curves instead of straight edges.  It's some pretty complex motor-planning that this girl has got going on.Well, here we are at the edge of the school year, the edge of grade 2 for Rose, the edge of a new schedule for Joy, the edge of a new opportunity for me, the edge of 200 for the posts.Geronimo-o-o-o-o-o!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://mamaedge.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/08/on-edge-of-200-and-otherwise.html", "title": "\nOn the Edge (of 200 and otherwise)\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2009", "body": "\nWe returned yesterday from our traditional bit of October insanity -- a three-day weekend getaway to the northwoods of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where JoyDad's family has a couple of rustic cabins on a little lake in the back of the beyond.  The October trip lets us help take care of closing down the property for the winter, taking the boat and pier out, this time with both JoyDad's brothers and father.  It's about seven hours in the car each way, this three-day weekend of ours, for the privilege of enjoying woodstove heating, cold water from a pump, cold outhouse.  Plus this year, we'd been watching the forecast with dismay, as the Weather Channel hour-by-hour showed a greater than forty percent chance of rain for every hour of the dang weekend!  I had visions of being cooped up in the cold cabins the entire time with the rain pouring down, trying to entertain two damp-bored-miserable kids.Shouldn't have worried.  Without rain, you don't get this:And in fact, the rain was on and off, more off than on really.  We got to go out in the boat, and Rose & I managed a (success-free) fishing run with the uncles.  And while we were out fishing, one of the eagles that nests in the tree on the left of the above photo sailed about overhead, bringing branches to shore up the nest for the winter! I went for a fine walk in the woods with Rose, and we took another one as a family, without even getting Joy too muddy!  Her favorite stim for the weekend was long-stemmed grasses, so she did a lot of dropping to the ground in order to pick the next one.  Joy also managed to escape her father's clutches and go walking into the lake at one point, while her sister was playing on the pier.  Lake-walk and all, Joy was a happy camper pretty much the whole time.  I think she was relieved at the break from the incessant therapy that she gets subjected to at home.  We did a lot of playing on the screen porch during the drippy-er bits of the weekend, and she let me take a whole sequence of photos where she looked right at me and did this:And this:I blew bubbles upon bubbles for Joy to pursue and pop, there on the screen porch.  Rose got into the action too:The two sisters enjoyed one another a lot this weekend:So now it's back to reality, back to a whole lotta laundry, back to the therapy schedule and work and studies (which I ignored totally while up at the lake).What a priceless getaway, though.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2009", "body": "\nNothing says \"summer\" like the county fair!  (Even if the temperature is in the 60s and you have to wear sweatshirts.)When we told Joy's Saturday-afternoon barista that we were going to the fair that evening, she wondered how we'd do it.  Do you use Joy's monkey-backback? she asked?  Nope, we just do a whole lot of firm hand-holding.  If I'm remembering right, we've taken Joy to the fair every year of her life.  First time out, she was 2 months old and napped through it all in a Baby Bjorn carrier!  Then she was in stroller, then on her own feet -- with her hand in a firm, firm grasp.Joy really did great this year.  We decided to make something of a game of trying not to break the bank at this year's fair, which meant that the over-priced creaky midway rides that we can never predict which girl (if either) will enjoy -- were out.  Instead we started with a lumberjack show.  Except it was lumberJILLs, lean tall powerful women throwing axes and chopping and sawing and log-rolling.  And wielding immense chainsaws that were deliberately hugely-loud.  Our young sensory-sensitive lass had a rather rough time of it.  Yes, that would be our \"neurotypical\" Rose, who spent most of the show with her fingers in her ears.  She objected to the chainsaws, and the loud announcer, and the cheering crowd.  But fortunately she stuck with us, and ended up very much enjoying the log-rolling competition, especially when the women did a little kick-splash maneuver to distract their competitor with a spray of water!Joy, meanwhile, was pretty calm about being corralled for the show.  We got off to a less-than-ideal start when I was sitting her on my lap, and then suddenly felt something warm and wet on my jeans.  Those darn MA generic diapers!  But Joy was wearing pants that didn't show the spot, and I decided to be bad-mama and just let us both air-dry.  Later in the show, she became fascinated with the long dyed-red tresses of a generously-proportioned woman sitting in front of us.  I was not quick enough to keep her from reaching out and exploring a handful of hair, but fortunately she didn't pull, and the woman was sweet and took it as flattery.  In fact, she turned around several times in the following minutes to twinkle and flirt with Joy, who responded with smiles and giggles.After the show, we headed into an exhibition hall where there was a big bouncy-house obstacle course freebie for the kiddies.  Rose tackled it with abandon, rope-climbing and all:Joy was less convinced.  She was willing to go into the initial tunnel, and Rose helped her get past the first obstacle.  But then she declined to go further, and we eventually had to commission Rose to help her back out.  I think if it hadn't been for the crush of other kids, and if we could have gone in to coax her along, she'd have conquered it.Next was a petting-zoo area for baby farm animals: We had to help Joy with the petting, and work hard to keep her from chowing on the wood-shavings (ew.)  Rose enjoyed the baby animals a lot, though.Then we all went back outside to shiver over and share a massive four-dollar serving of cookies-n-cream ice cream, and then the traditional big splurge: the pony ride!Those poor sad little ponies, circling under their little tent!  But the girls were so happy to get their rides, and we didn't have to wait in line at all.  In fact, we were the only ones in the circle for our turn, a pleasant chance.Then it was off to see some of the competition animals, bunnies and cattle.  For some reason Joy kept wanting to do a kick-boxing maneuver and get her foot up to the level of the bunny-cages, so we didn't take her down all the aisles that Rose went down!  It was a sign that the evening was drawing to a close.I wonder how next year's fair will be.  It's a new adventure every time.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4532497", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmWws-X1jvI/AAAAAAAAAUw/rGFF-M4ygXI/s1600-h/fairclimb.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmWxA5U8zdI/AAAAAAAAAU4/Mx43fboQW4c/s1600-h/fair-bounce.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmWxlAU1nLI/AAAAAAAAAVA/VsyAuSTFwhA/s1600-h/fair-ducky.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmWyJvtHVBI/AAAAAAAAAVI/UhGuA7cLWjw/s1600-h/fairponies.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/07/scenes-from-county-fair.html", "title": "\nScenes from the County Fair\n"},

She's been signing it for food, bubble machine, swinging, all sorts of goodies and activities.  Way to go, girl!Rose wants more too.  More time playing with Mama.Mama wants more too.  More independence on the part of Rose, especially during handbell concert season.Sunday's concert went awesomely well.  I love it when we finish a piece and the audience gives a little gasp/sigh after the last note and before the applause...We debuted new royal-blue floor-length dresses for the show, most with plunging necklines, and managed not to have a single \"wardrobe malfunction\"!When Joy has a \"wardrobe malfunction\" it usually has to do with a leaky diaper.Why is it that Joy always seems to wake up in the wee small hours on Tuesday mornings, one of her busiest days of the week?I was up early today too, but it was intentional.  Got a nice pre-dawn run in.  Lots of birds and blossoms and bunnies out there.The strawberry patch is starting to bloom, now that JoyDad has fenced the bunnies out.  Can't wait till the garden we planted this weekend starts to sprout as well!Did you know that violets are edible?  Tastes kind of lettuce-like and makes a lovely unusual contrast to a salad of greens.  Rose has loved picking flowers for dinner.  Joy eats them on her plate, but hasn't figured out to pick them out of the yard to eat.

I've heard Joy trying out several of her babbly-sounds, and one of them was the long-absent \"ma-ma-ma\"... now granted, it had rather an air of complaint about it, and was obviously not directed at me because I'm not even in the room.  Still, it's in there.  And a good day for me to hear it!Another very cool Mother's Day tribute came from an unexpected source -- my sister-in-law Auntie Running-at-the-Mouth, who picked up a \"running mom\" meme and added some leisure-studies research findings and turned it into a lovely salute, both to her mother and to me.  Thanks so much, RatM!She mentions that I've got another 5K race coming up... I'd like to tell you about it, if I may.On May 30, I'm going to be running in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure.  As you probably know from the amazing pink-ribbon movement, this is a fund-raiser for breast-cancer research.  I know all too many people who have had to battle breast cancer themselves, some of them mom-related figures in my life but also friends, other in-laws, a college roommate, way too many.  The latest astonishing figure is that the lifetime breast cancer risk is one in eight women.I'd like to give my readers the chance to help this race count for as much as possible toward funds for breast cancer research and support...Please consider a visit to my fundraising page for this race and making a donation. [Update: event is over, link removed.  Thanks, all!]  There's no such thing as \"too small\" and the page doesn't display who gave how much, only a lovely total.  Making every step count for as much as possible!All good thoughts and prayers happily accepted too.  And even though my own mother's journey involved a different form of cancer (renal cell carcinoma), maybe this can be for her too in a way. In other news, I'm told that I've won a special Mother of the Year award.  You have to see this to believe it.  (Thanks, Rhemashope!)P.S.  I broke the 10-minute mile barrier on my 5K run yesterday, first time ever.

She stopped attempting to pull almost immediately, and started occasionally doing what I like to do with it... rub her hands all over it.  Not ideal at meals, but hey, clean-up is a breeze!I also like to kiss that darling fuzzy head.  Awwww.I think the new cut makes you focus more on her gorgeous features.  Like the long eye-lashes, and the glorious smile.We also noticed that the cut makes her look startlingly like a certain little boy in old home videos from Chicago in the 1960s.  Except it's not so much JoyDad.  It's his older brother, Uncle Marathon.  I'll have the family weigh in on this at Easter time, see if they see what JoyDad and I see.  Meanwhile, let me assure you all, there has been NO wife-swapping going on!!It was interesting taking Joy to church all shorn on Sunday evening.  We had her dressed in a gender-neutral orange long-sleeved T-shirt, and from behind she was easy to confuse with another little blond guy in her Sunday school class, though his \"buzz\" is not currently so extreme!Little-blond-guy's dad advised me that if we were going to maintain this hairstyle, the best bet for a sturdy effective trimmer would be to go to Farm & Fleet and get one from the animals section.  The one their family uses is marketed for dogs.  He said this tip came from a hairstylist who said the animal-coat trimmers are made by the same manufacturers as the salon trimmers for humans, but sold for a fraction of the cost.  Who knew?I was also reminded at the Sunday service that there are at least two adult women in the congregation who are currently sporting buzzcuts.  Joy is in stunning company there as well.  Finally, I'll leave you with this poem that was printed on the bulletin and used in the service.  It's called Walking Blessing, and reminds me of blogfriends who have been walking for a cause, like jesswilson and rhemashope.  It also resonates for the journey as a parent walking with a spectrum (rainbow) child.  Here 'tis:Walking Blessingby Jan L. RichardsonThat each step may be a sheddingThat you will let yourself become lostThat when it looks like you're going backwards you may be making progressThat progress is not the goal anywaybut presence to the feel of the path on your skin,to the way it reshapes you, in each place it makes contactto the way you cannot see it until the moment you have stepped out.Peace.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/have-soapbox-will-travel/", "http://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/04/05/mended/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/04/whats-buzz-tell-me-whats-happening.html", "title": "\nWhat's the Buzz, Tell Me What's Happening?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 27, 2009", "body": "\nThis Lenten season, our church has been doing a series called \"The Spectrum of Faith and Doubt.\"  Lots of reflection on the nature of faith, doubt, and the interaction and relationship between the two.  For me the most powerful part of the series has been the short reflections every week by members of the congregation that fall into the confessional genre; as in, confessions of faith. And confessions of shattering struggles with doubt as well.  I was struck by something that was said last Sunday, questioning the use of spectrum imagery for faith and doubt.  The imagery somehow implies that the two fall on opposite ends of some kind of Likert scale (e.g., 5=very good, 1=very bad) rather than the complex interaction and co-existence that is perhaps more common to most people's experience.It reminds me of a similar pitfall in the use of spectrum imagery for autism, as if we could line people up \"on the spectrum\" in order of high-functioning to low-functioning, long wavelength to short wavelength, (very good to very bad?)  Ummm.  Not particularly helpful, to state it mildly.Some challenges are surely more profound and disturbing than others.  There have been some sobering stories echoing through the blogosphere lately.  The perfect metaphor, both for autism and for faith, would capture that.  Ultraviolet rays can cause skin cancer... look right into the sun too long and you'll burn out your retinas... On the other hand, which color is the more beautiful, red or violet or something in between?  What's the 5, what's the 1, and to what extent must it matter so much?  Which person is less a valued and beloved child of God, the one in a place of confident faith or the one eaten to shreds by doubt?  The \"low-functioning\" or \"high-functioning\" autist?I think the beauty of the rainbow inherent in the spectrum imagery has a lot going for it, not least the symbolism of the rainbow in the book of Genesis:And God said, \"This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.\"  Genesis 9:12-13Photo credit listentoreason under CreativeCommons license.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/growing_up_bigger_but_violent", "http://farm1.static.flickr.com/78/189639434_fe2c424560.jpg?v=0", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/charlestilford/", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/spectrum-of-faith-and-doubt.html", "title": "\nSpectrum of Faith and Doubt\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 24, 2009", "body": "\nOK, I got some of the leftovers off my plate. Drew up a press kit page for the handbells web site, revised a document regarding Joy's strengths and our ongoing concerns for her upcoming IEP, and (this is a big one) got the files sent to the printer for the book of my late mother's autobiographical writings that I've been working on editing.Now I can write about the weekend.Our big event this weekend was our church's annual winter retreat. Every February we gather at a retreat center by a state park about an hour's drive from here for a weekend of fellowship and a Sunday morning worship service. There are games, there are crafts, there are communally-prepared meals, there's a talent show, there's sledding and skiing and hiking. It's a wonderful time.February 2008 (i.e. last year's) retreat was a disaster as far as Joy was concerned. She was still slumping from a big regression that had started that Christmas, which stole her language and affected her behavior. She was having several knock-down seizures a day, each of which took an hour of intense comforting to recover from. In retrospect, we think there may have been a virus involved too somewhere along the line. At any rate, we took her to retreat anyway, and she just got more and more miserable as we went. In between seizures she went tearing around the center fussing and leaving a trail of destruction. We were hoping that naptime would be at least a break, but instead of napping or playing quietly, she stood up in her tented pack-n-play and screamed bloodly murder. For ages, with no sign of stopping. Finally JoyDad took her home. I stayed at the retreat with Rose, exhausted and wrung out like a limp washrag. It was a hard time.This year was a huge contrast.Touch wood, y'all, but Joy hasn't had a knock-down seizure since mid-September. That was the first major thing. Second, she did not have the Christmas regression. Third, her boundaries have improved and she's more willing to hang out quietly on my lap while something else is going on. Fourth, her mood is happier on the whole.With this background, I was willing to even take the girls to retreat solo on Saturday morning. (JoyDad came up later that afternoon; he had a memorial service to attend at noon.) Joy was contented throughout the slightly nerve-wracking trip as the snow was falling pretty hard. When we arrived, we had a friend all lined up to watch Joy while I unpacked the car. Joy hung nicely with me through the next event, which was a group game involving speed-singing of hymns and competitive reading of Bible verses all full of unpronounceable names. Much hilarity!Since Joy has been skipping naps most days anyway, we didn't even try to put her into her travel tent. Instead, another friend volunteered to watch her for a while so I could go participate in a book discussion. Funny enough, the book discussion actually was sparked by this humble blog, from when I posted back in November about Tracy Kidder's book Mountains Beyond Mountains. A friend from church who keeps up with Elvis Sightings was intrigued by my recommendation and organized a group of people to read the book and discuss it at retreat! It was a fine conversation, with thoughtful articulate people, several of whom had been to Haiti themselves and/or work in medical professions (the book deals with a charismatic physician whose primary work is among the poor in Haiti). All in the context of beautiful snow falling gently outside the huge windows.When I got back to Joy, her baby-sitter -- who has a grown son with a spectrum diagnosis in context of a different genetic condition than Joy's -- said they'd enjoyed their time together. \"She's very smart, you know,\" she told me. Bless her for seeing it!Our smart little girl kept it all together despite the lack of nap.  She even surprised us at dinner time by eating her entire helping of macaroni with her spoon, with no prompting from us!  She usually digs in with her fingers.But when are we going to get to the hula hoops, you ask? Well, I'm glad you brought that up.I mentioned earlier that the retreat features a talent show.  This year, Rose decided that she wanted to do a hula hoop act.  So she and JoyDad concocted a number wherein JoyDad played Wipe Out on his electric guitar.  She has never taken a dance class, and I (not a dancer by any means) have been her only hula hoop teacher.  However, she has such a sense of rhythm and has done a bit of group dance routine stuff in gym.  And with those natural tools, she put together a wonderful piece where she shimmied and strutted back and forth with that hula hoop a-swirling, dropped to her knees and came back up repeatedly, and then let the hoop drop to her ankle and hopscotched it around with the other foot.  All in perfect time to the screaming guitar.The crowd went wild.Video of this amazing act does exist, but we've got some technical hurdles before we get it onto YouTube.  If you'd like me to e-mail you the link when we get it ready, say so in the comments or send me a message.But that wasn't all.  See, Rose decided to share her hula-hooping delight in another way.  She brought all seven of her hoops along, and made them available in the main gathering room for the use of all the retreat participants.  (I did promise that I'd replace any breakage.)  It was amazing how the hoops resonated with all ages and shapes of people.  From the short to the tall, from the curvy to the beanpole, from the toddlers to the highschoolers -- male and female both! -- to the highschoolers' parents, a huge range of folks got into the act.  The height of the hilarity happened after the post-talent-show ice cream feast, when JoyDad plugged his guitar back in and played music to hoop by: more Wipe Out, Johnny B. Goode, one song after another after another.  He played till he started to wear out the fingernail on his pick hand!Well, some of the attendees were joking that hula hooping might lead to... DANCING! (verboten among the more conservative Mennonites, but this crowd is pretty far out on the progressive end of the Menno spectrum, as it were.)  And after JoyDad unplugged, sure enough, out came a couple of iPods to plug into the sound system.  Line dancing!  Cotton Eye Joe!  Jump Around!  My fellow Mennos and I boogied till I think I strained every muscle in my body that hadn't already been hula-hooped out of whack.Then I played Boggle till midnight.  Which made 20 hours straight of wakefulness, seeing as how Rose had awakened me at 4 am Saturday morning to present me with one of her two front teeth which she had finally wiggled out. Then Joy woke up at 2:30 and started commenting loudly...  I'm afraid I don't remember much of the next morning's worship service, though they tell me I was physically present.  It was quite the night.I actually did make it to the regular evening worship on Sunday too, after everyone had headed home and sorted themselves out.  Rose surprised me during the sharing time part of our service (\"joys & concerns\").  She stood up on the chairs and declared loudly that she had a joy.  She wanted everyone to know she was so happy that people had so much fun with her hula hoops at retreat.There.  As JoyDad commented on my last post, this is probably the only blog on the Interwebz that combines hula hoops, dancing Mennonites, and screaming guitars!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH5WGWX4MPg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/hoop-dreams.html", "title": "\nHoop Dreams\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, February 19, 2009", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis SightingsThe hearing on AB15, a bill to require insurers in Wisconsin to cover autism treatments, is going on right now (morning of 2/19).  (Actually it's on the substitute amendment offered yesterday, Feb. 18, to bring the WI Assembly version in line with the WI Senate version, about which I blogged earlier this month and which sailed unanimously through committee and is now awaiting scheduling in the Senate).JoyDad is there to testify.  I reviewed his testimony early this morning -- it looked good, and much better thought out than my extemporaneous testimony on the same issue two years ago!  But I had Joy with me then, an advantage he doesn't have since she's getting a House Blend therapy session right now.  So maybe it all evens out.Good luck, JoyDad!  Will update later.Update as promised:Testimony is done!  Wow, marathon hearing.  JoyDad had to wait a long time to speak his piece, and the hearing went on for several hours after that.  Between 5 & 6 hours, maybe?  Which is good, because it means a lot of people showed up.  It appeared that they were all speaking in favor, which seems to be the pattern, though I only listened to parts of the hearing via streaming video.  I will post the link when they get the video back online. (UPDATE: WI Assembly Committee On Insurance hearing video on AB15 here.)  Anyway, the opposition doesn't show up, just turns in written testimony and thereby avoids meeting the passion of the parents face to face...JoyDad would have preferred to testify without having had to wait so long, getting more keyed up by the minute.  He says he tried to speak slowly, but went faster than he'd planned.  That's OK, they had to cut off other speakers who went too long!  One surprise was that JoyDad didn't get any questions from the legislators.  He'd been rather looking forward to going head-to-head with a certain Assemblyman, but the guy was out of the room at the time.In honor of JoyDad's efforts, I'm providing a link to an MP3 of a song by his band.The name of the song is Testify!  Not only is the title beautifully appropriate for the day's activities, it's also a fine running tempo for me.  As the lyrics say repeatedly, Woo-hoo-hoo!(If you'd care to buy the album, you may do so online at CD-Baby.  Thus endeth the advertising plug.)Further Update (March 5): The Autism Society of Wisconsin has announced that the Assembly Committee on Insurance will vote on AB15 on Thursday, March 12.  The measure is expected to pass, and would then be forwarded back to the full Assembly for scheduling.Further Update (May 7): The committee vote was cancelled and has not been re-scheduled.  Someone on the committee is uncomfortable about something.  The holdout is probably a Democrat, because Democrats have the committee majority and the Democratic chair had indicated the votes were there to pass it, so a Republican's opposition wouldn't have held things up.  Rep. David Cullen of Milwaukee, Rep.Cullen@legis.wisconsin.gov, is chair of the committee.  A bit of citizen input to Rep. Cullen and other members of the Assembly Committee on Insurance would be apropos!And yet a Further Update (May 14) -- According to Wisconsin Autism Insurance Now, the autism insurance bill has been referred to the Joint Committee on Finance (which I think means that it's back out of the hands of the Assembly Committee on Insurance, so Rep. Ziegelbauer's misplaced concerns will no longer be the determining factor...)  The site goes on to say, \"We have been told by leaders in both houses that the bill will be considered in the context of the state budget -\u2013 either included in the state budget or accounted for and considered immediately after the state budget.\"Updates R Us (May 29) -- The Joint Finance Committee last night passed Motion 700, an omnibus set of budget provisions that includes the autism measure (on pages 20-22).  This will now go back to both the WI Assembly and Senate as part of the budget bill, no longer as AB15/SB3.  With the time-pressure to get the budget through, and as a tiny part of a much larger whole, and with the support of the leadership of both houses plus the governor, it would be a whole lot harder to kill at this point.  Apparently nobody even TRIED to kill it last night, having bigger fish to fry -- but all of the minority party objections were over-ridden along party lines anyway.  I've made this all into a separate post too, but will continue to update here so it's all in one place for my Google visitors (welcome!)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/AB15hst.html", "mms://71.87.25.133/com/com_090219_asm_ins_1.wmv", "http://www.juhnke.com/mike/mp3s/Tangy/Testify.mp3", "http://cdbaby.com/cd/tangy2", "mailto:Rep.Cullen@legis.wisconsin.gov", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/W3ASP/CommPages/IndividualCommittee.aspx?committee=Insurance&house=Assembly", "http://www.autisminsurancenow.org/", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/assembly/asm25/news/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/wi-assembly-hearing-on-2009-autism.html", "title": "\nWI Assembly Hearing on 2009 Autism Insurance Bill AB15\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 5, 2010", "body": "\nWe're back from a full Easter long-weekend.  Filled it full ourselves, by taking on a trip to my dad's place in Kansas, a 12-hour drive from here.I'd like to say that Joy was a dream, pleasant and cooperative and at her most charming and communicative the entire time!The truth, of course, is considerably more mixed than that.As I look back at my past few Joy-posts, I've been doing a lot of accentuating the positive.  Which is great, important, uplifting! but quite a bit less than the whole picture.  Blended in with the increased vocalizations and the group hugs have been a short fuse, a renewed spate of toy-throwing and biting (self and others), a powerful unwillingness to let herself be properly cleaned during a messy diaper change.Those unwillingnesses ramped up sharply for our Kansas trip.  We thought we'd have a pleasant stop at McDonalds en route, but she threw food and refused to eat anything more than a couple of fries.  We struggled with getting liquids into her the entire trip, resulting in the unfortunate digestive effects that occur when one doesn't drink just quite enough.  Still haven't gotten any milk into her in the last five days.  Soda and juice, can you believe.  Yikes.She flung the glasses off my face several times.  I lost a handful of (increasingly gray) hair to her fist.  At one point at Easter dinner she'd been happily eating a serving of jello salad with carrots, and then before we could blink, multiple fistsful of orange jello went flying all over the table.  In front of ALL the relatives.  Sigh.And yet!Her grandparents were so thoughtful and kind as we planned several days' worth of visit activities.  Grandma came up with a musuem to visit, called the Museum of World Treasures, with an eclectic collection for Rose and her cousin to peruse and a big upstairs playroom with an indoor bouncy castle where Joy could jump to her heart's content!  I even got to sneak out and see a couple of the exhibits... and had an Elvis Sighting! a silk scarf signed by Elvis himself.  How could you top that?Another day we went to the zoo.  Joy immediately wanted to climb over a fence and play in the water with the flamingos, and couldn't get over her disappointment that it wasn't allowed... until Grandma rented a sturdy stroller that gave her a chance to be wheeled around and calm down.  We had a resounding success with feeding the goats!  Notice how the initial hand-over-hand support faded out to nothing:Joy rewarded Grandma with unsolicited kisses on their front porch swing.  And Grandpa made a most excellent discovery that Joy liked to play in the back seat of their parked Prius!  Safe, enclosed, a fine distraction.It had been years since we made this particular visit -- since 2006, to be exact.  We packed in a lot of family into the few days, including my brother (Uncle Schnirelmann) and sister-in-law, several of my uncles and aunts and cousins, step-sister & brother-in-law and their three daughters (the youngest of whom is not much older than Rose).  I felt a little bad that I didn't even try to contact any of my childhood friends, but then again, I didn't even end up getting to talk much with all the relatives.Autism Awareness Day (April 2) came and went during our travels.  I didn't have anything profound or coherent to say.  But I'd like to share a set of posts from Both Hands and a Flashlight for their insights on autism awareness for different audiences:Be Aware -- For Families and FriendsBe Aware -- For ParentsBe Aware -- For EveryoneAnd I think that, for this post, we are about atTHE END \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S7ptqj48xEI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/K9GdLhNAmqI/s1600/goat2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S7ptkFUSa2I/AAAAAAAAAeI/b0J2sLzMGvs/s1600/goat3.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S7ptaOHp2cI/AAAAAAAAAeA/6BJ7J4xP5Dk/s1600/goat5.jpg", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2010/04/02/be-aware-for-families-and-friends/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2010/04/02/be-aware-for-parents/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2010/04/02/be-aware-for-everyone/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S7ptPR8KnGI/AAAAAAAAAd4/hoYez6gt-ZU/s1600/the-end.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/04/cross-country.html", "title": "\nCross Country\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 30, 2008", "body": "\nPain is an interesting sensation.  Nobody likes it -- most of us medicate or meditate it away when we can -- but it serves a mightily important function.Without it, we might not know that something is wrong.Joy's pain responses are... unusual, to say the least.  I've mentioned it a couple of times on the blog, like when she was going through the phase of biting herself.  It's not that she doesn't feel pain at all -- she yelps when she gets her shots, or when she runs into something hard, or when she gave herself a big chomp.  But it's generally an itty-bitty fuss.  Things that would send Rose into an hour-long, drama-queen tailspin, Joy stops reacting to in seconds.There are definite advantages to this!  It means that I can operate on splinters (and she got a lot of 'em this summer) with scarcely a yell or thrash.  It means that she can take a fall and jump right back up with no down-time for fuss-and-comfort.This past week or so, the pain thing has come to my attention again.  Joy got an infection around the nail of one of her big toes, possibly an ingrown toenail kind of thing.  I've had those before, and was a total wuss about it.  Noticed it every step I took, moaned and whined and complained.Joy jumped on hers.  Repeatedly, joyfully.  Without a flinch.The only signs I had that it was bothering her at all were a day of picking at her big toenails (and that was equal-opportunity, she played with both feet), and that she didn't really want me to spend too much time examining the owie-foot.  Which was clever of her, because I did end up poking at it on two different occasions to let the corruption out.  Not that she fussed about having it lanced, mind you!I was on the edge of taking her to the doctor about it.  It's just hard to know when you don't have the usual cues.  If the red had spread any further, I would have called the clinic.  But it turned back around, and is healing up nicely now.See, there's the scary thing.  It's hard to know, when you don't have the usual cues.  I've missed splinters on her before, until they got red and angry enough to catch my attention.  And when the pain reactions are unusual and the words are few,  how does one evaluate potential ear infections?  Toothache?  Tummy trouble?  Hairline fractures?I've heard it dissed as a myth that people with autism don't feel pain.  Certainly I can see the potential for damage and abuse, if that's used as an excuse to ignore people's needs, either physical or emotional.On the other hand, here we are with our n of 1.  And by my best observation, Joy's pain tolerance is incredible.I can at least hope that, on balance, her unique relationship with pain will be a blessing for her.I'd wish for my faithful readers that you'll be feelin' no pain as 2008 rolls into 2009, but that might be taken as a license to... overindulge... and I wouldn't be a party to that sort of behavior!!  We'll be rockin' the fizzy juice in our household, I can tell you right now.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/feelin-no-pain.html", "title": "\nFeelin' No Pain\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 5, 2009", "body": "\nI think we've got enough layers in place for this to make some sense.Besides, we had rather an amazing session with Joy's Tuesday-afternoon barista, that I'd like to share.This was a 3pm-5pm afternoon session; the House Blend sessions are two hours long, minus 15 minutes at the end for record-keeping.We have a consistent routine to begin and end the sessions, something that started all the way back with one of Joy's first Birth-to-Three therapists in 2006.  At the beginning of the session comes a song to the tune of \"Goodnight, Ladies\" that goes:Hello Joy,Hello Joy,Hello Joy,It's time for us to play!At the end of the session comes a song with three verses (I don't know a name for the tune): one verse for clapping hands, one for stomping feet, one for waving bye-bye.  We have tiny reminder-notes taped to the outside and inside of the front door to help make sure that the songs happen.The timing of the afternoon sessions is such that it generally starts with snack.Joy has become a pro at yanking and handing over the photo cards.  In fact, there was one snack over the weekend where we wanted to serve her something that wasn't on the photos, so we didn't bring the book out, and she was mildly cranky at not having her useful tool available!  (She wasn't upset enough to refuse the tortilla chips... But I digress).So after a suitable run of repeated photo requests for small servings of bunny-cracker and apple and milk, it was over to the living room for some jumps and pillow-squishes.  I think that's all they had time for before our playdate guests arrived!Since I have to be at home for these afternoon sessions, I'm no longer available to pick Rose up from school.  Instead she comes home with neighborhood friends, a lovely family with a Rose-aged daughter and a 3-year-old son.  Wonder of wonders, the mom is an early-childhood therapist (ST) herself and \"gets\" our situation without all the effort of edu-ma-cating on my part.Joy's playdate was with the son.  We'll call him J-Cat, short for Jellicle Cat because he is currently fascinated with the musical Cats. I could totally see him as Mr. Mistoffelees in the 2030 Broadway-revival...As soon as boots and snowpants were shed, Rose and her pal disappeared into a back room, and J-Cat and his mom came to join Joy in the livingroom.  J-Cat gravitated to a bag full of soft-blocks, so that became the first game.  The barista held Joy between her legs, J-Cat sat between his mom's legs, and they took turns trying to toss a soft-block to the other.  We used short verbal cues for things like \"Joy's turn!\"  \"Catch!\"  \"Ready, set...\" (wait for Joy to maybe chime in...) \"GO!\"  And lots of encouragement & cheering & praise.  Joy took a lot of support to play the game, but tolerated it -- like all things, up to a point.When Joy started protesting, we cajoled her into \"one more turn\" and then it was her turn to pick the next game.  The barista whipped a couple of toy photos onto the notebook, and Joy picked the Farm See-n-Say.  So then the See-n-Say passed back and forth, with each kid getting a turn to pick an animal and pull the lever.  \"Joy's turn!\"  \"Pull!\"\"Duck... quack, quack.\"\"OK, J-Cat's turn!\"\"Old McDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O!\"  (everybody claps along, Joy with support)Joy didn't say much, but she made definite selections when offered choices, and took good turns with pulling or pushing or whatever the toy was.  We played ring-stack, and blanket-pulls, and a train-toy, and another See-n-Say (an older bigger one with a stiffer lever, featuring baby zoo animals), and mini-trampoline jumping, and tunnel crawling.  Joy needed some jump-breaks from time to time, while J-Cat needed some breaks to sing and dance for us.After about an hour, both kids had hit their limit of such structured turn-taking.  J-Cat wanted to play an imaginative game with his mom involving play-food, not one of Joy's strengths.  So while they did that, somehow the very basic 3-hole shape-sorter came out as something for Joy & the barista to do.What happened next was magical.Joy pulled the lid off the shape-sorter, dumped the shapes, and started working to get the lid back on (accomplishing it with just a smidge of help.)  The barista handed her one of the shapes, and Joy went right to work trying to get it in (again with just minimal help).  Once she succeeded in getting the edges lined up correctly in the proper hole, she paused... and looked at the barista... and twinkled with anticipation.The barista built the anticipation with a rising tone of \"ahhh... ahhh...\" (Imagine winding your way up to a theatrical sneeze.)After teasing through several sounds of anticipation, Joy let the piece fall into the bucket, and began giggling like crazy, getting rewarded with praise and a tickle.They did this again... and again... and again.  They went through the entire bucketful two times, and then it was time for record keeping and the barista had to go fill in the binder.  But Joy wasn't done.  She went through another whole iteration of the bucket with me!  And then I got up to go check on Rose, and Joy still wasn't ready to be done.  She took the lid off once more all by herself, got out four pieces, got the lid back on, and ran the show all alone for two pieces' worth, looking all the way across the room to where I stood at the doorway, to make sure that I was watching and reacting appropriately.After that we had to say goodbye to our guests, sing the ByeBye song after the report had been written so the barista could get out the door, and get ready for dinner.There ya go.  How's that for a House Blend session?Right now we've got the playdate thing happening once a week.  The rest of the sessions at our house are generally one-on-one, though Rose inserts herself into the action from time to time.  Then twice a week we have sessions at Joy's daycare, with a very different dynamic among a roomful of peers (I'm never around to witness these since I'm always at work, but she's been able to do some neat things with support like join in on dress-up play.)  At this point we've got 12 sessions on the schedule per week.  It's not always this awesome, by a long shot, but it's fun to share a good one!By the way.  J-Cat's mom is very pleased with these playdates too (besides being a phenomenal partner as the action is taking place).  All this structured turn-taking practice is GREAT stuff for J-Cat as well as for Joy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SYmE2PdprRI/AAAAAAAAAOo/BguObfOmFls/s1600-h/snack-pecs.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SYrWFILICZI/AAAAAAAAAOw/Ed0UZffn2pU/s1600-h/see-n-say.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SYrWvsC8f_I/AAAAAAAAAPA/Ull3gJYcWUk/s1600-h/trampoline.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SYrWXO3QtfI/AAAAAAAAAO4/Rnl9hSaXTAo/s1600-h/shape-sorter.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/house-blend-session.html", "title": "\nA House Blend Session\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 11, 2009", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis Sightings\n===========\n\nHard to believe, but insurance coverage for autism is at the top of Wisconsin's 2009 legislative agenda!\n\nNote: I've updated on this issue as of February 7.\n\nWhen Joy was diagnosed with autism in December of 2006, we began to learn some unfortunate facts about developmental disability.  One particularly disturbing issue we began to hear about was how health insurance often treats autism.  As in... it generally doesn't, if the companies can at all help it.\n\nOne historic artifact is that health insurance has covered mental health issues only reluctantly, and to lesser degrees than physical health (as if they weren't related.)  Since autism is technically a mental-health diagnosis, that puts it on the shaky side of insurance.\n\nI should note here that our particular insurance policy has generally done very well for us.  We have not been denied any physical care for Joy on account of her autism.  We even got them to cover some speech and occupational therapy during the one summer when Joy was too old for the county's Birth-to-Three services, but the school district wouldn't pick her up because it wasn't September yet.  They also covered follow-up visits to the developmentalist/autism-specialist who made the initial diagnosis.  That was it for services directly aimed at the autism, however.  We haven't even really tried to get anything else covered.  And the horror stories are out there.  I also hate to think of what would happen if we ever had to switch insurances...\n\nFortunately, we discovered, there's been a movement afoot nationwide among the states, to highlight autism as a condition that MUST be covered.  There's a neat little map mash-up at Autism Bulletin that showed the situation in 2007; more states have signed autism-insurance mandates since then, including South Carolina whose legislature over-rode the governor's veto to make it so!  \n\nIn Wisconsin, the governor and the state Senate were supportive.  The motivator behind the proposed autism insurance legislation in Wisconsin was the state's intensive autism services, which Joy is receiving now.  (I've got a whole list of posts on that to come; stay tuned!)  Wisconsin has a lovely program via a Medicaid waiver that offers up to three years of intensive therapy for kids on the autism spectrum who are sufficiently disabled to qualify.  The budget dictates how many children get into the program each year, alas, and the waiting list is out of control.  Joy began receiving services a year and a half after her diagnosis, and you can believe we were not dragging our feet in trying to set it up! -- and the list has only grown since then.  The budget strategy went, if only insurance would pick up at least part of that expense, we could stretch the state dollars further, serve more children, whittle down that waiting list.  In the process, they could also help adults with autism who get slammed by insurance exclusions.\n\nSo we started advocating.  We got friends and family to write letters, I attended a rally at the state Capitol and talked to staff in various legislators' offices, I even testified at a state Senate committee hearing on the measure, and got quoted by a couple of news organizations!  Joy was so cute at the hearing.  I started my testimony with her on my lap, but she started telling the legislators \"bye-bye\" before I got 30 seconds into my spiel!\n\nWell, the measure dragged and dragged.  First they tried to put it into the budget, a long contentious process and we set the record for late state budgets that session.  Then it was introduced in the Senate, then the committee hearing, then the Assembly got a chance to drag its feet.  Rumor was that there were enough votes in the Assembly to pass it (it passed the Senate with ease), but the Assembly leadership was dead-set against bringing it to the floor.  Eventually they brought a substitute amendment that looked like it was going to throw state dollars at the waiting list, but that they knew wouldn't pass.  And the issue was officially dead for the session.  For timeline context, my testimony was in May 2007; the Assembly 11th-hour shenanigans that killed the bill for the session were in March 2008.\n\nSince then, there's been an election, and it has changed the playing field considerably.  Wisconsin now has the same party (Democrats) in the governorship and in the state Assembly and state Senate -- in other words, the Assembly majority changed hands.\n\nThe autism insurance bill was introduced in the state Senate this past week.  It's Senate Bill 3, right at the top of the legislative agenda.\n\nElections matter!!\n\nI do wonder whether the bill will make it through in its current form.  It's pretty broad right now -- it speaks to autism, Aspergers, and PDD-NOS, and defines the therapies to be covered this way:\n\nif the treatment is provided by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker who is certified or licensed to practice psychotherapy, a paraprofessional working under the supervision of any of those three types of providers, or a professional working under the supervision of an outpatient mental health clinic.\n\nDefinitely aimed at the ABA/DIR/etc. kinds of services that the Medicaid waiver covers.  The bill also does not have a dollar-cap written in, as far as I can tell, the way some do (some states make insurance plans provide up to $X of ABA in a year, for example).\n\nI think the loophole for our particular insurance and Joy's intensive services is going to be that the services Joy is receiving are not \"in-network.\"  I'm sure there will be plenty of other ways for insurance companies to limit their obligations.  The real details and limitations of whatever passes will have to be hammered out in a rule-making process led by the state's insurance commissioner, which could take up to a year in itself.  Meanwhile, who knows what will happen with the Obama administration's health-care initiatives!  The system could look very different in a couple of years.\n\nStill.  This insurance-coverage approach is one that we support, and it's exciting to see it moving forward.  After all, that's Wisconsin's motto: \"Forward.\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismbulletin.blogspot.com/2007/06/texas-governor-signs-autism-insurance.html", "http://autismbulletin.blogspot.com/2007/06/south-carolina-legislature-overrides.html", "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/31943199.html", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/SB-3.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/2009-wi-senate-bill-3.html", "title": "\n2009 WI Senate Bill 3\n"},

Joy was watching one of her Baby Crack Einstein videos, the Baby Noah one where they march out a whole bunch of animals two by two.\"Elephant,\" said the DVD.\"EH-uh-fuh,\" came the echo, with totally precise timing and inflection.I happened to be watching Joy at the moment, actually saw her lips move.  JoyDad whipped around, what was Rose doing imitating Baby Einstein?Looky there, we just had an elephant Elvis Sighting!  Never heard her do that one before, who knows when we'll hear it next![Aside: had a really weird Google search hit on this blog yesterday.  The search terms were \"does baby einstein cause seizures\".  Heh.

It was beautiful.  And JoyDad got to give his new snowblower a workout...And today we all went out sledding!Neither Joy nor Rose much wanted to go sledding last year.  Rose was timid, and Joy wouldn't stay in the sled, either for a pull-ride or to go down the hill.  This year, Rose belly-flops without a second thought, and Joy sticks to the sled like a little burr!  I sent Joy out into the backyard with a therapist and a sled the other day, and the therapist reported that Joy kept climbing into the sled to be pulled around.  \"Did she ditch out the side a lot?\" I asked.  \"No, she held on with her hands really well,\" came the report.Well, now I've seen it myself.JoyDad was able to give her a ride all the way from the parking lot to the hill.  I was able to tow her UP the hill after a ride.  Eventually we got brave and sent her down the hill on her own (I went first on a separate sled to be at the bottom to catch her.)You should have seen her face on the first run!  Sheer delight.I don't have Redheadmomma's chops at sledding photos but here's a shot that sets the scene:Joy is the sledder, JoyDad is the dark manly silhouette at the top against the gray clouds, Rose is at the right with a red sled.Happy winter, everybody!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SU0ym5JFTCI/AAAAAAAAALw/vZPftu1EyuY/s1600-h/babynoah.jpg", "http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2008/12/snow-day-zone.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SU00d98HTAI/AAAAAAAAAL4/T41dzX72JuM/s1600-h/snowcans.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SU01d9wFvmI/AAAAAAAAAMA/Z0IxlVo8TRg/s1600-h/joysledride.jpg", "http://redheadmomma.blogspot.com/2008/12/i-know-you-want-photos.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SU1Bxw8AC7I/AAAAAAAAAMI/unzP0lAN85k/s1600-h/joy-sleds.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/of-elephants-and-snow.html", "title": "\nOf Elephants and Snow\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 31, 2008", "body": "\nHappy last-few-hours-of-2008! It's been almost exactly half a year since I asked \"Is this thing on?\" as I introduced Joy to the blogosphere in my very first Elvis Sightings post.  Now here we are, six months and 100 posts later, with a conversation and a community well beyond what I had ever imagined.  As I said at the time,I'm writing mostly for myself, but also for family and friends already met, and also those not met yet. I hope there will be conversation, because I like conversation, but if not, that's OK too.Well, the conversation has been more than OK.  I owe a major debt to Maddy of Whitterer on Autism, for discovering Elvis Sightings and introducing me to her extensive readership.  (Niksmom and Osh followed me over from there, I believe.)  Bedtime ritual posts led me to jesswilson at diary of a mom, and Rhemashope at Autism in a Word, whose precious daughters have plenty in common with mine.  A discussion of the Scottish poet Robert Burns (who introduced, if not actually penned, the Auld Acquaintance poem that we all mumble through on New Year's Eve) opened the doors to Therextras and a lively ongoing conversation with Barbara/BRatK.  And then there's Mama Mara, always on the edge and also right around the corner.  And many more, and I hope many more yet to come!Then there are Joy's family members, both the commenters and the lurkers.  And the wider lurking community from church and friends far and near and goodness knows who else.  Thank you for keeping up with us, and all the prayers and well wishes.  Your support means the world to us.And then there are those who reach Elvis Sightings through search engines.  Some find topical tidbits (linear nevus sebaceous syndrome, for example, or craniosacral therapy).  Many others are in search of the other kind of Elvis sightings, or vampire encounters, or Santa Claus.  Or \"how bad is fizzy juice,\" or whether Handy Manny and Kelly really have something goin' on the side.  Welcome all -- even if you don't find what you expected here, we'll raise a glass in your honor anyway.  Elvis and Santa and yes, even Edward, can be real for you too, if you clap loudly enough or something...You know, my mother and her mother both had/have two lovely traditions that I never did manage to latch onto for myself: personal journaling and regular family letters.  Suddenly at the age of forty, by taking up Elvis Sightings, I've discovered a way to do aspects of both, with a lovely connected conversational twist.  It's been a treat so far!Finally, I must also acknowledge that I've actually only written, well, ninety-eight posts here.  The other two are courtesy of my co-blogger, co-parent, partner in marriage and all sorts of other shenanigans, JoyDad himself.So together we'll pour the fizzy juice not too long from now (it'll be midnight somewhere in the world, if not necessarily here) and raise a glass to auld acquaintance and new.

{"date": "Sunday, November 2, 2008", "body": "\nOK, I'd like to put in my order right now for the next five years' worth of Halloween weather.Make it just like that again, please!We had a nearly-70-degree day on Friday, clear and sunny, which meant that trick-or-treating weather was in the 50s.  The girls each wore a few thin layers of clothes under their costumes, which was plenty.  (For comparison's sake, sometimes the temperature has been below freezing.  It makes costuming... challenging!)Speaking of costumes, Rose went as Lucy the Diamond Fairy from the Rainbow Magic series of \"chapter books\" by Daisy Meadows.  Joy was Lucy's diamond, which meant wearing a big diamond-design of sticky-felt on a black sweatshirt, both chest and back.  (Yes, yes, I know, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and all that.  Just a little inside Beatles joke for the aging-hippie parents/grandparents of all those young chapter-book readers, I guess.)Joy didn't have much interest in holding her candy bucket, and she really would have preferred to hang out and stim in fallen leaves rather than go from door to door.  However, Rose and her friend were great about letting Joy take turns ringing the doorbell, and Joy also did do a good job of putting candy into her bucket.And now, the moment you've all been waiting for: the pumpkins!First, Joy's jack-o-lantern.  You'll remember that Rose had drawn a bunch of choices for her, and then gotten her to pick one.  Here's the one she picked:And here's how it turned out on a somewhat rounder pumpkin:Then we had Rose's pumpkin.  I had talked her down from wanting to carve \"Happy Halloween\" to just the word \"Boo!\"  However, not content with just a \"Boo!\" she went on to draw a creative face as well for me to carve.  Next came my Obama-lantern.  The stencil worked very nicely, although the next day I had to shore up the sunrise-bit with toothpicks, because the crosspieces were so slender.Finally there was JoyDad's contribution.  I think that if you're applying pumpkin-carving to the election, his comment may have been even more apropos than my own...Finally, here's the full lineup in all its glory:Hope you all had a happy Halloween!P.S.

{"date": "Monday, October 20, 2008", "body": "\nOn October 20th, 2007, Joy & Rose officially gained a new auntie by marriage.They also both got to be flower girls!Now, there's always a bit of risk entailed in the flower girl thing, and the younger, the riskier.  You never quite know how they're going to perform at the actual ceremony!  Having a three-year-old in the mix along with her five-year-old sister makes things more than a little unpredictable.When the three-year-old also has autism and epilepsy, all bets are off.The happy couple didn't waver as the planning process went along.  They were quite definite: they wanted both girls in their wedding, even though they of course knew about the autism and the epilepsy.  No, they didn't mind if I walked down the aisle next to Joy to keep things on track.  And whatever happened, they assured us, it would be cute and make a good story.Perhaps you can tell already that AuntLO was the ultimate UN-Bridezilla.  We had such fun together figuring out dresses for both girls to coordinate with her ivory & burgundy wedding color-scheme, while simultaneously trying not to break the bank.It's a rare late-October day in Chicago that comes in with a clear blue sky and over 70 degrees, but that's what they got for their wedding day on October 20 last year:We had a couple hours drive to get to the church, and Joy did have a pretty big seizure at one point along the way, but we were hopeful that she'd be feeling fairly well recovered by the time we got there and got her all dressed up.  (The Oct. 2007 trip to Chicago was one point in our data gathering that, up until this October, travel seemed to trigger seizures.)Then she had another sizable seizure just as we were walking up to the church.  Arghhh!  Despite her obvious unhappiness, we went ahead and got both girls dressed up in the church bathroom, and got their lovely little baskets of rose petals, and hoped for the best...And then while the processional music was playing and we were waiting our turn to walk in, she had another one.The poor kid.  I tried to walk in with her anyway, thinking that maybe she'd be so stunned that she'd just start moving forward and keep going.  Rose flower-girled like a pro, walking slowly and regally and strewing rose-petals \"just so\" (she'd been reading the Kevin Henkes book Lilly's Big Day for good practice!)Joy took three steps with me, a little in front of me.  Then she flung her petal basket in one direction and went running in the other, between a couple of empty pews.  All she wanted to do was escape.I pursued my sweet baby, picked her up, cuddled her the rest of the way up to the front of the church, circled around and pretty much immediately carried her back down the other aisle out the back of the church -- to await the incipient misery and fuss that always follows soon after a big seizure.The beautiful old Catholic church building in that old Chicago neighborhood did not, of course, have a cry room.  That wasn't on anyone's radar back when the church was built (heck, the term \"radar\" wasn't even coined until the 1940s!)  Fortunately there was a lovely little fenced grassy yard and garden at the back of the church, and it was so warm we didn't even need a wrap.  I followed Joy around, trying to keep her safe through the worst of her reaction until she was a little calmer, and then we snuck back in to grab my purse and brought Rose out as well -- turned out that the full-fledged wedding mass was getting too long for her.  So I snapped some photos.  Here's Joy:There was a statue of St. Francis in the middle of the little lawn, about the same height as Joy and shorter than Rose!I won't post any of the official photographer's shots, from after the ceremony.  Not only are they all from the front, Joy doesn't do well with posed photos and wasn't in a particularly cooperative mood.AuntLO and UncleDO, though, were over the moon.  We were so delighted to share in their joy, and touched beyond belief at their insistence on including Joy in their celebration.Afterwards we discovered in conversations with other guests that, if we didn't tell them about Joy's seizure, they just assumed that she was having a three-year-old moment there in the aisle at the ceremony.  Just like any kid might do.It was cute, and made a good story.========As part of \"and they're living happily ever after,\" I'd like to mention that AuntLO and UncleDO came to visit us last month.  We had a wonderful time, including a family walk by the lake and a restaurant dinner.  Here's Rose feeding the ducks during our walk:We're grateful beyond words for our amazing supportive family.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 30, 2008", "body": "\nIn my last reflection on Joy's brush with craniosacral therapy, I mused about doing a post on cause and effect.  Here 'tis. It strikes me that there are two sides to cause and effect when it comes to how we evaluate what's going on with Joy's health and development.  One has to do with what's going awry; the other has to do with what's going right.I'm particularly interested today in the \"what's going right\" side of things.We're trying different treatments and interventions with Joy all the time, in an elusive journey toward improvement / healing / wholeness.There's the allopathic medicine side of things, such as the combination of strong medications we've brought to bear on Joy's epilepsy.  We carefully track the seizures against the dosing.  Funny thing here: the three times that we've almost gotten to a month without any knock-down seizures don't seem to correlate very directly with dosage changes, and yet without the meds we'd be in big trouble.  (The one time that we tried to back down the dose of one of the two meds she's currently on, the seizures increased dramatically).There's the non-traditional medicine side of things, like we tried with the craniosacral therapy, various attempts to bring healing through correcting flows of energy and such.Then there's the educational realm of interventions that we're tweaking all the time, between three therapists from the school district.  The intensive autism therapy I should perhaps put with the medical side of things, but the day-to-day interactions have a lot in common with what we're doing with the school district and we deliberately coordinate the two.Then there's the fact that Joy continues to grow and mature.What a complex and fascinating endeavor, trying to facilitate (and evaluate) all this potential growth/healing!And somewhere, woven between all of this, is faith and mystery and miracle.Some Boggle-playing friends of mine at church had an amazing experience lately that relates to this.Their middle-school-aged son dislocated his knee earlier this month, a painful injury.  The doctor was able to manipulate the knee back into place with quite a bit of effort, but it wouldn't stay -- it was popping back out with a fingertip's worth of pressure.  The family requested the prayers of the congregation as they scheduled their son for surgery.The day of the surgery arrived, the son was prepped for the procedure and placed under anesthesia, and then... the surgery didn't happen.  The surgeon reported that the knee was back in place and healing well, staying put even when he pushed at it.  Nothing in the literature suggested the possibility of that course of events.\"Are you religious?\" the surgeon asked the parents.There is much about the causes & effects of healing that is beyond our knowledge.  I'm continuing to learn about being open to a range of healing, however it may come.===========Thank you to Barbara at TherExtras for precipitating this post.  I hereby submit it for inclusion in her upcoming blog-carnival on healing, scheduled for October 6.[Additional note: the mom of the lad with the inexplicably-healed knee did give me explicit permission to post the story!]\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.therextras.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/09/cause-and-effect.html", "title": "\nCause and Effect\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 14, 2008", "body": "\nJoy & Rose's great-uncle & great-aunt gave them a lovely picture-book a while ago, a Caldecott-honor book by Jon J. Muth called Zen Shorts.  The book tells several stories-within-a-story, short Zen meditations told in a manner appropriate for children.Here's one of them:There was once an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years.One day, his horse ran away.  Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit.\"Such bad luck,\" they said sympathetically.\"Maybe,\" the farmer replied.The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it two other wild horses.\"Such good luck!\" the neighbors exclaimed.\"Maybe,\" replied the farmer.The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown off, and broke his leg.  Again, the neighbors came to offer sympathy.  \"Such bad luck,\" they said.\"Maybe,\" answered the farmer.The day after that, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army to fight in a war.  Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by.\"Such good luck!\" cried the neighbors.\"Maybe,\" said the farmer.This story is good food for thought for me.  I'm not a lot like this old farmer (garden produce notwithstanding).  I tend to get dragged down by the \"such bad luck\" times and get mighty euphoric with the \"such good luck\" ones.  Here's one recent sequence of events and how it might look in some alternate-universe version of a JoyMama who's got the Zen thing going on:Toward the end of last school year, JoyMama learned that Joy's speech therapist was going to take a different position in the school district, and wouldn't be available for Joy's team the next year, though ideally we'd have loved to see all three team members continue.\"Such bad luck,\" her loyal blog-land friends commiserated.\"Maybe,\" replied JoyMama.Then we learned that the replacement would be a newer speech therapist with a lot of energy and good ideas.  The new speech therapist coordinated efforts with the occupational therapist to bring projects to Joy's daycare in which all the daycare kids could participate.  Not only is Joy taking well to the new strategy, but now is producing take-homes suitable for scrapbooking!\"Such good luck!\" came the cheers in the comments.\"Maybe,\" replied JoyMama.Then came word several weeks into the school year that the occupational therapist, who's been doing wonderful work with Joy and MADE several weighted vests for her, got reassigned to classroom-based work and would be leaving the team pronto.  Now a totally unfamiliar OT would have to learn all about our complicated little sensory-seeker, all from scratch.\"Such bad luck,\" sympathized the readers.\"Maybe,\" replied JoyMama.Then we learned that the new OT we've been assigned comes to the school district from Birth-to-Three (so she's experienced in working with early-childhood issues) and not only that -- she used to be the OT for one of the other kids at Joy's daycare, so she's already acquainted with Joy and Lynda and how the daycare is set up! I met with her this morning, got her signed up onto our team Yahoo group, she asked good questions and sounds enthusiastic.\"Such good luck!\" exclaimed the bloggers.\"Maybe,\" replied JoyMama.I guess we'll have to see what's next to come our way!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0439339111.01._SX140_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/maybe_14.html", "title": "\nMaybe.\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 21, 2008", "body": "\nIn the comments to this post, Barbara/therextras asked if it was JoyMama jumping off the bridge in JoyMama's profile picture. Here's the picture:I responded with a question of my own: \"You don't think I'd marry a woman who would fling herself untethered off a bridge, do you???? Well??????\"There are a number of possible answers to the question:1. It's not JoyMama, so therefore the answer is no, I wouldn't marry a woman who would fling herself untethered off a bridge.2. Yes, it's JoyMama. I had no idea when we got married that she would do such a thing, and I'm shocked, SHOCKED that she would put herself at such great personal risk. It reflects badly on her as a person and sets a terrible example for Joy and Rose. For I would never do such a thing\u20263. Yes, it's JoyMama. She made the leap before we were married when she was young and foolish. As part of our wedding vows, she swore off such desperate acts of thrill seeking, promising to be the sedate librarian from a small town in Kansas I always hoped to marry.4. Yes, it's JoyMama. In fact, I was the photographer. Which means I stood by, nay, encouraged her to fling herself off the bridge to meet an uncertain fate. It reflects badly on me that I would allow her to put herself in such peril and not do anything to try to stop her.What exactly is a leap of faith anyway? In common parlance it means believing in something despite, or in the absence of, any available evidence.Marriage is quite the leap of faith, isn't it? We vetted each other by dating for a year and then spending a year as an engaged couple. But forever is an awful long time to commit oneself to another. In essence, we based a decision on how to order the rest of our lives on a small slice of time compared to how long we were planning on being together. Thankfully, neither of us got cold feet before our wedding day, and at least so far, almost 15 years in, our faith in each other and in the decision to combine our lives has been rewarded. I mean, look at those pictures of the girls in their pretty flower girl dresses -- it amazes me every day how richly blessed we are to have them.I guess having kids entails a leap of faith as well. There's no crystal ball you can look into to see how they will turn out.  Certainly, we wish Joy didn't have to contend with autism or epilepsy, or that our family didn't have to deal with the fallout from those conditions. But if I'd had a crystal ball to gaze into before Joy was born, it would have shown me that despite all of that, raising Joy would turn out to be a wonderful experience. I tell people all the time that despite the struggles and challenges of raising Joy, we ain't giving her back. In fact, because it is a such a challenge, I think the successes we have with Joy (like seeing her becoming more interactive with people, as she has lately) are that much more rewarding.Oh yeah, the picture... That is indeed JoyMama taking the plunge. And I am the photographer. We had already been married for a while at the time.  It's not quite the leap of faith it might have been... We were camping at Baxter State Park in Maine. On one of our first days there, we were hiking near our campsite and came upon the bridge in the photo. There was a group of people swimming in the river, and a number of them were also jumping off the bridge. And not perishing... There was deep spot on one side of the bridge which made jumping off relatively safe. It was quite a refreshing way to end a day of hiking up and down mountains.And I, of course, took my own turns leaping....\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GyIBWwYa9A0/SP6LMlBheOI/AAAAAAAAAAo/EPSY4n55Mew/s1600-h/leap-faith.jpg", "http://www.baxterstateparkauthority.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/wednesday-photo-blogging-leap-of-faith.html", "title": "\nWednesday Photo Blogging: Leap of Faith\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 6, 2008", "body": "\nJoy's craniosacral therapy journey so far:Whose Woo Do You Do?Woo, Take 2JoyDad's Thoughts on Craniosacral TherapyUpdate to the Craniosacral Files (Woo, Me?)Yesterday Joy had her third and last craniosacral therapy session.  In our story so far, we originally began this treatment with a set of initial concerns we thought CST might address that included biting, teeth-grinding, her intense need to chew, sleep issues (taking a long time to get to sleep at night plus waking up too early) and her stimmy intensity.At yesterday's session, Joy pretty clearly recognized where we were as we drove up, and was happy to be there.  She almost danced through the door, and gave the therapist (we're calling her H.) a great big grin.  I think she wanted to play \"chase\" with H, and it started right away with a bit of a chase to get her to move from the waiting room to the therapy room.Once in the therapy room, Joy pulled out some stimmy toys and H began following her around and doing her light-pressure \"holds\" on Joy, each time for the count of 10 if Joy would let her.  Like the last session, the focus was on head and abdomen, though the last session's abdominal holds were pressing up into the diaphragm and this time she was working lower.  She spoke of getting some sort of release in Joy's ileal valve.  For Joy's head, the releases again had to do with heat in the cranium and generally loosening up the craniosacral flow.  Once again, H. had to follow Joy around the room and work with her on the floor, and Joy (happily) attempted escape most every time but didn't bite or struggle nearly as hard as she's capable of.One question on my mind was the strange fact that Joy's been having on-and-off low-grade fevers lately, which started before the CST but the last two times have occurred within a day or two after her CS sessions.  Yes, that can happen, was the answer, as the body releases heat or \"de-toxes\".  Part of a self-correcting mechanism, and if it happens it's usually only the first session or two.  I'd have bought the explanation much better if H had said something about the possibility in advance... but she hadn't.Another question on my mind, this one partially prompted by a comment from Barbara at TherExtras: why the schedule of treatments every two weeks, when I heard that another practitioner in town starts out on a schedule like weekly or even twice per week?  She said that she used to start out with more frequent sessions, but had come to her present approach through the experience that a longer wait gave her clients' bodies a better chance to take full advantage of the self-correction that the CST enables.  She said that she eventually became convinced that treating too often was actually interfering with the self-correction, stirring things up that were best left alone for the body to work out.She said that the things she'd worked on with Joy in earlier sessions were still doing fine (the neck & hyoid bone, the diaphragm) and that if we had been interested in coming back, she thought Joy was in balance enough that she'd next want to see her in a month.I was very open about the fact that we'd just not seen enough effect in Joy that we could attribute to the CST, to keep us interested in coming back.  Especially in the areas of the biting and the stimming, there just hasn't been any relief.  The only thing that has improved really is the night-time sleep, and maybe a little less teeth grinding, but the rhythm of those improvements don't really make sense with the timing of the sessions.  With as complex a kiddo as Joy, it's very hard to know what change affects what outcome, and we're tweaking various therapies all the time.  I think I'll need to do a whole separate post on the dilemma of trying to suss out what cause matches what effect.  (Aacck, I've posted just about every day this week, and my list of post topics is still growing beyond the pace I'm writing them up!  This can't last.)H was not at all fazed by my report of not being able to identify improvements, or our decision to stop treatment.  She said it sounds like we're doing good work to address Joy's ongoing sensory issues, she still felt good about what she said she'd accomplished with Joy's system, and she encouraged me to keep in touch if I had any questions or wanted to give things another try later.  I liked her a lot, and can see why she's got such a loyal following.  I think I'll miss her.As far as post-session affect on the day of treatment goes, Joy has been different every time.  First time was giggly/smiley, second time was stimmy/cranky, yesterday was mischievous and boundary-testing.  She got cranky again before supper, but later in the evening mellowed out and she & JoyDad got some nice happy playtime.So, case closed on the craniosacral files.  What a fascinating ride!  Thanks for tracking it with me.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.therextras.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/09/closing-craniosacral-files.html", "title": "\nClosing the Craniosacral Files\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, October 2, 2008", "body": "\nJoyDad and I had a wonderful opportunity last Sunday to talk with part of Joy's community.Our church invited us to give a presentation to the adult Sunday-school class, which is basically anybody who isn't involved with teaching the children's Sunday-school classes.  This was our first go-around with an occasional series that they call \"Families Living with Disabilities,\" where they've asked other families to speak in the past, to let the church community know where things stand with their child's extra challenges and how the congregation can help.The church is already helping immensely.  In addition to prayer support, there are also two rotations of volunteers who serve as one-on-one aides.  Joy gets an aide during Sunday-school hour, and another for the nursery during worship (and for several minutes afterwards so that I can talk to people without Joy-chasing).  Fortunately she rolls really well with having two different aides each Sunday, and different people on first Sunday of the month, second Sunday etc.This was an opportunity to add to that, and fill people in who aren't so involved with Joy week to week.So I wrote, and JoyDad and I presented, a 45-minute session with question-and-answer at the end.  We broke it into five parts:Top ten things Joy is good atChronologyWhat are we doing now?How can we invite you to interact with and nurture Joy as part of this community?Question-and-answerBoth of us can get pretty chatty when we're on a roll, and the chronology part (what happened with Joy when?) had all kinds of opportunity for digression!  We ended up cutting out most of the \"What are we doing now\" so we could get to the suggestions and still have time for Q&A, but it ended up working pretty well.Here are some highlights!First, the Top Ten list.  We wanted to make sure that we started out with ability, because it's tempting to only talk about the \"DIS.\"  Here's what we offered as the Top Ten Things Joy is Good At:10) Taking her medicine! (pills and liquid in an oral syringe, 3x per day) 9) Peek-a-boo (she\u2019s just learned to cover her own face with the blanket too!) 8) Getting set for meals (climbs into her chair, buckles up, and puts on her stretchy neck bib) 7) Eating meals (she eats widely and enthusiastically) 6) Asking for more food! (operative word is \"mo\")  5) Post-diaper routine (opens the drawer, puts in the diaper cream, closes the drawer) 4) Physical strength (the girl has been a powerhouse since birth) 3) Running.  Fast. [The link is to Auntie Run-at-the-Mouth, who just linked to us!] 2) Escaping.  By running.  Fast.  (She\u2019d be a great running back; she always finds the daylight!) 1) Winning hearts.  Her smile and laugh are utterly contagious, and you just can't help but smile back.Then here are some of the suggestions we made for interactions with Joy:1) Get physically on Joy\u2019s level.  Example of a powerful exercise I did during Hanen communication-therapy training, trying to have adult conversation where one partner is sitting and another standing, or one is standing behind the other, versus both being at the same level.  It's terribly awkward; face-to-face communication is the way to go.  (Rhemashope wrote a lovely reflection this week related to this, called \"Stooping.\")2) Pare your language use back to the basics, to get it closer to the point that Joy might be able to reproduce herself.  Example of teaching a baby to climb stairs \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t go all the way to the top and holler for the baby to crawl clear up... you go just a step or two above and encourage them from there.

Treat her noises and movement as if they have meaning, repeat them back to her and then maybe add your guess as to what they mean.

It'd be enough to make ya want to move back, if it weren't for the fact that really Kansas has about as many discouraging words as anywhere else.  And, alas, the movie Tropic Thunder is playing in Kansas as well.There's been a lot of editorial page ink and blogospheric bytes spilled over the protests from the special-needs community about the movie's use of the \"R-word\": retard.  As I understand it, the context is an actor (played by Ben Stiller) playing a character with cognitive disabilities, and overplaying the \"simple\" factor of his \"Simple Jack\" for Oscar-pursuit purposes. The word \"retard\" is bandied about indiscriminately, leading to real-world concerns -- shared by me -- that one of the movie's ugly taglines may be heard on a lot of playgrounds this fall. I won't repeat it, but you can read about it if you care to.I won't be seeing this movie, and wouldn't anyway because a) I see something like one theatre-movie per year if I'm lucky, and b) I don't \"do\" trash-mouth movies that pull their big laugh-lines out of the gutter, and I'm not just talking about the \"R\"-word anymore.Instead, over the past several months I've been reading my way through a clever and highly entertaining science fiction series by Lois McMaster Bujold, featuring lead character Miles Vorkosigan.  Miles is a nobleman on his home planet, in the line of succession to the emperorship.  He is blindingly intelligent, a man of conscience, full of manic energy, apparently arrogant but battling inner bogeymen.  He commands a fleet of space mercenaries, and has adventures, romantic and otherwise, all around the galaxy.He's also just over four feet tall, with startlingly brittle bones and other physical frailties, the in-utero victim of a chemical attack on his mother before he was born.  His home planet has a low tolerance for physical difference, to put it mildly.  The \"R-word\" that gets used against Miles is \"mutie,\" short for mutant.Joy and I have not yet heard our own planet's discouraging epithets used against her.  With any luck, we'll avoid it for some years longer.  I'm not so naive, though, as to think that it isn't going to happen at some point.Meanwhile, I shield myself against the day, rejoicing in Joy's accomplishments and entertaining myself with the successes of Miles Vorkosigan.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 27, 2008", "body": "\nI've mentioned Joy's daycare before, and officially dubbed her daycare provider \"Lynda,\" after Lynda Carter of Wonder Woman fame.  Today I'd like to let you know why we, and Joy, are so incredibly blessed in her daycare situation.I work a part-time schedule.  For the first two years of Joy's life, we had a daycare-swap arrangement with another family from church, who had a little guy only two days older than Joy.  But after two years of swapping, the other family was looking to reproduce again and found another arrangement that would better suit an expanding family, so we needed to find something else.  By that point, we were well aware that Joy was \"behind\" developmentally, and she'd been getting Birth-to-Three services for several months.  We knew that we'd need something special, and we found it from a personal referral from a Birth-to-Three therapist, who had heard about what Lynda had put together in her home.Lynda mixes things up with her daycare kids in two ways.  She deliberately assembles a mixed-age group of children, regularly taking in new babies who then grow into years-long clients!  And she deliberately puts together a mix of special-needs and neurotypical kids.  Right now the mix is about half and half.This daycare is a model of inclusion on a day-to-day basis, and she makes it look so easy.  It really hit me the other summer one time when I dropped Joy off late and everyone was already out in the front yard, playing in a little wading pool.  Lynda had the one girl with the most intense challenges (non-verbal, not very mobile, among other things) sitting on the bench of a little picnic table pulled up to the edge of the pool, with her feet in the water.  Lynda was playfully pouring water over this girl's legs and feet, to a response of big smiles, while simultaneously tracking and interacting in turn with the other kids around the pool and in and out of the water, and managed to seamlessly welcome me and Joy as we arrived.Lynda's place is therapy-central some days, with itinerant therapists from Birth-to-Three and the school district in and out to work with their various kiddie-clients.  Joy's summer speech therapist was only there once this summer, working mostly out of our home, but her response to just one session at Lynda's was \"This place is therapy heaven!\"  Lynda is eager to learn from the therapists and also make suggestions -- she's not a therapist by background, but has practically made herself into one by observation and continuing education.Oh, and did I mention the reports?  Every day during nap-time, Lynda writes up three or four paragraphs on each kid, with detailed specifics on their activities.  Most days those messages are e-mailed to a private online group we have set up for Joy-reports, so JoyDad and I get to see them at work (only on the busiest days do they get handwritten).  We've got the school-district therapists turning in their reports that way too, and Lynda's are easily the equal of theirs.To top it all off, this week Lynda let me trade Joy-days because of vacation and holiday.  I ended up having a day at home all to myself, though I did share it with JoyDad, swooped down on his workplace and whisked him off to a restaurant lunch.Yes, she does read this blog -- thanks so VERY much, Lynda / Wonder Woman!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/08/in-praise-of-awesome-daycare.html", "title": "\nIn Praise of Awesome Daycare\n"},

With her teeth.Joy's such a sensory kid, plus she's got a ridiculously high tolerance for pain, plus she's recently stopped grinding her teeth when she stims, plus she has a lot of therapists filling up her days for the past couple of weeks.  I think there's something in these aspects put together, with some click of some internal switch, that has resulted in Joy chomping on herself.  She does this particularly when she is angry or frustrated, as in \"Come on Joy, let's go change your diaper.\" I try to take her hand, she doesn't want to go, and all of a sudden she's dangling from my hand by one arm and her knee is up in her mouth and she's biting down hard.  It's clearly enough to make her feel pain at the time, as she lets out a loud wail when the bite stops.We've been trying to offer alternate chewing stimulation with therapy chewies and good chewy food.  It would be great if she'd re-direct the bite into a chewy-toy instead, but she strikes like a snake and there just isn't time to insert a chewy in between her teeth and her arm.Jeans and long-sleeve shirts would blunt things somewhat, but we've been topping out past 80 degrees with a lovely bit of late summer weather.She's done some biting of adults too, but usually we can get out of the way.  When the biter and the target are the same person, though, and she doesn't want to get out of the way, you get the results that you see in the photo. Joy's occupational therapist is making inquiries as to whether the Wilbarger \"brushing\" protocol might be applicable for this situation.  We used the brushing/joint-compressions back when Joy was not quite two years old, and aren't sure it was a lot of help back then.  We need something to try now, though.  Maybe brushing is it.Meanwhile, if anyone else has dealt successfully with this kind of thing... let us know!

I open the crib-tent zipper, open the blinds, greet her with a cheery good-morning.  Then depending on how asleep or awake she is, I may pat her, help her untangle from the blankets, eventually help her to her feet.  Then we have a little hug, and I say the word \"hug.\"Then I repeat the word \"up\" several times, and give her a chance to request it (something she used to never miss, but it went away one day a couple months ago and hasn't come back yet).  Then I count \"Ready, set...\" and give her the chance to say either \"up\" or \"go,\" another prompt she never used to miss.Then I fill in the \"go\" for her, and lift her out of the crib with a kiss, and her pyjama-ed little feet go padding out toward the living room and/or breakfast table.She does not look directly at me during this entire routine.At least for this eye-contact avoidance thing, I have a frame of reference: John Elder Robison's book Look Me In The Eye, in which he describes how difficult (and perhaps over-rated?) eye-contact can be.I don't have as good a framework for Joy's other frequent visual avoidance situation, where she declines to look at whatever task she's doing with her hands.  I supposed I should say \"whatever task she's being asked to do with her hands,\" because it's most noticeable when it's something an adult wants her to do: link pop-beads, put in a puzzle piece, buckle herself into her booster chair.The booster chair is a fascinating example.  She's very good at climbing into the chair herself, and retrieving the three straps that have to buckle together, and fitting the buckle together and pushing each side in with a pop! but with her fingers out of the way so as not to get pinched.  Except she generally does it without looking, other than perhaps peripherally.  When she accidentally gets one side of the buckle turned backward, it's well-nigh impossible for her to correct without seeing what's gone wrong.How to help Joy look at what she's doing, enough to see it, learn it, achieve it?Physically giving her head a gentle re-direct seems rather ham-handed and invasive, but it does at least get her to see that the buckle is turned backward or whatever, and correct it herself.  Calling to her with voice-prompt, making a noise by tapping the item, waving the item in front of her face... none of them very effective.Thoughts?Maybe she just wishes she were in Dixie -- Look away, look away!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jerobison.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/11/look-away-look-away.html", "title": "\nLook Away, Look Away\n"},

I'm an economist, so I tend to approach interventions with/for Joy (and other decisions in life) from that perspective. I want to provide all of the help to Joy that we can, but our resources (time and money) are finite. I try to weigh things like costs and benefits/expected outcomes, risk and reward, and opportunity costs (what else could we do with that time and/or money) in order to try to determine what the best mix of therapies is. Don't get me wrong, I do also have a heart that enters into the process, but I need data to make a decision.The big piece of data that was (and in fact remains) missing for me as we were trying to decide whether to go ahead with the CS therapy was how it is supposed to work. I'm sorry, but I just can't buy the whole \"Breath of Life\" business. I just can't. It is not logical, and appears to be based on concepts of physiology that are contrary to what medical science has been operated under for the last 100 years or so.The risks of CS appeared to be low (as opposed to something like chelation), and the rewards if it worked seemed to be something Joy could benefit from. The cost is not outrageous, and we could afford a few sessions without depriving ourselves of anything else of consequence. But the biggest stumbling block for me was the woo factor. I just could not get past that. It didn't help that Orac's blog post (the one JoyMama linked to in her post) appeared right in the middle of our decision-making.What finally tipped the scale for me was that we had heard from a number of people that it had helped them. Of course, it helped them with issues other than what Joy is struggling with (a classic sign of woo-based medicine is that the treatment is touted for an incredible range of ills), but I digress... Given the low risks and costs, I finally agreed to go for it.And I have to say that while there did seem to be a short-term change in Joy's behavior, I remain skeptical. Other than the couple of hours following the treatment, Joy's behavior is not any better. She has thrown a couple of tantrums during the time I've been typing this post.Yesterday's session provides only one data point, and what we're looking for is a trend. I've agreed to a series of treatments, and I will suspend judgment until they have run the course.

She turns on the charm high-wattage when it comes to wanting adults to do things for her (or with her) and distributes hugs and kisses freely both to current friends and friends-she-hasn't-met-yet.She can run like the wind, perpetually startling her observers and pursuers. She's physically powerful pretty much all the way around; I first noted in her baby book how unusually strong she was at the ripe old age of two weeks.She takes life on without fear, climbing and jumping and swimming with enthusiasm.Joy also has Linear Nevus Sebaceous Syndrome (LNSS), a rare neurological condition that in her case consists of cognitive issues, epilepsy, and a nevus sebaceous skin abnormality on her scalp that was removed in 3 plastic surgeries in her second year of life. She also has autism. She currently speaks about 15 words, down from 80 last fall. She has an extremely short attention span and pretty much runs her mama ragged!The autism piece of \"who Joy is\" has been the most useful lens -- so far -- for finding common ground with other kids and families, and figuring out appropriate ways to help her make her way in the world. So to a large extent, I guess this is an autism blog.But since Joy is a multi-faceted young lady, both personality-wise and in her medical challenges, I'm liable to go haring off all over the place. I'm writing mostly for myself, but also for family and friends already met, and also those not met yet.

Also n., a (self-)stimulating thing or behavior. Joy's got a lot of stimming going on this summer.  When let loose on a lawn, she immediately falls to pulling out clumps of grass and running it between her fingers.  At the park, the gravel or the chunks of old tires are much more interesting than the play equipment.But stim isn't in the mainstream dictionaries yet.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2008", "body": "\nFinally, finally! Yesterday morning Joy had her very first session of state-funded intensive autism therapy, almost nineteen months to the day after receiving the diagnosis of autism (just before Christmas, December 2006).The first time we visited her primary care pediatrician after the developmental pediatrician made the pronouncement, she told us that we were fortunate that Wisconsin has such a fine program for intensive autism therapy.Well, yes and no.There's indeed a fine program in Wisconsin, funded in part by a special federal waiver that allows Medicaid funding to be spent for early autism therapy, without requiring that the families be in poverty to qualify.  Each qualifying child can get up to three years of intensive therapy, with ongoing \"post-intensive\" dollars to follow.  The problem is that the funding has not kept pace with the demand, and the waiting list is growing to frustrating proportions.There's a fair amount of agreement that the gold-standard in inter-personal therapy  for autism treatment involves 30+ hours of therapy per week, and the earlier you get started, the better.  There are a number of intensive-level therapy programs & approaches out there, and our county offers a choice between two agencies that operate with the Medicaid waiver funding.  More about the choices and their content later!  What seems to be the commonality across the various philosophies is the many many hours of one-on-one face time, with lots of interactions and lots of documentation.  And ideally, the therapist should be the most interesting and engaging thing in the room.As you can imagine, this sort of intensity isn't cheap.  Out-of-pocket, it's up to $60,000 per year, out of reach for most middle-class families unless you double-mortgage your home and drain your retirement funding and fundraise like crazy.  We chose not to do so, instead continuing to pursue what therapy we could get for Joy through the Birth-to-Three early childhood program, and more recently through the school district.I started making calls on the very day Joy got that autism diagnosis, knowing that the wait was long and getting longer.  It was nearly two months before we waded through the initial paperwork and got a visit from a county worker to make sure that Joy looked like intensive-therapy material, and then two months more before they got all that paperwork processed and got her officially onto the waiting list, April of 2007.  And then the months started clicking by.  When she'd been on the list for a YEAR, the county sent someone out to \"re-screen\" her and make sure that we hadn't had some sort of magical recovery...In the meantime, we've gotten involved in advocacy, both for Joy's sake and for others coming down the pike onto that awful waiting list.  One of the ways that Wisconsin has attempted to rescue the intensive-therapy program without directly ponying up the money it would take to get everyone off the waiting list and into the program, is to require insurance providers to pick up some of the therapy.  Currently, insurance providers in Wisconsin are NOT required to cover anything autism-related, so they don't.  This year's attempt to make the insurance companies do the right thing went down in flames at the end of the legislative session, when the leadership of the Wisconsin Assembly used a weaselly substitute amendment to keep the autism insurance bill from coming to the floor (where it probably would have had the votes to pass!)November's elections are very important...Anyway, we're very happy to have the therapy available, and very happy to have two fully-funded choices.  Not everybody has that advantage, and we're well aware of it. We're cranky beyond belief, however, about that waiting list.  Talk about wasting public funds, letting the precious optimal months slip by!We'll continue with the advocacy, of course.  But now it's our turn for the therapy, and we're going to do our best to make sure that it's as helpful for Joy as it can possibly be.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/intensive-therapy-out-of-starting-gate.html", "title": "\nIntensive Therapy: Out of the Starting Gate\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 11, 2008", "body": "\nAutism takes so many forms, so many paths. (Perhaps you've heard the phrase \"if you've met one person with autism... you've met ONE person with autism.\")Each family has a different answer to the question \"When did you first notice that something was unusual about your child?\" That question came up repeatedly as we went down the path of seeking a comprehensive diagnosis for Joy.So here's my answer:We had two big measuring sticks for Joy's development. The first was her older sister Rose, born 28 months earlier. The second was Joy's daycare buddy, a little guy just two days older. Our families did a daycare swap for the first two years of their lives, so she had an exact age-mate who was always there.Physically, Joy did some things before her daycare buddy, such as rolling over and crawling (and maybe walking too, if I'm remembering right). Those were all things she did at an earlier age than her sister too.On the other hand, her sister was a verbal whiz, with 75 words by 14 months. Joy wasn't doing that. She seemed to have some babble, and I kept trying to count words, but they just weren't coming. Plus I'd think I was hearing a word, write it down, and then it would disappear. Elvis sightings! but we didn't know it then. Her daycare buddy wasn't as verbally precocious as her sister, but he eventually started to pull ahead with words too.Those weren't immediately definitive, though. After all, there's a wide range of normal, and we kept reminding ourselves that comparisons can be less than helpful.The first unmistakable red flag was a certain CD-player toy that we brought out at the age of about 10 months. If you pushed the yellow button on top, the \"CD\" would spin, colored lights would flash, a song would play. Then there was also a little noise-making barrel to spin, and a couple of noise-making buttons to push.All Joy wanted to do was spin that barrel. She had a toy in her crib with a similar barrel, which in that case was the correct trigger to light the lights and play the music. But the CD toy required the push of the yellow button.We showed it to her daycare buddy, and he \"got it\" right away. Showed it to him once, he was making it go again and again. Joy, on the other hand, took two weeks to get the idea, full of demonstration and hand-over-hand.Another memory that really sticks out for me was some time later, age 18 months maybe, when we were embarking on early childhood Birth-to-Three evaluation. I commented to the first caseworker that when Joy and her sister and her buddy were at our front window, and I'd be pointing out something like a squirrel or rabbit, Rose and daycare buddy would take an interested look and Joy generally would not. I remember a bit of self-deprecation as I said that, qualifying it with a \"maybe I'm imagining things-- might not be important anyway.\"I wasn't imagining things, and it's important.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/when-did-you-first-notice.html", "title": "\nWhen did you first notice...?\n"},

It was, we learned, a fairly common blip, a blotch of inappropriate dermal tissue packed full of oily glands -- hence the \"sebaceous\" -- on which no hair would grow. JoyDad went online and found some rather scary pages about linear nevus sebaceous syndrome, accounts of kids born with nevi all over their faces who ended up with various combinations of other symptoms involved: blind, deaf, serious cognitive impairments, severe epilepsy. However, I don't remember him making a big deal of those findings to me, because the message we got from the doctors was that most such nevi have no further implications, beyond the cosmetic issue and a somewhat elevated chance of pre-cancerous changes further on down the road. The nevus wasn't even expected to grow, beyond just keeping up with her head. (Nine-months photo above left; the blotch was peach-colored most of the time, turning bright pink when the rest of her face went red, as in a crying jag or the like.)We consulted with a pediatric plastic surgeon, who ended up doing three outpatient surgeries over the course of a year, the first when Joy had just turned one. No complications from the surgeries, other than a scar that her hair grew to cover, with a promise of potential scar reduction surgery some years later. The seizures started between the second and third surgeries, at age 15 months, summer of '05.  They deserve a post on their own, so I won't go into a lot of detail except that we have an excellent pediatric neurologist, who even happens to be a fine Boggle player!  He first floated the idea that the epilepsy and nevus might be related in summer of '06, but in such a low-key way that we didn't really glom onto it and press him for more details and a definitive diagnosis of linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS) until November of that year.LNSS is a rare congenital disorder that was first identified in 1957 and then independently in 1962, and is also known as Feuerstein-Mims-Schimmelpenning Syndrome.  My understanding is that it's rare to the point that the number of cases in the US numbers in the 100s.  It's a genetic disorder but a mosaic one, so it's only happening in the affected areas rather than systemwide and there's no blood test for it.  The classic triad of symptoms are the nevus (check), epilepsy (check), and cognitive issues (check).  It can also, however, include a whole slew of other systems such as eyes, ears, skeletal, and genito-urinary, and sometimes a diagnosis will be made if one of the triad is missing but some of the others are present. We are fortunate that Joy seems to have the classic triad, and nothing else.  She's seen a geneticist, had her eyes checked (one of the most stressful doctor visits we've ever had, but that's another story), and had her hearing checked (inconclusive because she has the attention span of a gnat, but we don't have any evidence for being concerned).For Joy, LNSS makes sense as an umbrella diagnosis that more or less explains all the rest, including the autism.  However, it doesn't give us much guidance as to what to DO about any of it...I'd link to a good summary site, except I haven't found one that I liked recently!  There isn't even a Wikipedia entry, for cryin' out loud.  I haven't found an online support group specific to LNSS either, though there is an Epidermal Nevus YahooGroup that gets sporadic traffic, where a variety of kinds of nevi are included and only a few of the participants are dealing with the syndrome beyond just the nevus.  Maybe there's a mission for me in that lack of information, at some point.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SH3PWlIAHwI/AAAAAAAAAAo/cj5j5zpO7rQ/s1600-h/nevus-at-birth.jpg", "http://www.lnss-connections.org/", "http://www.lnss-connections.org/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SHyHb32TiNI/AAAAAAAAAAg/ptzYdLYS1Wk/s1600-h/nevus-at-ninemo.png", "http://www.pediatricneuro.com/alfonso/pg302.htm", "http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Epidermal_Nevus/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/linear-nevus-sebaceous-syndrome-or.html", "title": "\nLinear Nevus Sebaceous Syndrome, or, another order of noticing things\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 18, 2008", "body": "\nQuoting police sergeant Dave Laude, from a July 16 Cap Times feature article on Project Lifesaver, an electronic monitoring program for people with autism & Alzheimer's: It's amazing what these families have to live with. One mother came into my office to sign her son up. The first thing she did was walk around shutting all the doors so he couldn't get out. Can you imagine having to live like that every day?Consider it imagined. Consider it lived. That's exactly what I do when I take Joy somewhere like a doctor's office, where I'm going to have to let go of her hand.Joy isn't quite the little Houdini that some of the other kids in the article are. She can only open easy doorknobs, and gives up pretty quickly. We recently installed a lovely backyard fence, which put an immediate damper on her former dashes for the street, and she hasn't attempted either climbing or digging. Still, in spite of all the watching and hand-holding and planning and door-closing, Joy does escape sometimes. As the article put it,No matter how vigilant parents are, children with autism get away. In fact, escape stories are family lore.Our classic escape story happened last fall, on a playdate at a mall play-place with fun tunnels and climbing toys, and a 3-ft high perimeter wall lined with benches. Joy had never climbed the wall, so I thought I was safe to stand with the other mother at the playplace entrance, and keep an eye out that Joy didn't come running out that way. All of a sudden, I realized that I didn't see Joy anywhere. My first thought was that perhaps she'd had a seizure in a tunnel, or out of my line of sight. So we spent a minute or two eliminating that possibility. Then we looked to the great big mall and all the people in it -- and fortunately Joy was trotting back toward the play-place, shepherded by a friendly mom. \"She did the right thing and wouldn't talk to a stranger,\" the guardian angel said, \"but I figured she had come from here.\"It's true, Joy won't talk to a stranger, since she barely talks! However, she might give that stranger a hug and kiss, and trot away happily with them... we were incredibly lucky that time.Last night we had another related incident. Joy takes swimming lessons at an indoor pool, and we stay a while after to free-swim. She'd been sitting happily on the pool steps for several minutes, so I took my eyes off her for just a second to watch her sister do something. In a flash, Joy was out of the pool and running around the perimeter at full tilt, in all its slippery danger, and I couldn't dash after her myself without taking the same risk. She slipped and fell once, and I almost caught up, but she popped right back up and kept going, right past two lifeguards before I could call them to intervene. Finally I was able to yell ahead to another mom at poolside to intercept her. Dangerous and embarrassingly conspicuous -- why can't you just holler at your kid to STOP, huh?We're going to look into signing Joy up for Project Lifesaver, if not immediately, then certainly in time for kindergarten.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.madison.com/tct/news/296350"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/escapism.html", "title": "\nEscapism\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 17, 2008", "body": "\nThe following is an excerpt from a diary I wrote on Daily Kos about a year ago, July 2007. Most of it still applies!========================Not long after we received the autism diagnosis, I attended a program called \"Autism 101\" that was sponsored by our local Autism Society chapter. One of the presenters was an autism consultant who has autism herself, a professionally successful woman with a master's degree who wasn't diagnosed with autism until adulthood.As part of the program, the attendees went around the circle and spoke a little bit about why we were there. I introduced myself and reflected on my daughter and her recent autism diagnosis, and what the diagnosis helped us explain and what it made even more confusing. One of the confusing things for me, I shared, was how to deal with boundary-testing: negative behaviors like swiping things off counters and flinging them, and dashing away at the least opportunity, that she never pulled at daycare but only with her parents. Such \"trying it on\" behavior felt like something a \"normal\" kid would pull, and yet we were having no success with setting those boundaries and getting her to respect them.The autism consultant, I'll call her E., rocked me on my heels with her flat response. \"I feel sorry for her,\" she said.Ouch. Try being told in front of a public forum that the local expert feels sorry for your child due to your parenting!And then E. told this story.====E. remembered very clearly one occasion where, as a child, she was being cared for by an adult other than her parents. One of the things that she did that day was that she kicked her caregiver in the legs, a good hard punt. Her caregiver was, quite naturally, furious. \"No! Don't kick, you don't kick people! Don't kick! Now, what did I just tell you?\"\"Don't kick,\" E. repeated promptly.And then she smiled up at her caregiver and gave another good solid kick to the legs.You can imagine what the caregiver said when E's parents returned. \"She knew EXACTLY what she was doing. She knew she wasn't supposed to kick, she even said 'Don't kick,' then she smiled up in my face and hauled off and KICKED ME AGAIN!\"====What was happening in her head?E. couldn't articulate it then, but these many years later, there's a lot she has to tell about the incident.First, it felt GOOD to kick. Many (most, all?) people with autism have a sensory component to their condition, in which their sensory systems are differently wired. Sometimes they become overwhelmed by too many noises or too much to see and can't sort out what's important. Sometimes they can't stand particular kinds of touch. Sometimes, on the other hand, they crave intense touch or pressure, and literally need that kind of stimulation to be able to focus. Kicking creates pressure. It felt good.Second, E's repetition of \"Don't kick\" didn't mean what the caregiver thought it meant. Many people with autism have echolalia, a twist on communication which allows them to repeat quite precisely what they hear, either immediately or some time later, without necessarily understanding it. People with autism can produce strange results on speech evaluations; neurotypical language-learners generally understand more than they say, but with autism and echolalia, it's entirely possible to say more than one understands. So, when E. repeated \"Don't kick,\" she didn't actually \"get\" it.Third, people with autism (many, most, all?) tend to think in pictures. The author and livestock handling equipment designer Temple Grandin, who also has autism, is perhaps the most famous voice on this subject. In fact, she wrote an autobiographical work called Thinking in Pictures: My Life With Autism. To Grandin, words are like a second language. Pictures are the primary means that she experiences what is happening in her head. E. thinks in pictures as well. And when you think in pictures, E. explained, the words that make the most sense are the words that can most easily be expressed in pictures. \"Kick,\" for example, is a nice easy one. \"Don't,\" on the other hand, is not. (Quick, everybody, think up a picture in your mind of what \"don't\" looks like...) So when she heard and said \"Don't kick,\" the important part of the instruction was the \"kick.\" And kicking felt so good, and how nice it was to be invited to kick again! So she kicked.====I'll add yet a fourth aspect to the frame of the story, and that is that many (most, all?) people with autism have challenges interpreting social situations. So when E. publicly declared her sympathy for my poor misunderstood and mis-parented child, I had to take a huge deep breath and remind myself that from her autistic context, perhaps she was not able to project how her brutally-honest words might make a neurotypical mama feel.What is happening in her head?There are several parts of E's story that make a great deal of sense in my daughter's context. My daughter definitely has sensory issues, and is in general a sensory-seeker. Running feels good, and jumping, and crashing into things, and splashing in water, and climbing, and teetering on the edges of things -- one of her therapists suggested that the teetering helps her \"feel\" where her body is in space. She loves activities that provide deep pressure, and she seems to be more focused immediately after such experiences. My daughter also keeps testing higher for expressive language than for receptive language, which puzzled the heck out of us until the autism diagnosis. Not that she repeats long strings of things clearly or accurately, but she does say things that we're not sure she understands, including the word \"no.\" (Her expressive vocabulary, just for context, is about 80 individual words, mostly nouns, not used in combination, and mostly poorly articulated.) [NOTE: this has changed; Joy is now down to 15 words or so, but clearly understands much, much more than she says.]I'm still floundering around somewhat with the idea that all people with autism necessarily think in pictures. Autism is such a combination-platter diagnosis. There's no blood test or anything that definitive. Instead it's a clinical judgment call, based on psychological criteria in the DSM IV. There are three categories of criteria for autism: social, communication, and behaviors/interests. Each category has four criteria, which one might call symptoms. To receive a diagnosis of autism, one must fit two of the social symptoms, at least one each of the communication and behaviors symptoms, and a total of six symptoms across the board. (Here are the categories and criteria for the autism diagnosis.) I don't have the mathematical chops to figure out how many potential combinations that is, but it's pretty clear that people with different levels of different combinations of different symptoms can \"present\" very, very differently and still receive the same diagnosis. Neither I nor my husband nor any of my daughter's therapists were expecting a diagnosis of autism when we took her to the developmentalist who diagnosed her. Our daughter is affectionate, loves peek-a-boo games, has a sense of humor, and just didn't fit what little we knew of autism. And yet the doctor pegged her for nine of the twelve criteria. The combinations can be that subtle.What generalizations are fair to make under those circumstances? Ooo, I wish I knew! \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/7/29/7128/21972/255/363849", "http://www.templegrandin.com/templegrandinchapterone.html", "http://www.autism-watch.org/general/dsm.shtml"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-is-happening-in-her-head.html", "title": "\nWhat Is Happening in Her Head?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 20, 2008", "body": "\nI've mentioned our new back yard fence a couple of times now.  That fence, installed on July 1, is in some senses the highlight of our summer so far.  We have a long back yard, and only the back edge of the property had a fence when we moved in.  The neighbors on one side installed a fence on their side about 7 years ago when they put in a little pond, but that left a huge expanse of potential escape routes (214 feet, to be exact).We started out hoping that Joy would soon outgrow the dashing game, but as this spring arrived it became clear that back yard play without a fence was going to continue be an exercise in... well, exercise.  Whoever took Joy out to play had to stay hyper-alert, and within 5 feet of her at all times.  Her sprints happen with little to no warning, and she is ridiculously fast, and she will not stop for, say, traffic or the steep concrete downhill steps not far from our property...But on July 1, it took a crew of 4 guys from 8:00am to 2:30pm to install a lovely 5-foot cedar picket fence, two gates, \"nice\" side in (so as to eliminate the crosspieces as footholds).We didn't want a privacy fence, because we have a great relationship with the neighbor we were fencing off.  That relationship continued during the fence-planning & installation process.  Even though we discovered that a line of hostas she'd put in bowed too far into the property line and the fence would clip them, and that we'd have to hack back one of her honeysuckle bushes at the back corner of the yards, it didn't fuss her up at all.And then yesterday, she brought a potato salad to our fence party.Ever been to a fence party?  Neither had we.  But we really wanted to celebrate this big improvement in our lives.  So we threw a big ol' back yard barbecue, and invited members of our various posses -- church, neighborhood, Joy's daycare & therapy folks, assorted friends from all over town.  Summer weekends are full of travel and other commitments (especially since we only gave people 2 weeks' notice!) but we ended up with almost 30 guests, about a third of them kids.Props to JoyDad for yeoman service at the grill, and getting all the food from fridge to buffet table pretty much single-handedly!  I was able to mingle and attend to other details, and keep an occasional eye on the kids who were frolicking with wading pool and sprinkler and bubbles further down the yard.So who was keeping an eagle-eye on Joy?  Nobody, and everybody.  Various parents took turns hovering to make sure the kids didn't create too much havoc.  But Joy didn't really need a lot of extra supervision!  The fence eliminated the urge to dash, and she happily hung out in the middle of the gaggle of other kids, only occasionally popping out to seek an adult to take by the hand and lead into the action.One of our friends from church, who volunteered this past year as a one-on-one aide to enable Joy to participate in Sunday school, was watching the wading pool scene with great interest.  She knows first-hand how hard it can be to keep that hyper-awareness when Joy is in escape mode, and what a departure last night's backyard vibe was from that, as Joy played contentedly in the midst of the kids.  \"She's so FREE!\" was her remark.Yes, yes, yes!  We'd been aware that the fence had already been mighty liberating to us as parents, but our friend's remark crystallized it for us: that fence is liberating to Joy as well.Good fences, good (friends and) neighbors, and a mighty fine barbecue.And tomorrow... we have the kickoff meeting with a new therapy team to begin intensive autism therapy for Joy.  Stay tuned.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/good-fences-good-neighbors.html", "title": "\nGood Fences, Good Neighbors\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 29, 2008", "body": "\nI'm figuring on doing \"Product Hits & Misses\" as an occasional feature here, highlighting goodies that have worked well -- and not so well -- for Joy.But first, a big vacation hit! We just got back from a long weekend in the north woods, at a small rustic lakefront cabin without running water or electricity, but with peace and beauty a-plenty. Joy particularly liked hanging out on the pier, so we did a lot of that. Photo credit to JoyDad:Now, about the products. We had a new goodie this trip that made life much easier: the KidCo Peapod Plus travel bed.Joy started climbing out of her crib at an early age. She still won't sleep anywhere that she's not contained; a \"big girl bed\" is currently out of the question. However, we did manage to make continued use of the crib with a Tots In Mind Cozy Crib Tent:   The tent velcroes around the top rail of the crib, and then the front panel zips down to get your kiddo in and out. It worked so well that we got a similar tent for the Pack-n-Play portable crib that Joy slept in at daycare! We then used a Pack-n-Play with the tent when we went on vacation. The tent works best on the crib, because you don't have to keep taking it down. The one that goes on the Pack-n-Play has 10 separate tent-pole pieces, and something like 12 clips to attach it to the playpen. It's been a pain in the patoot to assemble and disassemble every time we travel, but at least it was working -- but Joy was growing, and the Pack-n-Play was ceasing to be safe.Enter the PeaPod. Compared to the Pack-n-Play tent, it's a marvel of engineering. You open the carrying case, and the PeaPod snaps all the way open. Kapow, no rods to assemble, no clips to clip. It does have a thin air mattress that you have to inflate with the small hand-pump that comes with the package, and then you insert the mattress into a zippered compartment at the base of the Peapod. The sides are nicely ventilated, and it comes with a little sleeping bag too. Really nicely designed.Joy slept lovely full nights up at the lake in her PeaPod. She's also been napping in it at daycare. It's supposed to be good up to age six, so we may get two years out of it, until she realizes that she can zip the panel open herself...Our product \"miss\" for attempting the same purpose was a Secret Castle Bed Tent, a tent that fits over a twin mattress like a fitted sheet. We thought that might be a nice way to transition to a big-girl bed.Cute, huh? Alas, the bed tent didn't have a zipper at the bottom of the flaps, so Joy could crawl right out. Also, when the front flaps are down, there's not enough ventilation and the thing becomes a sweatbox. I tried to fix things by sewing snaps to hold the flaps down, and cut a comforter to fit inside because otherwise she'd be sleeping on tent nylon. Joy simply popped the snaps and refused to nap. So we gave the bed-tent to older sister Rose for a play toy. At least it's good for something.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.babyage.com/baby-gear/kidco-peapod-plus-travel-bed-37082.htm", "http://www.mystrollers.com/assets/product/images250/94F5C427BA2D490D9B8C77365661EDDC.jpg", "http://www.totsinmind.com/products/crib.html", "http://www.totsinmind.com/products/crib.html", "http://www.fatbraintoys.com/images/products/large/PP004.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/product-hits-misses.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 24, 2008", "body": "\nJoy's big sister Rose, age 6, had to visit the doctor the other day. I took her because her teacher had been concerned about frequent urination -- Rose had been visiting the potty some 15 or 20 times a day. After ruling out infection, the pediatrician said, \"Well, I could send you to a pediatric urologist, but I know the first thing that they're going to do, and so I may as well just prescribe it for her if you want.\" The automatic first-line therapy turned out to be a laxative, on the theory that an emptied bowel can't put as much pressure on the bladder.Part of me would very much have liked things to be that simple when Joy's autism diagnosis came down!But there is very little that is automatically recommendable when it comes to autism therapy. Autism comes in so many darn flavors, and it seems there's an argument about practically everything related to autism:What causes itWhether or not it's curableWhether or not one should even approach it in terms of a cureWhat therapies are usefulWho should pay for whatand on and on.The therapies themselves are a stew of acronyms and fancy monikers: DAN, ABA, DIR/Floortime, RDI, Sonrise, GFCF diet, nutraceuticals and more. And our doctors were willing to provide information sources and opinions, but we didn't get prescriptions. The legwork and the decisions were to be ours. The answer to what therapies are useful depends to a great extent on what you believe you're treating. In Joy's case, we had a genetic explanation ready to hand (the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome), and since there's no miracle fix for that one, our focus from the beginning has been on support and education and quality of life all around.The decision-making was helped only somewhat by the intensive therapy options approved by the state of Wisconsin and offered in our county. As I mentioned in my last post, there are two options for going down that road: Agency 1 offering Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)., and Agency 2 offering a house blend of relationship-based therapy, heavily reliant on DIR/Floortime and the Communicating Partners work of Dr. James MacDonald.Agency 1's offering, ABA, is the therapy with the longest history and the richest publication history. ABA practitioners use positive reinforcements to elicit and reward behaviors (verbal, social, motor) step by step toward specific instructional goals. Enthusiasts claim a high success rate, raised IQs, and improved abilities to function in society. Critics say that if you're all about training behaviors, you get... a bunch of trained behaviors, and not much else.Agency 2's offering puts the focus on relationships as the context for learning. The theory goes that first you work on eliciting an engaged, persistent, interactive relationship partner, and then you can work on specific content. Enthusiasts say that it only makes sense to start with relationships, because so much of autism has to do with relationship challenges, and point to great outcomes too. Critics say that it's a lot of money to pay for gussied-up playtime.Even between these two very different approaches, I was feeling indecisive. (Think Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof: \"On the one hand... on the other hand... on the OTHER hand...\") In the Autism 101 session I attended in February 2007, one of the questions I asked was how in the world one decided between even those two options. The moderator of the session, president of the local Autism Society chapter, reassured me, \"You'll know.\" She said that after reading up and then visiting both agencies, most families find it quite clear.I didn't believe her, but she was right.We did an initial intake visit to Agency 1 first. I was very impressed with the intake coordinator I had spoken with on the phone. But the expert who did the evaluation and modeled bits of the ABA therapy didn't get much joy out of Joy. She didn't \"light up\" for the little requested behaviors, just wanted the treats without the work. Plus when we mentioned the centrality of her sensory issues (all sensory-seeking, all the time!), the response was, \"We don't believe in sensory integration disorder.\" Hmm.Then came Agency 2. I hadn't had such a good phone experience with the intake coordinator, who was subbing for someone on maternity leave. But the expert who did the evaluation was able to elicit a very different Joy than the one who showed up at Agency 1. Joy seemed comfortable and happy, and ready to interact. Furthermore, we learned that sensory support was integral to their approach, on the theory that a child whose sensory needs aren't being met isn't going to be in the zone for much of any learning at all.Bingo.So Agency 2 is the outfit that we're now starting with. We had an initial workshop meeting at the beginning of the week, and have had several in-home sessions as our team members get to know Joy and the family. Joy has been receptive and charming so far; no surprise, as the initial sessions are structured to be very much child-led, so nobody's explicitly asking her to depart from her own agenda so far (though they are getting her to do a lot of interaction and game-playing that is very much their idea of how to expand on her agenda!)The dilemmas about what kind of treatments to pursue weren't all said and done in this one decision, of course. We've still got the annual dance with the school district, and the whole epilepsy side of things, and more. But this is a big step and a big directional choice.Meanwhile, about Rose and her potty trips. The laxative had an immediate and pronounced effect, at the lowest dose, and it's not the one you're thinking! It was a placebo effect. The very first day Rose took the medicine and started having to keep track of her potty trips, the number of trips dropped down to something like four or five. Who knows what therapies are going to produce what results?!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.healingthresholds.com/therapy/applied-behavior-analysis", "http://meandmyfriends.net/floortime.htm", "http://jamesdmacdonald.org/Articles/MacDonaldStart.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-can-you-possibly-choose.html", "title": "\nHow can you possibly choose?\n"},

I suspected that the King had not left the building...Then this evening a similar situation occurred.  This time Joy had the tube in one hand, a chewy ball in the other.

{"date": "Friday, August 8, 2008", "body": "\nSo Thursday I posted about Joy's upcoming appointment for craniosacral therapy. Here's the update in a nutshell: for the first few hours it looked like astonishing results, but later it was much less clear.Joy was bouncy early Friday morning but definitely had a short fuse. On the way to drop Rose off at summercare, she fussed at the stoplights and bit her shoe and gagged herself with her hand. I could get some smiles out of her if I engaged her energetically (i.e. not while I was driving) but she was cranky if I took my attention elsewhere.The practitioner, we'll call her H., had some toys that were attractive to Joy (note to self: get several of those Koosh-like pufferballs) and Joy played while I got a demo of the approach on me. H. put her hands first on my upper chest and back, then on my head, commented that I had a lot of heat in my cranium, wondered if I'd been having headaches or trouble with temperature regulation. Umm, no, not really. Then she focused a while, made a soft movement, and said, \"There! Did you feel the release?\" Umm... maybe I felt a little bit of a something... I'm pretty suggestible that way though.So then it was on to Joy. She rather followed Joy gently around the room, tried to engage her, then started holding on to her in the belly area. Joy let her hold on for a few secs, then squirmed away but didn't go running. Then she did several holds in the area of Joy's head and neck, keeping her in the interaction for a count of 10 each time, in whatever position Joy wanted to be -- sitting, lying down. She said that Joy's hyoid bone, an odd U-shaped bone in the neck that supports the base of the tongue, was up too high, and that the resultant choking feeling could well be responsible for some of the crankiness and biting/gagging and sleep difficulties we'd been having. She put her hands on Joy there, and after a slight struggle, Joy suddenly swallowed and sighed deeply. Several more interactions in the same vein, and our time was drawing to a close. H. placed small squares of kinesiology tape near Joy's ears where the jaw connects, saying that this would inhibit some of the twisting tension she's felt there. I was surprised that Joy let her do it and let the tape stay without clawing at it. We're to put tape on at least for overnights, but it can stay on as long as Joy's willing to let it be there.Joy was considerably more relaxed than at the start of the appointment, and then had a different species of release, by way of a full diaper. After I finished washing up from that, Joy and H. were hanging out in the waiting room. Joy was just sitting happily on the sofa, making eye contact and smiling at H. Given the opportunity, H. put her hands on Joy's legs, said she could feel the rhythms there too, and she sort of focused in, not even counting out loud this time.  Joy just relaxed right into it.The daycare report later in the day was startling.  All the way up till nap, Joy was chipper and giggly.  She didn't race around teetering and tripping on thing the way she had Wednesday.  She stayed with the other kids and made lots of eye contact and laughed and laughed.  Best daycare-day she's had in a long, long time.But later in the day some of the issues were evident again.  She tried to bite JoyDad a couple of times, gagged herself with her hand, went back to biting her shoe.  She may have still been in a better mood, but it wasn't particularly obvious.  She also still had trouble getting to sleep.I did like H. and the way she interacted with Joy, and Joy's immediate reactions were utterly fascinating.  We've got another appointment in two weeks, so we'll see.Woo knows?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/08/woo-take-2.html", "title": "\nWoo, Take 2.\n"},

Then JoyDad gets out the seizure meds, four chewable pills and one oral syringe (she's very good about taking them, thank goodness!) Then some practice with drinking water from an open cup, to wash it all down.Then I get another turn, holding Joy across my lap on the couch to brush her teeth. She's gotten quite good about letting me get in there with a little toothbrush and toddler toothpaste, though sometimes she shows a bit of displeasure by biting on the bristles! Then after I've done a reasonable job, I put the brush into her hand. \"Here's 'one',\" I say, and she takes several swipes at her teeth and tries to give the brush back. \"Here's 'two',\" comes next, and maybe a single swipe. \"Oh, do better,\" I cajole, helping her swipe a bit more. Then, \"Here's 'three',\" and if she makes a good effort, toothbrushing for the evening is done.Then it's JoyDad's turn once more. He gets to cradle Joy in the livingroom rocking chair, while I hang out on the couch with Rose for some bedtime reading.\"Rock-a-bye Joy, on the treetop,when the wind blows...\"and then he pauses and waits. We've been doing this for years, and Joy had gotten quite good at blowing a bit of air between her lips. Then for several disappointing months, it disappeared, but lately it's back again! Joy says, \"Whfff!\"\"Joy will rock.When the bough breaks...\" another pause. Joy says, \"Cccckkh!\" for the sound of the breaking branch.\"Joy will fall,and down will come Joy, cradle and...\" pause pause pause... Joy concludes, \"Ahhh!\"Next comes \"Twinkle, twinkle\" with more pauses for Joy's input. And then JoyDad talks softly with her about the day, and reviews things she did and saw. When she's had enough, she tells him \"bye-bye!\" (which at one point was \"nigh-nigh!\" but has since morphed.)When it's \"bye-bye\" time, he brings her around for kisses: one from JoyMama, one from Rose, then one (or several) from Daddy himself. Then it's off to zip her into her tented crib, usually for an uninterrupted night.Sweet dreams, sweet Joy!P.S.

{"date": "Saturday, August 2, 2008", "body": "\nTime for another piece of introduction to Joy's complex medical situation: the seizures.The first thing to know is that \"seizures\" and \"epilepsy\" are pretty well interchangeable terms.  If you have more than one seizure, you're considered to have epilepsy.What is a seizure?  According to the Epilepsy Foundation,A seizure happens when a brief, strong surge of electrical activity affects part or all of the brain.How many people have it?By 75 years of age, three percent of the population can be expected to have been diagnosed with epilepsy, and ten percent will have experienced some type of seizure.  Up to 70% of epilepsy is \"idiopathic,\" having no diagnosed cause; up to 40% of people with autism also have epilepsy. The first seizure that we noticed happened at a family gathering in July 2005, when Joy was 14 months old. In her grandparents' living room, sitting on the floor in the middle of a roomful of conversation, she suddenly \"zoned out\" and sat there quivering for what must have been over half a minute. Then she \"came back\" and everything was fine. We shook our heads, commented on how weird it was, and that was all. The second one was like unto the first, several weeks later at a noisy restaurant dinner -- zoned out in her high-chair, with a slight tremble. If I'm remembering right, she got pretty snoozy afterwards too.Those episodes were enough that I mentioned them at her 15-month pediatric appointment. The pediatrician was sufficiently on the ball to get us scheduled for an EEG with a couple of weeks, which was very helpful because during those two weeks, we started having daily episodes. The daily episodes were a little different. Joy's arms would jerk out to her sides, and she'd get a startled look and whimper a bit. Then a few seconds later, another jerk. These sequences lasted up to a minute at a time and were mighty disconcerting to all of us!We were pleased to discover that the pediatric neurologist on duty during the EEG was someone we already knew. He made a special point of coming in during the actual EEG (rather than just reading it later), and though Joy had no visible seizures during the EEG, the pattern was such that he could tell right away that there was abnormal electrical activity going on in there.The very first medication at the very first dose was a big initial winner. The visible seizures disappeared, so thoroughly that the neurologist had us come in for another EEG four months later to see if the underlying pattern was gone too! (It wasn't.) So the medication stayed, and the only side effect we identified was that we're pretty sure it made Joy more hyper than she'd otherwise have been.Unfortunately, the seizures started to re-emerge about a year later, early fall 2006.  At first we weren't even sure we were seeing them, just a little seizure-y flicker out of the corner of our eye, and a passing thought, \"Hm, I wonder if she's about to have another seizure.\"  Her neurologist confirmed that we probably weren't imagining things, and before too long we were back in the world of stronger, longer seizures.  As they got stronger and longer, they looked like this: Joy's arms would fly out to her sides, and her face and body would get stiff.  If she was standing, she'd topple over.  She'd stop breathing for a few seconds, enough to make her face turn red.  (Later, it sometimes got long enough to make her face look blue-ish, and she'd drool and convulse a bit too; right now, we're pretty much back in red-faced territory.)  After she comes out of the seizure, if it's a short one (10 seconds or so), she may pop right up and go about her business.  If it's longer, she may be cranky for half an hour.  If it's a blue-face one, she may be exhausted and limp for half an hour, then inconsolable for the hour after that.So our little neurologist-plus-family team started juggling meds -- first increasing the original one, then adding another, then removing the original and adding a third, then tried to remove the second (NOT good), then re-upped the second and removed the third, then added a fourth.  We also tried a low-glycemic-index diet along the way, sort of an Atkins-diet treatment that was supposed to stay just shy of ketosis, which we followed very faithfully but without any decline in seizures.  We're still on the \"second and fourth\" combo, which puts us into manageable territory, with no side effects that we're aware of (an immense blessing).  We've had some very fine stretches, including something close to a month in April when we had no visible seizures at all.  The day the seizures came back, though, we had SEVEN of them.  More often, the daily record on our calendar looks like this: 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0...  This summer we've noticed a tendency to have more seizures during travel.  The lake-vacation calendar went: 3, 2, 2, 4.We never know when a seizure is coming on, so climbing-play (which Joy loves) and park playground equipment and swimming lessons are all somewhat scary things.  Fortunately, however (touch wood, quick prayer, avert! avert!), we've never needed an emergency room trip, either for the seizures or a resulting fall.Right now, it's just part of our daily adventure with Joy and all of who she is.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/about/", "http://www.med.nyu.edu/cec/treatment/diet/glycemic.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/08/about-seizures.html", "title": "\nAbout the seizures\n"},

We occasionally try to make lists... the count has been as high as 80 a couple of times, only to plummet down into the 15 range after regressions.We're on an upswing right now, it seems.  In fact, two words re-emerged this weekend (whether or not it's an Elvis-sighting kind of thing remains to be seen).  You can deduce quite a bit about our weekend from which words they were: Uh-oh, and no-no-no!There's one very useful word, though, that Joy has retained pretty consistently.  In fact, it seems a shame to count it as just ONE word, because it has so many shades.The word is \"bye-bye\".Here's what it means:\"I can see that you're going now.  Farewell!\"\"I can tell that I'm going now.  Farewell!\"\"You. Go away. Now.\"\"I want to go away!\"\"Goodnight / nigh-nigh / I'm ready to go to bed now.\"That last \"nigh-nigh\" item used to be its own word with an \"n\", but it morphed (as many of Joy's words do.)  Maybe now that \"no-no-no\" is back, we'll get the \"n\" on \"nigh-nigh\" again?Usually it's not too hard to deduce which one Joy means -- for example, if we're rocking her to sleep.  Sometimes it's not quite as clear -- for example, one of the few times she was laid-back enough to hang with me during a worship service, and the fellow who brought the message had finished his sermon, and she busted out with a big loud \"bye-bye!\" as he was stepping down from the microphone.  Was she acknowledging his departure, or was she telling him good-riddance, or both??Well, that's about it from me this morning. I'm going now.

{"date": "Thursday, August 7, 2008", "body": "\nOne of my regular reads is Respectful Insolence, a high-profile blog by a surgeon/scientist known pseudonymously as Orac, who pungently dissects all manner of quackery and pseudoscience and \"woo\", as he calls it. There's plenty of woo out there to dissect, and it makes sense that lots of it is swirling around autism, where the cause is not established and there's no single surefire therapy to recommend and devoted parents will go to the ends of the earth in search of that miracle that might possibly help their child.For the most part, I'm an evidence-based medicine kind of gal.But I'm also open to the concept that Western medicine doesn't have all the answers.I think of my mother, whose journey with kidney cancer lasted an incredible 20+ years. A professor of literature, she was no friend to muddled thinking (to which her composition students could attest!) She pursued her cancer treatments thoughtfully and persistently, and made use of my skills as a librarian to ferret out the latest medical literature. Surgeries comprised most of her treatments. But she also embarked on a trial of high-dose intravenous Vitamin C, a treatment with some serious woo overtones, and credited it with slowing the cancer's growth. She took a carefully-compiled cocktail of nutritional supplements, including pycnogenol and aloe, to the improvement of her fatigue symptoms. And she relied heavily on the prayers of her community.The treatments we have pursued for Joy's epilepsy have been Western all the way. The intensive relationship-based therapy we have chosen for her primary autism treatment does not have as extensive a publication history as Applied Behavioral Analysis, but the literature is growing and we feel confident that it is a good match for Joy's strengths.When it comes to Joy's sensory issues, we're on somewhat more controversial ground, though it's a well-accepted concept among occupational therapists. Her constant, sometimes frantic, search for sensory input is highly apparent to us.But now we're about to go further out on the limb of woo than ever we have gone before. Tomorrow morning Joy has an appointment for craniosacral therapy, occasioned by issues of biting (self and others), teeth-grinding, her intense need to chew, and the intensity with which she tenses up her head and body when she \"stims\" on pine needles or grass or gravel.There's a craniosacral therapy practitioner in town whose name has come up again and again. From Joy's pediatrician. From a high-up source in the agency providing the intensive therapy. Once I started mentioning her name to others, I heard nothing but praise and respect. The therapy itself, however, is often branded as woo (Orac took it on this past June). It sure has plenty of the hallmarks of woo. There are extravagant claims for what kinds of disharmonies it can bring back into balance, and the underlying theory does not inspire confidence: certain rhythms in the body, not acknowledged by Western medicine, can be manipulated by gentle hands-on touch and brought back into balance. From the Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy Association of North America Frequently Asked Questions:The practitioner listens deeply to the fluctuations of the cerebrospinal fluid within the craniosacral system. The fluctuation of the cerebrospinal fluid creates a variety of tides within the system. As the practitioner \u2014 from a place of stillness \u2014 listens to these internal tides, the client's system begins to access its own inner resources \u2026 perhaps a little like finding keys to previously locked doors.Oh my. And yet... Joy's pediatrician finds the practitioner we'll be seeing to be a valued diagnostic partner. And we've heard quite a few personal testimonials by now.By coincidence, or maybe something more than coincidence, I happened upon a fascinating recent post on craniosacral therapy from Barbara, a PhD child-development specialist (& PT & OT) who has experienced the therapy herself. Her post hits very neatly the tone of what I'm feeling going into tomorrow's appointment.Besides, it's not ridiculously expensive, the touch is gentle and... who knows? It might just help.Stay tuned.

{"date": "Thursday, August 14, 2008", "body": "\nAs the mother of a child with autism, I\u2019m occasionally asked what I think about \u201cthe vaccine thing,\u201d i.e. the purported link between vaccines and autism.To answer that question, let me tell you a story. It will seem unrelated at first, but stick with me.From 1956 to 1983, pregnant women in the U.S. suffering from \u201cmorning sickness\u201d had access to an effective medication called Bendectin. Unfortunately during part of that time another medication, thalidomide, was also on the market in a number of countries, as a sedative that also had some nice anti-morning-sickness effects (it was never approved in the U.S., but was distributed to some extent here on an experimental basis). The manufacturers claimed thalidomide was safe for use in pregnancy, though testing had been minimal or non-existent. After the 1957 introduction of the thalidomide, unusual birth defects began to appear in striking numbers. Thalidomide was removed from the market in 1962 and its manufacturers expended great effort in claiming innocence and trying not to be held liable for its awful effects, effects which turned out to be easy to replicate and impossible to deny.Meanwhile, Bendectin continued to rise in popularity, eventually being used by as many as 1 in 10 pregnant women in the U.S. In the wake of the thalidomide disaster, Bendectin came under serious scientific scrutiny \u2013 so much so that perhaps no other medication has ever been so thoroughly studied for use in pregnancy. The results held firm in study after study: no adverse associations with Bendectin were ever established.However, as one might expect in that large a population, a certain number of women taking Bendectin also gave birth to children with birth defects. After what happened with thalidomide, blaming Bendectin \u2013 despite all the studies to the contrary \u2013 was not that big a mental leap. Soon the lawsuits started to pile up. Eventually the manufacturer Merrell Dow pulled the drug off the market due to the financial pressure, but continued to mount an exceptionally successful defense to the various suits that came to trial, among them a class action suit brought by over 800 plaintiffs and an individual case that went all the way up to the Supreme Court and had an impact on evidentiary standards in the process.No plaintiff ever received damages after a Bendectin-related trial. (Current Controversies in the Biological Sciences, p. 170)So, there's been no Bendectin on the market for suffering pregnant women in the U.S. for the past 26 years, with no discernable decline in birth defects. Hospitalizations due to hyperemesis (extreme vomiting) of pregnancy, though, increased considerably. Click here & scroll down to see a chart of the trends. Fortunately for our neighbors to the north, a generic version of Bendectin called Diclectin has been available in Canada all along. And, as my OB advised me during my pregnancies, you can buy Bendectin\u2019s ingredients separately, doxylamine succinate as Unisom and pyridoxine as Vitamin B6, and take \u2018em yourself -- only on the advice of your own physician, please!Now, back to the vaccines.Vaccines do occasionally have adverse effects, sometimes dire ones. To take that fact into account, the U.S. government has set up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), an alternative to the court system that provides for vaccine-injury compensation in cases where a credible scientific rationale can be advanced, without laying all the lawsuits on the backs of the vaccine manufacturers.Thank God for the vaccine court. Because if there were no such process in place, autism-related lawsuits might well drive the vaccines right off the market in the U.S., just like Bendectin, despite all the science that finds no evident connection between vaccines & autism. And there\u2019s no do-it-yourself over-the-counter alternative for protection against pertussis, diphtheria, measles, polio... all those diseases that used to kill and maim so many people before vaccines came on the scene.People get into big online slugfests about vaccines and autism all the time. I'm not really spoilin' for a fight myself, because nobody wins those things. I could wish that coming out online in support of mainstream science and the American Academy of Pediatrics weren't potentially a lightning-rod kind of thing to do! What a world, what a world.Anyway. That's where I'm coming from on the \"vaccine thing.\" Just in case my readers would like to know.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thalidomide.ca/en/information/brochure1.html", "http://tinyurl.com/5lhwk7", "http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-102.ZO.html", "http://books.google.com/books?id=ihI0QPnBkJ0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0", "http://www.nvp-volumes.org/p1_16.htm", "http://www.babyzone.com/pregnancy/trimesters/first_trimester/article/history-bendectin", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/25/science/25autism.html", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=186", "http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/autismfactsforparents.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/08/queasy-comparison.html", "title": "\nA Queasy Comparison\n"},

Both my girls are taking lessons this year, Joy for the first time and Rose for the third summer in a row.In their identically-patterned suits and their matching blonde bobs, they look like quite the matched pair, but their reaction to water is quite different.Rose enjoys getting wet and likes the idea of swimming, but she's been distressingly timid about the actual learning.  She has such a vivid imagination about the terrors that await if she actually picks her feet up from the bottom of the pool!  Her lessons for the first two summers were once weekly through her daycare program, and this year she gets twice a week via summer daycamp.  I think it took her till midway into the second summer before she was willing to attempt \"jump-ins\".  For some reason (maybe she talked a good \"sure I can swim\" show at the beginning of summer?) she got started in a group that was too advanced this summer, and ended up getting demoted two levels, down to the beginner-est level among her peers. Demoralizing, because she knew exactly what was happening.Joy, on the other hand, has loved the water from the start.  She's never complained about hair-washing in the bath, and loves feeling the water all around her.  We were so happy this summer to find a swim-center that does one-on-one lessons for special-needs kiddos, for the same price as their small-group sessions.  The goals of the first level of class at this center are modest: first, to get your child so he or she doesn't cry the whole session!  We conquered that on the very first lesson -- the only time Joy cried was when it was time to get out.  She has since submitted gamely to getting her face into the water regularly, and has begun to attempt to kick her legs.Both girls had a stellar week last week (I swim with Rose down at the far end of the pool while Joy and the other classes are having their lessons in the other half of the pool).  Joy has discovered jump-ins, and willingly splashes forward down into the arms of her teacher -- they put another staffer behind her at poolside to keep her from running away when she's on the edge preparing to jump, having learned their lesson last month.At the same time, Rose has finally discovered that she can swim a forward crawl (\"ice-cream-scoops\") or breast-stroke (\"pizza arms\") for the length of an entire breath.  So there I was last week at one end of the pool, watching my younger daughter leap in with a lovely splash at the other end of the pool, with my older daughter repeatedly swimming out to me from the edge.I'm so proud of both my little swimmers!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/08/proud-of-both-my-little-swimmers.html", "title": "\nProud of both my little swimmers\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 23, 2008", "body": "\nForthwith, the promised update on Joy's Friday CST session.Joy's had a very \"stimmy\" week, on the whole, and yesterday was no exception.  Our cranio-sacral practitioner, H., was running a little bit late when we arrived, but showed us into the therapy room so Joy could play.  Joy quickly pulled out a whole bunch of stimmy toys (kooshes, bristle blocks) and distributed them around the room, bouncing from one toy to the other like a ping-pong ball and squishing them between her hands and chewing on them.  She's got a very intense interaction with her stim-items, in which she tenses up her shoulders and face and jaw and vocalizes through her teeth: \"eeee\" or \"gooo\".  We've been concerned about it and hoping that cranio-sacral can provide some assistance.When H. came into the room, Joy greeted her with a big smile but continued to go at it with the toys.  H. began to follow her around and try to take hold of her, and Joy played it almost like a chase game.  She didn't mind when H. \"got\" her but she did try to struggle away between the giggles.  She never did really accept the holds this time, though perhaps was somewhat more relaxed toward the end.First H. worked on Joy's belly, saying that her diaphragm was tight and it could be making it hard to catch a good deep breath.  She again did the trick of counting as she pressed her fingers up toward Joy's diaphragm, so that Joy would have the sense that an endpoint would be coming.  Joy thought they were playing another game, and every time H. got to \"1, 2, 3\" Joy would chime in with a big \"Go!\"Next was the head.  H. said that Joy's head was very tight and she was holding a lot of heat in her cranium.  Joy has been running pretty hot on and off for the last few weeks, and the tension thing makes at least some sense because of what Joy does during the stimming (though is it cause, or effect?)  H. spoke of two potential reasons behind the stimming.  One would be a response to the tightness, as when you have a headache and you put her hands to your head as if pushing on the outside will help the internal pressure.  Second would be a sensory-need attempt to get a biochemical burst akin to a runner's high -- which could be more efficiently provided by heavy-work such as jumping, crawling, crashing, pulling.Anyway, H. spent the rest of the session working on Joy's head and upper chest, occasionally checking the \"rhythms\" by holding her legs.  She said she did manage to release a lot of heat and tension in the head, that she'd gotten the rhythms stronger and more even, and that Joy's neck (where she'd worked last time) was still in good shape.  I asked what to look for in the coming days, and she said to look for a reduction in the duration and intensity of the stimminess.Joy remained intense with her stims through the whole session, through the day and  the evening as well.H. did give two particularly helpful pieces of advice.  One was the advice to try and guide the stimming behavior into something more heavy-work related, games of jumping or running or trying to pull away.  The other was that she identified that Joy was dehydrated, which impressed me because in fact we've had some trouble getting enough liquids into her lately.  H. tied the dehydration into the heat-in-the-cranium thing.  Whatever one thinks of that particular link, we do need to get Joy to drink more.  So both of those were things that it was helpful to hear.I'll be taking Joy back at least one more time, in another two weeks.  Unfortunately I can't send JoyDad, because there weren't any Saturday appointments!  Oh well.Meanwhile, speaking of JoyDad, one of his colleagues forwarded him an interesting e-mail announcement: a CST training session for laypersons.This is a hands-on session which will teach techniques to relieve pain and promote relaxation by using basic CranioSacral Therapy techniques:Discover how to recognize the rhythm of the craniosacral system. Learn a basic CranioSacral Therapy techniques that you can perform yourself. Experience a sense of control over your innate ability to provide healing energy to others and yourself.

{"date": "Sunday, August 17, 2008", "body": "\nWhy buy something fancy and expensive when you can hit or miss just as well with something homemade and cheap?First up for consideration is our big homemade crash pillow.  This is an unqualified hit.  I first saw one of these at Joy's intensive therapy service provider's offices.It's nothing more than a huge homemade pillow, full of chunks of soft stuff.  The one at the office was filled with foam remnants from a mattress factory.  In fact, a mattress factory in our area had been making such pillows free of charge for community members with autism, but they had a closed waiting list by the time I contacted them.  Then I'll make one myself, said the little red hen!  And she did.The case is a king-size flat sheet -- you can pick one up at a thrift store for couple of bucks.  I just folded it in half, nice-side in, and ran a 1/2-inch seam most of the way around with my trusty 1970s-vintage sewing machine, leaving an opening for filling.  Then I turned it right-side out and stuffed it with finds from around the house: the contents of ratty old pillows, a chopped-up \"egg-carton\" foam pad we had lying around.  Get the kids to help with the stuffing!  Then stitch up the opening by hand and you're good to go.The pillow is pictured above folded up against the wall, in case Joy and Rose want to take a running start for a good big crash, as below.  The pillow is big enough for Joy and me to crash together, or Joy and Rose, yet flexible enough that you can fold it over a kid for good big full-body squishes.  Rose has even napped on it a time or two.Next up is the infamous Bucket-o-Beans.  This one went over the line from huge hit into too big a hit, and must currently be classified as a miss.  Maybe it can come back later.The Bucket-o-Beans is simply an 18-gallon plastic tote, with 20 pounds of dried pinto beans poured in.  A sensory-seeker's paradise, originally recommended to us by Joy's first occupational therapist.Joy loves to sit in the beans, and have them rubbed on her body, and stim in them with her hands.  For a while it was a nice sensory-input option, and a fun way both to contain her and interact with her -- she'd pull my hands down into the beans, for instance, to request that I rub them on her.Alas, the Bucket-o-Beans descended into addiction, to the point that the ONLY reason Joy ever wanted to go downstairs to the basement was to get into the beans.  Then she'd throw a tantrum when it was time to get out.  First we had to hide the Bucket-o-Beans away.  Then we had to hide a similar unrelated tote that held food for our pet rabbits, because Joy was convinced it held the B-E-A-N-S.  Yes, we have to spell it out now, or risk bringing on the urge and the ensuing fuss if we slip and say the word.Other things to be aware of with the B-E-A-N-S:They can be swallowed whole, and exit whole as well, swollen to about 3 times their original size.  (Did I really need to tell you that?)They can be scattered all over the place, especially when a kid gets out, and even more so if the tote tips over.Use under supervision, and be aware of the lid if your little one likes to create cozy enclosed spaces.  Most such totes come with suffocation warnings.All that being said, it's a way-cool and inexpensive option for kids who relish and need such input.  I'm hoping that some months down the road, it might be useful for Joy again.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SKgkgZkbMWI/AAAAAAAAABw/pvdtv7sZBIw/s1600-h/crash-pillow.JPG", "http://www.bres.boothbay.k12.me.us/wq/nnash/WebQuest/little_red_hen.htm", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SKglSsU-J9I/AAAAAAAAACA/zqwIrf2tDEg/s1600-h/crash-in-progress.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SKgkz0agrWI/AAAAAAAAAB4/cqEOUTuXL2k/s1600-h/bucket-o-beans.JPG"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/08/product-hits-misses-homemade-edition.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses: Homemade Edition\n"},

We're pretty clearly back in seizure-land at this point, going at the rate of one knock-down per day with several disorienting single-jerks (plus the ongoing internal electrical storm that has been present for the past two years at least).  Good news is, there was only the one big blue-lipper so far.  The subsequent ones have been about 10 seconds in duration and have been much easier to shake off.Then there's the awesome meat-space community (so to speak)!We've got such a wonderful network through our church.  The mom with whom we used to daycare-swap has coordinated for us a full roster of volunteers to accompany Joy one-on-one at Sunday School and nursery, plus give me a few minutes before and after worship for conversation.  There are enough volunteers that nobody needs to step in more than once a month, and Joy is accepting enough of a wide range of helpers that this rotating whirl doesn't seem to faze her.There's also a strong neighborhood network.  On Friday I needed to go to Rose's end-of-summer-camp party, which conflicted with one of Joy's home therapy sessions, and there needs to be a parent or other adult in the house for the therapy to take place.  One phone call next door, and the neighbor on the other side of the fence (who brought the potato salad to the fence party) was all lined up to come on over.I was able this week to line up two other neighborhood moms with Rose-aged kids to take on the regular task of getting Rose home from school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, because that too conflicts with Joy's therapy hours.On top of that, I've got a list of eight families (spanning neighborhood and church) willing to be called on short notice if we are in need of a bit of respite Joy-care, plus three other families who didn't think Joy-care was up their alley but would help by bringing a meal if need be.And then there's the dear friend who brought her daughter over for a spur-of-the-moment playdate Friday night after the end-of-summer-camp party, and brought wine as well so she & I could each have a glass as the summer sun went down...I could list more, but that gives you a flavor for it!

{"date": "Tuesday, September 2, 2008", "body": "\nI gleefully blogged a little while ago about ditching Joy's ratty old cloth diapers (of course we saved them for primo rags!) in favor of disposables funded by Medical Assistance (MA), which are delivered to our doorstep.The other side of that story is more forehead-slapping than gleeful.  Joy actually qualified for Medical Assistance in April 2007, when we went on the waiting list for the intensive autism therapy that she's finally now receiving.  We were excited to qualify because we thought we'd need that support to fund some therapy in between the time she aged out of Birth-to-Three (May 2007) and the time she got picked up by the school district (September 2007).  But then we actually got our regular insurance to cover speech and occupational therapy for the summer.  The only things we ended up doing with that MA card were that Birth-to-Three pounced upon the chance to bill MA instead of absorbing April & May's therapies themselves, and that we got a discounted annual membership to the local children's museum.Then July 2008, when we came to the top of the waiting list, we got a new county caseworker.  In our first meeting, she told me that MA would cover the co-pays for Joy's epilepsy meds, plus now that Joy was four, diapers would be covered too.  Well, we hadn't missed too many potentially-covered months on the diaper front since she just turned 4 at the end of May.  But the co-pays, that we'd been ponying up all this time!  It turned out that we even could have back-billed those co-pays for an entire year, but for the fact that we'd been good consumers and had used pre-tax dollars through a Flexible Spending Account. So we couldn't go back and double-dip.How do you know what it is that you don't know?I went to a wonderful informational meeting the other day.  It was held at the agency that runs our town's Birth-to-Three program, and featured a speaker from our Regional Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs (CYSHCN) center.  I'd never heard of the center before, or at least hadn't remembered it due to its awful crunchy unmemorable name.  However, it turns out that it's a government-funded information service (read: no cost for the call) where parents can call to learn about local resources for their kids with special needs.  The resource person gives you suggestions about available services, and then follows up with you later to see what success you've had accessing those services.There were 5 moms around the table, having kids with different challenges and different ages, all avidly drinking in the information and taking notes and collecting handouts.  Then we started exchanging information too, and things really got rolling.  I learned the names of local epilepsy-support contact people, and that MA may pay for travel & lodging if you have to travel for a necessary medical service, and about a medical ID bracelet with downloadable information.  I had a few nuggets to share too - the other moms hadn't heard about the children's museum discount, for example (nor had the speaker!)Then despite that lovely information-rich session, and having talked there about my whole MA/diapers/co-pay experience, I learned something new in the comments when I posted about diapers... Trish gave this excellent advice:Just make sure the doctor checks \"no generics\" on the prescription or you will get the cheapest diapers known to man!! Gah!  Trish, the delivery service that our caseworker recommended only has \"generics\" available, so we're working with that at this point.  But see, there we go again -- I didn't know what I didn't know and nobody told me up front!I'm a librarian, so information is my stock in trade.  I'm very good at ferreting things out when I've got a known question (and even at getting library users to clarify what question they're really digging for when they don't ask it very straightforwardly).  But when I don't know what I don't know, and am not aware that there's even a question I should be asking, I'm as stuck as the next person.Blogging is one answer, I suppose.  Regular in-person support groups with other parents in a similar boat, where things can come up in discussion, is another.  (That's one thing I don't have going right now, despite my otherwise-awesome local support network.)How do my fellow special-needs parents out in bloggy-land cope with this?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_spending_account", "http://www.mch-hotlines.org/web/mch/home.nsf/Menu/11C1BA40450D0F2F86256F3F00749851!opendocument", "http://www.carememoryband.com/", "http://anotherpieceofthepuzzle.com/", "http://www.hdis.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/09/not-knowing-what-you-dont-know.html", "title": "\nNot Knowing What You Don't Know\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, September 21, 2008", "body": "\nEach fall, our congregation reserves a couple of group campsites at a state park and we gather out in the woods for a loosely-planned weekend of fellowship and camping.  This year was the first year since Joy's birth that we've actually dared to try & tent-camp overnight as a family.  Herewith, the campout story.The Diagnostic VersionWe almost didn't go.  The night before we were going to drive up to the park, Joy woke up crying THREE times.  This never happens.  She almost always sleeps through, and if she does wake, she usually stims and babbles herself back to sleep, rather than crying loudly.  JoyDad reported that on one of the occasions, she was grabbing at her head.  Plus, after the third waking, we gave her ibuprofen and then she finally fell asleep for the rest of the night.We suspected ear infection.  She's had quite a few, though it's been a while.  It's very hard to tell, though, because she has an enormous pain tolerance and an out-of-kilter sensory system and doesn't have the language to tell us when something hurts.  She had just the slightest edge of a fever.  So I took her in to Urgent Care when they opened for the morning (of course this always happens on a weekend, right?)Well, Joy's ears were clear.  And her throat looked fine.  And her mood was improving by the minute.  So when I got her home from the check, we packed up and went.It turned out to be a lovely time.  We set up Joy's PeaPod travel bed inside the tent, where she took a nice afternoon rest and then slept the night without complaint.  She didn't really do any dashing at all, nor did she try to play with the campfire.  Instead, she ran around within the confines of the camp area, but deliberately kept looking back to interact with whomever was tailing her.  She also managed to come on a bit of a hike with me and a couple of friends.  And she ate well, and smiled a lot, and generally did great.Oh, and no seizures, though our party-count-clock has been set back with a night-time seizure last week.  (Which shouldn't count.  But I think it does.)So why did the campout go so well?1)  Maybe she's settling in to a recent epilepsy-meds dosage increase.2)  Maybe having had a whole summer to experience a backyard fence has helped reduce her urge to dash.3)  Maybe the intensive autism therapy is starting to get her into an increasingly interactive mode, which we'd love to credit for some of the wanting to be with people.4)  Maybe we just hit it lucky with a good-mood weekend.And maybe I'm wayyy over-analyzing this and should learn to live in the moment!  So, here goes again:The In-The-Moment VersionWe were so happy to be able to go camping with our friends from church, after briefly thinking that we wouldn't be able to go.It turned out to be a lovely time.  We set up Joy's PeaPod travel bed inside the tent, where she took a nice afternoon rest and then slept the night without complaint.  She didn't really do any dashing at all, nor did she try to play with the campfire.

{"date": "Saturday, September 13, 2008", "body": "\nRegression.  Possibly THE most frustrating aspect of Joy's development, for me anyway.For those not living in autism-land themselves, it might surprise you to learn that big regressions are not necessarily a part of the autism trajectory.  The most highly-publicized autism stories (especially in the \"what causes autism\" controversy accounts) often involve a great big regression at some point in the first two years of life.  The child retreats into him- or herself, becomes withdrawn, loses language, almost seems like a different person -- and when the stunned parents go looking for a diagnosis, autism is what they discover.While this is definitely one piece of the autism story, it is by no means what everyone experiences.  Some kids with autism don't regress at all, others plateau, others show symptoms from the beginning and then regress, others have multiple regressions over time.  There's a nice round-up of several studies on autism-related regression in a June 2008 IAN Research Report (the Interactive Autism Network, sponsored by Autism Speaks).  One of the studies they cite found 46% of their sample of kids on the autism spectrum had experienced regression, but only 30% of those reported normal development up to that point.  Another study with a stricter definition of regression found regression in their sample in only 11.8% of children with autism and 5.5% of children elsewhere on the autism spectrum.  Joy's in the \"early symptoms\" and \"multiple regressions over time\" categories.I blogged in July about the \"early symptoms\" (When Did You First Notice...?)  We definitely had a whole cascade of symptoms before we hit a regression, from language problems to interaction deficits to sensory issues, with whipped cream and seizures on top.The first regression was subtle enough that we didn't catch it in progress.  Sometime in late fall of 2006, at the age of 2 1/2, Joy started losing words and started ramping up with behavior issues.  The timing was probably pretty good, if you can say such a thing, because we'd been waiting for an appointment with a prominent developmentalist who specialized in autism, and the appointment was Dec. 21.  That's when we got the autism diagnosis, and the doctor pointed out autism issues left and right.  She chastised me for having filled out forms describing Joy in far too glowing terms, and told me that I'd better mend my ways when applying for intensive autism therapy, because you have to paint the bleakest version of truth to have the best chance of getting the therapies you need.And let me digress here to say what a soul-killing reality this is, on an annual basis or more, for parents of kids with special needs.  At least every year for the school district, and sometimes more often than that, we have to focus on what our children can't do, in order to advocate for them and get them the best services we can.  How screwed up is that?!Anyway.  The doctor also chastized our Birth-to-Three representative, who was so kind as to accompany us to the appointment, for not recognizing the autism.  We all felt rather wrung-out by the end of the appointment.  Merry Christmas 2006 to all!What we hadn't yet put together was that Joy's first big regression had been happening between the time I filled out those forms and the time she got the diagnosis.  The most obvious piece of the regression was that she went from about 80 words to about 20.  Even that, though, can be hard to track.  Think about it -- if you're even keeping track of your kiddo's words for the baby book, you write them down when you start hearing them, and then you consider them mastered.  What you don't anticipate is that any utterance of that word might be the last time you hear it for goodness-knows-how-long.  When do you realize that you haven't heard that word for a while?  In a week?  In a month?Our tracking system got much better when we started a private Yahoo! group for Joy and started trading daily updates with Lynda the daycare lady, wherein I also began describing the Birth-to-Three therapy sessions.  In this way we were able to track how Joy came out of the regression over the course of the summer.  Then in the fall she started with the school district and those therapists started contributing reports of every session to our lovely online archive, documenting some very nice progress.  We were back up over 80 words, starting to do some color matching, stringing chunky beads, beginning to stack Legos....And then came Christmas 2007.  This time we saw it right away, though it probably was only a little more extreme than the first time.  It happened over Christmas break.  Joy started losing words again, wouldn't tolerate being in the Sunday school classroom, had a behavioral down-spiral.  In February 2008 we think she had a virus that made things even worse.Good things have happened since then, for sure.  Joy has begun to lead people by the hand to what she wants.  We've established some nice new helper routines.  Some words have come back (like ma-ma-ma-ma-ma!)  She re-entered the Sunday school classroom in June.  She has begun to initiate peek-a-boo games.  Much to be happy about!On the other hand, we haven't seen the level of language recovery that we did the prior summer.  And Christmas is coming again in three months...That's the worst of it, I think.  Christmas is coming again, or we may see a regression sooner, or maybe later, or maybe never again.  And we never know, from day to day, whether this day will be the last day that she says ma-ma-ma for the next year.  We can't take any gain for granted.  And that's very, very hard.The IAN report I linked to earlier was also reporting on its own data collection about regression.  Very unscientific, not peer-reviewed, self-selected respondents, self-reported information.  However, despite all those caveats, there was this fascinating chart, with the big question on the chart in red:In other words, maybe someone will start taking notice of late regressions, or multiple regressions?  Maybe there's some fodder here for future research, instead of focusing autistic-regression research solely on those big initial regressions, which, devastating as they are, by no means tell the whole regression story.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iancommunity.org/cs/ian_research_reports/ian_research_report_jun_2008", "http://www.iancommunity.org/cs/ian_research_reports/ian_research_report_jun_2008"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/09/regression-analysis.html", "title": "\nRegression Analysis\n"},

If I worry too much about the future and the next regression that might (or might not) be around the corner, there are many glorious Joy-moments that might not get the appreciation they deserve.Like all the peek-a-boo games yesterday!One of Joy's intensive autism therapists was the first to elicit it, a week ago.  Joy has always loved peek-a-boo games, and has been pulling the blanket away from our faces to peek for a long time now.  Last week, though, the therapist reported that Joy held up the blanket TO HER OWN FACE and did a peek!  Turn-taking, imitation, initiation, social awareness, all in one tasty package!Joy showed off her new skill a couple of times during the past week, with great big grins and giggles.  Then yesterday, she decided it was her favorite new thing to do.  We spent long spells peek-ing, sometimes at my initiation, sometimes at hers, sometimes between Joy and JoyDad.  She was enjoying holding up that blanket so much, I sometimes had to playfully grab it away to get a turn in edgewise!My favorite interaction, though, was at one point when I came upstairs and she initiated the game, holding up the blanket to peek.

We're fortunate to live in one of the counties offering Project Lifesaver, a locator service for people at risk of becoming lost and not having the wherewithal to get themselves found again.  Here's an article I linked to in a prior post, talking about the partnership between Project Lifesaver and law enforcement. We had to call our local sheriff's department to start the process.  We set up an appointment, and this week two deputies came out with the equipment and a stack of forms to fill out.  It's always interesting when forms try to cover multiple situations (in this case a range from kids with autism to elders with dementia or Alzheimers) -- some of the questions can be laughably inapplicable!In addition to the bracelet on Joy's ankle, about the size of a women's digital wristwatch, we were given an ID number and transmitter-frequency number.  In case of an escape emergency, we're to call 911 and tell them that we're with Project Lifesaver.  If we didn't happen to have the numbers on us, they could look them up, but having the numbers saves a few moments of time.  We also got a small battery-tester device, that we're to test the anklet with once a day and record the results.  Then at the beginning of each month, we have to pay a visit with Joy to the sheriff's department, turn in our testing log, and get a new battery and band.  Batteries should last 45 days, but they change them monthly to be sure, and you get a new band because they have to cut the old band to get at the battery.Joy didn't like getting the band put on, and tugged at it a couple of times the first evening, but since then has pretty much ignored it.  I was glad to see that it wasn't as big a device as I was fearing.  It would be less publicly noticeable if she'd wear it on her wrist like a watch, but I think she'd probably be biting at it all day.  We're going into fall weather anyway, so it'll be invisible under long pants except at swimming lessons and such (yes, it's waterproof!)There are consumer products on the market to do this kind of tracking, such as Ion Kids, but in our county at least, Project Lifesaver is grant and donation-funded for now, and also gets us that partnership going with law enforcement first-responders.So leaving aside our speedy radio-tagged gazelle, there's another kind of tagging I wanted to address.  For my family readers who don't inhabit the blog world on a regular basis... I've discovered that there's a practice among bloggers that has a bit of a chain-letter vibe to it, where bloggers get a set of fun questions and answer them in a blog post, and then \"tag\" several other bloggers that they'd like to see playing the game as well.  (Here's an example from Trish at Another Piece of the Puzzle.)Bloggers also can recognize one another's work and create links to their favorite reads by means of awards.  I was recently recognized by Barbara at TherExtras with the \"Premio al esfuerzo personal\" for \"excellence in the expression of values in a blog\".  The values in question in this case, as defined by the award giver: \"movement [as in body, not the other b-word], personal responsibility, politeness, acceptance, words used well, and love.\"  Thank you Barbara!  I'm honored!I'm also going to break the rules, because what I'm supposed to do is post the rules that go along with the award, and then pass the award along further.  I'm going to respectfully decline the opportunity, with thanks.  In general, I figure not to participate in \"tagging\", mostly because as I said yesterday, my post ideas are outrunning my time.  If you do tag me with the fun-questions sort of thing, I may answer in your comments, but probably not on my blog.However, I can't finish this particular post without also acknowledging having received another honor, one that I don't have to feel guilty about not passing along because it's all mine!  In honor of our meeting last week, Mama Mara says, \"I officially dub JoyMama as Mama Mara's goddess of freaking miracles.\"  Much appreciated, Mama Mara -- you rock, too!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SMO5t_P5VUI/AAAAAAAAADo/zK-bihRuL-g/s1600-h/tagged.jpg", "http://www.madison.com/tct/news/296350", "http://www.ion-kids.com/", "http://anotherpieceofthepuzzle.com/trish-needs-a-makeover-amongst-other-things", "http://www.therextras.com/.a/6a00e008d851bd883400e554e2a6eb8833-320wi", "http://www.therextras.com/therextras/2008/09/words-well-used.html", "http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2008/09/its-world-of-hope.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/09/tagged.html", "title": "\nTagged!\n"},

{"date": "Friday, September 26, 2008", "body": "\nJoy's grandpa, my father, sent me an e-mail the other day about a world premiere dance performance he had attended this weekend, together with Joy's grandma.  We talked about it the following day, and the conversation & e-mail are blended together in the words below.  ========On Saturday evening Joy's grandma and I went to Wichita State University for the world premiere of a new dance work titled \"beyond.words.\" \"Beyond.words\" was created to raise autism awareness.   It was a deeply moving experience.     Seven performers from the New York dance company \"dre.dance,\" joined by seventeen performers from the Wichita State University dance program, performed the work.   The hour-long work portrays the life of one person on the autism spectrum, from youth to manhood to middle age.  The dance movements are based upon repetitive motions, stimming activity, wild running, etc. typical of autistic persons.  We recognized a lot of what we have seen in Joy.  Having chased Joy up and down the hallways at church, I almost laughed to see seven or eight dancers running full tilt across the stage and then dashing back.  At times I thought I was feeling what it might be like to be inside the brain of someone with autism, there was so much going on.Some of it was strange and frightening.  Much of it was beautiful.  It brought us to the edge of tears.      The creators of the new work are Andrew Palermo, a dance master, and Taye Diggs, a Broadway-movie-TV star.  Palermo has been artist in residence at Wichita State University for the past year.      In a talk-back session after the peformance, the dancers spoke with enthusiasm about their visit to a local autism therapy facility where they had done part of the work and been received warmly.  The work intends to \"raise awareness that autism is not something to be 'cured' but to be accepted.\"      Palermo and Diggs plan to take \"beyond.words\" on a national and world tour next fall.  Anyone with concerns or connections to persons on the autism spectrum would be enriched by seeing this show.========UPDATE: I've found another blog-review of beyond.words that goes into more detail on the story-line of the work.JoyMama again -- my father also pointed me in the direction of an article in the Wichita Eagle from the day before the performance, with more interview goodies from the show's creators.  He said that there has been some criticism of the work to the effect that it glorifies autism, making the strange and sometimes-disturbing movements of autism into beautiful dance and turning it into more gift than burden.  To which I say... what a lovely corrective.  We could use to see more of that facet of the complex truth that is autism.  It helps to counterbalance the bruise-and-bite side of things!I wish I could have been there, and I sure appreciate the review and the chance to share it.  Thank you to my father for being so attuned to life with Joy, and for contributing to the blog as well as faithfully following it!P.S.

First we had the camping trip, and then after we got back on Sunday and had lunch, she had a playdate with a classmate from school.  When she got to her friend's house, another classmate was there too, and then her friend's little sister (about Joy's age) woke up from nap and the four of them ran around like crazy.Later in the evening, Rose talked me into watching a bit of football on TV with her instead of our usual bedtime reading.  (Is she her daddy's daughter, or what?)  As we watched, out of the blue, she suddenly said, \"I wonder what it would be like if Joy didn't have autism and epilepsy, and she could play with me more.\"I figured out right away that this was coming from the playdate experience with her friend's little sister, and Rose confirmed that this was what she'd been thinking.  I was happy that my voice stayed steady as I agreed, yes, that things would be different.  And then I mused that it would probably be different too to be like her best friend  who doesn't have a sister or brother at all.  Or to be like one family we know where there are something like 6 or 7 years between the older brother and the Joy-aged brother.  Yes, Rose agreed, that would be different too.Then she came back to Joy, and she reminded herself (I didn't even have to say it!) that she does play peek-a-boo and chase with Joy, and that they do have fun. And then Rose said that even if things were different, \"I would still love her anyway.\"And then the ref threw a flag and the conversation turned back to the football game, and she hoped the flag was against the Packers.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-wonder-what-it-would-be-like-if.html", "title": "\nI wonder what it would be like if...?\n"},

{"date": "Friday, October 10, 2008", "body": "\nOur vegetable gardening is one of my favorite spinning plates of the summer months.I learned to love gardening from my father, and the basics of preserving what we grew from my mother and my father's mother.  The backyard garden behind the house where I grew up was a continually expanding project.  Every year Dad would rototill up just another smidge of lawn, until eventually the garden ballooned to take up almost a third of the yard.Our main vegetable patch here has stayed stable at 20-some feet per side, but we expand by finding new flowerbeds in which to plant produce.  Rhubarb replaced hostas; basil replaced pampas grass; okra (with its beautiful hibiscus flowers!) replaced rose canes; a strawberry bed replaced a stand of Snow-on-the-Mountain; and this year my front flower bed held rainbow chard instead of salvia.When the garden is in full swing, it's a feast for the eyes as well as the tummy.  Here's a shot JoyDad took back in August:Especially great crops this year: bok choy, kohlrabi, beans, peppers, the aforementioned chard.  Strawberries and sour-cherries did pretty well too, as did the rhubarb and okra.  Also mulberries, not in our yard but we picked and froze a whole bunch from a tree on nearby park property.  JoyDad keeps pickling hot-peppers:Joy is willing to partake of just about everything we grow, even the kohlrabi and the pickled beets!  Rose's favorites are the fruit and the sweet peppers and the cherry tomatoes.  She likes rhubarb upside-down cake too.I know I keep harping on the difference this summer's new fence has made to life with Joy in our back yard, but it's really helped with the gardening too.  I can now let Joy play on her own nearby while I pick raspberries or go into the (separately fenced) garden to do some harvesting or pull a few weeds.  So liberating to only have to keep half an eye on her!The garden is winding down for the fall now, though.  We've had a couple of almost-frosts which have slowed everything down.  The tomatoes are petering out, we'll get one more bok-choy stir-fry, the beets and beans are all in, pretty soon it will be time to bring in the butternut squash.Growing so much food is a help to the pocketbook in these troubled economic times.  But mostly it's good for the tastebuds, and the soul!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SO9w9Ki0fzI/AAAAAAAAAFY/DAJ6vSOKnTw/s1600-h/produce.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SO9xhXTnizI/AAAAAAAAAFg/wcGVHYU48xw/s1600-h/peppers.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/fall-comes-to-garden.html", "title": "\nFall Comes to the Garden\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 5, 2008", "body": "\nThere's a song about swinging, based on a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson, that I sing to Joy & Rose, that my mother used to sing to me, that her mother used to sing to her.  (In case you're keeping track, that would be Joy's great-grandmother, who is 99 years old and reads this blog regularly.  Hi, Grandma!)How do you like to go up in a swingUp in the air so blue?Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thingEver a child can do!Swinging, swinging, up in the air so blue,Swinging, swinging, up in the air so blue!Joy has (almost) always loved to swing.  She's long outgrown the baby swing, of course, but we have photos where we'd put her in the chair and flipped the switch to set the thing rocking, and it made her so happy.  Later we made copious use of the swings at the park, and Joy's occupational therapist taught us to swing her in a blanket, telling us that the swinging was useful input to Joy's vestibular system.  Therapeutic and fun, too, what a package!But then at Christmas 2007, Joy had a major regression and her internal swing switch flipped to the \"off\" position.  We first noticed in a January therapy session.  In December she'd practically begged for blanket-swinging, to the point that we were using it as reward; in January, she wanted nothing to do with it.When spring came, we learned the extent of her new aversion to swinging.  At the park, I couldn't even get her into the toddler swings that had delighted her so much the previous fall.  At the zoo, her beloved grin-filled carousel rides had become occasions for strenuous complaint.  She didn't even like the stroller rides back and forth walking her sister to school.This lasted all the way to mid-September, a couple of weeks ago.Then, apropos of nothing that we can identify, the switch flipped back \"on\".Gleeful swinging at the park.  Big smiles on the zoo carousel.  Zero protests on the stroller rides.  So much renewed joy!What is it that flips her internal switches?  It's been a useful metaphor for me lately in thinking about how Joy operates.  This probably won't be the last time you find me using it.Meanwhile, how do you like to go up in a swing, up in the air so blue?========P.S.  We're back from the northwoods.

{"date": "Thursday, October 23, 2008", "body": "\nBack toward the beginning of October, I reported that Joy had suddenly begun to enjoy swinging again, after having gone suddenly \"off\" anything swinging-related the previous Christmas.  It was, I said, akin to a sudden flipping of a switch somewhere inside her head.  And I said that the switch-flipping metaphor was making a lot of sense to me, and you'd probably hear me using it again.Well, here it is.  Behold, the extended metaphor: The above is a high-falutin' mixer board at Smart Studios, where JoyDad's band did the mixing work on their latest CD.  (Smart Studios was founded by Butch Vig of Garbage, and has done work for Nirvana & Smashing Pumpkins as well).But a sound board or light board would work too, anything with a bunch of flip switches and fader/dimmer switches and a variety of knobs.Here's the thing.  Sometimes with Joy, attributes or abilities or favorites change suddenly, like the flip of a two-position switch, as happened with the swinging.  Sometimes we get a dimmer switch, like a strange fading of language that has happened in the last couple of weeks (she's basically using no words now).  Meanwhile another dimmer switch for experimental vocalizations has been slowly turning on.  The biting, fortunately, has faded off, and is now reduced to a rather cute occasional nibbling of toes.  Expressing frustration by throwing things, meanwhile, has faded on.When a whole bunch of switches slam to off all at once (or fade to off fairly rapidly), we call it a regression.  But more often, faders are going in different directions, and we don't quite know if they're related, or what might be causing what.I was talking with JoyDad about this and asked if I could use his photo, and he told me another really cool aspect about the board at Smart: the switches are motorized and you can actually see them moving as a recording plays.  Cool, and a little spooky.The fact that Joy's switches do go both ways feels spooky to me in general.  Neurotypical kids, their switches don't do this as much, at least when it comes to learning.  Likes and desires are a different matter, but once a kid learns words, you expect the words to be there.  Once she can stack blocks, you don't figure you're going to find yourself teaching it all over again.I did have the thought to extend the metaphor still further, something about the hands of the Almighty dancing across Joy's mixer board or some such.  But then I started reading Look Me In the Eye, by John Elder Robison, gifted writer and blogger and proud Aspergian.  (Thank you, Jess, for nudging me to get reading on this!)  I just got to the part where Robison writes about his engineering experiences doing audio and lights and over-the-top special effects work for a certain high-profile entertainment act.  His description of working the light board in the chapter \"One With The Machine\" is, alas, too long to reproduce here, so I'll just quote one sentence:It's just like playing a huge musical instrument, and your hands never stop moving on the dimmers.So now my reverent image of omnipotent fingers on Joy's dimmer switches is hopelessly conflated with a mental picture of the young John Elder Robison working the lightboard in a huge arena... Sometimes metaphors extend in really wild directions!Does the sound-board / light-board / mixer-board metaphor work for anyone else?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SQCeuv0c4iI/AAAAAAAAAGw/cufbhLoEFcc/s1600-h/smart-studios.jpg", "http://www.smartgeeks.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SQCkt3SmDsI/AAAAAAAAAG4/A77G7twk4C8/s1600-h/LookMeInTheEye.jpg", "http://jerobison.blogspot.com/", "http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/at-what-cost/", "http://www.kissonline.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/extended-metaphor.html", "title": "\nExtended Metaphor\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 7, 2008", "body": "\nIt was a long ride for a short vacation -- seven hours in the car each way, leaving early Friday morning (3:30am!) and back home by Sunday afternoon.  In between, there was a lot of work to do.  This was the traditional \"close the family cabins for the season\" jaunt to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a brief sojourn at the wooded lakefront property that's been in JoyDad's family since 1950.  We stayed in one cabin, JoyDad's father and brother stayed in the other.It would have been hard to improve this visit, other than making it about a week longer and adding a few more JoyDad-family-members who weren't able to come.First, the colors were spectacular.Joy loved all the stuff on the ground to play with: the leaves, the pine needles, the plants and little trees.  She even loved the big trees:We were thrilled by how well she stayed in one area.  Something of the dynamic that exists in our fenced back yard (whereby we no longer have to hover over Joy every second in fear of her dashing away) was operating up at the lake too.  It extended indoors as well, where she stayed well away from the woodstoves and got into almost nothing she wasn't supposed to get into.  She did unusually well at walking on the roads too, where earlier this year she kept making breaks into the woods:It made walks so very pleasant!We also got to take the pontoon boat for a spin or two, before hauling it out of the lake to put into storage.It was so lovely not to be dealing with seizures.  Last time we were at the lake, the day-by-day knock-down seizure count was 3, 2, 2, 4 -- each with its attendant recovery fuss.  We've had seizures every time we've traveled in the past two years.  Except for this weekend, where the counts were 0, 0, 0.  Joy neither fussed nor bit herself, almost the entire time we were up there (the ride home didn't quite fit the bite-free pattern, but then who wants to have to leave the lake?)Joy didn't spend as much time on the pier this visit, having too much fun stimming on shore, but Rose has always loved the pier and took advantage of every possible minute before we had to break it down for the winter. She's an awesome hula-hooper:And I've saved the best photo for last.  This is Rose at the end of the pier at sunrise.  Doesn't it just look as if she's about to step into heaven?Bonus points for anyone who can guess what late-seventies movie image this sunrise shot brought to mind for me, before you click & get the answer!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtBMqJ_pfI/AAAAAAAAAEg/SG-1wR-P3V8/s1600-h/tree-lane.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtB0cwB5TI/AAAAAAAAAEo/4KM3E13AhBw/s1600-h/tree-hugger.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtCkSzDdEI/AAAAAAAAAEw/e4TsgaAiEfw/s1600-h/wait-mama.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtC23GgT7I/AAAAAAAAAE4/Dlm_SiP_WBw/s1600-h/mama-daughters.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtDSRXCUPI/AAAAAAAAAFA/SY7ZhfWRC7w/s1600-h/girls-on-boat.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtEhib7wBI/AAAAAAAAAFI/Uoe_oxuwvfI/s1600-h/rose-hoop.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SOtE5YvI5qI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/Gawel_mnv0w/s1600-h/rose-sunrise.jpg", "http://www.zml.com/content/covers/45830_3.jpg", "http://www.5minutesforspecialneeds.com/9/welcome-to-special-exposure-wednesday/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/special-exposure-wednesday-northwoods.html", "title": "\nSpecial Exposure Wednesday: Northwoods Getaway\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 30, 2008", "body": "\nThere has been a string of events over the past couple of weeks, in which just what I needed came along at just the right time.First was Rose's bicycle.  She's been riding on a low-budget little garage sale bike, with training wheels.  I think she was physically ready to ditch the training wheels quite a while ago, but she couldn't find the confidence just yet.  However, she's grown so much that the little bike with training wheels is getting almost un-ride-able.So the other week she was out riding the too-small bike up and down our street, and I'm thinking, \"We really need to get her a new bike.  Maybe in the spring.\"  And then one of Rose's playdate neighbors (3 years older) and her dad come biking down the street.  Playdate neighbor is proudly riding a big bike, just that day handed down from her older sister.  Dad says, \"Yeah, her little bike was really getting much too small.\"  And I say, \"Do you have plans for the little bike?  Could I perhaps buy it for Rose?\"He accepted a pittance, but the new bike is much sturdier and upscale than anything we'd have sought out.  Plus, it doesn't have training wheels, nor do the ones from the little bike fit it.  Rose is delighted with her new toy, and will have great incentive to learn to ride it in the spring.Fast-forward about a week... I'm backing the car rather carelessly out of the garage, with two girls distracting me in the back seat, and don't notice that I've mis-parked Joy's stroller so that it's sticking just a little bit out from its place. Crunch.  The poor stroller was held together with picture wire anyway, and I'd been mulling the thought of a replacement, but wasn't quite planning to stampede myself into it quite like this.The next day I'm walking Rose to school, with Joy sitting solo in our old heavy double stroller, which was the only option left in the garage.  And on that very walk, the same playdate neighbor girl catches up with us and says she & her dad were going through their storage shed, and since we took the little bike off their hands, would we maybe want to take a jogging stroller off their hands as well?  I kid you not!  Again, an item in good condition which, when new, was way pricier than we'd have considered shelling out for.  So not only does Rose have snazzy new wheels, so does Joy.The next couple of just-in-time moments were more idea-based than object based.So Jess over at diary of a mom posts this cool entry about how she's been challenged to train for a half-marathon, and further challenges all her readers to join her.  I can't imagine it.  I'm too over-committed, and to work up to running that far just involves chunks of time that are beyond what I can do.  I'll be cheering for her though... and a seed had been planted.And then I read an article in Time magazine about the results of a long-term study at Stanford that started following 538 middle-aged runners vs. a control group of non-runners back in the 1980s.  There were half as many deaths among the runners as the non-runners, and the onset of disability was 12 to 16 years later for the runners.  No difference between rates of osteoarthritis and knee replacements.  And, the article advised, \"the best way to start an exercise regimen is to come up with a goal, such as losing 10 lb., running a half marathon...\"  Whoa.And THEN my wild-woman fire-eating sister-in-law, Auntie Run-at-the-Mouth, posts a just-in-time link over at her running blog.  It's a program called the Couch to 5K plan, where you do three walking/running workouts per week, under 30 minutes each, increasing intensity gradually until you're running 5K.  Now, I hadn't run in something like 6 years, though I'm in reasonably fair shape thanks to my bike commute.  But the bike commute will be ending soon for the season (will post more on that later), and we've got a perfectly good treadmill, on which I ran the first of the training sessions Tuesday.  It felt just right.PLUS -- when the weather is nice enough -- I've got a jogging stroller!!!I'm going to set a 5K goal for now.  But who knows?On top of all that -- I've got yet another just-in-time blessing to report.This one relates to my previous post about wanting my home to be a favorite place for Joy's therapists to work, and how a certain standard of housekeeping might relate to that.Well, the very next Sunday our adult Sunday school class spoke to me on that issue.Our church has been involved for a number of years in the work of Interfaith Hospitality Network, a program in which congregations take turns opening their church building to host homeless families for a stretch of nights, in a climate of overflowing \"traditional\" homeless shelters.  Our church took an extra step over the past two years, helping mentor one specific family and raise money to rent an apartment for them, with the intent of providing a more permanent path out of homelessness.  Things are now more stable for the family, and they've gotten Section 8 housing and the dad has a full-time job, and our church's intensive involvement with them has wound down.  The mentors from our church did a presentation looking back on their experiences.There were three mentors, one for each family member (mom, dad, son).  Of the many things the son's mentor had to say, two things were paramount.First, I learned that the son was on the autism spectrum.  Whoof.Second, the mentor spoke about the challenges of how homelessness can perpetuate itself.  Kids who spend a significant portion of their growing up homeless, may tend to internalize it as just the way things are.  There are also things related to having a home which, if you don't see your parents handling them, you won't learn them yourself.Like housecleaning.One of the goals that the mentors for all three family members worked with was teaching how to keep a home in decent shape.  Basics such as how to hold and use a broom...I think, in my favorite place post, I may have been somewhat too glib about the challenges that so many families face, focusing instead on the challenge the therapists encounter.  Perhaps instead of the hint of competition that crept into my musings, I might think instead of providing a place where therapists can draw strength to carry onward to the homes where various challenges keep working conditions from being ideal.  Those kids need the therapists at full strength, at least as much as Joy does...Important food for thought, at just the right time for me.I am reminded of how God gave the Israelites manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), enough for each day, for forty long years.  Just what was needed, just in time.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/", "http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/eye-of-the-tiger/", "http://runatthemouth.livejournal.com/", "http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml", "http://www.nihn.org/ihn/ihn.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/just-in-time-blessings.html", "title": "\nJust-in-Time Blessings\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 4, 2008", "body": "\nWhat an amazing Women's Retreat!JoyDad deserves a great big hug and shout-out for this.  Despite severe sleep deprivation and a way-late gig on Halloween night, he sent me up to the northwoods anyway.  Another big hug and shout-out to our pumpkin-patch friends (they really need aliases!), who not only provided playdate for Rose for most of Saturday, but then came over and helped JoyDad make dinner that evening.But I didn't know about the dinner till later.  Too busy being uplifted up in the north woods, with twenty-some other church ladies.  Each participant got one of these greeting cards -- would you believe, the artwork is called \"Dancing for Joy\"!You can buy these greeting cards online at Fellowship of Reconciliation.The weather was stunning.  I went out by myself and walked/jogged the third session of my first week of Couch to 5K training in the woods.  Then on the way back I fell in with a party of walkers from our group, and walked and talked with a friend... who turned out to be looking to start a 5K training program herself but hadn't found one yet!  And, her goal definitely had to do with actual race-running, something that Auntie RatM was encouraging me to do but I hadn't quite committed to yet.  Well, now I've got a racing partner.  Talk about your just-in-time blessings!I got back from the run/walk just in time to do the uplifting craft project.  If you weren't curious enough to click on the link last time, I'll just say it right out -- we were making purses out of brassieres!  I had bought a fun polka-dotted padded confection at a thrift store, but then found out that the organizers had brought along a bunch of extra bras for anyone who needed one to work on.  There among the extras was a much smaller bra, with smaller polka-dots in the same color palette as the one I'd brought.  The coincidence simply cried out for a mother-daughter set of purses.  So I made one for Rose.  (She loved it, and proudly took it to church on Sunday, carrying a teeny-beanie-bear in it!!)So many uplifting words, both in conversations and in our more formal time together.  I'll share three quotes here.  First, the words to a song from Sweet Honey in the Rock, inspired by a Chinese proverb and performed by a trio from our group:Where there is light in the soul    there will be beauty in the person.Where there is beauty in the person    there will be harmony in the home.Where there is harmony in the home    there will be honor in the nation.Where there is honor in the nation    there will be peace in the world.Then, from a translation of Psalm 91, from a book called Psalms for Praying by Nan C. Merrill:Those who dwell in the shelter of Infinite Light,who abide in the wings of Infinite Love,Will raise their voices in praise:\"My refuge and my strength:In You along will I trust.\"And finally, our sending hymn.  The song is called Benediction, composed by Patty Shelly, who happens to be a friend of our family.  She led this song herself as the sending at my mother's memorial service three years ago... I'll leave you with these words today.The Lord lift you up,The Lord take your hand,The Lord lead you forthAnd cause you to standSecure in God's word,Seeking God's face,Abounding in love,Abiding in grace.Amen.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SRA4RtuhEKI/AAAAAAAAAIw/XyvaoIEnBvQ/s1600-h/Power-to-Lift-Up.jpg", "http://www.forusa.org/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=books&Product_Code=2pp&Category_Code=GREET", "http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml", "http://runatthemouth.livejournal.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SRA8lt7bgrI/AAAAAAAAAI4/6TAT4AivrNw/s1600-h/uplifting-purses.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/11/power-to-lift-up.html", "title": "\nThe Power to Lift Up\n"},

(Well, OK, maybe we need those too.)Our desperate zombie-moan sounds more like \"SLEEEEEEEEEP!\"I referred to sleep-deprivation playing a role in the run-up to Women's Retreat this past weekend.Here's the deal.  Over the past couple of weeks, Joy has been fighting going to sleep.  The way she does it is through stimming, both physically and vocally.  Loud vocals.  Hoots and yelps and giggles.  Did I mention LOUD?It started with just naptime, which is not that surprising because lots of 4-year-olds are ready to give up naps.  But then it transferred to bedtime in the evening too, and also to wake-ups in the wee small hours.  She can keep it up for hours on end.  And when she's doing that loud vocal stimmy stuff, her parents don't sleep.We have been able to manage the bedtimes using melatonin.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to affect the 2:30 or 3:00 am wakings.  We just asked her doctor for the OK to bump up the dose Monday night, and she did sleep through Monday night.  Last night, though, she started up at 3:30am.  Of course we'd been up to see the election returns and the acceptance speech...  I got up, gave her some Benadryl, rocked her till 4am, then put her back in the crib still awake.  I think she might have dozed a bit, but then started in again.Therefore, JoyDad and I have basically been up since 3:30am.  Again.  With headaches, and fighting our colds.At least Rose sleeps through it all, though I have no idea how, because they share a room!My hunch is that this will eventually be like the whole biting thing, and the dimmer switch will eventually slide back the other direction.Till then, though, this is taking a pretty big toll.Ideas welcome!  Thank you in advance for any input...And in regards to the events that kept us up watching the TV, I'd like to close with a line from a pre-election prayer that came around by e-mail, from the Mennonite Church USA Peace and Justice Support Network.We pray that all candidates, both those who are elected and those who are not, will seek Your justice and Your peace in the world.Peace.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theonion.com/content/node/38541", "http://peace.mennolink.org/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/11/zombie-parents.html", "title": "\nZombie Parents\n"},

We go out to a retreat center north of here, and from Saturday morning to Sunday noon we hike, talk, reflect, do handwork, worship, sing, and enjoy one another's company and the break from the day-to-day.Last year Joy came down with a 24-hour tummy-bug, not a week before the retreat.  I was up all night holding her as she retched.  \"I mustn't catch this,\" I told myself sternly.  \"I want to go to women's retreat!\"Then a day or two later, Rose caught the bug.  Again I was up all night with her, positioning the bucket at 45-minute intervals.  \"I won't catch this,\" I promised myself.  \"I'm going to go to women's retreat!\"Friday came around and I packed up my things for the next morning's departure, still feeling fine.  And then...JoyDad started feeling rumbly in the tummy.Hadn't even thought of that!  But there went the daughter-care for the weekend.  I stayed home and took care of the girls (and him, though he didn't let me hold the bucket) while he retched, and missed the retreat.  And then, insult to injury, came down with a mild version of the bug myself the following Monday.This year?  I'm fighting a cold, and so is JoyDad.  Plus, Joy has discovered how to keep herself from falling asleep, for hours at a time.  She stims on her blankets or stuffed animals, and vocalizes loudly.  This applies to nap, to bedtime, and lately to wake-ups in the middle of the night too.  Rose sleeps through it, but JoyDad and I are missing big chunks of sleep (as we try to fight our colds).I'm still planning to go to women's retreat, though!  The theme this year is \"The Power to Lift Up.\"  I'm expecting a beautiful, uplifting time -- our pastor (yes, a woman) always does such a lovely Sunday-morning worship at retreat, and the setting is idyllic, and the company is fantastic.  And the craft project is related to the uplifting theme as well...Wild church-ladies in the northwoods.  Can't wait.

{"date": "Saturday, November 8, 2008", "body": "\nWell I ain't superstitious,But a black cat crossed my trail... -- bluesman extraordinaire Willie Dixon Generally I prefer to think that superstition and medicine shouldn't have anything to do with one another.As I've said before, I'm an evidence-based kind of gal, and I like to have a medical team with the same basic outlook.On the other hand, when I updated Joy's excellent neurologist on her lovely on-going seizure-free string (going on 2 months this coming Tuesday!), he glanced around and said \"Quick, touch wood!\"  We laughed together as he jokingly allowed as how pediatric neurology had more to do with superstition than one would guess...OK everybody, touch wood for us!  Quick!  Doctor's orders!I also found myself doing something perhaps related to touching wood at Joy's recent primary care appointment.  I got her a flu shot.  And I requested a thimerosal-free dose.Now, intellectually I am thoroughly convinced by the studies that, time after time, fail to find any connection or correlation between thimerosal and autism.  In addition, if there were any connection, by now we should be seeing decreases in ASD diagnoses since thimerosal began to be taken out of vaccines as far back as 1999 -- and that drop has not happened.So why did I ask for the thimerosal-free formulation for Joy?  Touch wood!  I don't have any better reason than that.  And I'm a little bit peeved at myself, and a lot frustrated at the anti-vaccine movement that has managed to instill this gut-level unreasoned uneasiness, even in me.  An evidence-based kinda gal, or so I like to think.  Emotions are such pesky beasts, aren't they?The flu shot, recommended but not required, is about the last holdout for the regular use of thimerosal as preservative in childhood vaccines.  The latest CDC guideline this year has expanded the recommended population for flu shots.  They now recommend that everyone from 6 months to their 19th birthday, and also everyone over 50, get the shot.  I think it used to be only up to age 5 for kids.  Poor Rose, age 6 this year, got her shot this morning (didn't feel the need to specify formulation for her).  Fortunately we didn't have long to wait in the doctor's office for her to stress about it.  She cried almost as little as Joy this year, which is to say just a few whimpers -- Rose's whimpers were before the shot, Joy's were after.JoyDad and I didn't whimper at all when we got ours at our respective workplaces.  Or so he tells me, anyway.Funny postscript to this year's flu shot adventure.  Rose came in and told JoyDad that she'd had her flu shot.JoyDad asked, \"Where did you get it?\" thinking left arm, right arm, leg, derriere, where?Rose replied, \"At the doctor's office!!\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fda.gov/CBER/vaccine/thimerosal.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/keyfacts.htm"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/11/of-flu-shots-and-superstitions.html", "title": "\nOf Flu Shots and Superstitions\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 13, 2008", "body": "\nI've mentioned a couple of times that I have a rather nice bike-commute to my part-time job.  It takes about 20-25 minutes each way, most of it is either bike lane or bike path, some of it is lakefront, and there are just enough inclines to make it a bit of work without being too discouraging.The most dangerous bit is a left turn that happens near our house, crossing a busy street.  Left turns can be tricky.  In general, the safest way is also the scariest -- you have to leave your bike lane, merge into traffic and act like a car for a bit, blocking other cars until you've completed the turn.This maneuver is called \"taking the lane.\"Now, one doesn't HAVE to take the lane.  The more timid route is to come to a dead stop in your bike lane, wait for all the traffic both ways to pass, and then quickly cut across the whole street.  Trouble is, there may be other bikers behind you, who may or may not want to turn themselves.Alas, my bike commute ends for the season when the Daylight Savings switch comes around in the fall, even if the weather is still good.  Once we \"fall back,\" the left turn near our house on the way home begins to happen after sunset.  And I don't play traffic games on a bicycle when dark is falling!In past years, this is when I begin to turn into a hibernating pudding.  At the time I most need the exercise (yes, I've finally realized I do have some seasonal-affective issues, on top of the holiday feastings), I lose my best regular workout.  Fortunately this year, the Couch to 5K training program came along just in time.  I'm midway into week 3 now, and it still feels pretty do-able.  We're also getting an exercise bike to go with the treadmill.  Maybe after the 5K I should train for a triathlon?  Nahh, let's not get ahead of ourselves...Anyway.  These past few months I've been blogging have been an interesting \"take-the-lane\" time for me in other ways too.  I've found myself to be more of an idea person, and being unusually forward in acting on those ideas.  Things as small as -- getting in touch with the principal & PTA co-presidents to inquire whether there might be some way to get the city to do a better job of snow-removal on the sidewalks across from the elementary school, which was a real pain in the patoot during last year's record snowfalls.  (My e-mail turned into a PTA board meeting agenda item; people-who-know-people inquiries are underway).Two potentially larger things are spinning with my plates now too.  Remember my dad's lovely review of beyond.words by dre.dance?  Suddenly I got the itch to try & bring the production to my city!  I've been in touch with the director, and the booking agent, and some contacts both in the arts & autism community around here... it may or may not happen, particularly in this economic climate, but wouldn't it be too cool?Second, I've been taking some steps on my idea of creating an online information source and support group for linear nevus sebaceous syndrome, something that is sorely lacking on the web right now.  I've got a potential partner lined up for maybe providing the domain & web hosting, and I've collected a bunch of information from the medical library -- working on a draft of the site, in all that free time of mine.Lots of \"taking the lane\" going on, even with the bike commute over for the year!  Now that I've told you all this, it gives me extra accountability to keep moving on these projects.  I'll let you know.---------And in further updates: we're doing better on the sleep front, helped by melatonin, nap management, a white noise machine, and we're now waiting/weighting on the weighted blanket to arrive by mail.  Maybe the dimmer switch is moving in the right direction too.  We can hope.And yes, we made two months seizure free!  Woo-hoo!

{"date": "Monday, November 10, 2008", "body": "\nWay back in August I posted how Joy had a reputation at daycare for getting giggles.We've just found a new context, with a zombie-parents twist.Joy's difficulties in getting to sleep are continuing, particularly at home.  She is managing to nap some at daycare, whether due to peer pressure or her Peapod Plus travel bed or her borrowed weighted blanket (top priority for this week - chasing down our OT to give a weight-recommendation so we can obtain such a blanket for home too).I almost thought I was seeing a pattern where the few nights she was sleeping through were happening after those daycare naps.  That pattern broke with a crash on Friday night, though, after a deep 2-hour daycare nap.  That night she almost didn't let the melatonin put her to sleep at bedtime, then woke up at 12:30.  I thought I'd try something different, and took her to attempt co-sleeping in the guestroom.  She didn't do more than drowse the rest of the night (though at least she was fairly quiet), and I didn't want to take her back to the crib to hoot & holler until JoyDad was up for the day, because that would killed the rest of the night for BOTH of us.Anyway.  We decided to try cutting out naps altogether for the weekend.  Not that she'd been actually napping at home for quite a while, but at least we'd been putting her in the tented crib for \"quiet time\" for a chunk of the afternoon.Saturday, after playing outside in fallen leaves instead of napping, Joy got very snoozly and almost fell asleep on the floor in the late afternoon, but perked up some after dinner.  Then as bedtime approached, she started getting giggly.  Wild, over-the-top giggles.  At first it made us laugh too, until it was clear that quiet lullabies and rocking and even the melatonin weren't causing the giggles to stop.  So we just put her to bed, where she giggled and thrashed for about 5 minutes before crashing into sleep.Slept all night, it was very very nice!Tried it again on Sunday.  I realized that I'd heard those giggles recently before.  They had happened when she'd awakened at 2:30 or 3am on previous nights, and had been vocalizing for 2 or 3 hours -- the vocalizations would change to those wild giggles.  Overtired, perhaps?Joy's church volunteers reported that she was quiet, tired, low-energy all evening.  It wasn't until we got her home and started getting ready for bed... that the wild giggles began again.This time they didn't stop when she went into the crib.  It took something like an hour and a half to crazy-giggle herself to sleep, which wound her parents up enough to push their sleep even later than that.  But at least she slept through, which was something.The saga continues!  Tee hee hee hee!  MuuuuAH-HA-HA-HA!

I hung my hat on the clinical, psychiatric definition of autism that formed the basis for Joy's diagnosis.  That definition comes from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.  The most recent edition, the 4th edition, came out in 1994, and is known as the DSM-IV.  I referenced in a previous post the peculiar combination-platter approach that checks off certain criteria in certain groupings to constitute an autism diagnosis:A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3)Uncle Schnirelmann obligingly contributed to the comments of that post a calculation of the number of potential combinations!Here's the thing, though.  This particular combination-platter that \"is\" autism has only been on the books since 1994.  Autism was first added to the DSM in 1980; PDD-NOS (which broadens the autism spectrum considerably) was added in 1987; the autism definition expanded yet further in the current 1994 version, including the first mention of Asperger's.Is autism in-and-of-itself really only the latest psychiatric definition?  Did autism an sich (German for in-and-of-itself) actually change?  Surely a reference book doesn't have quite that kind of power, right?For anyone still hanging his or her hat on the clinical definition, hold on to the brim, because the world of psychiatrically-defined autism will be changing again, in not too many years.The new DSM-V is due out in May 2012.  The American Psychiatric Association started the wheels of the new edition turning as far back as 1999, in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health.  There have been conferences and task forces, and starting in May 2008, 13 different work groups were convened to deal with different areas in the purview of the DSM.  Autism is covered by the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group, chaired by Susan Swedo, MD.I didn't know all this off the top of my head, of course; got it from the American Psychiatric Association web site on the upcoming DSM-V.  I started poking into this due to a blog post called Sausages and Legislation by afbh at Whose Planet Is It Anyway?  The post references an LA Times piece from earlier this week, regarding a dispute between psychiatrists as to whether the process of assembling the DSM-V is going to be primarily a transparent process, or a closed-door process.So that got me wondering, what exactly do we know about the status of the autism definition revision at this point?  And that led me to this brief Report of the DSM-V Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group, dated November 2008.The report lists three main areas of discussion for the work group:1)  Possible modification of ADHD criteria to allow for co-morbidity of autism and ADHD (currently excluded). The ADHD & Disruptive Behavior Disorders Work Group has agreed to consider this possibility.2)  Discussion of the validity of Rett\u2019s disorder as a separate disorder and inclusion of a new modifier within the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), which might include genetic and medical disorders and other biologically-definable conditions.3)  How to address Pervasive Developmental Disorders \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS).  The individuals currently diagnosed with PDD-NOS may still be described in DSM-V, but the work group will discuss whether they can redefine ASD in such a way that the PDD-NOS diagnosis isn\u2019t necessary, as this diagnosis currently captures a very heterogeneous group of individuals.Then there are eight additional questions, and various subcommittees.  I'm hoping this gets wider play in the autism blogs -- Kristina at Autism Vox has started that ball rolling.  I'd like to see someone eventually take it in turn to invite discussions of each of the points and questions separately.  (Not to worry.  I won't inflict that on my particular readership!)I will just comment a bit, though, on the one of the first three points that jumped out at me, and that's point #2, about the interface between autism and other genetic or biologically-definable conditions.  The dual-diagnosis thing has been of particular interest to me, given Joy's combination of autism with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome.  In our case, we've been conceptualizing Joy's autism as falling somehow under the LNSS umbrella.  But I've also heard people referring to their quests to \"rule out\" autism by testing for genetic known-factors like Fragile X, and I've wondered why it couldn't be both -- especially since there's only one lone genetic exclusion in the DSM-IV, and that's Rett syndrome.It's always seemed strange to me that Rett should be singled out, and at least mildly concerning that if the list of exclusions were to grow explicitly, it could have a massive impact on the eligibility for autism services of people who also have Down Syndrome, or Fragile X, or LNSS, or whatever.  The work group report implies, though, that there's discussion about taking it in the other direction, maybe with explicit inclusions?Fascinating stuff.  I'm hoping that the official discussion stays as transparent as possible.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-watch.org/general/dsm.shtml", "http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV/DSMV.aspx", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/11/sausages-and-legislation.html", "http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/", "http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-lane16-2008nov16,0,5678764.story", "http://psychiatry.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV/DSMV/DSMRevisionActivities/DSMVWorkGroupReports/NeurodevelopmentalDisordersWorkGroupReport.aspx", "http://www.autismvox.com/whats-in-an-autism-diagnosis-changes-in-dsm-v-ahead/", "http://www.rettsyndrome.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=375"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/11/evolving-definitions.html", "title": "\nEvolving Definitions\n"},

Our \"Popeye Sighting\" (when she used the word \"ug-ug-ug\" for \"hug\" a while back) has remained in the Elvis Sighting category -- I've only heard it once since.  There are a few other words that come and go:-- \"gog-gog-gog\" for doggie-- \"chuh\" for chair (her mealtime booster-seat)-- a few sounds from the farm See-n-Say, her current favorite toy-- one blessed Elvis-Sighting string of \"ma-ma-ma\"The most interesting recent Elvis Sighting to me, though, is her use of the word \"no.\"  She's been doing some deliberate \"nuh-nuh-nuh\" to mean no, but there have also been just a couple very clear, distinct, definitive \"NO\" utterances.Here's the interesting bit -- unless I'm mistaken, they've all been said to just one of her 5 intensive-autism therapists (who reads this blog faithfully, so, hi!)  Not to me, or her sister, or Lynda at daycare, or JoyDad, or her school district therapists.  The context tends to be when this particular therapist asks Joy to give her something that she doesn't want to give.  Joy has, on just a few occasions, pulled the item away and said no, clear as a bell.Fascinating!She's also been responding better to \"no\" or \"stop\" from adults in a certain stimming situation she's been very persistent about.  Which would be... umm, how to say this... oh well... humping.  Pillows, stuffed animals, her blankets.  She can get very... intense about it.  Such a little sensory-seeker, our girl!  It's not exactly that it's a problem, but it's the primary activity that keeps her awake when she oughtta be sleeping, and also pulls her into her own little world when she could be doing more useful, or interactive, or socially-acceptable things.  So when she's not alone in her crib, we've been working on getting her to replace it with other activities.It reminds us a little bit of another sensory activity that she was once very persistent with, which involved playing balance-beam with our low picture-window frame in the living room.  There's just enough of a ledge, about a foot off the ground, for her to teeter on... and she went through a long phase of absolutely loving to teeter.  Unfortunately she often teetered too far, and picked up lots of sad little bumps and bruises!JoyDad's been the leader in these situations.  I'm too much a softie, tending to think along the lines of \"well, if that's the input she needs, I hate to get in the way.\"  But JoyDad doesn't give up so easily.  And, with repeated gentle admonitions (together with physical redirecting if need be), he eventually gets Joy to respond to a \"No\" or \"Stop\" voice-prompt.  It eventually worked on the ledge-teetering issue -- I'm sure that he's the main reason the dimmer switch eventually slid to \"off\" and she stopped doing it altogether.  With the \"Joy loves her stuffed animals\" situation, she is now willing to stop on voice-prompt.  First she only accepted it from him, now she'll respond to the \"no\" from me (and I think from Lynda too) in that situation as well.Yay, JoyDad!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/11/elvis-says-no.html", "title": "\nElvis Says \"No!\"\n"},

It's gotten to the point that we are able to leave doors open to the rooms on the back hallway where she's not supposed to go, and she just... doesn't go there. Her therapists have commented on how Joy has even started to treat the square carpet in the living room as a boundary to be respected:Maybe if things are going well next December, and Joy's dimmer switch for boundaries hasn't slammed in the opposite direction, we might consider a real tree. It's nice to be able to imagine that from here.Meanwhile, Rose has been setting some boundaries of her own. Check out their bedroom door: Girls Club!  Keep Out! Do not disturb, do not disturb!

{"date": "Sunday, November 30, 2008", "body": "\nTraveling with Joy & Rose has proven to be a whole lot easier lately, generally speaking.When I started this blog back in July, we were just on the point of noticing a pattern -- that Joy's seizures got worse when we had long days of car travel.  But then came this current string of seizure-free (81 days right now, touch/knock wood!)  When we went to the northwoods in October, Joy travelled like a pro, and we had the same experience this holiday.First leg of the trip took us to Thanksgiving Dinner at the home of AuntieS, where we contributed the pies:Next leg was to the home of my grandmother, Great-Grandma to Joy & Rose.  At 99, she still hosts us overnight in her apartment and cooks for us and is so very interested to see the girls and hear about all the details of what's going on with us!Joy was very comfortable at Great-Grandma's this visit.  Everything about it was easier.  For example, Great-Grandma noticed that Joy didn't cry AT ALL the entire visit. (No seizures means no seizure-fusses!) She initiated happy jumping-games with random adults, including an in-law relative whom she only met once before.  She did almost no grabbing for forbidden stuff, and she did a lot of self-entertaining.The last two points (grabbing & self-entertaining) combined into an interesting accident at one point during the visit!Great-Grandma has a fun box of old, old toy building blocks.  She has also tossed into that box a bunch of little clear plastic discs that come with the packaging for hearing-aid batteries.  An example is on the left in the photo below:Joy took a shine to the little plastic disks, especially once she discovered that they made a fun little clattery noise on the kitchen floor if she threw one down.  She spent long stretches of time carrying little disks over to the kitchen and tossing, retrieving, tossing, retrieving.Then during one of these games, when our guard was down, she looked up on the kitchen table and noticed a different kind of disk.  Similar, yet larger and sparklier, like the disk on the right.  It was a cut-glass coaster.  And what a lovely crash and a shatter it made when she snagged it to use in her tossing game!  As we galloped into the kitchen to remove her from the shards, she was trying to retrieve one of the larger pieces to make it happen again...What a neat bit of generalization!  So near, and yet so far.  And she was so pleased with the results of the new toy, we had to work to keep her out of the kitchen after that point, as she obviously had it in her mind to reproduce all the fun that happened when she used the big sparkly tossing-disk.Disk-shattering aside, though, in general it was a superb holiday!Speaking of superb -- I got a most excellent blog-award last night, from Barbara at TherExtras.  She has selected me for The Baddest Mommy-Blogger Award (remember, bad is the new good!) Here's what she had to say:JoyMama is bad-to-the-bone. She was bad before she became a Mama - as evidenced by her willingness to EAT FIRE. And be photographed doing so. And post photos on her blog. After I asked for proof. Clearly, God prepared her for rare and wonderful parenting.I'd be blushing, but when you're b-b-b-b-BAD to the bone, ain't nobody can make your face turn red.Oh, and if you needed more proof that I'm a bad-mama rule-breaker -- as admitted previously, I generally don't really \"do\" tagging/awards.  So I'm not passing it on, even though I know plenty of baaaad mommy bloggers.

{"date": "Sunday, November 16, 2008", "body": "\nI recently finished reading an excellent book, Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder.  It's a non-fiction account of a dedicated (and generous and brilliant and eccentric) physician, Paul Farmer, and his work among the poorest of the poor, first in Haiti and then beyond.  His work in Haiti eventually blossomed into public-policy impact for how tuberculosis (TB) and AIDS are treated among the poor worldwide.Kidder is a masterful storyteller, expert at bringing up details that reappear later in the book as he weaves his themes together.  One such detail had to do with a Haitian woman whom Farmer treated for TB.  In the case of TB, a major challenge is that the treatment regimen must be followed faithfully for a long time, or the disease simply becomes resistant to that particular drug.  Conventional wisdom for Haiti is that it's hard to get patients to buy into this necessity because they want to attribute disease to Voodoo curses instead of micro-organisms, but Farmer found that when enough of their basic poverty-related needs were being met, his patients did a fine job of keeping up with the medications.  Kidder related an encounter with this woman who had accepted the idea of the TB germs and did well at sticking with her meds, but then surprised Farmer by telling him later that someone in the community had cursed her with the TB and she was going to take revenge.  When Farmer called her on it, she responded (in Creole), \"What, are you incapable of complexity?\"This is a helpful thought for someone like me, putting together a worldview that has room for both allopathic & non-traditional medicine, plus mystery and miracle and faith, that maybe needn't feel bad for a touch of superstition as well.But no Voodoo for me, thanks anyway!Accepting the complexity of the seemingly-contradictory may also be a helpful concept in threading the ongoing controversy regarding the nature of autism...Been thinking about that, will post more another day.Meanwhile, I do recommend Mountains Beyond Mountains.  Much food for thought about the roots of poverty, and the interconnectedness of the world, and what one dedicated person can do.

{"date": "Thursday, December 4, 2008", "body": "\nPerspective is a valuable gift.Because of the presence of Joy in our lives, Rose and I had the tools to cope with what would otherwise have been a ridiculously overwhelming incident yesterday.  (Poor Rose actually was quite overwhelmed at first, and with good reason.)I got a call from Rose's first-grade teacher yesterday afternoon.  She prefaced the conversation with the heart-stopping words, \"We've had a bad accident....\"  Clutching the edge of my desk, I forced myself to breathe as I awaited word on the extent of Rose's injuries, and which emergency room I would be visiting shortly.  Fortunately it was nothing like that!  Here was the account:Just before gym class, Rose had to make a quick trip to the bathroom.  There was only one other child in there, in another stall.  As Rose was washing her hands, the other child (a kindergartener with special needs) came bursting out of the stall with her knickers around her ankles and her hands full of poop.  She ran at Rose, smeared some of the poop on Rose's shirt, and then threw the rest into the sink.It sounds like my poor kiddo felt sadly assaulted, violated even.  Poop is unpleasant stuff, and she hadn't done anything to this girl to earn any kind of retaliation whatsoever.  Fortunately her teacher was able to soothe her, get the soiled shirt off and change her into her art smock -- a bright old tie-dye T-shirt of mine, that went quite well with her hot-pink leggings!From Rose I learned that after gym class the kindergartener was brought to her to apologize, both with a note and a verbal \"so...\" accompanied by the \"sorry\" ASL sign.  (She apparently has quite a few signs but very few spoken words.) When Rose told me about the incident as I picked her up from her after-school program, she did so without tears and told me that \"the girl had a disability and doesn't always understand.\"  I went ahead and verbalized the connection with Joy, reminding Rose that Joy wears onesies so she doesn't play with her own poop, and asking if Rose remembered seeing Joy smearing poop before.  Yes, she certainly did remember.My Mama-Bear persona is more than a little concerned about why this kindergartener was in the bathroom with no adult in attendance!  The Special-Needs Mama side of me, though, is more than a little aware that... well, poop happens.  Unexpectedly sometimes.  You think a skill is learned, or that boundaries are in control, and then whammo.I did drop Rose's teacher an e-mail of thanks for the phone call and taking such good care of Rose in the wake of the incident, bringing gentle attention to the idea that \"bad accident\" was perhaps not the right term to use at the start of the call, and also including a line about being sure that a flurry of strategizing was underway about how to prevent any such future occurrences...It's quite an experience to be on the other side of the special-needs mama / neurotypical mama divide for this incident.  What a priceless perspective!Rose, meanwhile, benefits immeasurably from that perspective and understanding as well.  While a small bump on the head later in the evening (she ran into our birdfeeder en route to the car to go to piano class!) brought a few extra tears and feeling sorry for herself, she was in good spirits by bedtime, and slept peacefully through the night.  As did I.  And Joy too.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/assault-with-stinky-weapon.html", "title": "\nAssault with a Stinky Weapon\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 10, 2008", "body": "\nAs I was fixing dinner last night, Rose and Joy were around the corner on the living room square carpet.  All of a sudden I heard a shriek.  At first I thought it was one of Joy's various high-pitched shrieky-squeals, painful to the ears of anyone nearby but otherwise fairly harmless.  But it went on -- an entire breath-worth.  Then the breath caught... and I thought \"Rose?\"... and then the scream began again.It was Rose.  She had been lying on her back on the carpet, with Joy lying tummy-down on top of her, face-to-face.  And Joy had suddenly zoomed in and BIT her.  A full-circle-of-teeth, hard chomp, on the side of her face just next to her left eye.Remember the awful bruise-producing biting that Joy was doing to herself back toward the end of the summer?That's what she did.  To her sister's face.I didn't exactly know what to do with Joy other than remove her from the situation.  Much more concerned with Rose, to get her a nice icy Boo-Boo Bunny and a cuddle on the couch to start processing this new trauma.  (Remember, the stinky-weapon assault at school was less than a week ago...)Something I said about last week's school incident was hugely applicable to this one:You think a skill is learned, or that boundaries are in control, and then whammo.This really came out of nowhere.  Now, Rose has been treating Joy a little bit like an oversize rag doll at times, dragging her around and hugging too enthusiastically and talking at her in an exaggerated annoying baby-talk voice.  We've been at her repeatedly to be more gentle with her sister, to read Joy's cues that she doesn't like the situation, to let her walk away.  This time, though, it didn't seem like Joy was trapped.  She was on top and not confined, she could've just gotten up and left, but instead she chomped.One difference between this incident and school is that Rose didn't get an apology this time.  The girl at school had a vocalization and a sign for \"sorry,\" and was able to trace a pencil over the letters of an apology note that her aide wrote out for her in yellow marker.  We've not yet got a vocabulary nor a consistent approach for what to do when Joy does something harmfully wrong, particularly to a peer.  How to begin to get her to understand, or even go through some sort of apology motion?  Which motion, even, given that she's not really using any signs at all other than a highly inconsistent \"more\" sign?Bloggy input welcomed!I feel so bad for Rose.  She's just having to put up with more than a kid oughtta have to do.After supper, when things had calmed down and a Joy-therapist was in attendance, I took Rose out to help me shovel snow off the driveway.  She told me that she was going to try to keep further away from Joy for a little while, a reasonable approach (and all to the good really, if it gets her to stop the rag-doll games).And then she said, But that doesn't mean I don't love her.Oh, my beautiful daughter.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/too-much.html", "title": "\nToo Much\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, December 11, 2008", "body": "\nRose had an interesting story to tell when she came home from school yesterday, having gone to school with a ring of teeth-mark beside her eye!Apparently one of her little first-grade classmates (we'll call him Edward, after the vampire swain in Stephenie Meyer's runaway hit novel/movie Twilight) has been playing a forbidden game on the playground lately.  He pretends to be a vampire -- and then he bites.  Apparently the victims have been 4th and 5th graders, because the teacher from a 4/5 class came to talk to Rose's class about this situation, and a 4th-grader in her after-school program was showing off the bite-mark on his finger.Rose had a much more impressive bite-mark to show!  Status symbol, apparently.  Who knew?I'm guessing that the game was likely connected somehow to this whole teenage vampire mania that's going around.  I actually did read Twilight myself recently.  The book's premise runs something like this: a high-school lass, who considers herself something of an uncoordinated misfit, moves to dreary rainy Washington, where she falls into a tingling romance with a gorgeous vampire who is attending the same school (even though he's really 100 years old, he's got the form of a 17-year-old.)  The best part of the book is the forbidden desire between the two, upon which they cannot act because, well, he'd kill her.  The plot is otherwise a bit creaky.  But I digress.Last week I read an interesting bloggy take on how Twilight may appeal particularly to young women -- or even older women -- on the spectrum:The Twilight series connects to those left out and different feelings, and it provides a fantasy of a romantic hero and an eternal connection. Just what lots of girls with Asperger's may be looking for.As Rose finished her account of the vampire incident at school, I realized exactly which kid this Edward was.  It was the little guy we ran into at the park earlier in the fall, who called Rose over to the tennis courts and really really really wanted to keep talking with her even though we were kind of on our way home at the time.Good grief.  Rose is (or at least was) the crush-object of a vampire wanna-be!Well, at least she'll be used to the biting...Meanwhile, Rose made a different connection between the two biting incidents.Edward's was worse than Joy's, she said, even though hers was bigger.Because Edward knew that his biting was wrong, and Joy didn't.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.patriciarobinsonmft.com/social_skills_for_kids/2008/12/book-review-and-movie-review-twilight-by-stephenie-meyer.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/vampire-encounter.html", "title": "\nVampire Encounter\n"},

{"date": "Friday, December 19, 2008", "body": "\nI was struck by a post over at Autism Vox earlier this week, called Santa Can Wait, in which Kristina mulls over the fact that her pre-teen son Charlie has never sat on Santa's lap.  Malls were potential meltdown triggers, and her son never did \"get into\" imaginary characters.  Besides, she reminds herself, she'd just have to eventually reveal that Santa is really Mom & Dad anyway...Well, Joy has never sat on Santa's lap either.  Come to think of it, I'm not sure I ever did myself, until I was an adult (and I don't believe there's any photographic evidence of that occasion, probably just as well.)In my case, it just wasn't the family tradition.  In Joy's case, the busy-ness of the mall isn't the issue, nor is particularly problematic for her to go snuggle with a stranger (yipe).  I think she did get a visit from Santa at daycare one year, in fact.Alas, the reason that Joy has never sat on Santa's lap can be directly traced to her sister.Here's what happened on our first attempt to take Rose to see the mall Santa, at the age of 10 months:  The next year we discussed it, and she seemed to have at least an interest in Santa-visiting, though she asserted, \"I don't like his ho-ho-ho!\"  So we got her all dressed up, and went to the mall to be early in line when Santa was to arrive.  She waited with minimal twitching and fuss, right up until she heard him walking down the mall, jingling his bells, and (of course) booming a jolly \"Ho, ho, ho!\"  Meltdown before he even got seated.  We stepped out of line and made our escape.  After she calmed down I got her to pose with a much less threatening Santa statue further down the mall, only four feet tall:So that's why we never went back, and it hardly seemed worth it to take just Joy.Interesting wrinkle this year: back in November, Rose decided to write a letter to Santa.  She carefully wrote out a few modest requests, including a request or two on Joy's behalf.  Then she folded it up, wrote out the envelope to Santa at the North Pole, carefully including her real return address as she'd learned in school.  I almost didn't post it... but then rather thought that there'd been enough prevarications about the whole Santa thing, and wanted to tell the truth that yes, Rose, I actually did mail it for real.Fast forward a couple of weeks, and Rose puts the pieces together.  Santa's not real, is he?  Mom and Dad stuff the stockings (and eat the cookies, and drink the milk, and consume Rudolph's carrot!)  When she asked it straight out, we copped to the truth.  But when we asked if she still wanted to play the game, she absolutely wanted to get her stocking filled.  Quick on the uptake, this girl!Fast forward again to yesterday, and Rose gets a letter in the mail.  Return address: Santa Claus, North Pole.  And inside is a computer-printed poem from Santa about how he'll try to make her Christmas happy, but she has to promise to be good!  And then there was a handwritten \"Santa\" signature, and one-sentence postscript about how nice it was that she included her sister in the letter...I wish I knew what was going through her head about this whole thing!  We didn't point out the hometown postmark.  But it's pretty clear that Mom & Dad didn't write the letter.  We were too obviously gobsmacked when it arrived!Meanwhile, Joy too has received a lovely pre-Christmas surprise, in her case from one of the members of her large circle of support:The photo doesn't do it justice!  It's a little shadowbox that she hand-decorated for Joy, with a bunny in the \"box\" part (referring to our pet bunnies) and the \"Joy\" at the top and a tiny rose on the heart in the lower left corner in honor of the big sister.Thank you, Santa, so very much!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://www.autismvox.com/santa-can-wait/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SUvdlA53Q3I/AAAAAAAAALQ/RxiZeLPi4Ws/s1600-h/santa.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SUvfwtwEVOI/AAAAAAAAALY/3jtbrg62XEE/s1600-h/santa2003.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SUv8VXCbCzI/AAAAAAAAALg/q3En_Ww0Tfw/s1600-h/bunnyjoy.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/here-comes-santa-claus.html", "title": "\nHere Comes Santa Claus\n"},

How can you apply other people's research studies to this particular individual, really?  How can you generalize anything about her to anyone else?  She keeps busting our expectations right and left.It makes me think of fingerprints.  And snowflakes.  Not gonna find any two the same, though I understand that with snowflakes at least, it's technically possible.And yet, when we look outside our window, we see a blanket of white, and the individual snowflakes all blend together into a lovely sparkly layer (a much thinner layer than it was earlier this week, thanks to a wild spate of warm temps and rain!)And then I think of a line from a Paul Simon song from his Graceland album:He said, \"There's no doubt about it,It was the myth of fingerprints -- I've seen them all, and man, they're all the same.\"All human, we are.All children of God.All us neurodiverse, amazing people.And now, we can't have a reference to Graceland without making the Elvis connection... there's another line in that song that sounds for all the world like he's singing: Elvis is the watermelon.I'm serious!

{"date": "Friday, December 26, 2008", "body": "\nThere have been some lovely posts lately on a Christmas Carol theme, specifically the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and yet to come:Ghosts of Christmases Past at Diary of a Mom, and Ghosts of the Season at Maternal Instincts were two that particularly struck me.I've been reflecting on Christmas comparisons, Christmas progress, Christmas forecasts as well.Christmas 2006 was a rough one.  We'd just had Joy's autism diagnosis days before Christmas, and had not yet comprehended the dimensions of the regression she'd been experiencing.  She was also having seizures, not too disruptive yet but definitely there.  That holiday had some elements of shell-shock.Christmas 2007 wasn't a piece of cake either.  That year the seizures were in full swing, and Joy wasn't feeling well at all.  The traditional family visit to AuntieS' place was one big meltdown.  And then a whole bunch of switches flipped all at once (i.e. another regression) right about at Christmas, and the next few months were some of the roughest we've had yet.This year?  We had a lovely quiet Christmas.  The seizures have been on hiatus since mid-September (touch/knock wood!)  Not even really on the radar screen right now, which feels very nice.While the seizures don't have me on edge, the whole regression thing does, seeing as how it's happened twice in a row at this time of year.  So far, though, there's nothing in particular to point to.  (More touch/knock on the computer desk, or my own forehead...)We'd hoped to go party with the extended JoyDad family at AuntieS' on Christmas Eve per usual, and even got into the car and drove for an hour, but there was blowing snow across the highway and lots of slow travel and cars in the ditch, and we eventually turned around.  A shame to have missed it, but we're hoping to see most everyone tomorrow night if the weather doesn't get in the way again...We let the girls open one present each on Christmas Eve since they didn't get their extended-family presents.  Then they climbed into their brand-new matching footie-jammies and settled down for a long winter's nap.Christmas morning brought giggles and grins and a lovely pile of presents, though not so many that we couldn't open them one by one, to savor each in its turn.Joy's favorite present, hands down, was the accordion tube in her stocking, that makes noises when you squish it open and closed.The My Little Pony was also a hit due to its lovely stimmy mane & tail.  And then there was all the tissue paper, and one shiny ribbon in particular.  She didn't really get the whole present-opening thing, but was willing to play along and pull and tear paper when encouraged.  The aforementioned presents and trimmings kept her happily occupied pretty much all morning.Rose was thrilled with her new My Little Pony too (the pony's name is Snow-El, I kid you not!)  She also liked her new Children's Dictionary, and the old digital camera that we handed down to her since Santa brought us a new one.  She spent lots of time posing the ponies -- Snow-El is the white one with the halo: A highlight for JoyDad was a collection of 8x10 photos from the lake up north, with a promise of post-Christmas framing.  For me, I got footie-jammies too!  And then there was this mask that Rose made for me:Christmas Day passed at a leisurely pace.  Rose and I baked zwieback, a traditional double-decker yeast bun (the link is to a blog called Mennonite Girls Can Cook!!)  As darkness fell in the late afternoon, we all ventured out by car to drive through an elaborate display of holiday lights that appears each year in one of the local parks.  And after dinner, we actually built a fire!  In the fireplace!  And Joy was laid-back enough to keep out of the way, with only a little additional monitoring!I've got a lot of questions for Christmases yet to come.  At what point will receiving and opening gifts actually become a joy for Joy?  When and how to involve her in the giving of gifts?  Will the whole Santa thing ever make enough sense at all to explain?  Or more profoundly, the newborn baby in the manger, God on earth among us?But all in all, this has been a merry little Christmas so far, with more family treats yet to come.God bless us, every one.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2008/12/16/ghosts-of-christmases-past/", "http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2008/12/ghosts-of-season.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVWUSSl-zkI/AAAAAAAAAMg/qO5rAwMsaBw/s1600-h/presents08.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVWUv6mAzNI/AAAAAAAAAMo/dyQlD1mjbB4/s1600-h/greentube.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVWW0B0PR7I/AAAAAAAAAMw/Wbf8JNcv3Q0/s1600-h/ponies.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVWRJUj1U_I/AAAAAAAAAMY/bKkAwdBTrLk/s1600-h/mask.jpg", "http://mennonitegirlscancook.blogspot.com/2008/06/zwieback-double-buns.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVWaiHL6F5I/AAAAAAAAAM4/O6bCDfPnDeM/s1600-h/yeast.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/merry-little-christmas.html", "title": "\nA Merry Little Christmas\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 28, 2008", "body": "\nThe weather wasn't promising!  Heavy fog, considerable rain, tornado watches on the other side of the state line, flash flood watches on our side of the state line, and us with over an hour's drive over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house...I'm happy to say that almost all the JoyDad relatives made it who planned to be there, though we sure missed AuntieLO who was stuck home with a bad cold.  One cousin is celebrating Hannukah in Israel this year (where it's a little-bitty holiday since it doesn't have to compete with Christmas over there), and Auntie Meerkat had to work at the zoo so she and ARatM are arriving for a New Year's visit.  Otherwise, though, we had a clean sweep!Did I ever tell you that GrammaJ has something akin to an Elvis shrine at Christmastime?  Rose is developing the appropriate Elvis appreciation -- each knick-knack comes with a little push-button Elvis soundtrack, so she got to hear some of the classics!Joy had a fine visit, considerably more laid-back than others in recent memory.  GrammaJ and GrampaK didn't have to Joy-proof nearly as much.  Past Christmases involved lots of running up and down the back hall, where all doors had to be closed at all times to prevent unauthorized excursions.  This year?  Almost no hall-running, and no dashes through open doors.  Joy was mostly content to range around the living room, hanging out on couches and flirting with various relatives.Joy spent the most flirty-time this year with Auntie Save-the-Tatas (there's been a lot of breast-cancer surviving going on in JoyDad's extended family lately).  Auntie Save-the-Tatas entertained Joy with \"zerbitz,\" an entertainment whereby auntie makes a funny raspberry-noise on Joy's tender little bare feeties.  Joy loved it.  We got the huge Joy giggle-and-grin, accompanied by extending her foot again and again for another round.  \"More zerbitz please!\" said that little foot.  \"Do it again, do it again!\"For those who are following the JoyDad family tree here amidst the aliases, Auntie Save-the-Tatas is the wife of JoyDad's older brother, who appeared in the Santa 1963 photo.  I hereby dub him Uncle Marathon, as he's planning to run another one in 2009.  He is the original source of the running craze that has been gradually sweeping the entire family, from ARatM to UncleDO to JoyDad (temporarily sidelined these days) to myself.  Thanks for the inspiration, Uncle Marathon!  C'mon AuntieS/RatK, all the cool kids are doin' it...As we experienced at GreatGrandma's for Thanksgiving, it's easy to let the Joy-guard down just a little too far.  What would a holiday be without an incident, after all?  This holiday's incident involved GrampaK and a delectable slice of apple pie, which he was enjoying as he sat on a living-room couch.  Joy moves like lightning when she sees something she wants... and in this case, she wanted two big fists-full of GrampaK's pie!  Well, at least it wasn't as dangerous a cleanup as the shards of glass at Great-Grandma's!We came home with a trunk-load of presents and smiles on our faces, and the holiday isn't over yet.  The grandparents on JoyMama's side will be arriving with the New Year.Meanwhile, if I post twice more by Wednesday, I can do post #100 on New Year's Day...\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVepUj-maSI/AAAAAAAAANA/i2uLmKPS4Ik/s1600-h/elvis-shrine.jpg", "http://www.savethetatas.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SVeph29pigI/AAAAAAAAANI/dpFE9W9LoPY/s1600-h/sweetfeet.jpg", "http://runatthemouth.livejournal.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/of-zerbitz-and-apple-pie.html", "title": "\nOf Zerbitz and Apple Pie\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 8, 2009", "body": "\nThe inimitable Barbara at Therextras pointed me in the direction of a new (to me) blog last week, and I've been mulling over one of the posts I read there.  The blog is Both Hands and a Flashlight, the blogger is Tim (who co-blogs with his wife Mary, sound like a familiar set-up?) and the post is \"Happy Autism\"?Here's how it starts:I recently ran across the term \u2018happy autism\u2019 in a book I was reading (which, of course, I\u2019ve now forgotten the title of). Essentially, the author used this term to describe his autistic child, who clearly 1) met all three components of the so-called \u2018autism triad\u2019, and 2) was generally very happy and content most of the time.That immediately rang a bell with me, and I do love bell-ringing!  Joy doesn't generally fit the prevailing child-with-autism stereotype, an image that perhaps entails a blank-faced, unresponsive kiddo either rocking silently in a corner or engaging in disruptive, self-injurious behavior.  Not that she doesn't get wrapped up in her stimmy activities, and we've had some effort to keep her safe from herself too at times!  However, on the whole, she's a sunny child with an irresistable laugh, and we end up having to explain the shortcomings of the stereotype to people who wonder why she has the diagnosis she does.There's actually something dangerously seductive about the term \"happy autism\" for me, as sweetly as it seems to fit my daughter.  The trouble is the wish to find a way to differentiate her from those other kids with autism.  You know, the stereotypical ones.  See, she's not like them.  She's happy.  She's in a different part of the hierarchy, y'know?Ugh.Tim points to other modifiers that do something similar (high-functioning, mild, moderate, severe), even though they're not part of the official diagnostic criteria.  In our informal search to categorize and quantify, we end up creating new boxes, new artificial separations, each of which can bring its own damaging value-judgments.I know that we need language in which to talk about diagnoses and conditions and experiences.  I don't envy the team that's working on the new definition of autism for the upcoming edition of the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (DSM V).  The new definition will surely draw the formal boxes in a different manner than they are formally drawn now.  I hope that they will get closer to getting it right.  If we knew what right was.Meanwhile, we're back to the tension between the myth of fingerprints (they're all the same!) and the n of 1 (every last one is unique).  So I've got a new term for my original, broke-the-mold kiddo.  It's all hers, uses her name even!\"Joy\"ful autism.(Seriously, if you haven't done so yet, go read Tim's post.  He's good.)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.therextras.com/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2008/12/30/happy-autism/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2008/12/30/happy-autism/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/joyful-autism.html", "title": "\nJoyful Autism\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "body": "\nWay back in the first month of this blog (July 2008, in case anyone's counting), I wrote about the challenges of decision-making regarding the overwhelming array of autism therapies.  The post called How Can You Possibly Choose? has weathered well over the past 6 months -- still worth reading for background on our thinking.Here in Wisconsin, where the state funds intensive-level interpersonal autism therapy, we had some parameters on our choices for what agencies and therapies were available under that program.  In our county there are two choices, which I dubbed Agency 1 and Agency 2.  At Agency 1, the agency's founder trained with Ivar Lovaas, the grand-daddy of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).  Agency 2 takes a more relationship-based approach, incorporating principles of DIR/Floortime, the work of Dr. James MacDonald (Communicating Partners), and behavioral principles as well.  We'd had a hunch that Agency 2's approach, focusing on relationships, might be the better match for Joy, but we knew that many people get excellent results with ABA.  What really sealed the deal in favor of Agency 2 was when we discovered that Agency 1's version of ABA didn't \"believe\" in sensory issues, while Agency 2 makes them an integral part of their program.  Joy's sensory issues are written all over her -- one of her school-district therapists called her \"THE most sensory-seeking child I've ever seen.\"  We couldn't possibly go with a program that didn't \"believe\" in such a major component of our child's make-up.So our hard-core work with Agency 2 got underway this July (after 15 months on the dreaded waiting list, which meant that the program actually started 19 months after her diagnosis, though we did do some introductory work out-of-pocket in fall 2007/winter 2008).  I'm not quite sure why I haven't been writing about it more, as the one-on-one hours have gradually swelled to our target schedule of 24 hours per week.  But at any rate, suddenly I feel like I have a lot to say about it, something that will span a number of posts in introduction and then will presumably weave its way through my posts as we move along.One challenge has been trying to get my mind around how to talk about Agency 2's program.  Interestingly enough, they really don't have a name for their protocol, as far as I can tell.  People tend to refer to it by the organization's name, as in \"Agency 2 Therapy.\"  That doesn't flow trippingly off the tongue for me; for the purposes of Elvis Sightings, I hereby dub the protocol \"House Blend.\"Mama Mara recently introduced me to a new blog called Spectrum Siblings, a most excellent and prolific blog by a Cale, a college sophomore on the spectrum (Asperger's) who also has an older brother with autism.  He has been doing a \"Theory Thursday\" series with explorations of neurodiversity and how different therapies can intersect with a neurodiversity outlook.  One of his opinions that leaped out at me:[T]he therapy should follow the child\u2019s interest. The best is a mix of DIR (to be discussed next week), and ABA, as it allows for the child and therapist\u2019s goals to be accomplished.Ooo!  House Blend, House Blend!So, here's a little bit of an introduction to what House Blend looks like.  The tag line on the Program Guide for House Blend staff (the baristas?) is:Learning to Interact......Interacting to LearnMuch depends on the partnerships between Joy and her staff.The program sets and works toward goals in five areas: Regulation (there's the sensory stuff, right at the top of the pops!), communication, relationships, learning, and daily living.  There's a definite hierarchy in these areas.  The theory is that if you're not regulated, you won't be able to communicate well; relationships depend on communication; and the partner relationships are key to guiding learning.Right now, the goals for Joy are written in the first three of the areas.  The first phase of the program, basically the first year of three, is called Beginning Relationships.  The first weeks (months) of the program were all about getting acquainted and getting our team up to speed.  Joy accepts new people with relative ease, but the building of the team was a longer-than-expected process.  However, operating at full-strength now, we've been able to work on the first goals and revise/expand them as Joy meets the benchmarks.  There has been forward movement, absolutely.  One of the documents we received from Agency 2 early in the process, which I can't lay my hands on right now for some reason, described the expected progress as an upward spiral.  I think that may be from Greenspan?Anyway, there are lots of specifics about communication strategies that therapists (and parents) are to use with Joy, and how the sessions are structured, and how to take data.  I'll do an upcoming post or two on the communication, which is where Jim MacDonald's work comes in, and also a post on Joy's specific goals and what progress we've seen.  And probably another post on a typical session.

It's a structured alternative to sign language in which a person communicates by selecting and handing over laminated pictures, often little line drawings like these:Joy made some progress with initially learning just the act of handing over the pictures, but she seemed to be attaching words to objects almost as fast as we were providing the pictures, so we let it fall by the wayside.Between then & now, alas, we've had these regressions.  After the first regression, the language did come back.  This time it's not really happening the same way.  It does seem to be time to give pictures another try, though this time we decided to use real photos instead of making Joy interpret the meanings of line drawings.  So I went and took a bunch of shots of common items in Joy's world, and her senior therapist for the intensive autism therapy got them laminated for us.Our first step will be using the photos in conjunction with the item or activity, eventually hoping to move to making choices.  It's not a strict PECS protocol, more like just making available another avenue for communication.Here are some of the photos.  Do you suppose she'll want to play with the slide...Or will she prefer the sandbox?Maybe she'll want to drink some milk... or possibly some juice instead?Even without hearing much about these plans, Joy's older sister Rose has picked up on the idea.  She's been very excited about decorating for Halloween, and is already making plans for how we'll carve the pumpkins (though we've yet to get to the pumpkin patch).  At first she wanted to carve hers with the words \"Happy Halloween!\" but I do believe I've convinced her to go with \"Boo!\" instead.Then she wondered what Joy would want on her pumpkin.  And then she came up with a sisterly idea: she would draw a couple of options, and Joy could choose among the drawings!  I did not prompt this in the slightest.  Here is what Rose drew:It's such a thoughtful big-sisterly thing.  I hope that Joy will cooperate at least a little.Meanwhile, I've already got the stencil picked out for my jack-o-lantern.  Fair warning: it does relate to presidential politics, so don't click if you don't really wanna know...

{"date": "Tuesday, January 13, 2009", "body": "\nWay back in the Dark Ages high school I had an excellent, quirky Chemistry teacher.  One of his tricks was suddenly bestowing a coveted award that could be earned at any time for clever thinking or a job well done.  The award was a mimeographed certificate known as an \"Attagirl\" or \"Attaboy.\"  If you ever collected 5 of them (a rare occurrence indeed), you could trade them in for the \u00fcber-certificate, \"One Great Big Pat on the Back.\"Well, despite pride being one of the seven deadly sins, I'm going to award myself an Attagirl, based on two bits of advice from past online conversations that I picked up and put into action on Joy's behalf.  And I'll rationalize the shameless self-congratulation because, hey, I'm sharing the good ideas with all of you, and that has to count for something!  Right?Bit of advice #1 was something we did last year: take a photo of your child to the IEP meeting (the summit at which you put together the Individualized Education Program/Plan that shapes what school-district services your child will receive in the coming year.)  Since Joy is too young to attend such meetings, and we were dealing with administrators who had never met her, I glommed onto that advice as a way to give her a physical presence at the proceedings.  We were very pleased with the outcome of the meeting and how it shaped the summer and this school year so far, and that photo surely helped set that stage.Bit of advice #2 was something that I ran across before either Rose or Joy had started with the school district.  The advice was to become a \"presence\" at your child's school as early as possible, so that you are not a stranger to the powers-that-be when your kiddo with all her unique needs comes down the pike.  Since Rose started school first, I've been able to volunteer on her behalf and also position myself as an already-valued part of the community as Joy moves toward kindergarten.  This year I help kids in Rose's classroom with their reading, and volunteer in the school library as well.  I also designed and maintain the PTA website, which brought me to the attention of the principal, and made me a known quantity to be able to raise concerns about last year's poor snow-removal on the city sidewalks across from the school (got it onto the PTA board agenda, people who knew people talked to people who get things done, and there's definitely been improvement!)Now that 2008 has rolled over into 2009, it's time to think IEP again.  Joy will turn 5 at the end of May, putting her at kindergarten age for next fall, but we're leaning pretty heavily toward waiting an extra year.  Once she starts attending school, it becomes ridiculously difficult to arrange a full schedule for her intensive autism therapy, which cannot overlap with school hours. (Gah. Don't get me started... that'll be a rant for another post.)  Since she's got an almost-summer birthday, she wouldn't be that much older than her classmates with early-fall birthdays anyway.So, what's the process for delaying kindergarten for Joy?  First, I needed to contact the administrator who presided over last April's IEP meeting -- who surely remembers us pretty clearly, in part because it's apparently so unusual to bring a framed photo to the meeting around here.  The photo of Joy was a memorable one, riding on the zoo carousel and beaming ear to ear.  Then that administrator sets up a meeting for us with the school principal -- you know, the guy who already knows me as a good person to work with because of the volunteering and PTA stuff...Maybe it's premature to do the \"shameless self-congratulation\" dance, since the meeting hasn't even been scheduled yet!  But, having put into practice those two bits of wisdom from other special-needs parents online, I'm feeling so much better about even the prospect of how this process is supposed to go.Attagirl, JoyMama!In unrelated news, I also got some bloggy appreciation from my sister-in-law ARatM (short for Auntie Running-at-the-Mouth).  I drew her name this year in the family holiday gift exchange, and my gift to her was a hand-embroidered running hat emblazoned with \"RatM\".  Not only did she wear it for a race on New Year's Day, she changed her profile pic to show off her new gear.

He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who! Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two. Joy has been making the sweetest little sounds lately.  Lots of little dove-coos, single syllables on falling intonations:Awww!Oooo.Gohhhh.Gooooo!Mmmmmm.She'll say them to herself in her crib, or at meals, or to whatever toy she's carrying around -- dolls with yarn-hair or her new My Little Pony with its lovely stimmy mane.  She's also been very snuggly, and the coos are simply divine when they accompany hugs and cuddles.GrandmaJoy and GrandpaJ (he went for the conservative alias, though really he's quite a progressive guy!) have been beneficiaries of our little Who-daughter's cooing and cuddling.  They've been struck by the many changes in Joy since their last visit half a year ago.  That visit was fraught with seizures and fusses and Joy outrunning them down the hall at church.  This time around, Joy has been cheerful and less distractible and has done a much better job of honoring boundaries.  We can even leave the bathroom doors open to air out, unthinkable half a year ago!Alas, the grandparents are leaving this morning, and we need to get back to the regular routine.  Back to daycare, and school, and work, and early rising.  We'll probably get all Grinchly and shove the tree back in its box sometime in the next couple of days, all shorn of its decorations.  We hope that little Cindy-Lou Who will not be disillusioned.  If she starts singing Wa-hoo-dor-ay, we'll be sure to let you know.========I was mulling this post during the day yesterday, and was surprised at church in the evening after I'd dropped Joy off in the nursery, when one of my friends caught me in the hall and brought up the Grinch.  \"You know little Cindy Lou Who?\" she said.  I nodded, my head full of Joy.  Well, she was thinking of one of my daughters, all right.  But she made the comparison to Rose!  I guess the sisters have more in common than I realize sometimes.========Update:  This morning Joy's special-educator from the school district worked with Joy and heard the coo-ing.  Without having read the blog, she quoted the line \"like the coo of a dove\" and compared Joy to Cindy-Lou Who too!

My Alaskan and Canadian readers may not be much impressed, but for us it set records, for the winter in 2007-2008 and for the month of December in 2008.Getting Rose to and from school was a particular challenge last winter.  Not that Rose doesn't cope with snow fairly well, but we always had Joy along too.  Too big to carry, strollers are useless in the snow, had behavioral issues in early 2008 and didn't always care to slog along snowy sidewalks.Other families were using sleds, especially for younger sibs.  But that didn't work for us either, and I was envious.  Joy wouldn't stay on a sled.  Even on a downhill run, she'd ditch halfway through the ride.  Trying to pull along a snowy road?  Forget about it.But this winter, I posted in December about our amazing family sledding outing.  \"Joy sticks to the sled like a little burr!\" I wrote.  So I decided to try the sled as a transportation device to get rose to school yesterday morning.It worked like a charm.  I was able to tow both girls on the sled about 2/3 of the way before we hit street & sidewalk that was too dry for sled (about a 10 minute endeavor).  Joy kept on the sled, and kept on her mittens and boots no problem.  Then I held her hand and we all walked the last third together.  The way back was similar.  Walked well, Joy alone on the sled this time, stayed on the sled and never lost so much as a mitten.  She did great.  Rose, on the other hand, complained bitterly about the cold once she had to get out of the sled and start walking, and told me she was so cold, she was gonna die.  And it was all my fault because I didn't lay out her scarf for her (as if she had asked? and anyway, she had a hat and a hood).  Can you say, \"pre-teen\"?  At the age of almost seven, yikes!!Guess I can say goodbye to the sled envy, at least unless/until we have any major switch-flipping in that area!  Speaking of switch-flipping, I'm now ready to declare that Joy did not have a Christmas regression this year, unlike the past two holiday seasons.  If the switches go haywire tomorrow, we'd call it a New Year regression.  But we made it through the holidays.

{"date": "Saturday, January 17, 2009", "body": "\nMe and my extended metaphors.Suddenly I find myself riffing on how if I'm going to use the name \"House Blend\" for the relationship-based therapy served up by Agency 2, the staff must be the baristas.  Right?  It's actually not such a bad analogy.  They're the ones actually assembling and serving it up on a day to day basis.  For the benefit of our (lone) male line therapist, I also hasten to point out that the World Barista Champion of 2008 is a dude -- the feminine-sounding ending on the word does not imply an all-female staff, though in our case it's pretty darn close.Here's how Joy's team is structured.At the head of the team is the Lead Therapist, a professional (degreed) clinician who is responsible for Joy's treatment plan.  We were fortunate that she was also the therapist with whom we did the out-of-pocket work while we were waiting for Joy to pop to the top of the waiting list.  She also keeps tabs on Joy through this blog and the Yahoo! Group that Lynda and the school-district therapists and I use to exchange reports.  She supervises the Senior Therapist and attends team meetings every other month (I think) and also periodically does a session directly with Joy.Next in the chain is the Senior Therapist.  She supervises and helps train the Line Therapists, runs the twice-monthly team meetings, and does a session with Joy just about every week.  I believe the required degree for this position is a bachelor's degree, though in a university town people's qualifications often exceed the minimum (like the taxi drivers with PhD's kind of thing).  Lots of training & experience go into this one too!Then the baristas who are behind the counter each and every day -- the Line Therapists.  We have five of them.  The required qualification is a high school diploma, though I believe all of our line therapists exceed that (we even have a speech-therapist-in-training who is most of the way through her graduate work!)  Then there's some training at the Agency 2 office, and then 30 hours of supervised hands-on training, and then the line therapist can go solo.The standard House Blend session is two hours long, with the final 15 minutes devoted to report-writing.  Our fully-staffed weekly schedule involves 12 sessions with Line Therapists, or 24 hours a week, not counting any additional visits from Senior or Lead Therapist.  Two sessions per week are at daycare, the rest are at home.  Then twice a month we have a one-hour team meeting.  For all of these hours, there must be a parent or suitable stand-in adult caregiver present.When you figure that we also have four one-hour visits from school-district therapists (one occupational therapy, one speech therapy, two special-educator, who also sits in on Agency 2 team meetings from time to time)... Our schedule is just nuts.  And Joy's getting bombarded with one-on-one attention.We have an excellent team going right now.  Hiring has been an issue, and it took longer than the state likes to see to get the team up to full strength -- technically we are responsible to get in 80 hours per month, and that didn't happen until December, though the team started assembling in July.  We had lots of early washouts, including a couple of hires who never even darkened our door, one who had overbooked herself and bowed out while in training, another who left for a job more squarely in her field after having completed training.I enjoy getting acquainted with our team members.  Despite the official warnings in the paperwork about professional boundaries, I find that we share nuggets of our lives in conversation just because we do spend so much time together.  So we've got the therapist who actually has worked as a Starbucks barista, and the one who has handbells in common with me and rock-band experience in common with JoyDad, and the one who used to sell jewelry in the parking lot at Grateful Dead shows, and the one who's working on a double-major in mathematics and art... It's really a delightful group.  I hate the thought of the inevitable graduations and other turnover, but I guess that's part of the way things go.Examples of Joy's goals, and the contours of a typical session, I'll save for future posts.A final word about terminology, though.  My career, such as it is, is in the field of librarianship.  I have the master's degree and, as such, am qualified to work as a librarian.  It makes degreed librarians all kinds of cranky when people refer to the high-schooler behind the check-out desk as a \"librarian.\"  It strikes me that there is something of the same dynamic with the word \"therapist.\"  Professionals who have worked long and hard for the various therapy degrees and credentials tend, I think, to shudder when the term \"therapist\" is applied to folks like Agency 2 line therapists.  But... that's the terminology that Agency 2 uses, so that's how I'm going to phrase it.  No disrespect to higher levels of credentialing is meant thereby.  Meanwhile, the line therapists are the ones on the front lines serving up the House Blend, and we very much appreciate all that they are doing for Joy, and in relationship with Joy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista", "http://www.worldbaristachampionship.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/baristas.html", "title": "\nThe Baristas\n"},

But I know that's not how it is in the real world, and since the only home I can influence is my own...This \"favorite place\" idea of mine grew organically from the seed of wanting to get the most out of our therapy visits as possible.  To me, that meant being present and engaged to try to learn all I can from the therapists' expertise; sharing what I know about Joy and what's going on with her; and coming up with my own ideas about how we can work together.It also meant being organized, and available, and on-time for the sessions.  (Occasionally I flub, but get easily forgiven because of my track record.)Therapists respond positively to such efforts!  Cordial partnerships have ended up becoming friendships, and I've ended up with even more reasons to want to make things pleasant.I found myself taking a little extra care to keep the floors on which they work/play from getting too disgustingly grungy, and to keep the bathroom reasonably clean as well.  Not that I wouldn't do that for our family (right?), but this provides an extra little kick in the pants.  Then there are the little things that make life a little sunnier.  Like small gifts of produce from the garden.  (Especially among our intensive-autism line therapists, these people aren't making a princely wage!) Or passing along a certain jack-o-lantern stencil to a therapist who gave me the thumbs-up about a certain sign in our yard.  Or complimenting a therapist on the piano piece she played for Joy during a session, ending up with me asking to borrow the sheet music.Most of this stuff I'm almost doing more for me and Joy than for the therapists, and I wouldn't be doing these things if I felt it was a burden or an obligation.  Instead, it makes me happy -- and it makes them happy -- and happy therapists are more likely to bring that attitude through the door.As I said before, ideally there would be no hint of competition between families.   And I know that there are reasons why, say, one's bathroom might be hard to keep clean or life is just too freakin' insane to do one more extra thing.  I've had stretches like that, most notably this past winter, and nobody's held it against me.Speaking of this past winter, for Christmas last year we gave our therapists little gifts of homemade strawberry freezer jam.  For some reason, thinking back on that now, it reminds me of a line from a LaVyrle Spencer romance called Morning Glory.  (Yes, I do have that kind of stuff on my shelf, among the highbrow goodies.  Now you know.)

{"date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2009", "body": "\nI don't remember where I first heard the outlines of the following illustration, but I know that Joy's senior barista/therapist used it recently at a team meeting and I've used it myself in a presentation to my church! It introduces the concept of sensory regulation:Think of a crowd of people sitting listening to a lecture. Think of what you do at a lecture. Does everyone sit perfectly still and straight the whole time? Heck no. Some have their legs crossed and are bouncing their foot. Some twiddle fingers or play with their hair. Some doodle. Some gently shift their body back and forth. These are examples of the kind of sensory regulation we do every day. We unconsciously adjust our bodies to enable us to focus and learn.Some people (like Joy, like many others on the autism spectrum, though you don't need to be on the spectrum to have sensory issues), have sensory needs and sensitivities that are so great that they can't just unconsciously jiggle a little to get to the point that they can be focused enough to learn, let alone get out of just an overall overwhelmedness. Some have super-sensitivities to noise or fluorescent light or texture or touch (like the wrong kind of fabric or seams in the clothes!), others crave more sensory input than their surroundings can automatically provide, often it's some sort of combination.I recently read an anecdote by an autism consultant, who has autism herself, about throwing herself against the wall to get the input she needed to keep her sensory circuits from blowing into mass confusion. Author/scientist/autist Temple Grandin reported creating a kind of contraption for herself that would smush her between two boards to give her full-body pressure. Cale over at Spectrum Siblings posted recently about consistencies he can't tolerate. Anecdotal evidence abounds!On the professional side, the concept of sensory integration disorder was introduced by an occupational therapist in the 1970s, and Joy's occupational therapists have been the ones with the expertise to guide (can I use the word prescribe?) her sensory interventions. Examples: How heavy should her weighted blanket be? How long can she wear her weighted vest before it begins to be ineffective?  Would the Wilbarger brushing protocol be appropriate to ease self-biting problems?So how is it that, as I've reported a couple of times now, the intake expert at Agency 1 of the two local intensive-autism-service-providers told us that Agency 1 didn't believe in sensory integration dysfunction?Well, when I want a skeptical view of treatments or diagnoses that may not be generally accepted, there are two websites I visit first. One is Respectful Insolence, blogged by a surgeon/scientist pseudonymously known as Orac, who takes great delight in dissecting all manner of what he calls \"woo.\" (\"Woo\" might be described as an antonym of \"evidence-based.\") The other is a site called Quackwatch (\"Your Guide to Quackery, Health Fraud, and Intelligent Decisions\"), also operated by an MD, a collection of information about potentially-dubious healthcare information.I didn't find anything about sensory issues at Respectful Insolence -- a good sign! Quackwatch, however, has an interesting piece called \"Why 'Sensory Integration Disorder' Is a Dubious Diagnosis\" by Peter L. Heilbroner, MD, PhD. \"Few pediatric neurologists believe that SID is a real diagnostic entity,\" the article claims.  Indeed, it is not a DSM diagnosis, and Tim commented a few posts ago that it seems to be losing the bid to make it into the DSM-V.  Instead, the author goes on, \"many neurologists...feel that 'sensory symptoms' are a nonspecific indicator of neurodevelopmental immaturity.\"  (In other words, people grow out of it, therapy or no.)  \"Given the fact that few (if any) adult patients have sensory integration disorder...\"  Hmmm.I think the big kicker is this one: \"A review of the literature on sensory integration disorder reveals mostly poorly designed studies and flawed methodology.\"You'll encounter a related caution at the site Sensory-Processing-Disorder.com, a sprawling site written by an occupational therapist named Michelle, who also runs an Amazon.com site with a fine selection of sensory-related books and products.  (As a librarian and critical consumer of information, I'd have liked to know her full name and more specific degree/credentials, though since she talks about her daughter, I can see why she might have chosen to go by first name alone.)  On a page called Is SPD a Real Diagnosis? she says:One of the most frustrating things about Sensory Processing Disorders (Sensory Integration Dysfunction) is that there has not YET been enough significant, massive, SPD research through controlled studies to quantify, prove, or predict the symptoms and life course of this disorder (in the eyes of the medical community).If you click the SPD Research link in the quote, you get a list of links to SPD-related articles and bibliographies of which she claims, \"If you want to know... Is SPD Real?  This should 'prove it'.\"  Unfortunately the list of links is not a critical bibliography, and nothing at all like a Cochrane Review (a huge name in evidence-based medicine; SID/SPD has not been a subject of review there. Yet?)  I think she's right that the growing mass of research will eventually get to the point where much more can be said with confidence about SID/SPD.  However, a mass of links does not a scientifically-valid argument make.  Anti-vaccine sites have their lists of links too...Barbara at TherExtras ran an interesting series last fall about sensory integration.  I was particularly struck by her account of a seminar she attended, where two very likeable presenters served up a program on sensory integration that had distinct overtones of \"woo,\" backed by an outdated bibliography.  Alas.  Not that such a seminar invalidates anything about sensory integration, but it doesn't exactly advance the cause either.Well.  I'm running at the keyboard here, and this is perhaps not one of my better organized posts, but I'll go ahead and put it up anyway.  Next up will be examples of the sensory interventions in the toolkit that we're using for Joy!  See, skepticism notwithstanding, we do believe in sensory issues, and their centrality to what will help our Joy.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://frogger11758.wordpress.com/", "http://frogger11758.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/butmyhandsssssss/", "http://www.pbbkids.com/the_wilbarger_brushing_protocol.htm", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/", "http://www.quackwatch.org/", "http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/sid.html", "http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/", "http://astore.amazon.com/sensorspecia-20", "http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/is-SPD-a-real-diagnosis.html", "http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/SPD-research.html", "http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/", "http://www.therextras.com/", "http://www.therextras.com/therextras/2008/09/introducing-senory-gurus.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/my-sense-of-sensory-issues.html", "title": "\nMy Sense of Sensory Issues\n"},

Hoo boy, do we got medicine at this house.  Here's the dosing that I'm responsible for:For JoyMama first thing in the morning: swallow 3 pills, inhale one dose.For Joy at breakfast: one oral syringe, four chewable pills, one powdered dose mixed in yogurt.For Rose at breakfast: one oral syringeFor Joy at lunch: one oral syringe (Lynda administers this on daycare days)For Rose at lunch: one capsule mixed into yogurt (on school days we move this to breakfast or dinner)For Rose at dinner: one oral syringeFor Joy half an hour before bedtime: one oral syringe, four chewable tablets, three tablets crushed and mixed with jam.For JoyMama at bedtime: Inhale one dose. It's a lot to keep track of, and I imagine some of you have meds routines that are more complicated still than this!  Unfortunately Rose & Joy's meds don't lend themselves to pre-loading into those daily pill-boxes, since so much is powder and liquid.Fortunately all the Rose dosing will drop out in a couple of days -- she's getting antibiotics for strep, and acidophilus to try and keep some good bugs in her.  (As an entomologist-in-training, she loves the terminology \"good bugs / bad bugs\" though she knows we're not really talking about insects.  After all, her doses don't have an exoskeleton, six legs, and three body parts...)You know, this recent series of posts reminds me of one of my fascinations as a grade-schooler.  I used to love the anatomy pages in our Compton's Encyclopedia set (I think that was the one; we acquired a more up-to-date Collier's set later on, if I recall correctly.  As if that matters, other than to a librarian!)  Instead of the regular paper, these were transparent overlays, building a human being from the back to the front.  Each overlay added more organs and bones and whatnot, all with terminology and descriptions.  I remember that's how I learned the word \"esophagus,\" because I had to ask a parent how to pronounce it! Anyway.  It strikes me that with these recent posts, I'm building an anatomy of our days, one overlay at a time.  I've still got a few more overlays to go before the post of what a House Blend session looks like.  This meds-dosage overlay doesn't apply to that, but does of course apply to the anatomy of the daily routine here.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+McFerrin/_/Medicine+Man"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/i-am-medicine-mama.html", "title": "\nI am a Medicine Mama\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 25, 2009", "body": "\nIt's been a while since I've done one of these, but I've got a couple of goodies to share.The first one is a huge hit, and has been rather a long time coming.  It's a 3-ring binder full of laminated photos, for picture communication.  I first talked about laminating photos back in October, in a post called \"Choices\".  That's when we started using photos of everyday objects (mostly food and playthings) to offer an alternative to spoken language for labeling things.  We've been moving toward having Joy be able to select and give someone a photo card as a form of request.  But for several months, we just had the cards in loose piles at home.  At daycare each card had a hole-punch in the corner, so they could be threaded onto a ring and kept together in that way.The photo communication has now become a more central part of Joy's formal House Blend goals, so over the holiday I put the binder together.  It's a velcro-and-manila-folder project (see Both Hands and a Flashlight for some games based on a similar concept!)  Each laminated photo gets a little square of stick-on velcro tape (the soft fuzzy side so it doesn't stick to carpet and clothes) on the back.  Each page of the binder can hold four photos on a side, so four corresponding velcro bits (the prickery-burr side).The binder pages are organized by categories: Food & Drink, Upstairs Toys, Downstairs Toys, Outdoor Toys.  Next addition will be an Actions section: jumping, tickling, pillow squish, etc.Then the front of the binder has two strips of the burr-side velcro.  Here's how it looks at snack time:As you can see, there's a lineup of three cards stuck to the binder, corresponding to the three parts of snack that are sitting before her: bunny crackers, drink, and raisins.  To get a small helping of any of the three, Joy has to grab the corresponding photo, rip it off the velcro, and hand it to an adult.  At the beginning of snack, I also use it with just two photos to give her a choice of which grain-option to have: bunny crackers or pretzels?  Kix or Cheerios?  Then once she's made that choice, we go to the three-card setup.Joy is really shining with using the photos, particularly at snack-time.  She does love her food, and will make requests again and again.  Often we have to cut her off when the number of helpings gets ridiculous, which sometimes even prompts her to make a \"more\" sign or say a \"mah\" word!  (Yes, we do reward her for that.  One final helping before the snack goes away for real.)I made a similar binder for daycare, velcro-ing all the photos from the rings into a binder so she'd have similar structure for photo choices.  This, so far, has been a bit of a miss, in that the photos-on-a-ring were such a useful handy way of using the photos (at least for labelling), that they miss it now that I've slapped all the photos in the binder!  Perhaps a duplicate set of photos is in order, at least for the most useful of the ring photos.======Next up is a common kiddy toy, cardboard box-blocks, that we got handed down to us from a friend.  Joy is still learning the whole tower-stacking thing, so these were a neat find.  What makes them \"home-made\" was a suggestion from Joy's lead therapist, who observed that the boxes can be opened up, and if you fill them with some weight, you can get a bit more sensory bang out of them.So here's what we did.There are two usable compartments within each block.  We filled each compartment with a ziplock sandwich baggie full of wood fuel-stove pellets, two eight-ounce baggies per block for a finished product with an extra pound of weight in a block.  Rose helped me fill the baggies and weigh them on a kitchen food-scale.  We had the wood-stove pellets easily available because we use them in the bunny litterboxes, but dried pinto beans or gravel or such would work well too.Hmmm.  Have I ever posted about bunnies?  I may need to do that at some point.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2009/01/14/fun-with-folder-games/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SXxtikMmWvI/AAAAAAAAANQ/mYAu5fW8n_I/s1600-h/snack-pecs.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SXxtz7oS8kI/AAAAAAAAANY/-LkdM4i8SL8/s1600-h/weighted-blox.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SXxuAc9NDqI/AAAAAAAAANg/UeY5mjzuhLM/s1600-h/weights-for-blox.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/product-hits-and-misses-homemade.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits and Misses, Homemade Edition\n"},

Then I promise I'll get back to the anatomy of Joy's days, at least until the Valentine's Day race!Here's the Bobby McFerrin song that's been in my head today, again from the Medicine Music album.  It's called Discipline:For those who have been trained by it,no discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful, no discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful... Later on however it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace, for those who have been trained by it,no discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful...Make level paths for your feetmake level paths for your feetstraighten out your feeble mindso He can make it heal, so He can make it heal,strengthen up your feeble arms,strengthen up your weakened knees,fix your mind on things aboveabove where we are freeabove where we will be...For those who have been trained by it,no discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful. My little foray into pain-spiced discipline this morning was an outdoor run through gently-falling snowflakes with Joy in the jogging-stroller.  I love how smoothly jogging-strollers ride in comparison to regular strollers.  I also succeeded in picking a 5K route that didn't have any glare ice.  Alas, my avoidance of glare ice sent me up a killer hill.  Did I mention I had Joy in the stroller, all 40 pounds of her?  Puff, pant, gasp, snuffle.  Also I'm fighting a cold (JoyDad has a version of the cold that's been kicking his backside for several days now.)  Plus Joy woke up at 2:30 this morning, and so did we.  All this combined to add about a minute and a half to my running time.  But I did run-jog-fasterthanawalk the whole course.However... while I'm not quite ready to claim a harvest of righteousness and peace from all this running discipline, I have been doing better at fighting colds this winter.  And keeping the deep-blue days of the deep-winter season at bay.  My weakened knees even feel pretty good.  I will not feel at all feeble when I take my bike commute back up this spring -- already the days are almost long enough for it again, if we get the right combination of good temperatures and good snow-clearing.I'd have done better to pick a level path for my feet, though.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.last.fm/music/Bobby+McFerrin/_/Discipline%2B%2528feat.%2BRobert%2BMcFerrin%252C%2BSr.%2B%2526%2BVoicestra%2529"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/01/one-more.html", "title": "\nOne More\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 28, 2009", "body": "\nOh the rhythm of life is a powerful beat,Puts a tingle in your fingers and a tingle in your feet,Rhythm on the inside, rhythm on the street,the rhythm of life is a powerful beat.I think I may have only heard this song once, performed by a highschool group back when I was a gradeschooler, but it was so catchy that it has stayed with me all this time.Been thinking a lot about rhythm lately.  One intriguing place that rhythm has broken into the routine is something that Joy's occupational therapist has begun to try with her.  Here's how she put it:I was experimenting some with rhythm... I want to address some of that internal rhythm for attention and regulation. So completing activities to a rhythm or song for attention and focus. Giving movement and input (deep pressure, massage or tapping) to a rhythm for that internal self-regulation. This has possibilities!  I think it resonates particularly well for me at this point with my running.  Yes, I'm still at it, having completed the Couch to 5K training just before Christmas, still running three times a week.  When I get outside (on weekends if the weather isn't too rough) I can keep going for 5K without too much internal struggle.  With hills and wind and some ice, I managed to do a 5K route in 34 1/2 minutes last Friday.At home on the treadmill, though, I need help and I usually do shorter (2-mile) runs.  If I don't have music to listen to, it's TOO boring to even get through that.  Two favorite tapes to listen to (yes, old technology, I know) have been Footloose and a tape of the Radiators from New Orleans.  I find that when the beat of the song matches my running pace, my energy level goes way up.What songs match my pace, right now?Well, let's see.  On the Radiators tape, there's \"Walking Backwards With Our Eyes Closed.\"  The line repeats again and again.  It's kind of like -- life with Joy.  Feels like we do an awful lot of walking backwards with our eyes closed sometimes!  Have to trust that we're going in good directions, with help from above.On the Footloose tape, the best run-pacing song is \"Heaven Helps the Man\" by Kenny Loggins.  (What's with all this \"man\" stuff -- medicine man, heaven helps the man, etc?  Oh well.)  Once again, my thoughts are drawn to my daughter:Looking into your eyes I know I'm right If there's anything worth my love it's worth the fight...Heaven helps the man who fights his fear Love's the only thing that keeps me here You're the reason that I'm hanging on My heart's staying where my heart belongs  Yes.  There are surely fears to conquer, but love keeps us hanging in there.  Joyfully.So, are all my running songs Joy-related?  Uh, turns out... not quite.How about another one off the Footloose album, \"The Girl Gets Around\"?  Let's see, that one must be... about running.  Yeah, that's it.  See, I get around faster because I'm running...Oh, and the one from the Radiators, \"The Nasty Boogie Woogie.\"Nope, can't spin that one.  Other than... life has its rhythms.  What can I say?Speaking of which, turns out the original version of the Rhythm of Life song comes from the Bob Fosse musical Sweet Charity and has slightly different lyrics from the childrens-choir re-write:And the rhythm of life is a powerful beat,Puts a tingle in your fingers and a tingle in your feet,Rhythm in your bedroom, rhythm in the street,Yes, the rhythm of life is a powerful beat!Heh.By the way, yesterday's treadmill entailed a 5K in 33:31.  A good sign, since I've signed up for a race in 2 1/2 weeks, on Valentine's Day!  Also running will be the friend from church that I told about the Couch to 5K thing back at Women's Retreat this fall.  And her husband, and her sons!  This will be so much fun!

{"date": "Saturday, February 7, 2009", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis Sightings===========I got a whole bunch of search engine hits yesterday looking for information about the pending legislation for autism insurance in Wisconsin, due to my post last month about the bill introduced in the Wisconsin Senate (SB3).  There was a segment on the show Here and Now on public television last night, and other news coverage I'm sure.  Things seem to be happening fairly quickly.So, here's what I know.The original author of the bill, Senator Judy Robson, introduced a substitute amendment yesterday (Feb. 6), with some added particulars.  In my last post, I mentioned the lack of a dollar cap.  That has been addressed in the new version:The coverage provided must be at least $60,000 for intensive\u2212level services per year per insured, with a minimum of 30 to 35 hours of care per week for a minimum duration of four years, and at least $30,000 for post\u2212intensive\u2212level services per year per insured. Beginning in 2011, the minimum coverage monetary amounts will be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the medical consumer price index.Another shortcoming of the previous version of the bill was that it did not specifically mention speech-therapy or occupational-therapy services, a common insurance exclusion.  The new version does specifically include these.There is still no age cap mentioned -- this is deliberate.  The intent is for insurance coverage across the lifespan.  Apparently there were shenanigans in Texas after the law was passed and it went to the insurance commissioner to hammer out the administrative details, at which point an age limit was imposed.  Ugly result; I understand, though, that in this state the Autism Society of Wisconsin is on the case.The expectation for this framing of the autism insurance proposal is that it will result in approximately 1/3 of the kids currently covered by the Medicaid waiver in Wisconsin (the intensive autism therapy program that provides Joy's House Blend) being covered by insurance instead.  Very helpful for the wait list!There is a public Senate Committee hearing on the bill this coming Monday, Feb. 9, at the Capitol in Madison at 10am.  JoyDad and I are unfortunately tied up at work, but I hope there's a good showing. Here's a link to more information about the progress of Senate Bill 3 (the legislative history).The companion bill, introduced in the Assembly, is Assembly Bill 15.If you would like to sign up for e-mail updates on these bills (or any Wisconsin legislation), you can do so with the Wisconsin Legislative Notification Service.You can also check the Wisconsin Autism Insurance Now site, which does a good job with talking points, but perhaps not so good with up-to-the-minute updates.  What I've written here is, as of today, much more current than what they've got up.I think it's time for Wisconsinites to start writing letters / sending e-mails / making phone calls to state representatives...I should perhaps also mention that there's a Republican response out there as well.  This seems to entail throwing just enough money at the Medicaid waiver program in a one-shot pacification maneuver to get people to stop talking about insurance, without any ongoing support for future years or for what happens after the intensive phase is done.  Weak.Last time I posted an outdated link to a map of autism insurance initiatives.  Here is one from Autism Speaks that is much more current, and allows one to sign up for e-mail alerts in their own state.Money is tight, in Wisconsin and everywhere.  But I think we've got momentum this time.Update Feb. 12:  It looks like the Senate committee hearing on Monday had good attendance and lots of personal testimony.  For the record, here is a link to the streaming video of committee proceedings.  The committee voted unanimously the following day to recommend the bill back to the full Senate for passage.  Bipartisanship, can you even believe it?!  SB3 as amended is now awaiting scheduling for a Senate vote.Update Feb. 19: See more recent post about the hearing on the Wisconsin Assembly version of the bill, AB15.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/SB3-SSA1.pdf", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/SB3hst.html", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/AB15hst.html", "http://notify.legis.state.wi.us/", "http://www.autisminsurancenow.org/", "http://thewheelerreport.com/releases/Feb09/feb4/0204newcomerautism.pdf", "http://www.autismvotes.org/site/c.frKNI3PCImE/b.3909861/k.B9DF/State_Initiatives.htm", "mms://71.87.25.133/com/com_090209_sen_health_1.wmv"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/more-about-wisconsin-autism-insurance.html", "title": "\nMore About Wisconsin Autism Insurance Legislation\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 1, 2009", "body": "\nWhen we first got Joy evaluated and into the Birth to Three early intervention program, we had an interesting stroke of luck.The program was short on speech therapists, didn't have one to assign to us right away, so gave us something else instead.  I got a couple of months of weekly training in parental techniques to encourage communication, using the Hanen program and the book It Takes Two to Talk.  (There's another version of the program that's focused on ASDs, called More Than Words, but we didn't have a diagnosis at the time.)The Hanen training gave us a magnificent foundation for getting more out of Joy's communication, turning us into better Joy-listeners and communication partners.The Hanen program was founded in Canada for the very situation that we were facing: frustration with long waits for professional speech therapists, families who needed to get started \"right now.\"  It's an incredibly empowering approach.  As their site says, The goal of It Takes Two to Talk is to enable parents to become their child\u2019s primary language facilitator, thereby maximizing the child\u2019s opportunities for communication development in everyday situations.Some of the highlights of the Hanen program, for me:An emphasis on meeting your child where she's at.  This includes a very basic physical principle of positioning yourself to be really face-to-face with your child, rather than talking at her from on high.  But it also entails letting you child show you what she's interested in, and paying close attention to her cues, and responding in a way that stands a good chance of drawing a further response.  It Takes Two to Talk calls this the \"Tuned-In Parent.\"An emphasis on playfulness and fun.  As in, your kid's going to be much more interested in sticking with a social interaction if it's enjoyable all around.  Let go of thinking that you have to make them talk (how many times have you heard an adult doing something like: \"Hey, Joy, can you say 'spoon'?  C'mon, say 'spoon' honey. Say 'spoon'!\"  and then she doesn't say 'spoon' and it gets totally un-fun for everyone.)  Instead, enjoy what interactions they *can* do... maybe pretend to eat from the spoon.  \"Mm, good food!\" then pass the spoon back and say \"Joy's spoon!\" and maybe she can pretend to eat too....One acronym I actually remember from the program, which is OWL, for Observe, Wait, Listen.  Observe to see what your child is interested in.  Wait to give her enough time to send you a message, whether a sound or gaze or action or whatever (it helps to lean forward and look expectantly, sending your own message that you are indeed waiting for a communication!)  Then Listen for your child's message, paying attention to as many cues as you can.  Even if you can't understand what her response, if you've waited and watched, you can often take a good guess and respond accordingly.  Or else take a turn by imitating... and then OWL again to give your child the next turn in the interaction.I found that a lot of this came pretty easily to me, once I took the time to think and practice.  Of course there were many more steps, and thought-exercises, and we also got several video-taping sessions with the speech therapist who was leading the training so she could comment and critique how we were putting the principles into practice.  It was simply thrilling to see Joy respond.Well, another reason we ended up doing Joy's intensive autism therapy with Agency 2 and their House Blend was that their approach builds on similar principles.  In fact, the James MacDonald (PhD) that I've mentioned before was involved in developing the Hanen program early on, and much of that work is evident in the Communicating Partners program that he later developed.  His latest book, Play To Talk: A Practical Guide to Help Your Late-Talking Child Join the Conversation, co-authored by Pam Stoika (PhD), is a highly-readable explanation of the approach and strategies.  (Plus it's reasonably priced, what a bonus!)The parent-empowerment agenda is powerfully stated on the very first page.If you are concerned about your child's social development, communication skills, behavior or learning, the first and most important thing to do is to find a person (or small team of people) to be your child's social language teacher.  In our experience, your child will make the greatest gains with a social language teacher who is:Someone who is already a competent communicator, with words as well as gestures and non-verbal communication.Someone who will be available to teach your child in a variety of real-life settings, such as play time, chores, meals, family outings and daily routinesSomeone who your child likes and trusts, and who likes and trusts your childSomeone who is familiar with and dedicated to supporting the cultural and family values you hold dear[the list goes on!]...Mothers and fathers, grandparents and guardians: go to the nearest mirror and look.You just found your child's best social-communication teacher. So, the Play to Talk / Communicating Partners training was what we layered onto the Hanen training when we were in limbo on the waiting list for intensive autism therapy, and we both wanted to keep moving forward and also start building our relationship with Agency 2.Here's the gist of the Communicating Partners program: strategies that seem simple, but each of them can be unpacked pretty far and take quite a bit of effort and practice to really internalize!Balance: Do and say about as much as the child does and says.  Allow child time to participate.Match: Talk and act in ways that are possible for your child.  Talk and act in ways your partner can and will want to try.Respond: Let your child see that you are paying attention to his feelings, actions and words.Share Control: Be sure each partner has impact on the other, each partner has some control but not total control.Play and Affirm: Let your child see that you enjoy and value him just as he is.All this represents another layer of our days with Joy, and the principles according to which our House Blend baristas are trained as well.Upcoming layers: Joy's therapy goals, and how her school-district therapists fit into all this too.  And maybe some bunnies.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/HanenPrograms/ItTakesTwoToTalk/tabid/76/Default.aspx", "http://www.amazon.com/Play-Talk-Practical-Late-Talking-Conversation/dp/0978832027/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233509399&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/best-social-communication-teacher.html", "title": "\nThe Best Social-Communication Teacher\n"},

Such fun to do springtime activities again!  I was dredging my memories for counting rhymes for her, and came up with this one:My mother, your mother, live across the wayEvery night they have a fight and this is what they say:Icky bicky soda crackerIcky bicky booIcky bicky soda crackerOut goes you!Maybe \"icky bicky\" is what Joy has been trying to say lately...In the past couple of weeks, Joy has been fine-tuning a two-syllable utterance.  It sounds something like this:ICK-eeEYE-goACK-erUGH-goNow, one of the precepts of the Hanen & Communicating Partners training that I wrote about earlier is that you honor your child's vocalizations.  Even if you don't know for sure what the intent is (or if there's any intent at all), if you encourage the vocalizations and treat them as legitimate communicative turn-taking, you encourage the patterns of social interaction and the idea that \"when I say THIS sound, they think I mean THIS!\"So if there's anything at all that fits the sound, that'll be how we interpret it.  Or if there's nothing in context that fits, we'll just imitate or play with noises.  Anything to take a communicative turn.You would be amazed at how many things the ICK-ee/EYE-go/ACK-er noise can mean.Buckle!  This one actually feels legit, in context of Joy buckling herself into her booster chair at food time. Cracker! Speaking of food... again, we've had some really neat exchanges where it absolutely does sound like cracker.Tickle!  I heard her going back and forth with \"tickle\" with one of her baristas yesterday.  Sure sounded real.Thank-you!  Does she know what this means?  It's definitely felt like she's imitating it...Got it!  She used to have this phrase in a solid, stand-alone way, back when she had 80-some words.Hot dog!Echo!Doggy!Icky!I go!Blanket!All-gone!Icky? Bicky? Soda Cracker?An incredibly useful utterance, wouldn't you agree?Meanwhile, there are a few other vocalizations in the mix.  Yesterday the \"tickle\" barista also got Joy to imitate \"b-b-b\" and \"p-p-p\" sounds.  We're also getting \"go\" for go and \"guh\" for hug from time to time.  Yesterday she started saying \"no-no-no\" just moments before attempting to climb onto the table on the deck, something she knows is a \"no-no\"!We'll keep tracking this talking stuff.  It's in there somewhere.  Meanwhile, when I told Rose the \"icky bicky\" counting rhyme, she giggled and then asked what the mothers were fighting about.  I told her I had no idea, but later it occurred to me... Maybe they're on opposing sides in the various autism controversies...My mother, your mother, live across the wayEvery night they have a fight and this is what they say:Icky bicky DAN! doctorNeurodiversity tooIcky bicky Andrew WakefieldOut goes you!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/icky-bicky-soda-cracker.html", "title": "\nIcky Bicky Soda Cracker\n"},

Oh, my baby!We've been celebrating for days -- restaurant outing on Saturday, party at our house Sunday, cookies and paper crown at school yesterday morning, family presents & cards in the mail last night, probably a few cards yet to arrive.She's such a fascinating combination of old-soul and pre-teen and sweet innocent child.  Oh, and little snot, too.The pre-teen Rose was kind of hoping for a Jonas Brothers CD or Michael Jackson.  The innocent child was just as thrilled to get an Imagination Movers CD instead (Juice Box Heroes!)The little snot is having trouble making herself convey the proper thank-yous to relatives sending her gifts in the mail (we're working on it!)  Although, I had to remind JoyDad that he developed a reputation in his own immediate family as a youth for ripping open a birthday card, declaring \"No money!\" and tossing it dramatically aside...The old-soul has been delighting her Sunday School teachers.I heard from one of her teachers awhile back, who was touched at how Rose is always excited to talk about her little sister in class when they discuss the events of the week gone by.Last night I heard from her other teacher (who also happens to be one of Joy's baristas) about their project this past Sunday.The lesson involved one of the healing miracles of Jesus, and the idea that we are called to be God's healing hands in the world.  To expand on the idea, they created a poster together, tracing their hands and adding other illustrations as well.As the poster-making was drawing to a close, Rose had one more idea.  She began drawing a smooth, looping line connecting all of the hands on the poster and the other illustrations.  \"That's God's love,\" she said, \"running between all of us.\"Amen.  And, happy birthday!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/happy-birthday-to-gods-hands.html", "title": "\nHappy Birthday to God's Hands\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, February 15, 2009", "body": "\nFrom the comedic genius of PDQ Bach, in his ground-breaking work Iphigenia in Brooklyn:Oh God, who knows what it isTo be running?Only he who is running... running... running... knows.Running, running knows, Run running knows, run running knows...!!!Kleenex, anyone?Any run outdoors in winter is going to involve Kleenex for me, and yesterday's 5K was no exception.  It was a gorgeous day, though.  The race started just after 11am, under bright-blue skies, temperature right around freezing, light winds, sunshine glistening on a 2-inch layer of snow that had fallen the night before.  Most of the race was along cleared bike-path, so we were really only running on snowpack for a few blocks of city street.The race was a lot bigger than my friends and I had expected.  From past years' posted results, it looked like the usual turnout was around 120.  This year?  430!  I wonder how many registered same-day, once they saw what a nice day it was.My personal goal was to run an 11-minute-mile pace, for a total time just over 34 minutes.I ran it in 33:15, for a pace of 10:42, running all the way.  I even had enough steam left to put on a bit of a sprint at the end, passing up the woman I'd been pacing behind for much of the race.  I guess if you take off the ten seconds it took me to cross the start line, that's 33:05.  Fastest I'd ever gone, even on the treadmill!  I placed 383 of 430.WOOO HOOOOOO!!I enjoyed having friends along so we could share one anothers' excitement.  The woman with whom I shared the Couch to 5K link back in November at the Women's Retreat had been training with her husband, and their two sons (10 & 13) came along for the run too, pretty much without training but they play soccer so they run well.  All of us were happy with our times.  The young'uns beat the pants offa me, but who's counting, right?Then last night we all went over to their house for dinner.  Joy was in a fine mood, ate well and sat happily at the dinner table for a long time, playing with the plastic from around the ice-cream carton while the rest of us talked.  The 13-year-old entertained Rose very obligingly, without a hint of teenaged-guy-attitude.  (Rose kept her own attitude in check as well, not complaining about the curry main dish but simply saying \"No, thank you\" as we had coached.)Wow.  Now I need a new running goal!  Shave my 5K?  Ten-minute miles, anyone?  I wouldn't have believed it when I started...One thing I failed to bring to the race was a camera.  Here are some older running-related photos for your entertainment, though:This photo from September 1991 was, if we're being picky and technical, my other first 5K.  It was a fun-run/walk at a Mennonite Relief Sale, a fundraiser for international relief work.  I had just finished a 2-year stint of Mennonite volunteer service in Chicago at the time, and a local pastor cobbled together a team with me and one of my former housemates and a couple other guys.  I don't think I trained much if at all, and don't remember much about the race either.  Like, I don't remember the starting gun, though I do have some flash memories of the actual running, including near the end when I was passed up by a race-walker!  I didn't know enough to look at my time on the clock at the finish line, so I have no idea how fast I went (if they were posting times, I wouldn't have known where to ask anyway).I wore the shirt again eleven years later, at the SCAATY Run in Chicago, September 2002 (Rose, hiding in the stroller, was seven months old).  SCAATY stood for Still Crazy After All These Years, and was organized by Uncle Marathon in honor of his 20,000th mile running.  Yes, you read that right.  Twenty thousand.  He'd been keeping logs since he started, something that I've now been talked into doing, and organized a run to invite friends and relatives to join him in running mile 20,000.  It was a nice little bit of post-pregnancy training for me, just to get to the point of jogging a mile, and JoyDad and I had fun joining in the 20,000th mile run and festivities.Don't worry, this isn't going to become a running blog.  I might sneak in updates now and again, though.P.S. Many thanks to Auntie RatM and Uncle Marathon for the tips and encouragement leading up to this race!  Yes, I did start near the back, and double-tie my shoelaces!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml", "http://www.half-fast.org/2008/02/shave-your-5k-challenge.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SZgqIseNRWI/AAAAAAAAAPI/D0YvFq8G89w/s1600-h/running-Chicago-Yes.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SZgr-wtOb3I/AAAAAAAAAPQ/SWotHNAXUYY/s1600-h/running-SCAATY.jpg", "http://runatthemouth.livejournal.com/24360.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/only-she-who-is-running-knows.html", "title": "\nOnly She Who Is Running Knows\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 26, 2009", "body": "\nWe've seen it a couple of times recently.Today it was unmistakable at lunch.  Joy wanted more Kix.  (What, you don't feed your children delicious nutritious breakfast cereals at lunch?  C'mon!!)  And when her portion was done, she very deliberately gave herself her own little fist-bump, the sign for \"more\" that has come and gone over the months, and come and gone.  Who knows if it will be here tomorrow.  Or even this evening.Just for today, she's chewing the bejammers out of her super-strength chewy-toy.  This overwhelming need to chew came back two or so weeks ago, I think.  She's also leaving it clipped onto her shirt today.  The last phase of super-chewing, she would let Lynda clip the chewy onto her at daycare, but would pull it off in a second at home.  Who knows if she'll need to chew tomorrow, or if she'll leave the clip on.Just for today, she's been pushing some boundaries.  Climbing onto the toy chest to get to the TV.  Climbing onto the glider-rocker in the living room, which she never used to do.  Most of the time she's responding well to a voice-prompt of \"Joy, down!\"  But who knows if she'll climb tomorrow, or if the voice-prompt will work tomorrow.This weird uncertainty, this not knowing when the switches and sliders on Joy's mixer board will flip and slide, is making it a challenge to write her IEP, her Individualized Education Plan for the upcoming school year.  Her school-district team leader commented to me the other day, after having combed through months of daily reports, that there are lots of times where we report something new starting, but then she often doesn't find a mention of when it stopped.Well, yeah.  At one point back in September I blogged that Joy had retrieved the word \"ma-ma-ma\".   A week later, I wrote, And we never know, from day to day, whether this day will be the last day that she says ma-ma-ma for the next year. We can't take any gain for granted. And that's very, very hard.Guess what.  One day, probably not too long after that, was the last time I heard \"ma-ma-ma\".  But I don't know what day it was, because when she said it for the last time, I didn't know it was the last time.  I don't even remember when I realized, \"Hey, where are the ma-ma-mas?!\"So we end up not having a good record of when things go away, either the things we want to go away (like the night-wakings, still with us, alas!), or the things we desperately wish wouldn't go away.  Like \"ma-ma-ma.\"It's funny, but it almost feels as if IEPs are written with neurotypical children in mind, in that way.  You write goals, with the general expectation that the child will make documentable progress toward those goals, so you can record when a goal has been met and set new, higher goals.  It's not set up for our reality, which is more like, \"Joy was doing this thing pretty well in the fall.  Then she didn't do it for a long time.  Now she does it sometimes but not always, and we don't know why she does it some times and not others, and it might disappear again, who knows.\"So, what goal shall we write for whatever \"thing\" it was?  Do we keep trying to teach it?  Do we figure she knows it but doesn't show it?  If she doesn't do it, how can we build on it?IEPs are not built for living in the moment.And today, just for today, maybe even just at lunch... Joy signed the word \"more.\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/just-for-today-she-signed-word-more.html", "title": "\nJust for Today, She Signed the Word \"More\"\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 21, 2009", "body": "\nSo I had in mind to start this post with some cute collection of rules in our household, maybe some particularly quirky ones related to Joy's autism.  But then I found a link from Quirky Mom to a most excellent post by One Sick Mother, who writes about Rules, Damn Rules, and Statistics.  She structured the start of her post the way I'd hoped to do mine, only better than mine was coming out.  So, go read hers, and remember her introduction.  Then come back and finish mine.One Sick Mother's well-deserved rant was about the rule-of-thumb kind of thing that physicians use in making their diagnoses, such as \"Kids under the age of one don't tend to get strep.\"  The problem comes when the rule becomes inflexible and exceptionless, morphing into \"Kids under the age of one DON'T get strep.\"  Her kiddo, of course, got to be Exhibit A of how the rule needed some flexibility.I'm going to rant about discuss rules that need flexibility too.  We've had several examples lately of program rules that are designed to prevent various kinds of inappropriate behavior.  Such rules (when not administered with flexibility) can have unfortunate consequences for people who behave WELL.Here are the examples:From Agency 2: Parents and therapists must behave professionally toward each other at all times.From Project Lifesaver: A year's supply of batteries and bands for the Project Lifesaver radio-tracking device may be administered by someone other than the sheriff's department.  However, that \"someone\" may not be the caregiver of the person wearing the band.From the state: Intensive autism therapy hours must happen in the home with an adult present in addition to the therapist.  Preferably that adult should be a parent but really any adult over the age of 18 will do.  Any therapy hours in other community settings must be applied for in advance, with detailed goals, and approval will only be for 3 months (at a time).  You can't do more community hours than 25% of the therapy hours you have scheduled in the home.We have encountered different levels of flexibility with these three rules.The administration we've encountered with Rule 1 is, in my opinion, a beautiful example of how flexibility should be employed.  In my post about the baristas, I had written,I enjoy getting acquainted with our team members. Despite the official warnings in the paperwork about professional boundaries, I find that we share nuggets of our lives in conversation just because we do spend so much time together.Our lead therapist read that and reassured me at our next meeting.  She said she had no worries at all about barista-boundaries at our house, not even the informal data we've been collecting about who's got tattoos!  (For the record, on our Agency 2 team there are 3 baristas with tattoos and one former Harley-rider.  Which I think almost counts.)  The rule, she explained, is there because not all families do have healthy boundaries, and sometimes parents will try to do things like glom on to a therapist as a Best Friend Forever or otherwise make unwelcome overtures.  In which case -- it's very useful to have the rule to enforce.Flexibility!  The idea that not all families have to be punished because some families abuse privileges!  Is that cool, or what?So then we have the Project Lifesaver rule.  I love the idea that the batteries and bands for the radio device don't need to be administered by the sheriff's department.  It's been a hassle both for us and them to have us truck out to the station once a month or have them come to us to do the monthly battery replacement, plus it freaks out the neighbors to keep seeing squad cars in front of our home.But.  How silly is it that we have to burden someone ELSE with the battery storage and installation, and can't do it ourselves?  We who can administer epilepsy meds three times per day for months, nay years, and never (OK, rarely) miss a dose?Alas, there's no flexibility for the sheriff's department on this one.  The rule comes down from Project Lifesaver Central and the deputies have to comply.  So, we'll find a way to make it work.  Our Wonder Woman daycare lady Lynda has agreed to get trained in how to do the monthly battery installation, and take delivery of the year's supply of batteries and bands.  I'm sure we'll (wink) be able to work something out.And then there's Rule 3.  The biggie.  The one from the state that says we have to have our House Blend therapy at home.This rule was not always in place.  At one point, therapy could happen at daycare as well as in the home.  Lynda has experience with a previous kiddo at her daycare whose parents both worked full-time, and the child received oodles of House Blend hours at daycare.  Which was great!  Lynda's place is \"therapy heaven,\" as one of our previous speech therapists put it.  It's a home away from home, Lynda generally only has 6 kids at a time, she does a great job of participating in therapies and learning techniques and making suggestions and keeping everybody in the loop.Unfortunately, there were apparently daycare situations that were not so ideal.  Plus there came a budget crunch and a cutback in the number of hours that would be funded.  Suddenly the pendulum swung crazily in the other direction.  Therapy at daycare became suspect; therapy anywhere outside the home became suspect.So, here's the ridiculous situation we find ourselves in.  We have a glorious daycare setting, an ideal therapy setting, a home away from home.  Joy's been going to this daycare for a couple of years, where she gets to be with peers and gets all the extra enrichment that Lynda's place offers.If we'd had Joy at home alone with an au pair or a grandma or other one-on-one babysitter (anyone over the age of 18), the state wouldn't bat an eye at sending the therapists to that type of daycare setting.  Which, in the case of a one-on-one paid provider, is generally more expensive than group daycare, which amounts to discrimination against working parents who don't have a lot of extra dollars to throw around.But because we want her to have some therapy hours out of the home (four hours a week! only four, out of twenty-something!), we have to write these elaborate applications for three-month goals, with plans for how we're going to transition out at the end of those three months even if we're going to apply again.  The most expensive member on our Agency 2 team (the lead therapist) is spending HOURS on these applications, plus daycare visits and documenting and generally going to bat for us.Our first three months of therapy at daycare are winding up.  The application for another round is in right now, though there have been several requests back from the state for further information and documentation.  More administrative/clinician time and effort.  For a lousy three more months, that might or might not be granted, and if granted, might be the last three months of House Blend therapy at daycare Joy gets to have.Is this outrageous, or what?Damn rules.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://confessionsofaquirkymom.blogspot.com/", "http://onesickmother.typepad.com/", "http://onesickmother.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/01/rules-damn-rules-and-statistics.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/02/rules.html", "title": "\nRules\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 5, 2009", "body": "\nDoesn't it always seem to be a bit of cognitive dissonance when an \"economic UPdate\" comes on the TV or whatever, and then the news is all about how things are spiraling DOWN?Anyway.  We've got both ups and downs here, so we got both updates and downdates.UPDATE: Rose is feeling much better.  She went to school on Monday, only a little worse for the wear (achy muscles from all the hurling).  Cute Rose story from yesterday: we were in the car on the way home from piano lesson and she asked me, \"Did men always used to have to have short haircuts?\"  I started an answer about how it wasn't that you had to have short hair, it was just...\"Tradition!\" she supplied from the back seat.  I chuckled and told her what a grown-up girl she was, that that was exactly the right word.\"Yep,\" she replied smugly.  \"I'm a human dictionary!\"That's my girl!  A chip off the ol' OED!UPDATE:  Joy's \"more\" sign has persisted this week.  She's not using it at every opportunity, but we're still seeing it occasionally.  She also seems to have retrieved her old sign for \"all-done,\" which consists of self-applause.  Which makes sense, because what do people do when you finish an achievement?  They applaud and praise you!  She used it remarkably well at Tuesday lunch, when I was around the corner as she finished the food she wanted to eat.  I heard the clapping and came running, and she was absolutely telling me she wanted to be done.  And then I told her that she needed to eat a few more bites of ham before I'd let her get away with being \"all-done.\"  Heh.  Little stinker.DOWNDATE:  Sigh.  This one harkens back to my Rules post the other week, in which I ranted about the ridiculous conditions and hoops to jump through to get 3 months worth of House Blend therapy (at 4 hours per week) at our fabulous daycare.  Our daycare lady, Lynda the Wonder Woman, provides just an ideal setting for therapist work, and is a full member of our team.  The daycare setting provides Joy with the opportunity to work on generalizing goals that she's been working on at home, into her \"home-away-from-home\" setting where she gets to interact with more peers.Well.  The response came back last week.They said that in the next 90 days, we could have FOUR of our 4-hour therapy weeks.  We're to sprinkle them throughout the 3 months as we see fit, but the emphasis should be on training Lynda so that we can fade out the need to have the therapy at the daycare at all.This is not a decision made with Joy in mind, or with any clinical basis in the situation.  This is a bean-counter decision, made in service of an apparent crackdown on therapy hours outside of the home in general.ALL kids need structure, and stability, and routine.  Kids on the spectrum have an even greater need for structure, and stability, and routine.So, let's jazz things up at daycare, shall we, with 4 hours of therapy in week 2 of twelve, and then we'll take two weeks off, and then we'll have another week with 4 hours of therapy, and then we'll take three weeks off...You see what I mean.  That kind of approach isn't particularly kind to barista-schedules either, might I add.It looks like our only sensible option is to take all four weeks consecutively, starting next week.  And then we're out.  No more therapy at daycare.  No further venue of appeal, other than the committee that handed down the decision to begin with.Well, our particular case might not be appeal-able, according to the rules that are apparently being re-written and tightened as the months go by.  But when the rules are THAT BAD, maybe someone needs to do something to get those rules changed in the right direction....Will keep you posted.  If I need help, I'll let you know that too.

{"date": "Sunday, March 1, 2009", "body": "\nSo this has been a sleep-deprived week at the Joy household.  I wrote about the ridiculous lack of sleep over the church retreat weekend, starting with Rose waking me at 4am Saturday with a tooth that had fallen out, then 20 straight hours awake partying at the retreat, then 2 1/2 hours of sleep and not much more than dozing the rest of Saturday night...Catching up from that big deprivation wasn't going well.  Joy did a lot of night wakings this past week, of the kind in which she wakes at 2:30 or 3am and starts enjoying herself in the crib, with loud comments.  Sometimes she'll snooze again at 5am, sometimes she just stays awake.  And then she doesn't nap!  As you can imagine, the big people have a hard time sleeping through this too.Finally on Friday night I had a good solid 8-hour night.  It would have been longer (Joy slept till we woke her at 7am, eleven hours!) but I had bell practice all morning and we needed to get a week's worth of groceries before I left.Oh, how I was hoping for a solid night last night, to consolidate my rest and make the world right!But Rose came to my bedside at 2:30.  \"My tummy doesn't feel good.\"  I staggered out of bed, gave her some simethicone, and sent her back to her room.  Ten minutes later, she was back.  \"I threw up all over my bed,\" she reported.Aughh.  Got her moved onto the couch with a barf bucket, stripped her bed, started the laundry... and woke up Joy.  Who didn't go back to sleep.  But that was the least of the worries.Rose, wide awake, wanted a video.  So we curled up on the couch to watch, and she then started heaving at intervals of 10 or 15 minutes.  I lost count of how many trips I made to dump the bucket.Eventually she was tired enough to sleep, thought the barfing was done, go to bed Mommy, I'll stay on the couch.  So I gratefully hauled back to bed, about 4am this was.  Ten minutes later, she's at my side.  She'd whoopsed again, and without my help she didn't get the bucket in time.  So now I have another load of laundry to do, and I'm back out to the living room.  To lie down on the floor, since Rose is now using the whole couch.  She was so tired she actually did nap, but the ten-minute intervals continued, with me on duty listening for the gagging since she couldn't position the bucket in her sleep.Finally JoyDad got up after 5 sometime.  I put him on bucket duty and wearily crawled away to bed.  I did get to \"sleep in\" at that point.  And the last bucket, that I dumped just as he was getting up, was (wonder of wonders!) the last retch.  He didn't have to oversee a single one.  Lucky, lucky dude.Despite a few hours of morning sleep, I don't feel much rested.This was not what I had in mind.UPDATE:  Well, just when I get a good self-indulgent whine on, I read something that makes me count my blessings.  Prayers for Nik and his mama over at Maternal Instincts.  They're having a rough time right now, and sleep deprivation is just part of it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/home/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/not-what-i-had-in-mind.html", "title": "\nNot What I Had In Mind\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "body": "\nBoth Joy and Rose are making transitions from one clothing size to another.Of course, it would happen simultaneously.  And it would happen right when the stores have finished selling off their winter clearance and have barrelled all the way into summer.  Shorts!  Swimsuits!  Beach wear!  Does nobody realize that we're supposed to have a low temperature of FOUR DEGREES here on Thursday?!  (And yes, that would be Fahrenheit.)Fortunately, I have two girls.  So I have a nice stash of hand-me-downs from Rose to Joy.  Joy doesn't mind a whit.  Rose doesn't mind secondhand goodies either, perhaps having absorbed my delight in thrift-store shopping.  It's cheap, it's eco-friendly, it supports good causes, what's not to like?  It also beats new-clothing shopping in another way.  One of my favorite Rose-clothes stores, Kohl's, has the cutest girl-stuff in their little girls department, sizes 4-6x.  Except that Rose is now a size 7, so she moves over into their big girl department, sizes 7-16.I will NOT dress my 7-year-old like a teenager.  Give me thrift-store selection any day.Anyone got any favorite not-too-expensive stores for that in-between girl stage, beyond little-girl but not yet tween/teen?  Meanwhile, the most definitive up-sizing for Joy was with her footie-jammies.  The 4T's were getting snug on her, which was just as cute as could be.  I love putting her in footie-jammies because they've got that long zipper all the way up the leg, and she can close that zipper the whole length by herself.Unfortunately, she'd been doing a lot of unzipping too during her middle-of-the-night wakeful hours.  We'd been finding her in the mornings with her feet still in the footies, but the rest of the jammie all unzipped in a heap around those footies.So we moved her up to Rose's old 5T footie-jammies, which fit surprisingly well.Even more surprising?  The night-time unzipping stopped.Clever, growing girl.  She was trying to tell us that she was too big for her jammies!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/growing-girls.html", "title": "\nGrowing Girls\n"},

Sit on the platter, grab the spindle, pull yourself around, make yourself so dizzy you puke!  The ad went like this:Some kids go [sound effect: wheeee!] when they Sit N' Spin,Some kids go [sound effect: honk! honk!] when they Sit N' Spin...Well, Joy has a modern version of this venerable toy.  It has a purple oval instead of a circle for a platter, a big picture of Dora the Explorer on the spindle-wheel, and a way-noisy Dora soundtrack.Joy loves it.Here's how it looked this morning:Some kids goWhen they Sit N' Spin,Some kids goWhen they Sit N' Spin,Some kids goWhen they Sit N' Spin,Some kids goSome kids goSome kids goWhen they Sit N' Spin!Funny enough, one of the squats during all that sitting n' spinning resulted in a full diaper.

The sun shone bright all day, the temperature climbed to 55 degrees, the streets were full of snow-melt rivulets.I was fortunate enough to be off work taking care of Joy, due to a vacation day at the daycare.First thing that Joy and I did was walk Rose to school, wheeling along with the jogging stroller.  Then we kept going, making the walk over an hour long altogether.  So lovely to be out with the sun on our faces!Then after a therapy session, we went out again, this time to an open-gym session for the five-and-under set at a local gymnastics place.  They have a glorious huge gym all full of trampolines and big squishy mats and ropes and a crash pit and a carnival-sized bouncy castle and a 3-story play structure like the kind at McDonalds Playplaces (only bigger).  Joy and I haven't had many opportunities to hit this place in the past year, but between therapist illness and daycare vacation, we were able to go once the other week and then again for this Friday visit.Joy had a blast. I loved seeing how much she learned from the first visit to the next.  One particular example was the bouncy castle, which had a ramp kind of thing you could climb when you wanted to go up to the slide and then exit.  Her first time in the castle the other week, I had to climb in with her to nudge her up to the slide.  Then her other two forays into the castle that visit, I was able to stand outside the castle and call her over to the ramp, and she'd climb up.  On Friday, I was able to call her to the ramp right away.  Then by the end of our visit, she actually went up the ramp with no input from me at all!And then she napped after lunch.  Ahhh....And then in the afternoon, we went to the zoo!  We're lucky to have a pretty decent zoo in town, with the added advantage that admission is free.  Quite a few animals are off the displays in the winter, but there were plenty left to enjoy.  The penguins were in fine form, and the polar bear, and the otters.  My favorite, though (and I think Joy was at least watching them somewhat too) were the prairie dogs.  They were doing this funny thing where every minute or two, one of them would stand up on its hind legs and scream \"Wheeeek!\"  It would be answered by similar salutes from other prairie dogs: \"Wheeeek!\"  Almost as entertaining as the prairie dogs were a group of college kids watching the prairie dogs.  Every time the \"Wheeek!\" thing happened, the observers also threw their hands into the air and hollered \"Opaa!\"And then we picked up Rose from her after-school program, and when we got home, we found snowdrops blooming on the south side of the house.Spring is coming.  Even though it has rained pretty much all weekend so far and will probably snow before the afternoon is out.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/out-and-about.html", "title": "\nOut and About\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2009", "body": "\nI'm feeling just a trifle bad about a little bit of grousing I did in the comments over at diary of a mom the other day.Jess had written a post about a lovely experience at the American Girl Bistro in Boston, where they had a waitress who was magnificently ready-to-help about autism-related issues. (If only they'd known to ask her at the beginning of the meal!)  The comments were singing the praises of the wholesome sturdy educational American Girl product line, especially in comparison to the likes of Barbie and her physically-impossible ilk.Rose had just gone Barbie-shopping with some birthday money, and had gotten both a bikini-clad doll and a Barbie swimming pool with lifeguard chair & other accessories on sale for the price of ONE new American Girls outfit.  My grouse compared the dolls to cheap junk-food calories (Barbie) vs. pricy organic fresh stuff (AG).  Sometimes when you can't afford the latter, you're going to go with the former, and that's just the way it is. Grump, grouse, whine.  And pass the ramen noodles.Well.  We got a phone call yesterday from Rose's school.Weekend before last, her school had held their annual big PTA fundraiser carnival, and we had ponied up $10 for raffle tickets.  We were told that we needn't be present to win, but if we did, they'd give us a call within 48 hours.  Having heard nothing, we thought, \"oh, well.\"The call, from the secretary, said, \"We were hoping you could find a time to pick up the American Girl stuff you won at the carnival.  It's been sitting in the principal's office and he'd like to get it taken care of.\"Ooo.  American Girl stuff!  We've never purchased anything American Girl ourselves, even though it's a (local) Wisconsin company.  We'd read almost all of the books from the library, though.  And we do have a Molly and a Kirsten and a bunch of clothes & accessories, most of it hand-me-down, an outfit or two came as gifts.  I was thinking maybe we'd scored a new outfit or some such in the raffle, and so I walked to school with Rose this morning, Joy in the stroller, thinking to bag up the dolly-clothes and tote them home.Nuh-uh.  Here's what it was:Molly's Stage and Screen.  Plus Theatre Seats.I had to come back with the car to load up the big box.These are retired items, might have been \"seconds\" because some little add-ons were missing, like the stage lights and the popcorn that usually come with.  But they're brand-spankin' new.  What a gorgeous, generous donation.  And what amazing raffle-y luck to win this for Rose! I think that Rose's Barbies and Only Hearts dollies are going to love performing here, along with their bigger American Girl counterparts.Maybe someday Joy will be able to do theatre pretend-play too.  For now, we'll have to keep her from sitting on the chairs.But anyway.  I retract my whine!

Fortunately, though, we have a nice deck that catches the afternoon sun.  Joy was out on the deck with her barista this afternoon, while I was inside concocting a delicious vegetarian lasagne with rainbow chard, frozen from last year's garden.Suddenly I heard squeals cries of delight coming from the barista on the deck.  \"She's pedaling!  She's pedaling!\"  As I came to the door, the barista demanded, \"Has she ever pedaled the trike before?\"Well, no, not really.  We've tried for several years now.  I've duck-walked backward in front of the trike, holding her feet onto the pedals, and she'd go around a few times that way.  She'd sit on the trike and propel herself with feet on the ground.  But no, she'd never pedaled before.\"Oh, then you have to see this.  Look, she was getting her feet onto the pedals and would keep them on when I pushed her... here, Joy, feet on the pedals... and then when I let her go, she kept on going... wait, Joy, can you put your feet back on?  Oh, no.  Well, she was doing it a minute ago!\"Heh.  Elvis rides again.By the way, this is an awesome little trike.

{"date": "Monday, March 23, 2009", "body": "\nWe had a great big Agency 2 team meeting at our home the other evening, that really brought home the magnitude of the plate-spinning we (I) are doing on Joy's behalf these days.There were 11 people at the table:4 House Blend baristas (including a brand-new one, we've had a spot of turnover)the House Blend senior therapistthe House Blend lead therapistthe county case managerthe school-district team leaderLynda from daycareJoyDadJoyMamaIt was a fine meeting, lots of positive Joy-stories and a good opportunity to get on the same page with some things that we're doing with her PECS photos and such.  We sent a plate of on-sale, store-bought cookies around the table.  I couldn't believe how appreciative everyone was.  I guess people are too overwhelmed or don't think to do those little hostess-y, favorite-place things for their wonderful therapists?The next day, JoyDad gave me an extra hug and thank-you for all the coordination I do to keep this whole show moving.  (That would be what Maddy recently referred to as \"wrap-around services,\" I believe.) Hug appreciated!  It's a crazy edifice we've built here, especially when you consider that this still isn't EVERYONE who is on Joy's team.  We were missing one barista who had a conflict with the meeting time, and Joy also has a speech therapist and an occupational therapist with the school district who weren't involved with this meeting.  Then there's the team at church, where she has two Sunday-school teachers and TEN different volunteers (one for Sunday school and another for worship, a different pair every week of the month).  One of those volunteers did the original recruiting and scheduling, which I appreciate deeply but which does not relieve me of the responsibility to let the right people know when we'll be missing a Sunday, for example.  In a similar vein, the Senior therapist is in charge of scheduling the House Blend barista sessions, but I'm the one who has to pick up the phone and go scrambling if someone doesn't show up, not to mention making sure that either JoyDad or I will be in the house during the sessions!And then there's the primary care pediatrician, and the pediatric neurologist, most excellent partners indeed.And then any other specialists as needed...Which brings me to our latest new wrinkle.  JoyDad has been noticing for some time that Joy's eyes don't always seem to be tracking well together.  I don't see it as much as he does (I think mostly I don't want to know, LA LA LA LA....) but eventually even I had to admit it.  I did check informally with her neurologist to confirm that it didn't sound seizure-ish, but rather strabismus-ish. Here's why I don't want to know.  When Joy was diagnosed with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), we went through a round of specialist visits to check out some of the things associated with the syndrome.  One of those \"things\" is ocular abnormalities.  So we went to a pediatric opthalmologist in September 2007.That eye-check visit was THE WORST clinic experience I've ever had with Joy.  And this is a girl who has had 3 plastic surgeries under general anesthesia, a sedated MRI, a 4-hour video EEG, the list goes on and on.  We'd arrived on time for the eye-check and ended up waiting for nearly an hour to see the doctor.  The waiting room was crowded and noisy and under construction.  We went through all the snacks and toys I'd brought along in the first 30 minutes.  Then Joy had a seizure, if I'm remembering correctly, putting her in a foul foul mood.  Then finally we got to see the doctor... for the FIRST time.  Oh, hadn't anyone told us... they needed to dilate Joy's pupils.  Please go back to the waiting room for another hour to give the drops time to work!  I went back to reception and begged to be allowed to go home and come back, just a 5 minute drive.  Well, OK, they finally agreed, but you have to be back in 45 minutes to be sure you don't miss the next round with the doctor.  So we made it back in 45 minutes... and then waited ANOTHER 40 minutes, Joy with wide wide pupils and refusing to wear anything like sunglasses on her face.  Joy and I were both basket cases by the time we saw the doctor again.  The doctor was barely able to catch a quick peek into those poor sensory-overloaded dilated eyes, and in that quick peek didn't see anything worrisome.Alas, strabismus is on the list of ocular abnormalities that can be part of LNSS.  (And associated with autism too, I think maybe?)So I dragged and dragged my feet about contacting Joy's pediatric office this time, but finally eventually did, telling my whole sad story about why I was really really hating the idea of an eye appointment.  I didn't get to talk to the pediatrician himself, but nurse who called back told me that he'd recommended a pediatric opthalmologist who happened to be the same one we'd seen before.  Not that I had anything against the doctor -- we really didn't get to interact with her much -- but she's still at the same clinic!!  As my dear friend Mama Mara would say, GAAAAAH!The nurse tried to talk me down.  You just tell them your story, she said, tell them Joy's situation and that she CANNOT have another experience with those kind of waits in that kind of waiting room.  If they give you any guff at all, talk to the clinic manager.  Just don't take no for an answer.  They'll take care of you if you escalate it properly.Friday morning I heaved a big sigh and went to the phone.  I spoke to a very nice appointment-desk lady who was very sympathetic.  She put us in for a first-appointment-of-the-day so we'd get in quicker, with fewer people in the waiting room.  If there's an exam room available that day, we can maybe wait there... while we wait for her eyes to dilate... no, ma'am, no way around that.  This kind of appointment for this kind of concern, we've got to do the dilation.  (GAAAH!)She says she made all sorts of notes on our record, so we can have something to point to when the appointment actually comes around in July.  I'll have to talk to whoever is in the clinic that day, though, about actually like getting them to honor any of this.LA LA LA LA, I'm not going to think about this again till summer... unless you have some strabismus-related or waiting-room-related wisdom to share...Isn't there a therapy schedule I can go coordinate somewhere, keep myself occupied?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://whittereronautism.com/2009/03/wrap-around-services-and-other-urban-myths/", "http://mamamara.blogspot.com/2009/03/edge-is-near.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/eyes-have-it.html", "title": "\nThe Eyes Have It\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "body": "\nWe live in a university town with a slew of medical education programs.Our university-connected health care is attached to a \"teaching hospital\" and generally comes with observers and learners accompanying the doctors, particularly for pediatric stuff.  Joy's neurologist generally comes through the exam-room door like a mama duck with three or four little ped-neurologists-in-training swimming in his wake!  Joy doesn't seem to have a problem with this.  She likes people, on the whole, and doesn't fuss at new faces.  And I'm happy to accommodate.  The world needs more pediatric neurologists, etc., and how else will they learn?  I suppose that in certain circumstances I'd refuse to let my kids or myself be \"practiced\" on, but that really hasn't come up yet.  With Rose's broken arm last year, the cast was wrapped by a student, under the careful oversight of the experienced emergency-room doc.  At one point I let a student start an IV on Joy.  What better subject than a kiddo who demonstrates so little fear and has a high pain tolerance?  (Though if she'd missed the stick, I'd have asked for the teacher to finish the job.  She did fine.)We've opened our house to students too.  Again with a university in town, the local Birth-to-Three was a natural fit for having therapists-in-training who were looking to Joy's therapists as mentor.  Some of them brought some really interesting ideas and approaches, and Joy never rejected a single student.Recently Lynda the Wonder-Woman daycare lady hooked us up with a friend of hers who also runs a home daycare and who was taking a class on inclusion of special-needs kids.  She needed a lot of hours of observing such a child, at daycare and home and in therapy, to meet class requirements.  We took her grocery-shopping with our family, opened our home to her, let her observe Joy at Lynda's.  The world surely needs more daycare providers who have what it takes to care for and teach children like Joy!One of our intensive autism line therapists, our House Blend baristas, has a special training role in the Agency 2 organization.  We opened Joy's sessions to one of her trainees earlier this year too, training for someone else's team.  The trainee connected nicely with Joy, came for quite a few sessions, expressed regret that she wasn't going to be working with Joy.And then at the beginning of March, we suddenly wound up with a big gap in our schedule where one of the baristas had been.  We thought of the new trainee... and she leaped at the chance to join us!  She's been doing a great job so far.  We could have limped along for weeks while Agency 2 tried to hire someone new for us and then got that person trained up from scratch.  As it was, we were up and humming with a full team again remarkably quickly.Hospitality and teaching are good things.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/teaching-hospitality.html", "title": "\nTeaching Hospital/ity\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 10, 2009", "body": "\nIt's spring, it's spring!We had a gorgeous day yesterday.  And we started it out with a trip to Target to pick up a replacement for what has become (for us anyway) an indispensible toy.  Behold today's first hit, the bubble machine:Here's a photo from the web of how it looks in the packaging:Joy got the first of these bubble machines for her birthday at the start of last summer.  This year it's called \"Amazing Bubbles Bubble Generator\"; last year's model was called \"Turbo Bubbles Bubble Generator\", and both are from a Chinese company called Placo.  Cost us about $15 at Target; they only have them during the spring months and into the summer, as far as I can tell.  You pour bubble solution into the front of the machine, and then it turns both on and off by means of a single colorful push-button on the top of the machine.Joy LOVES to turn this thing on and off, and to run around in the resulting stream of bubbles.  Yesterday she was actually tracking bubbles and working on popping them, another skill that seems to come and go.  The first of the above photos is the one that we use in Joy's PECS book; a highly motivating choice.Downsides of the toy: it eats lots of bubble solution (make sure you buy an extra gallon of the stuff) and also eats AA batteries of which it takes six.  It also comes with a handle on top, but if you try to pick it up with the handle while there's bubble solution in the toy, it will tip and dump out all the solution.  Oops.  For a cheap plastic toy, it did pretty well, lasting a whole year.  Eventually the fan fell off in the back of the machine and there's no way to open the thing up to get to it.  Still.  You'll notice we ran right out to replace it while the getting was good!On the MISS side of the equation last year was another battery powered bubble generator called Bubble Bellies: Manely the Lion, by Little Tikes.Poor Manely.  He was a cute idea: you operated him by grabbing a handle on his back and squeezing, which opened his mouth for the bubbles to come out and turned on the fan.  Should have been good grip-manipulation practice.  But he was too heavy for Joy to turn on and carry around easily, and his handle tended to stick which made him frustrating even if you worked him on a table, and he broke within weeks.  Plus he didn't give nearly as good bubbles as the Bubble Generator.  Manely = Miss.So, one more bonus hit before I go today.  This one is from Rose.I first saw these \"Multicultural\" washable markers from Crayola last fall at Target when I was school-supply shopping for Rose.  I passed them over at the time since we were spending so much money already, thinking that I could pick them up as a stocking-stuffer later.  But when I went back closer to Christmas, they were nowhere to be found, and I didn't know the right search term (multicultural) to find them online.  Suddenly we found them in our local craft-supply store this week.  Rose was delighted, and set right in to make a rainbow of people!  Wish I'd had this kind of thing back when I was a kid; the standard colors never did justice to skin tones.  Heck, I bet my mama wished they had washable markers at all back when I was a kid!There's your product roundup for the day.

{"date": "Thursday, April 2, 2009", "body": "\nWhen my brother Uncle Schnirelmann and I were kids, we had a silly little in-joke game called \"string.\"I'm not sure how it started, but it involved feigning a fixation on string.  Think zombies moaning for \"Braaains!\"  Our signature moan went along the lines of: \"String... striiiing...STRIIIIING!!\"  Then we'd greedily grab and pretend to obsessively play with whatever piece of string triggered the joke.Well, the joke's on me, my friends.Joy's hair-pulling stimmy activities didn't come out of nowhere.  The dimmer-switch has actually been sliding for quite a while.It started with dolly hair, as far as I can tell.  My Little Ponies.  American Girls.  Barbies.  Most of which, by the way, belonged to Rose.  Miss Rose has been generous with the ponies, but the others have been rather a cause of contention.Then it spread to other stringy things.  She started picking up hair and fuzzy bits from the carpet, and gravitating to toys with strings.  Here's what her OT reported on the subject on March 18:Joy was really drawn to stimming activities today. It seems like every where there was a string for her to twist in her fingers. It was me against 10,000 pieces of string!The hair-pulling seems a natural extension (though I guess you can't wear extensions if you don't have any hair there to begin with...)  Here's from Lynda's daycare report yesterday:She was putting a lot of energy into looking for strings. I took a couple toys out of the room that have strings. Ones she knows are always on the shelf. Even if I turn the toy so the string isn't visible, she knows it's there and will pull the toy out to get to the string. I tried substituting a squish ball thingy that [the OT] had brought for her a while back. She would play with it a few minutes, then go back to tracking down string. A couple good clumps of hair came out when strings weren't readily available.Joy's been wearing a little pink hoodie-sweatshirt today, to pretty good effect so far.  I so very much appreciate all the words of wisdom and encouragement on last night's post!  It all feels somewhat more manageable this morning.  My best guess is that the dimmer switch will eventually slide the other direction, as it has with many other less-than-desirable behaviors and stimmies.I still see a potential buzzcut looming in the future, though -- if not as a preventative approach, then in service of evening things up when the hair starts to grow back in!  Pixiemama, I don't \"do\" Facebook, but I bet your shaved head was adorable!  Auntie RatM has even more extensive shaved-head/buzzcut experience.  Makes her more aerodynamic and all.Hey brother mine:  \"String... striiiing...STRIIIIING!!\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SdTIUEqllEI/AAAAAAAAARY/iXkxt4QL0gU/s1600-h/string-play.jpg", "http://imapixiemama.blogspot.com/", "http://runatthemouth.livejournal.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/04/string-string-string.html", "title": "\nString...

We signed her up for a new summer-care program, so they needed umpty-something different forms filled out, from the emergency contacts to the vaccination dates to the contract to the field trip permission et cetera, und so weiter.  I think I had to put all our names, address, phone and e-mail on every single form.  Well, OK, maybe no e-mail on the form about the preferred brand of sunscreen and bug spray.  Sure felt like it though.Then there are the forms from the elementary school. Tell us about Rose so we can put her in a well-balanced class next year.  Buy petunias to support the PTA.  Scholastic Books order form.  Sponsor sheet & t-shirt order form for the all-school walk/run in May.And we signed her up for piano lessons again for next year.  And I think there are a few more forms lurking in a pile that I'm forgetting about.  If not, I'm sure some will come home in her backpack now that spring break is done.Of course we can't let Joy get away without paperwork!!  The contract for the daycare renewal at Lynda's is an easy one, I just haven't gotten to it yet.  The one I'm actively avoiding at the moment, though, is the re-registration for medical assistance.  Not that it's a particularly long form or anything.  It's just... well, kind of a mess.  It appears that they're trying to use the same ridiculous form to accommodate everyone from preschoolers with special needs to economically-disadvantaged applicants to people with work-related disabilities -- and for first-time applicants as well as renewals.  Sure, THOSE are all going to need to answer the same questions.  These government-program-forms give me the willies anyway.  As confusing as they are, I have this icky fear that I'm going to accidentally mis-interpret something, give the \"wrong\" answer, and *POOF*!!

But it's been SO long since we've heard those 80-some words that she used to speak, once upon a time.  Among all the people who are working with her now, only Lynda at daycare and one of her school-district people have known her long enough to remember hearing her use words.  Right now she has no spoken words at all, communicating via her photo cards when we ask her to, or her push-button when it's available, or the occasional \"more\" sign, but mostly just actions and glances and gestures.I asked JoyDad, and he set me straight right away.  \"No, she never did.\"  He had worked more deliberately than I to try to get an echo of \"Love you!\" back when there were more words floating about, and it just never came.But here's what she DOES do:When he goes to pick her up at daycare, she comes running up to him and gives him a great big hug, and sometimes even gives him a little pat-pat-pat on the back.She gives kisses upon request, and sometimes initiates little puckery kissie-kissie motions.And remember the Popeye Sighting?It's no wonder I got confused about how I heard, or didn't hear, the \"I love you\" a year and a half ago or more.  I've been hearing it a lot lately, listening with all my heart.  It just hasn't been verbal.  Rhemashope didn't need to hear the words spoken either, but I'm surely rejoicing with her about what happened the other night at bedtime.Someday.

{"date": "Friday, April 3, 2009", "body": "\nIn the wake of a couple of big Joy meetings recently (Agency 2 and also IEP), we've been upping the ante a little bit on her photo-communication.  Some neat stuff to share.First, we've added an \"all-done\" card into the mix. Her cards have all been photos so far, but this one is a Boardmaker image that has a line-drawing showing a person making the \"all-done\" sign.Until now, we've been able to offer choices between two photos, but haven't given her a similar means of choosing/communicating that she's finished with a toy or activity.  But now, let's say we're out on the deck with the trike.  She's played with it a while, then gotten up.  Now we can swoop in and ask the question:  \"More trike?  Or, all done?\"Then if she picks \"all done\", we abandon the trike and set up another choice between two or three different options.  The other thing that we've been trying is a single-button communication device.  The parent/barista/whomever records a word or phrase on the device.  Then Joy \"says\" that word herself by pushing the button and activating the playback.  She'd used it with some success at daycare for things like \"more\" at snacktime and \"my turn\" when the group played games (they'd pass the button around and have other kids say \"my turn\" in the same way).  New twist at home is using the photo cards to indicate what pressing the button will \"say\".So there's the button, with a velcro on it to hold a photo card.I was worried that Joy would want only to pull the photo card off the button, since that's how she communicates with photo cards using the binder.  And in fact, she did try that at first.  However, she learned within maybe two days that when a photo was on the button, you pushed instead of pulling.  Clever girl!One of our favorite button-requests is \"Let's jump!\"  Joy loves to grab an adult's hands and get them to help her jump to impossible heights.  Lately she's even been putting little cheerleader kicks and splits into her jumps!  If the button is programmed and available, though, we're nudging her to \"ask\" with the button.I saw such a button used to very cool effect last year when Rose sang with the other kindergarten and first-grade classes at school.  There were a coveted few speaking parts that had been doled out among the first-graders.  One of the first-graders who \"spoke\" a part did so by means of a push-button switch!  Powerful stuff.Rose (who had one of the speaking parts in this year's concert) has gotten involved in programming the button too.  It's lovely to hear Joy speak with her sister's voice.More to say?  Nah.  All done!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SdJ9EZgOHlI/AAAAAAAAARA/gGYKjdff46o/s1600-h/all-done.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SdJ9fTWSaaI/AAAAAAAAARI/Ejc7X85fGgo/s1600-h/switch.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/04/lets-jump-or-all-done.html", "title": "\nLet's Jump! or, All Done?\n"},

I am a little ambivalent about how the kids come home with these carefully handwritten wish-lists that they've obviously done in class, but we've generally let Rose pick a book or two off her list to purchase, and chalked it up to community support.The day of the book fair, Rose came charging home after school with a friend in tow.  The friend had invited her to turn right around and go back to school with her mom for the book fair, and Rose really wanted to go NOW instead of have me take her later after Joy's therapy.So I pulled out the lone twenty-dollar bill from my wallet, rehearsed with her which two books she wanted to buy, and got set to send her off.And then she said, \"Wait, I want to buy a board-book for Joy.\"I didn't have any more money in the wallet, but before I could mention this, Rose had galloped off to her room and pulled out the box where she keeps her allowance.  She counted out five dollars, which she was going to put in her bra-purse but I convinced her to take something that actually zipped up to keep the money safe!Here's what she brought home for her sister:Between the change from the twenty and her allowance money, she'd had exactly enough with just a couple of pennies to spare.Joy likes her new gift very much.  She's been carrying it around a lot, and this evening I had to make her hand it over so I could get her to the table for supper.  She said something that JoyDad, the barista and I all agreed sounded very much like \"book.\"=================P.S.  Just so it doesn't sound like we've got Saint Rose here or something... you should have seen the power struggle we had over clothing yesterday.  It was COLD yesterday morning, and Rose wanted to wear capris and sandals to school.  I made her wear long pants and shoes, which wrecked piano practice and the rest of the morning's preparation.  After warning her that I didn't want ANY complaints about cold on the way to school, I let her get away with wearing a light hoodie for a wrap.  Sure enough, about 5 minutes into the walk, the lower lip sticks out:I didn't knooooow it would be so cold! It's NOT MY FAULT!Natural consequences are a real booger sometimes.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2009", "body": "\nIt's handbell concert season again, which means the schedule is crazy and my fingers are aching from holding two (and sometimes three!) bells in one hand simultaneously.So perhaps it's natural that the bells should come to mind in relation to a cluster of posts last week, started by the incomparable Mama Mara, who posted a powerful reflection called Retarded Isn't Stupid, Mama Mara!  Then came Cale over at Spectrum Siblings, who posted Retarded Isn't Stupid, Cale!  And StatMama followed up with Developmental Disabilities, in which she pointed out that the word \"retarded\" quite literally means \"slow\".And what's so bad about \"slow\"?Slow is something we've actually been working very hard on with the bells.  We've got a couple of pieces that that derive their beauty from a slow tempo -- like Gershwin's \"Prelude No. 2\" which Gershwin himself described as a \"blues lullaby\" but I think is actually a mighty seductive piece, not necessarily conducive to sleep!  Another of the pieces, Brahms' Hungarian Dance #5, is chock full of tempo changes... and wouldn't you know, the big challenge is the slowing down (ritardando) in coordination!Joy does not technically have a diagnosis of mental retardation, though in an earlier version of the DSM that would likely be the box that fit her best.  (Diagnostic substitution.  Powerful stuff when it comes to arguments about autism and \"epidemic\" language...)  Right now we're calling it \"developmental delays\" or \"cognitive issues\" because we really don't know how to tease out what aspects of the delays are mediated by the autism, and what would be there if the autism weren't.  Certainly her diagnosis of linear nevus sebaceous syndrome traditionally comes with a mental retardation component -- but not always.  And we surely do have the sense that Joy isn't letting us in on everything that's going on in that mind of hers.  In the words of her school district team leader: \"Her file drawers are full! We just don't have the key to the cabinet.\"But whatever word we use to describe Joy's trajectory so far... there's definitely a component of slow.   And why are people so down on \"slow\"?I'd been plotting a post about the virtues of \"slow\" myself, and then I came across a wonderful column in this week's Mennonite Weekly Review, by Melodie Davis, called Slow is Good -- Very Good.  It's gorgeous stuff, too good not to share.  I'll intersperse her words with mine, OK?Slow is a walk.Slower still is a walk with a toddler.Slow is a porch-swing and a long tall cool drink.Slow is reading aloud.Slow is a stew simmering all day in a crock pot.Slow is incubating a baby for nine months.Slow is hours of nursing, rocking, dozing with baby.Slow is the food you started from seeds in the ground in the spring, weeded, watered, harvested, preserved, and didn't consume until the middle of winter.Slow is melting into the arms of your spouse and just letting the moment linger, not worrying about what's next.Slow is a delightful pace for what might come next as well.Slow is focusing totally on the person talking to you during coffee hour at church and not thinking about the three other people you have to catch before they scurry away.Slow is focusing totally on your child, giving yourself over to whatever activity they're playing, for as long as they care to keep it up.Slow is meticulously hand-stitching every inch of heirloom wedding quilts for your grandchildren.Slow is the sewing basket, and a pile of mending, and a classical CD on the stereo.Scripture encourages us to be slow to speak and slow to become angry (James 1:19). God is slow to anger (Neh. 9:17). Prov. 14:27 advises that \u201ca patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man displays folly.\u201d Moses complained that he was too \u201cslow of speech\u201d to undertake the task of speaking to Pharaoh and being a leader for the Hebrew people (Ex. 4:10).

{"date": "Thursday, April 23, 2009", "body": "\nWhen Joy had just turned three, we paid a six-month follow-up visit to the pediatric developmentalist / autism-expert who had diagnosed her.  We were struggling with some behavior and safety issues at the time.  Joy was getting taller, able to reach things on counters and climb onto tables, and she liked the commotion of the results when she managed to shatter a glass or plate.The expert advised us crisply that we had to strip down our environment.  Plastic plates and glasses for EVERYBODY, she said.  Pack anything breakable into storage.  Consider folding chairs that you can fold up after meals so there won't BE any way to climb on the table.  Creating a safe household for Joy comes first.We were stunned.We were also... non-compliant.  (Heh.  We're also not seeing this expert any more.)Oh, we made a few changes.  But they were changes that suited our family.  Instead of folding chairs, we just made sure to do a better job of pushing chairs in to the table to make them less appealing for climbing.  Instead of ditching our glassware and ceramics altogether, we did a better job of gating the kitchen and putting the breakables away.I realized at the time that the developmentalist was recommending a chainsaw for a job that kitchen shears could do just as well.  What I didn't put together till later was that her recommended changes flew in the face of a very important principle.Least Restrictive Environment.Readers who have, or work with, special needs kids in the public education system are nodding their heads in recognition just about now.The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) includes two fundamental requirements: a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE).  It also ensures that each child will be served a bowl of acronym soup daily... OK, not really.  What the LRE amounts to in the school setting is that you don't shut away or segregate off our kids unless there's a REALLY compelling reason to do so.  The presumption is that children with special needs are to be educated among their \"typical\" peers to the full extent possible.Who among us wants to be placed under unnecessary restrictions?  Either at school or at home?The trick is figuring out which boundaries and modifications are necessary and helpful for any given kiddo.  The modifications around our house, that we've put in place to have a safe and nurturing environment for Joy, have ebbed and flowed over time.  Some things are constant -- in general, we try to help her focus by cutting down the clutter.  There's one toy-box in the living room, one in the bedroom closet, and a set of toy-shelves in the downstairs playroom.  We try to keep everything easily put-away-able.  (Sometimes more successfully than others.)We also try to keep down the temptation for things that could be pulled down to make a big crash & mess.  The Christmas tree was up on the stereo cabinet.  There are no plants in grabbing range, though she's growing to the point that she could knock one over if she tried...Winter 2008 was an intense time for boundaries.  Joy was climbing over the back of the couch to jump on the low bookcase that sits back-to-back with the couch, and knocked over the lamp that sat on top of said bookcase.  So we bought a hanging lamp with a chain & cord that trails up the wall, and we covered a big piece of cardboard with wrapping paper and set it up as a barrier between the couch-back and bookcase.  Joy was dashing into back bedrooms & bathroom at the slightest opportunity, so we kept ALL the doors closed ALL the time.  She started pulling the music rack on the piano and dumping Rose's piano books off, so we tied the rack to the back of the piano with a piece of yarn.In summer 2008 we put in the big barrier, just before I started blogging in fact!  We got a fence for our big back yard.  One might think that a fence was a massive restriction.  In a way, I suppose it is.  But when we went into the backyard with Joy before the fence, we used to have to be on high alert.  She had this little game where she would suddenly dash off, without warning, and head for freedom and the street.  And she is FAST.  So to keep her safe, we had to be within hovering distance, at all times, ready to sprint at any moment.With the fence, we don't have to hover.  In fact, we can give her a whole lot more freedom within that boundary than she used to be able to have.  A perceptive friend at our fence party that summer noticed it right away.  \"She's so FREE!\" was the comment.It's my belief that as Joy came to recognize and heed the fence boundary, she started observing other boundaries as well.  We were able to take down the cardboard from behind the couch.  The doors in the back hallway stay open now, and Joy just doesn't venture back there.  Rose accidentally broke the yarn on the music rack recently, and we didn't bother re-installing it.The right restrictions, at the right time.  A balance that we're continually trying to keep.Another issue that we see coming up is the question of Joy's sleeping arrangements.  She's currently in a tented-crib for the night, and a PeaPod travel tent for nap.  These are designed such that she will not be able to get out, and since she's not toilet-trained, she doesn't really need to get out.  It's also very helpful to us to have her confined to the crib when she wakes in the middle of the night and plays for several hours straight.But she has technically well outgrown the specs of the crib.  She's strong and getting bigger.  We'll have to figure something else out, that can teach her to sleep in a big-girl bed and keep her safe and not impinge on her sister, with whom she currently shares a room.  I don't think we're going to need something like these specialty beds (designed for a least-restrictive environment, by the way -- to \"help the person live as normal a life as possible, with as few barriers as possible and still be safe\"!) It's good to know the range of what's out there, though, as we make decisions on next steps.  \"Been-there, done-that\" stories would be most welcome.This post was sparked by Barbara at TherExtras, who is currently hosting a blog-carnival on the question of \"how you have arranged your home to enhance your child\u2019s development.\"  I'm looking forward to hear how others have interpreted the theme!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SfBLhvbOJFI/AAAAAAAAAS4/v3172MKuh9c/s1600-h/fence2.jpg", "http://www.bedsbygeorge.com/Inclusion.htm", "http://www.therextras.com/", "http://www.therextras.com/therextras/2009/04/homing-development.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/04/home-selectively-restrictive-home.html", "title": "\nHome, Selectively-Restrictive Home\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 4, 2009", "body": "\nI had a fine evening at the park with Joy and Rose the other day.  It had been a couple of weeks since the elements converged such that we could all go -- weather and absence of prior commitments on all sides.  It was a different experience than the last trip!Difference #1 - Rose rode her bike.  Like, on the way there!  When we went to the park to learn to ride, we loaded up the bike into the car and drove to the park.  Now she can ride almost the whole way, and only has to walk her bike on one especially steep hill.Difference #2 - Joy didn't dash.  Last time we went, she wandered afield, and I had a big long run at one point, ending with a dramatic swoop whereby I caught her by the coat just as she was about to jump into the water in the ditch!  This time, she spent the entire time in the gravel area.Difference #3 - The gravel area didn't enter Joy's mouth.  Last time, particularly near the end of our stay, I felt like I was digging gravel out of her mouth every time I turned around.  This time?  Not at all.  She did spend lots of time gravel-stimming, which felt very familiar.  One new thing was shuffling her feet through the gravel on her way to the swings or play structure.  I'm reminded of how last year she started the spring season being extremely stimmy at the park, not wanting to do anything else.  Then over the course of the park season, she got gradually more interested in things other than the stimmies.  Wondering if we're already seeing that pattern repeat.Difference #4 - Joy wanted to play on both the big kid swings and the toddler swing.  Last time she only wanted the toddler swing, though I tried to interest her in the big-kid swing, the kind with the flexible seat between two chains.  She was having none of it, deliberately sliding off even before I could get her swinging.  This time she gravitated toward the big-kid swing herself, got into position to hike herself up to sit on it, and then looked at me for help and signed \"more\" when she didn't quite make it!  She went back to the swings several times, sometimes requesting \"more\" for my help, sometimes draping herself over the swing on her tummy and propelling herself.  She even at one point tried to do the tummy-drape thing on the toddler swing, which didn't work quite so well.  I liked seeing the experimenting, though.  And the signing -- how glorious to see the signing.Well, Rose would probably tell me (since they worked hard on defining patterns in kindergarten) that you can't call it a pattern until/unless it starts repeating.  We shall see.  Whatever else it was, though, it was a lovely evening at the park.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/05/patterns-at-park.html", "title": "\nPatterns at the Park\n"},

{"date": "Monday, May 18, 2009", "body": "\nSorry I've been a little scarce for a few days.  Had two presentations in rapid succession, first a short reflection for Sunday night's worship service, and then a public-comment presentation for the Wisconsin Autism Council (related to my Updates & Downdates post back in March.)Both went well.  In fact, the Autism Council meeting was the site of the first unexpected hug today.The Autism Council is an advisory body, appointed by the governor, meant to provide guidance to the Department of Health Services on statewide supports and services for children with autism, particularly the Medicaid waiver program through which the state is providing intensive services for Joy.  They meet quarterly, and the first half-hour of each meeting is reserved for public comment from anybody who wants to show up and speak up.There was one other mama who had signed up to speak before me, who had a concern about children being bumped out of the program for supposedly making too much progress, even when the needs were still substantial.  We chatted a little before the meeting and established some common ground, but I was still startled in a good way when she had finished her comment and I was going up to give mine, and she caught me in a warm hug and wished me well.Whether it was the hug that did it or not, I felt that my remarks about providing intensive autism services in natural settings other than the home were well-received by the Council.  There was a department administrator (not a Council member) who responded at length, downplaying my concerns to some extent, but I spoke back up again and I think at least made myself heard.  I got to have some additional conversation with one of the Council members out in the hall so as not to disturb the meeting.  Made me feel like a player, at least!  We'll see what's next.  Then toward the end of the day, I got another hug.  This one was when we went to pick up our new Honda Fit that I mentioned randomly a couple of weeks ago.  Such a cute, bright-red creature it is!  We worked with the same saleslady who sold us a CR-V eight years ago, an enthusiastic and down-to-earth person who loves her job and does it well.  A new car purchase is a celebrative occasion at this dealership, complete with a big red bow on the top of the car and an official photograph of the happy owners with their new purchase.  Unfortunately I had to scoot back home with Rose before we'd had the full grand-tour of the new purchase, to relieve our neighbor who was sitting in on a Joy therapy session, but as I was making our goodbyes I got a great big saleslady hug.  Thanks and cheers all around!OK, that's two hugs.The third hug-event of the day was one that happened while we were out signing the car-papers.  When Rose and I arrived home, Joy's barista was eager to share a moment from the therapy session.  She and Joy were exchanging hugs and Joy twice said the word \"hug,\" both times with exaggerated \"h\" and \"g\" sounds.  \"I'm pretty skeptical about these things,\" said the barista, \"but if I weren't so skeptical, that sure did sound deliberate!\"Reminds me of the Popeye Sighting from last October.  That hug-word is IN there.  It surely is.What a fine day for a hug, or two or three!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/05/three-unexpected-hugs.html", "title": "\nThree Unexpected Hugs\n"},

{"date": "Friday, May 29, 2009", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis SightingsInsurance coverage for autism in the state of Wisconsin moved a big step closer to becoming a reality last night.I've been keeping up a running update on the progress of the initiative at my February 19 post, which was when JoyDad did his public hearing testimony.Recap in a nutshell - this is now the second biennium in which autism insurance in Wisconsin has made it to the stage of serious legislative consideration.  In 2007 it was stymied in the Wisconsin Assembly, which then had a Republican majority, at the eleventh hour.This year, after the 2008 elections which left both the Wisconsin Senate AND Assembly with Democratic majorities (plus a Democrat for a governor as well), the measure was introduced early in the session, as AB15 in the Assembly and SB3 in the Senate.Both measures were referred to committee, and public hearings were held.  The Senate committee recommended the measure back to the Senate unanimously.  The Assembly committee should have had the votes to pass it as well, but were held up by one Rep. Bob Ziegelbauer (D), who had some concerns with the language of the bill.Then the measure was taken out of those committees' purview altogether, and went to the Joint Finance Committee, where the ugly details of the state budget are being hashed out as I type (Wisconsin, like every other state, is being socked by the economic downspiral).  The JFC is moving quickly to make the sausage, packing multiple motions into large omnibus packages.One such package, labeled as Motion 700, passed last night just before 10:30pm.  The autism bill is included, on pages 20-22.This will now be part of the budget bill that goes back to both houses, rather than continuing as the separate measure that was AB15/SB3.  With the support of the governor and the majority leadership in both houses the way they stand, it would be very difficult to kill the autism insurance provision now, given the support it enjoys from the leadership in both houses and from Governor Doyle.  From reading the live-blogging at the WisPolitics budget blog, it looks like the (failed) minority-party challenges to the motion were all about other things, leaving the autism provision alone.The optimistic plan is to have a final budget passed by sometime in July mid-June, such that it can be signed by the governor and in force by July 1.  Then again, this has been the hope every time around, but the success rate at keeping to the July 1 deadline has been abysmal.  I will continue the picky updates, which I imagine are less-than-fascinating to many of my readers, simply because my Google search records indicate that people are coming to Elvis Sightings to find information on autism insurance in Wisconsin, and I think it's important to be able to trace the progress SOMEWHERE in exhaustive detail.Big thumbs up this morning.  I think it's gonna happen.Links to prior related posts:3/15/2009: WI Assembly Hearing on 2009 Autism Insurance Bill AB152/7/2009: More About Wisconsin Autism Insurance Legislation1/11/2009: 2009 WI Senate Bill 3\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/AB15hst.html", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/SB3hst.html", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/assembly/asm25/news/", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lfb/jfc/MO%20700.pdf", "http://blogs.wispolitics.com/budget/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/05/wi-autism-insurance-excellent-news.html", "title": "\nWI Autism Insurance - Excellent News!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2009", "body": "\nRose and I went to a neat event at her elementary school last night, a Fun Walk/Run for the kids that was also a PTA fundraiser.  There were T-shirts, and race numbers, and goofy warm-ups with one of the first-grade teachers, and picnicking on the lawn, and desserts to share, and the district superintendant & others were handing out little stretchy-bracelets to the kids for every lap completed.  The weather was perfect, the turnout was huge.And, I got to spend time talking with other parents I hadn't seen in a while!  Two families in particular were once part of our regular routine but not so much lately -- one family for regular playdates, another we used to encounter last summer at Joy's swimming class.  Both those evening time-slots have now been filled with intensive autism therapy for Joy.  In fact, Joy was therapy-ing at home instead of Fun-Running and picnicking with me & Rose.It's a trade-off.  Intensive therapy fills a lot of time that we used to have available for other things.On the other hand, if I'd had Joy at the Fun Run, I wouldn't have been available to catch up with the other parents, because I'd have been Joy-minding...I also put together in my mind something that I'd not been tracking with, for both these families.  They both have older kids in Rose's grade, and both also have younger daughters a little younger than Joy.Both those younger daughters will be starting kindergarten at the same time as Joy, since we're holding off on kindergarten for another year!I think I need to make better efforts to keep Joy well-acquainted with these two classmates-to-be.  And also to make sure we bring Joy to next year's Fun Run.  Wonder how many laps she'll be willing to do, if I go with her?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/05/trade-off.html", "title": "\nTrade-Off\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2009", "body": "\nJoyDad takes the wheel for a spin through a special Memorial Day Weekend edition of Random Tuesday Thoughts...We are blessed that Joy is a good traveler. I know some kids on the spectrum take exception to having their routines mangled by vacations and such, but Joy just seems to take it as it comes. She doesn't seem to mind the long car rides, strange places and stranger people (but hey, they are the only family I have...)A favorite activity for Joy this weekend was bubbles. Joy even tried popping them with her nose, which was too cute for words. And it is great to see her able to track individual bubbles with her eyes, and have repeated success in popping the bubble she is following.Another favorite activity for Joy was getting any available adult (and sometimes Rose) to help her to jump. And there were seven adults for her to choose from, so the opportunities were plentiful... She doesn't have a word for \"jump,\" but she lets you know in no uncertain terms by coming up in front of you and grabbing both of your hands. She makes wonderful eye contact as she sails through the air, with a great big grin and squeals of delight.When she wasn't chasing bubbles or requesting the jump game, Joy also liked to play what we call the clap game. She'll put her hands on yours and make them clap. She does that a time or two, and then makes them miss with the other person saying a great, big \"UH OH!\"Rose loves going to the cabin. She didn't seemed fazed by the bugs, and spent a lot of time outside on the past-its-prime swingset and down by the pier. She is looking forward to telling her friends about it at school tomorrow. We printed out some pictures of key events (the restaurant meal in town the morning we arrived, the bald eagles nesting in a tree, the ride on her uncles' boat).The fish weren't biting but the bugs were. We took to describing the swarms of bugs as \"biblical\" in their epicness. And they must not have gotten the memo about how deet was supposed to repel them.Changing a tire on a large vehicle on soft sand is sub-optimal. The jack doesn't do a good job of staying put. But if you are going to drop said large vehicle onto its brake rotor, soft sand does less damage than pavement would. Don't ask us how we know...Have you ever tried changing a tire with about a gajillion gnats trying to suck every last drop of fluid from your body? Or chopping up a tree that has fallen on your garage while choking on a lungful of gnats? Let me tell you, you haven't lived until you've tried that. Bet you're jealous.Now that I think about it, I'd take using the outhouse when it's 20 below zero over the gnats any day, thankyouverymuch. Oh yes, I have used the outhouse at the cabin in the middle of the winter, with the outside temperature hovering around 20 below. Good times....Even with the bugs and lack of indoor plumbing, I'd still rather be there than here.JoyMama even managed to squeeze in a run on Sunday. She was smart and went early in the morning while there was still frost keeping the gnats at bay. Uncle Marathon and UncleDO wimped out. Although Uncle Marathon does get props for going swimming in the very cold lake.Hot and cold running water are not essential for humans to live. And it's nice to be reminded of what a luxury they are (especially the hot running water) by going without for a few days. I have partaken of the soap and hot running water since our return to civilization, so y'all can take the clothespins off your noses.Our cabin and lake in da U.P. are about the only things that have remained constant in my life. The lake still looks the same as it did when I was a wee lad, the cabin looks and smells just like it did way back then. I'm glad that JoyMama and the girls like to go up there, it holds a lot of memories for me, and hopefully there's a lot more left to be made...\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://theunmom.com/", "http://theunmom.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GyIBWwYa9A0/ShyTEs7mFqI/AAAAAAAAABA/tV73nIwYkkM/s1600-h/IMG_8413b.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/05/random-tuesday-thoughts_26.html", "title": "\nRandom Tuesday Thoughts\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2009", "body": "\nSo anyone who follows my blog knows that scheduling is a big part of my plate-spinning.  Joy's got 24 hours of House Blend intensive autism therapy a week, plus three therapists from the school district who each see her twice a week; I've got work, bells, church, volunteer; Rose has school, piano, etc.Usually it all clicks together somehow.And then we schedule a JoyDad foot surgery into the mix.The originally-scheduled surgery time was for noon yesterday (Tuesday), and we were to get out at 3pm if all went well.  Tuesday's not a paid-work day for me, so we had to find Joy-care.  Fortunately Lynda stepped up to the plate, offered to take Joy for an extra day.  Whew, problem solved -- so all I had to do was figure out which therapists to cancel (because the House Blend therapists can't go to Lynda's anymore).  Then on Monday JoyDad got a call from the scheduler.  \"Sir, your surgery has been re-scheduled to 3pm on Tuesday.  We'd now like you to arrive at 1:30 instead of 10am.  No, you still can't eat anything after midnight, sorry sir.\"Total fruit-basket upset.First off, Joy couldn't stay with Lynda anymore, because things were likely to go past the end of the workday and we couldn't impose that on Lynda.  Even if she'd've been willing to be imposed on, she had Tuesday evening commitments anyway.  So now we had to find childcare willing to come to our home, and stay open-ended into the evening.  Oh, and we'd likely miss Rose's piano class party & recital at 6:30.This sent me into a pretty wild emotional tail-spin, I'm afraid.  While it was only a couple of hours in between the time I blasted an e-mail to the church listserv and the time I got an affirmative answer, I spent that time mentally running around in a little hamster wheel, not having a very soothing prayer experience either.I should have trusted, though.  That first blessed \"yes, I can take at least the first part of the afternoon\" was enough to set the rest in motion.  When I got home from work (where I'd had no phone numbers to be in touch with the people I needed), I was able to call all the therapists I'd cancelled, and all three of them were still able to make their sessions.  Plus call the friend who was to bring Rose home from school, who then proved willing to be the sitter for the second shift.  Plus figure out who was going to help pick up Joy from daycare while JoyDad was on crutches...On Tuesday everyone showed up as planned.  Joy was having a really good day, despite waking up at 3am.  JoyDad, alas, also woke at 3am and had lots of time to overthink things plus get a mighty hunger on by the time he'd missed breakfast and lunch both.  The sitter had arrived just before 1pm and we were getting set to go out the door when the phone rang.\"Can you come in for the surgery RIGHT NOW?  We're running ahead of schedule and are ready for you as soon as you can possibly make it.\"Zoom, out the door we went.  The surgery-clinic experience was an efficient whirlwind.  JoyDad was under sedation and a knee-down nerve-block (NOT general anesthesia, so better than we'd hoped) and under the knife within an hour after we'd left the house!  The surgery went smoothly, so did recovery from the sedation.  Another thing that went better than we'd been told -- originally they said no weight-bearing till the follow-up appointment.  But instead, they put a velcro-ed foot-boot over his dressing and ankle-wrap, and told him he could use the foot for balance with his crutches as long as there's not too much pain.We were home by 4:30.The sitter said that Joy had done well, but napped hard and woke cranky, looking for \"ma-ma-ma.\"  (Yes, in those very words she was looking for me.  Whoa.  Now we just need her to say it TO me again!)I got to take Rose to her party & recital after all.  She did great.JoyDad's still learning to use the crutches, and what it means to have both hands full of crutches to move around.  (Can't carry an open cup of coffee, for example.)  He'll be home today, on pain meds.  I've got to run now and make my own lunch, plus a sandwich for him, usually a part of the routine that he does.  I'll have a lot of extra responsibilities here, which will remind me how much we share the housework load!But it does seem as if things went well.  We'll know more about how successful the surgery was as time goes on.Schedule.

{"date": "Sunday, March 22, 2009", "body": "\nLiving through winter in Wisconsin is kinda like deliberately banging your head against the wall because it feels so good when it stops.  [Update: Check out this cartoon from the Sunday paper: I'm not the only one who feels this way!]It's spring.  And it feels GOOD.I had a cranky whiny post all lined up to run this morning, but I can't do it.  I'll post it Monday, which is supposed to be a rainy day anyway...Today, I've got to write about Rose.Unlike Joy, who is utterly fearless when it comes to flinging her body around, Rose has all too good an imagination about where excessive body-flinging might lead.  This was exacerbated last spring when she fell and broke her arm on her very first trip to the roller rink.She's been mighty cautious about bicycles.We bought her a little bike with training wheels at a garage sale two springs ago.  She was very hesitant at first.  It took a lot of coaxing and support and a whole bunch of tumbles, but by fall 2007 she was riding quite well.  I was hoping that 2008 would be the year to take the training wheels off.No dice.I actually did try taking the training wheels off at one point last year.  Rose rode that way once, with me holding her up the whole time, and was terrified.  Refused to touch the bike again until I put those wheels back on.  Over the course of last year, as she grew and grew, she was outgrowing the bike to the point that even with the training wheels off, it wouldn't have been a good bet for learning to balance on her own.Well, I posted at the end of October about just-in-time blessings, how a new right-size bike that wouldn't even take training wheels providentially came our way.  That was the same post where I first announced, I think, that I was going to be doing the Couch-to-5K thing.Of course we couldn't make any progress over the winter with the bike, but I managed to get to the point where a 5K run is now my regular workout.  Yesterday was a gorgeous day, and my 5K in the morning was down to a 10:33/mile pace (with hills, and some wind!)  After a day with lots of outside time, much lovely yardwork and such, Rose requested a bike-riding lesson for the evening.There's a park near us that has an oval sidewalk of asphalt that runs around the lawn and playground area, nice and flat and perfect for toppling into the grass on either side when necessary.  A red-helmeted Rose got onto the new big-girl bike with fear and trembling, insisting that mama hold her both by handlebars and waist.  Around and around we went, lots of of stop-and-topples but no injuries.  She got more confident, I let go the handlebar, was starting to have to trot to keep hold of her waist.And then I let go for just a few seconds.  And she balanced.  And squealed with delight!That was the turning point.  Pretty soon I was just having to get her started, then letting go and jogging alongside (which I never could have done last fall before all that training...)  Then she was making it all the way around the loop without stopping.  Then she got up to a speed I couldn't match for very long.By the end of the session she had succeeded in going THREE times around the loop in succession, without me at her side, only needing a bit of support at the start to get going.[Update: We went out Sunday morning for another session.  Rose went around the loop 26 times without stopping, and succeeded in starting herself without help a couple of times as well.  I think she's ready to practice on our street next.  Photo below!]Kristina at Autism.change.org recently mentioned the concept of kairos, the \"just moment,\" the \"right time\" when things come together in due measure.  (The \"just-in-time blessing\" moment, perhaps?)I think we've been there twice now this week, between trike and bike.  And yes, Joy did do a little smidge of pedaling herself again yesterday.Did I mention that I love springtime?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://comics.com/frazz/2009-03-22/", "http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/Scdp5wF2PqI/AAAAAAAAAQw/6vhRWHe_9SE/s1600-h/Rose-Rides-Bike.jpg", "http://autism.change.org/", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_good_life"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/03/rose-rides-bike.html", "title": "\nRose Rides a Bike\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 11, 2009", "body": "\nHere's a product that's got both the miss and the hit thing going on!  Last year, it was a miss.  This year, it's a hit.  I present to you:The Bouncy Castle.We were very excited to find this thing last year.  It was Joy's big 4th-birthday present from us and the grandparents, plus party entertainment all rolled up into one.  Joy is a natural jumper, loving trampolines and carnival bouncy houses and all such.  Even better, it only cost $200 shipped!  (Prices have gone up.  I can't find ours online anymore, but here's a link to a very similar one.)The castle is pretty easy to set up and take down.  It stakes into the yard with 4 tent-pegs, and the tube in the back attaches to a fan (not pictured) that stakes down with two smaller pegs.  Run an extension cord to an outdoor outlet, turn on the fan, and the thing inflates before your eyes.  You can put in up to three kids, total 180 lbs.  Totally awesome.Except... Joy didn't want to go in.  All the other kids at her party last year were clamoring for their turn, but she was unimpressed.  Not with friends, not alone, she just did not approve.  If we actually lifted her in, she'd lie down.  Or scramble out.Fortunately Rose and her friends got some good use out of it before the snow flew, although we found that the afternoon sun limited the play time -- in direct sun, it got very hot very fast.Jump forward to this spring, and I decided to pull the castle out again for another round at one of Joy's therapy play dates.This time?  She hopped right in and started bouncing.Woo hoo!We had a wonderful fun playdate with the bouncy castle this Tuesday.  Not only was her usual buddy there, and his mom, but we had a double dose of therapists, and then another friend and HER mom came by to drop off a belated birthday present.  And stayed to bounce.  Rose, meanwhile, was holding court indoors with three friends there.  I love it when a playdate snowballs!Neat happening as the playdate was winding down.  The one girl and her mom were leaving, and the mom told Joy goodbye with a big wave.  And Joy grinned at her and WAVED BACK!  She barely even knows this mom, but gave her a lovely farewell.  The therapists and the other mom erupted in a chorus of \"OH my gosh -- she WAVED -- JoyMama, did you SEE that -- she actually WAVED!\"  The recipient of the wave was a little bit stunned at what she'd taken for granted!The next day Joy waved again, this time at Lynda's, to someone else she didn't know all that well.  Fascinating.I'm getting rather far afield from the product review, but that's how things have been going lately.  Sorry to be a little scarce around here.  Since the schedule kerfluffle around JoyDad's surgery, I've been strung pretty tight, with more plate spinning than usual combined with a lower tolerance for any of the plates getting wobbly.  Feeling overly anxious over things that ordinarily wouldn't throw me.  Bleah.  Hoping that things will settle down as JoyDad continues to recover and we get the summer underway.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SjEosUaoiNI/AAAAAAAAAUY/sb2EtTD8dpc/s1600-h/bouncy-castle.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Castle-Inflatable-Bounce-House-Slide/dp/B000W3JIX0/ref=pd_sim_sg_3"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/06/product-hits-misses-bouncy-edition.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses: Bouncy Edition\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 7, 2009", "body": "\nCelebrating Joy's birthday is always a bit of a scheduling juggle.  Often her birthday falls during our annual Memorial Day trip to the lake.  This year, the following weekend already had a bar mitzvah celebration in it.  So we ended up having her party yesterday.Yes, even with JoyDad on crutches.The past two years, we've been blessed with glorious weather for our Joy-birthday parties.  One year we had the guests help pick our strawberry patch.  Last year we spent almost the whole party playing in the yard, with Uncle Schnirelmann and Auntie K helping out with Joy.  This year, we were going to have a backyard barbecue.  Including the four of us, we were planning on about 20 people.We got the people, a lovely turnout!  Only, we didn't exactly get the weather.  It spattered rain on and off all day, and the temperature never even hit sixty.  So we went with a sandwich platter setup instead, and planned to shoe-horn everybody into our modest little house.  Which meant I kinda had to clean.  And call ALL our chairs into service, and figure out how to get the food served and everyone seated, etc. etc.JoyDad did quite a bit of food preparation, for having to stay off his feet.  I had to shuttle ingredients and supplies around, but he produced an excellent macaroni salad and put together the sandwich and veggie trays.I know I've said this before, but we have such wonderful community going on here.  We invited families, and it was a delight to have both moms and dads show up with their kids.  Rose picked off the older kids and led them away to play independently, while the parents helped the younger kids play with Joy in the basement.  We did several turn-taking games, where we had every child tap the push-button communication device, which was programmed to speak the words \"my turn!\" before taking their turn with the crash pillow or the ball or whatever.  Joy had been playing crash-pillow with her therapy-barista just before the party, where she would crash and then lead him by the hand and \"make\" him crash too.  So she was \"making\" me take my turn crashing at the party as well!Then we went upstairs for presents.  Joy was definitely more engaged with present-unwrapping than she was at last year's party.  With some support, she was able to pull paper and presents out of gift bags, and enjoy textures of presents and ribbons.  Some of the presents will figure into their own post later.  But here's the ribbon...Then dinner, with lots of scrambling by parents around the \"buffet table\" (actually laid out across our countertop & range!) to feed the children who were already seated around the dining table.  Joy ate a good meal without much assistance.  Then we brought out the Jello cake and vanilla ice cream.  I decided not to do the candle-blowing-ceremony, just in case Joy should take it into her head to grab big handfuls out of the middle of the cake.  We just sang while presenting Joy with the first serving from the cake.  But then I looked at her face at the end of the song, and was surprised to find her with pursed lips.  As if to blow out a candle... We seriously do not give her enough credit sometimes.After the meal the party continued on our deck, which was just dry enough for bubble-blowing and hula hooping.  Joy navigated the chaos remarkably well:What a delight to see her enjoying the toys, among her peers.  She even submitted to birthday hugs from her friends at the end of the evening.And while I was out on the deck, and JoyDad was holding court in the living room with his foot propped up, our friends put all the food away and did all the dishes.Many, many birthday blessings!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SiwWgoQTfoI/AAAAAAAAAUA/RM14Ox2Ygtc/s1600-h/party-ribbon.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SiwX1uz6_EI/AAAAAAAAAUI/daSYm0SGA1g/s1600-h/party-hoop.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SiwYtXBE9xI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/3WRlzRzn9lo/s1600-h/party-hoop2.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/06/birthday-blessings.html", "title": "\nBirthday Blessings\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 16, 2009", "body": "\nIn just a couple of days, JoyDad and I are off on what I think will be our first kid-free weekend getaway since Joy's birth.We're going to my twenty-year college reunion!  After JoyDad's surgery follow-up appointment yesterday, he was cleared to lose the crutches and the wrap and dressing.  So he is once again free to shower (whew!) and to wear street shoes and to walk around as much as is comfortable.GrandpaJ and GrandmaJoy, courageous souls that they are, will be staying for a long weekend, hanging out with Rose and Joy and supervising the various Joy-therapies that will happen during that time.While it can be fun to occasionally revisit old stomping-grounds and old memories, the big draw of a reunion is the people.  I'm looking forward to catching up with two of my former roommates!So I got a pre-reunion e-mail a couple of days ago, a light-hearted survey of reunion attendees.  The last question was the most interesting one, and went something like this:How different is your life than you'd have imagined it when you were at [college-name]? (Give your answer in degrees; zero is just as you'd expected, 180 might be \"planned to be a high-powered investment banker, ended up a rural pastor\")I'm quoting it badly, but that was the sense of it.Now, one of my least-favorite interview questions is the one that asks you to talk about where you'd like your career to be in five years or ten or whatever.  I've never really liked to think or even dream that far ahead.However, I think that if you'd pressured me to talk about 20-years-down-the-line back in 1989, a lot of what I might have said... has come to pass.The librarian thing wasn't hard to predict.  I was working in the library on campus, and the one career-matching test thing I did at the campus career center had librarianship pop right to the top.  Though I might have envisioned a more ambitious career than what I've had so far.Settling in the Midwest?  Uh-huh.  Right where I feel at home!I kind of figured on meeting an awesome guy and getting married someday, though answering a singles ad and winding up with a guitar-slinging tax economist from the big city wasn't exactly how I'd have pictured it...Centrality of Christian faith in my life, being actively involved with church... check.Two kids?  Yep.  I was one of two, and it seemed like a good number.But the biggest surprise, the most startling unexpected life-changing challenge and blessing?  My delightful daughter Joy.  Someone I never could have predicted.  It's hard to put a number on the degree-of-difference she has brought to our lives.  In some ways, it's just another flavor of parenting.  In another way, it changes so very much.One very specific thing that it's changed for this weekend is that we're not really able to bring the girls along to reunion.  I'm sure Rose would love the kids-camp daycare setup, but it's simply not set up to work for someone like Joy.  On the other hand, if we took the kids along, it wouldn't be a getaway!  And I expect that both they and the grandparents will enjoy the weekend immensely.I don't think I'll attend the session at reunion that involves discussing the next twenty years.  That's too far ahead to think right now.  Besides, I never did like that interview question.-----P.S.  If you'd told me in 1989 that I'd be running a 5K race at my 20th reunion, I might have laughed at you!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/06/twenty-years.html", "title": "\nTwenty Years\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 24, 2009", "body": "\nI did a lot of yawning over our getaway weekend.Lots of smiling, too!Goodness knows, there was nothing boring about my first weekend getaway with JoyDad since the kids were born.  (Yes, that would be seven years, for those keeping score.)Even the drive to my college reunion was lovely, with a big long chunk of roadway between wooded bluffs on one side and the Mississippi River on the other.  And time alone to talk with my sweetie!  Luxury!  And then a whirlwind of activity, catching up with friends and roommates of 20 years gone by, attending lectures and receptions, dining, running...Not boring.  And not over-doing it -- we had to take things a little bit easy, since there was only so much that JoyDad's rapidly-healing foot could take.  So no late-night dancing or bonfire or concerts.  But lots of yawning.I think it may have been an accumulation of tired, catching up with me just a little bit.  Though nobody seems to have the full answer to the functionality of a yawn, one theory is that it's an attempt to acquire an extra burst of oxygen.  I needed to breathe deeply!And then there was the smiling.  How I could I help that, with as much time as I got to spend with JoyDad, and with my roommates (one in particular)?  Lots of smiles passed around at the reception at the library too, where I worked as a student and where I now have colleagues with whom I occasionally cross paths at conferences.I was surely breathing deeply and I think I was smiling as I crossed the finish line of the 5K that was an early Saturday morning feature of the reunion.  I came in dead last of the 27 runners who started at the whistle together.  Apparently only the hard-core runners come out to run in the bright sunlight at 7:30 on a warm reunion morning!  I ran within seconds of my top pace, though, quite a triumph since I haven't been training specifically too well lately.  And the rest of the pack hung around to cheer for the stragglers, so as I crossed the finish line alone, I had a whole cheering section to myself!  Thoroughly smile-worthy!And then there was the PowerPoint presentation by an alum from the class of '84, a fellow who'd been something of a wild-child during his years on campus but eventually gave up his drum set and took off for Thailand to become a Buddhist monk.  He now leads a monastery in New Zealand.  He simply radiated peace, groundedness, and gentle good humor.  With an incredibly high-wattage smile.So many reasons for good cheer this weekend, uninterrupted by the need for child-centered vigilance!Then after we got home on Sunday I dragged the family off to church in the evening because the guest pastor was someone that I knew from way back when.  May as well keep the reunioning going on, right?One of the points he shared during the sermon was a recommendation, something that his wife taught him and practices faithfully herself.When you get up and get yourself ready for the day, smile at yourself in the mirror.  You are part of the work God is doing in the world.  Smile at yourself.  Acknowledge it.I'm going to try to remember.  The regular ruteen is back at full-blast, after the capable and much-appreciated interlude of the grandparental help last weekend.  It's not easy to jump back in... more about that in the next post...Meanwhile, the yawns are still pretty frequent, though the context is different.  Will work on the smiling, too.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/06/of-yawns-and-smiles.html", "title": "\nOf Yawns and Smiles\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, July 22, 2009", "body": "\nSqueeze that nickel till the buffalo hollers, dear readers!  (OK, I guess that would have been the LAST depression when buffalo nickels were around.  And they weren't even buffalo, they were bison.  But still.) Yes, today I've got several money-saving goodies to review.  First up is a little trick I've been using for homemade diaper wipes.  A friend of mine passed this tip along to me in a greeting card when Rose was born, and I've been using it ever since.  (I trust that one of these years I'll be able to give it up.  But that time does not appear to be close.)So, how do you do homemade diaper wipes?  Here's the recipe:1/2 roll good-quality paper towels (I use Bounty)2 c. water1 T. mineral oil1 T. baby shampooTo get a half-roll of paper towels, you'll have to cut the roll with a serrated knife, as if you were sawing a log.  I usually trim off any raggedy bits with scissors.For a storage container, I use a one-gallon plastic lettuce tub:I just bought a new one recently.  The first two lasted me through seven and a half years... ohhhh I've been doing this for tooooo long....Anyway.  Mix up the water, oil and shampoo, and then plop the half-roll in, cut side up.  Give it a few seconds to soak up a bunch of liquid, then take out the half-roll and flip it upside down so the smooth side is up.Put on the lid (you may need to squish the roll down just a bit first, but that's OK).  And there you have it.  I was initially told to pull out the center core and pull the wipes from the middle, but for me it works best to take them from the outside.  After the roll gets a little smaller, you can turn the roll on its side within the tub to make the wipes even easier to grab:=============================OK, next item is in honor of the late, loud pitch-man Billy Mays:How does this fit the \"Squeeze That Nickel\" theme?  I'll tell you how.  This stuff WORKS to take out stains.  And if you can take stains out, you can put the clothes back in the drawer to wear again.  And you don't have to buy new ones.  And you save a TON.Joy's clothes always seem to pick up more stains than anyone elses in this house, most often food-related.  She eats enthusiastically and well, preferring to use her fingers.  She does use fork or spoon when encouraged to do so, but does not always keep her mind on the task... She also tends to stuff her mouth a little too full, resulting in interesting driblets and droplets.Yesterday I used OxiClean to get out mulberry stains from a white onesie, and dried-on red wine stains from the back of her dress.  (Huh?  Oh, yeah.  No, there was no wine in her sippy.  That wouldn't have spilled, right?  Actually I was silly enough to go chasing across the yard after her with a glass of wine in my hand.  Clumsy mommy!)  Anyway, the stains totally vanished.These last couple of days I've been seeing post-Billy-Mays OxiClean ads.  And, as much as I was annoyed by his outsized voice and his impossibly-dyed-black hair and beard... the more moderated female voice that does these new ads does not make ANY kind of impression.  I can't believe I actually kinda miss the guy.=============================OK, one more product.The lowly pinwheel may set you back all of a buck at the dollar store.  But oh, the joy we get out of these things!We can't leave pinwheels lying around for Joy to play with at random, because she doesn't take too long to crumple the wheel and bend the stick beyond all use.  However, they're great when one of Joy's baristas needs to put a guaranteed distraction into her hand for just a minute while they jot something down or program something into the GoTalk.  We've also had good success lately with turn-taking games -- Mama will blow on the pinwheel, Joy giggles hysterically, Joy reaches up a hand to spin the wheel herself, Joy giggles hysterically, Joy pushes the pinwheel back toward Mama, Mama blows on the pinwheel, Joy giggles hysterically... You get the picture.  How many giggles can you usually buy for a buck, huh?=============================OK, that's all for today... must go make more applesauce... squeeze those windfall apples till the worms holler, or something like that!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmdCUxKtylI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/H5_VDMC7Go4/s1600-h/wipes-container.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmdFxa8jEFI/AAAAAAAAAVY/Vinl0NasTtk/s1600-h/wipes-topview1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmdGSxaRCOI/AAAAAAAAAVg/0WumgKh4YF0/s1600-h/wipes-topview2.jpg", "http://www.atmospheric-violence.com/mays/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmdGuKTUkbI/AAAAAAAAAVo/ZErhQ_uMtsc/s1600-h/oxyclean.gif", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SmdJ4GHwqII/AAAAAAAAAVw/xhOJIpxO3fA/s1600-h/pinwheel.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/07/product-hits-and-misses-squeeze-that.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits and Misses: \"Squeeze That Nickel\" Edition\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 1, 2009", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis Sightings===========We did it, y'all!On Monday, Wisconsin's Governor Jim Doyle signed the state budget into law, including a requirement for insurance companies in Wisconsin to cover autism-related treatments.  Until now, insurers in this state have been free not to cover autism, and to deny any service that might be autism-related.Intensive-level therapy for children with autism in Wisconsin has been provided through a Medicaid waiver program, whereby the state & the feds together fund up to three years of intensive therapy (20+ hours per week) with the possibility of a number of years of post-intensive therapy.  The autism diagnosis plus a certain level of disability qualifies a child for the program, regardless of parental income (though families do pay a small monthly fee that depends on income).  The state budgets for a certain number of new clients in this program each year -- lately that level has been set at 200 new kids a year.Unfortunately, the need has been greater than the waiver program could handle.  A waiting list formed, and grew.  In Joy's case, the time lag between her diagnosis at the end of 2006 and when her number came up on the waiting list was 18 months, plus another month until the first therapy (so the agency could assemble a team).  And the waiting list continued to grow.This was the setting in which the autism-insurance movement swung into gear here a few years ago -- if insurers could be required to pay for these therapies, the Medicaid-waiver portion of the program could focus on the uninsured, and more children overall could receive treatment.  The legislation ended up broader than just the needs of children, fortunately, also applying to autism-related treatment for adults.It took lots of advocacy and meetings and lobbying and rallying, lots of maneuvering and persistence.  And now the autism insurance requirement is law.  Wahoo!!  Big happy thank-you and cheers to everyone who helped bring this about!So.  What now?Well, nothing will change immediately.  The next step is for the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) to hammer out the specific rules for the insurance companies to implement, based on the law.  The timeline for them to do so is five months.  Then the insurance companies have to issue their new plans based on the rules.  For state workers like me & JoyDad, the new plans should go into effect at the start of 2010.Coverage must be at least $50,000 for intensive services (evidence-based behavioral therapy) per year, $25,000 per year for post-intensive (i.e. anything afterward, still must be evidence-based, so no coverage requirement for such things as  hyperbarics and certain biomedical interventions).As I understand it, the hope for how this is going to go is that the insurance companies will contract out the providing of the therapies to the agencies that are currently providing them under the waiver program.  I was initially concerned about a couple of things for our particular situation.  One is that our HMO has been very particular about not wanting to cover anything not offered by their particular network.  However, since the HMOs haven't been covering the therapies, that means the clinics haven't been offering them, which means they  would have to totally start from scratch in developing such therapy programs, staffing them, etc.  Contracting it out should be a much more attractive option, at least initially!  (Conversations are underway, or so I hear.)Meanwhile, our own Agency Two (which provides the baristas that serve up Joy's House Blend therapy) has a PhD-level therapist on the committee that's helping to formulate the Insurance Commission rules.  This eases my mind about another worry, which was that the language in the law about \"evidence-based behavioral therapy\" might be interpreted as code-speak for \"Applied Behavioral Analysis as practiced in Lovaas-protocol discrete trial therapy\".  Which is the protocol provided by Agency 1, the service-provider that we... umm... decided against.  However, therapies that have a more relationship-based focus can also claim a legitimate place under the behavioral-therapy umbrella, as they successfully did when decisions about the waiver program were being made.  And Agency 2 is right in there to help make those decisions fall the right way when it comes to autism insurance in Wisconsin.It's pretty clear that families who have insurance will be required to make the switch, and cannot choose to stay on the waiver program.  I wonder if this will turn out to be a costly deal for families with high-deductible policies?  I was also wondering if we'd still be able to keep Joy's medical assistance at all, which pays for the diapers that aren't covered by our HMO -- it seems that we can at least hope not to get kicked off that, since the determination of disability for Joy should still apply.Ideally, if everything comes up as sweetly as possible, we'll be able to stay with Agency 2, keep MA, and lose the ridiculous waiver-program rule that restricts the therapies to the home environment, so that perhaps we'd be allowed to have therapists work at Joy's daycare (as Birth to 3 and school district therapists have no problem doing.)  We shall see.  No guarantees on any one of those hopes, at this point.There's a lot left to be worked out.  And after the rules are in place, and the new insurance plans based on those rules take effect, I imagine things will get very hairy for a while as the autism-therapy service providers have to quickly staff up for an influx of new insured-clients who were either previously sitting on the waiting list, or had given up on the state program altogether but now will want to take advantage of the insurance coverage.  I also don't know how the state is going to count the \"waiver slots\" that open up when people like Joy move over onto insurance funding.  Will \"her\" slot come open in addition to the 200 new ones for the new fiscal year, or will it be one of the 200, which the state parcels out at an average rate of about 4 per week?For all of the potential drawbacks and questions, I have no question that this was the right thing to do.  Ultimately, more people in Wisconsin, children and adults both, will get the autism-related treatment they need.  It's good to have something to celebrate, in a very difficult budget.As Wisconsin's state motto says:  Forward!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/acts/09enAB0075-veto2.pdf", "http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/wisconsin_state_symbols.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/07/forward-autism-insurance-in-wisconsin.html", "title": "\nForward!

{"date": "Friday, July 24, 2009", "body": "\nIf I tell you a story, will you tell me a story?I've been nudged to think still more about the contents of my Library Conference post from a few days ago, after getting comments both from the moderator of the \"Serving Students Along the Autism Spectrum\" conference session, and from the creators of the \"Libraries and Autism: We're Connected\" training program and materials.  An exchange of e-mails has followed, and some of my feedback has been incorporated into the Libraries and Autism web site -- plus Elvis Sightings seems to have become an Autism Blog of Interest, woohoo!  Anyway, this all led me to reflect on my own experience with Joy and the local public library.  I'm hoping to hear some autism-related library stories from my readers too.Joy is not an easy match with the public library.  When Rose was little, I could take her to play with the books and toys, and she'd spend hours coloring or building with their huge toy blocks or perusing books with me.  Joy doesn't work that way.  She'd throw (or eat) the crayons, use the aisles as a racetrack, have little-to-no interest in the books I'd present.In fact, it's even more challenging with books lately.  Joy has always been hard on her board book collection, but the newest wrinkle is: she's decided that the best use for a board book is to fold it backwards, presumably for the sensory delight in breaking its spine.  More and more of her books have ended up as tattered individual cardboard pages.I don't check out library books for Joy to mangle.Our most successful public-library experiences have come courtesy of a friend of ours who also happens to be the children's librarian at a nearby branch.  Together with Joy's former daycare bud and his mom, we'd sign up for toddler story-times led by this librarian, for half-hour sessions full of songs, fingerplay, books and toys.  I would have to do a lot of corralling Joy, and occasionally she'd be too intent on leaving to make it worth staying.  The big bonus, though, was having the toddler-time led by someone who knew her and valued her, someone she was comfortable with, who didn't get bent out of shape when Joy was noisy or not particularly attentive or masticating her nametag or whatever.Joy's full schedule of intensive autism therapy has pretty much ruled out any story-time attendance lately.  I do take her to the library but it's mostly for my own errands, to check out books that I've placed on hold and to return others.  She does enjoy helping me put each book into the return slot and pushing it until it falls, but I pretty much have to keep a tight hold on her hand the entire time we're there.What public library memories do you have to share?  (I said autism-related above, but if you have a non-spectrum story to share, sure, why not.)  What works well at your public library in that regard?  What doesn't?  What would you change about it if you had your druthers?  Tell me your story!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thejointlibrary.org/autism/expand.htm"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/07/storytime.html", "title": "\nStorytime\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 11, 2009", "body": "\nIt's been close to a year since I posted about swimming.  Last summer, before Joy's number came up on the wait list for the intensive autism therapy she's been getting, we signed her up for lessons at a local swim school, that has a program for kids with special needs whereby if you needed a smaller class size or one-on-one instruction, they'd provide it for the standard non-special-needs price.  (Still not cheap, but whatta deal!)  Joy did great with the summer session, with a wonderful teacher who really seemed to \"get\" her.  I blogged with glee about the happy report card, on which every skill for the level was marked \"Mastered\"!Then we decided to keep going with lessons in the fall.  Turned out our wonderful instructor had a summer-only gig, so we were put with another gal who, though well-meaning, did not have that connection with Joy that her predecessor did.  Joy had been doing so well with jump-ins.  They'd set her up with a staffer behind her to keep her from running, and then the instructor in the water reaching up but not touching her, and Joy would jump in on her own.  With the new instructor, though, it almost took a push from behind.  Half the session was over before she was willing to jump on her own again.She made some good progress on floats and submersions.  I was chagrined, though, at the report card.  Instead of being scored on the next level's report card, she got the same card as the previous session.  Only the scores had gone BACKWARD.  Instead of reading \"mastered\" for all the skills as it had in the previous session, suddenly some of the skills were only \"developing\".  When I protested, I was told that after the first session they pretty well promote everyone.  But since Joy was still in a class on her own, so could go totally at her own pace without having to worry about keeping up with a class or anything, this time they were scoring it more accurately.Nice.  Not.We did not sign up for the winter.  By then we had a full therapy schedule, plus I had no desire to be dragging in and out of a pool facility having to stuff a wet child into boots and winter coat in zero-degree weather.  Plus I was smarting from essentially being told, \"we made you feel good the first session with the artifically pumped-up scores, but she didn't really deserve them, so you can stop feeling good now.\"  Bleah.Anyway, here it is summer again.  I tried to take Rose & Joy to the public pool two weeks ago, but we'd scarcely been in the water for 5 minutes before someone pooped in the pool and closed it down.  We didn't get another good chance until this past Thursday evening, and the temperature was questionable, only in the high 70s, but Rose really wanted to swim.  So we went.It was a delight.Joy is so much more confident in the water than she was last time I remember (which may be two years ago, since we didn't do much public-pool last year!)  She's taller, stronger, happy to splash around.  She doesn't much mind getting a face-full of water, which is actually a bit of an issue because it's a fan-shaped pool where the bottom slopes down from zero at the outskirts to over-her-head in near the center of the fan, and the slope encourages her toward deeper waters.  So I had to stay vigilant.The best part, though, was the jump-ins.  I discovered that I could put Joy up on the edge of the fan where the water was a good depth, step back from the wall, count \"1-2-3-Jump\"... and she would jump in to me with delight!  There was only a token barrier behind her, and nobody holding her.  We did this over and over, sometimes with Rose at her side but sometimes not (and Rose wasn't holding her at all).  Joy only turned to duck under the barrier and run for the grass once, out of twenty or more attempts.We stayed till her teeth were chattering, maybe a little shorter visit than we'd otherwise have made, but it was a fair trade-off since the cool weather meant that the pool was very sparsely populated and Joy could splash all she wanted without disturbing a soul.Besides, fewer pool-participants means less chance of bio-accidents...Sorry, no photos.  Maybe if JoyDad accompanies us one of these days, one of us can work the camera while the pool works its magic.P.S.  I'm composing this chez UncleDO and AuntLO -- am in their neck of the woods for a library conference.  I like the accommodations!

{"date": "Tuesday, July 7, 2009", "body": "\nRemember my agonized howls back in March, when Joy got referred for an appointment with the same pediatric opthalmologist at the same clinic where two years ago we'd had the worst clinic experience EVAH?!We had the appointment this morning.It went fine.SO many things were different. Today we had the first appointment of the morning, so no crowded waiting room. This time I explained our situation up front to anyone who would listen.  The waiting room itself was tidy and whole, as opposed to the construction that was underway in September 2007.  We had a minimal wait before being called the first time (a short enough wait that Joy was entertained by the waiting-room goldfish the whole time.)  The doctor came promptly after the tech was done.We knew in advance that Joy's eyes would need dilation so didn't have that element of surprise.We got to wait for the dilation to take effect in a private exam-room with low lights.They came for us in EXACTLY the 30 minutes allotted, rather than the hour-plus we suffered through last round.No seizures.  As expected, but it helped so much!  (We were so much in seizure-mode last time, it didn't even occur to me to TELL the doctor that it had happened.  She was surprised not to find it in her notes when I recounted the experience this time around.)We were outta there in an hour and a quarter.  What a marvellously well-oiled visit!The point of the visit was a concern on our part that we keep seeing episodes where Joy's eyes don't track well together.  It seems worse when she's tired or out of sorts.  Fortunately she performed for both the tech and the doc, so they could see what I was talking about!  (Joy was, in fact, remarkably cooperative with the whole appointment.)The diagnosis is strabismus, but not serious at this point.  The key seems to be that she can pull her eyes back into focus on her own.  Given that state of affairs, the doctor doesn't want to do anything beyond watching and waiting.  It's a brain thing rather than a physical-structure thing -- her eyes themselves look healthy -- and nothing that they have an easy reliable fix for.  The next step up would be an eye-patching routine (yeah, she'd love that) and the escalation beyond that would be surgery on the eye muscles (about a 70% success rate, and I neglected to ask exactly what constituted \"success\"). We're to go back in a year, unless things get outta control and we have to go sooner.  But for now, Joy's overcoming it all by herself.  So very much this kiddo has to contend with.  I'm very proud of her, and will gladly squeak on her behalf whenever necessary!P.S.  Tomorrow is the first blog-o-versary of Elvis Sightings.  Hard to believe it's been a whole year since I first asked, \"Is this thing on?\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/07/will-squeak-for-grease.html", "title": "\nWill Squeak for Grease\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 18, 2009", "body": "\nI'm back again -- didja miss me?I didn't mean to take quite this long to post, but between last weekend's conferencing, the regular daily plate-spinning, and the bounty of the plantation (have frozen umpteen quarts of green-beans, and canned 10 quarts of applesauce and a double-recipe of cherry jam since last we spoke), my poor blog has gone sliding down the priorities.However.  The library conference needs reporting!Though the pickings were a little slim for my data-library specialty, I did manage to find relevant vendors in the exhibit hall and useful sessions to attend.  I also, wonder of wonders, connected up with EVERY ONE of the people-meetings I'd arranged.  It really felt in some ways like another reunion weekend, except instead of college friends, it was high school buddies, a housemate from my post-college years in Mennonite Voluntary Service, a college-library colleague whom I hadn't seen since JoyDad & I made our last cross-country move 11 years ago, a data-librarian colleague from social-science data conferences.  (Yes, they have those.  Who knew?)  And then the wonderful hospitality of UncleDO & AuntLO, who treated me to a grilled-out dinner on their rooftop deck Saturday night, with a spectacular sunset and view of the twinkling city skyline as the darkness fell.  Ahhh.The very last session I attended at the conference was something just for me.  It was a session called \"Serving Students Along the Autism Spectrum.\"  The program was aimed particularly at school libraries, but it sounded to me as if the attendees represented a broad range of libraries -- and also that some of the more coordinated efforts are happening in the public libraries!  Which makes sense, because school libraries are often deemed expendable in budget-cutting times, and we're surely in budget-slashing times these days... many school librarians are just trying to keep their heads above water.  But I digress.  At any rate, the number of attendees caught the presenters off guard, to the point that they ran out of handout packets!The session itself had a \"what is autism\" training component to it, but also had a school librarian describing her own work with students on the spectrum, and representatives from the Chicago Public Library talking about their recent system-wide efforts to orient staff and acquire/create autism-related materials.  The CPL is a big system, and I was impressed at how broad their staff-awareness efforts sounded, though at this point it would be hard to guess it from their web site.  They also spoke of \"inclusion kits\" that they're making available for check-out, though it's not yet a completed work -- the kits are social-story materials aimed at particular situations like using the library or using the CTA public transit system.The school librarian who spoke was interesting.  She had a speaking style that was simultaneously animated, with big gestures, but slowly spoken and with huge emphasis on what felt like almost every point, practically every other word.  I actually found it annoying to listen to, but then thought \"hey, she's showing us what she thinks works when she communicates with young'uns on the spectrum in her library!\"  Which put a different cast on it.  Kind of like how Barney is totally annoying for adults, but little ones lap it up...  A few random good points:On the school library side of things, there was a good point made about keeping the library in mind when it comes to IEPs (filing away for future).On libraries in general, one of the presenters spoke about how libraries can be a natural match for people with autism.  It's generally a quiet place; it's generally predictable, with rules for how things go; there are usually safe-feeling nooks and crannies; and there are BOOKS! There are COMPUTERS! You can learn as much as you like about your all-consuming interest!An audience member asked for recommendations for story-time books for kids on the spectrum.  The responder gave some examples of books with rhythmic cadences and rhymes, repeated patterns, interesting pictures -- and the audience member pointed out that those are all things that make good read-alouds for any kid.  YESSS!The presenters pointed out an award-winning set of resources for libraries, put together by Scotch Plains Public Library and Fanwood Memorial Library, both of New Jersey (where the oft-quoted autism prevalence number is 1 in 94.)  The program is called Libraries and Autism: We're Connected, and consists of a 20-minute training video for library staff, a PowerPoint training presentation, recommendations for autism-related materials for library collections, a printed tool with Boardmaker-type icons for library-users with autism to communicate with staff, a social-story tool called This is my Library, links and logos.  The panel wanted to rope these people into the conference session, but discovered that they'd be receiving an award at the conference during the same time slot!I was impressed with the video.  (It looks like two parts, but Part 1 is actually the complete presentation, 20 minutes long.  Part 2 repeats the last 10 minutes of Part 1 - strange. I figured it out!  Part 1 & Part 2 are ten-minute YouTube segments, OR you can click on the video player and play the whole 20-minute video from the library server.)  It was very reassuring, low-key, professional.  Participants in the video were clearly on the spectrum themselves, not just actors (2 kids, one adult).  Several nice points in the training video:They use the quote \"If you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism.\"  Nice!They recommend people-first language (person with autism).  I know that's got its own level of controversy, but it fit well into the people-first emphasis of the video overall  (e.g. The tips in this video are really quite universal... any encounter with ANY library user should involve a receptive smile and personal words of welcome...)One particularly useful conversation tip for de-escalating uncomfortable situations involved asking common social questions to help library users with autism to get on-script and decrease anxiety levelsGood point that if there's a caregiver present, that caregiver is not automatically an intermediary -- library staff should communicate as directly with the person as possibleLibrary staff can be ambassadors to the community, by how they respond to situations involving autism!  If the staff is low-key and accepting about flapping or vocal stims, for example, it sends an important message to other people nearby that this is not cause for alarm.The video pointed out the people on the spectrum can make excellent library employees and volunteers. (Oh yeah!)And there was more.  As I said, I was quite impressed.  I'd be interested to hear reviews from a spectrum perspective, to fill in what I might be missing.  One quibble I have with the materials is some discomfort with the logo.  There's that darn puzzle-piece thing again.  It's not so bad when the puzzle-pieces are connected to the books in the image -- when the libraries are part of the puzzle of life, and we're all in it together trying to figure out how to do things right, that's positive.  But they use the puzzle-piece part of the logo separately too, and the whole implication that people on the spectrum themselves are puzzles to figure out... bleah.The recommended links on the site also rather bend over backward to be fair-and-balanced about vaccines.  On the other hand, the blog recommendations are much more neurodiversity oriented: LeftBrain/RightBrain, Autism Hub, and more.Well, it's taken me long enough to get this together, I'll just post now.

She'd recently been on vacation for a family wedding, with her large extended family.It sounds like the reception dance was a joyful affair.  One of the highlights of the evening, after the guests had gotten a little loosened up and let their hair down, was the song Baby Got Back, a raunchy ditty with a strong dance beat.  The lyrics reflect masculine appreciation of a generously-proportioned female backside.  (Yes indeedy, objectification of women.  Tsk, tsk.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 11, 2009", "body": "\nLast night we had a team meeting at our house, one of those delightful gatherings that gets all (or almost all) of Joy's baristas (intensive autism line therapists) in one place at one time, together with me & JoyDad & Lynda the Wonder Woman daycare lady.These are remarkably productive meetings when we keep them on track.  The biggest thing that threatens to derail them occasionally is that everybody gets too involved in the very first agenda item...The first agenda item is positive stories.I love starting meetings this way, and I love the fact that people have SO many positive Joy-stories to tell, that it threatens to take up too much of the meeting sometimes!Last night's positive stories included:Joy ate an entire helping of cut-up spaghetti & red sauce -- with her fork.  With almost no guidance.When one of her baristas was playing pillow-squish game with her, and saying a big ol' \"Squish!\" each time the pillow came down, Joy several times echoed the unusual sound \"KW\".At daycare, Joy was in her chair at the table playing with a puzzle, something that's usually not a big turn-on for her.  Another child decided to be \"helpful\" and came over to take over, pulling pieces out of Joy's hand and putting them in the puzzle.  And Joy, instead of checking out on the interaction, got mad, tried to hold on to the pieces, even succeeded in getting some back!Joy imitated monkey-noises, \"oo-ahh-ahh-ahh\".The \"high-five\" that we've worked into Joy's greeting and bye-bye routines has caught on like wildfire.  It's such a charming way that she can interact that feels \"normal\" to people, and they respond with such delight.  She high-fived the sheriff's deputy who came to change her Project Lifesaver battery, and a whole bunch of folks at church.  Plus she high-fives Rose, who is a model of patience in holding her hand at the ready and waiting for Joy to come through with that high-five.Once we've got a good foundation of positive stories to build on, it's ever so much easier to bring out the challenges, like how do we deal with Joy's grass-pulling and rotten-apple-eating in the yard?  (we're going to try to provide stretchy-sequin bands, which have helped at daycare) or how do we deal when she's pingpong-ing around and won't slow down long enough to interact (sometimes it's calming to get her sitting in the high-chair, notched down to its lowest setting near the floor.)Positive stories.  Didn't I just mention recently how much I like them?P.S.  Here are some positive stories from me.  This morning I went running again (OK, alternating walk with slow-jog) for the first time since I broke my toe last month.  It felt fine.  And, I interviewed yesterday for the university program I was talking about the other day, that would take my plate-spinning to a whole 'nother level.  I don't think I've ever been so relaxed and confident in an interview before.  The program feels RIGHT for me.  Now the committee just has to agree!

I sometimes talk myself out of expecting them even when the chances of side effects are high.Rhemashope posted recently about the difficult decisions they're facing about epilepsy meds for Rhema -- difficult in large part because of side effects and dependency issues.

He started on a new medication, prescribed but also available over the counter (OTC), where \"side effects are generally mild.\"  You basically don't expect big problems when you take it.The night after he started taking the stuff, he got a fever & chills, coughing, shortness of breath, had an awful night.  In the morning he called the whoever was on-call at his clinic (weekend, of course), only to be told something vague, probably ought to stop taking the medication just in case and call the doctor on Monday.  He stopped the meds, started feeling better, didn't actually miss any work, forgot to make the call, convinced himself that he'd been on the wrong end of coincidence and a virus, and re-started the medication.This landed him in the emergency room Tuesday evening, tight-chestedly gasping for breath and coughing up things one hadn't oughtta be coughing up.Fortunately he's OK, treated & released that evening, though he hasn't entirely shaken the cough yet.  We're intensely grateful to the retired-nurse neighbor who dropped everything on a moment's notice and gave him a ride to the hospital, so I didn't have to cancel a barista and drag the kids along for the emergency room experience!The drug in question?  Prilosec.  Common OTC antacid.Be careful out there, folks, any time you or your kiddo starts some new drug, prescription or OTC or herbal supplement or whatever.  Side effects may be uncommon.  But with most meds -- they're entirely possible, and you just might be the one to land on the wrong side of the statistics.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/a-good-bad-result/", "http://mamaedge.blogspot.com/2009/06/turning-it-around-part-3-mood.html", "http://mamaedge.blogspot.com/2009/06/exactly.html", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2009/02/07/update/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/2008/09/13/sleepless-in-seattle-niks-house/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/08/side-effects-are-generally-mild.html", "title": "\nSide Effects are Generally Mild\n"},

We have, of course, the nominated favorites, what we might call \"Readers' Choice.\"  Then we have posts with the most comments, posts that actually made things happen in the real world, posts that get the most hits.  And then (since I'm doing the writing, hee hee) we have my own favorites.So here we go!There were four posts that tied for the most comments, with 16 comments each:Favorite Place (Oct. 08) - about wanting my home to be Joy's therapists' favorite place to come workNot Alopecia -- Trichotillomania! (Apr. 09) - wherein I photographed Joy's emerging bald spot and asked for hair-pulling adviceIn Stunning Company (Apr. 09) - the following post, displaying glamorous buzzcuts, including Joy'sRandom Tuesday Thoughts (Apr. 09) - my first use of the Random Tuesday Thoughts memeAs far as posts that make things happen, I guess we don't always know what people do with our words after we put them out there.  The action isn't always in the comments, either.  My Nov. 08 post Complexity, which quoted and reflected on Tracy Kidder's book Mountains Beyond Mountains, got only one comment but inspired a friend to organize a discussion-group around the book at our congregation's annual winter retreat.  My March 09 post ABLE Accounts and \"A Bad Place\" about the ABLE Accounts Act of 2009 generated some communication with legislators.  I also hope that my product reviews have been useful; I know that I've gotten wonderful feedback on both situations and products when I've solicited advice.The most-frequently-viewed posts, due primarily to Google image hits, are the Stunning Company one (between Tyra Banks, Natalie Porter, Demi Moore, and Joy, it's Demi who gets the most searches) and my 5th post ever, on Linear Nevus Sebaceous Syndrome.  The LNSS post also generated a contact that is this close to making a substantial real-world contribution.  I will let you know when the project goes live!Then we have the nominated favorites.  I suppose it's a good thing that some commenters couldn't limit themselves to one...My Sense of Sensory Issues was BRatK's nominationARatK added Ritardando and Joy! by Joyce Carol ThomasRhemashope nominated n of 1, or the Myth of Fingerprints; Joyful Autism; and Listening With All My Heart.But the Number One nominee (several enthusiastic votes), and also a personal favorite of mine, to which I have referred again and again, the acrobatic metaphor for how I generally live my life, is of course:  Spin, Spin, Spin.  The JoyFamily spinning plate act has no need to go on tour -- this blog invites you all right into the midst of it.  Runners-up for my personal favorites include:Extended Metaphor -- in which I compare Joy's trajectory(ies) to the workings of a mixer-boardWhat Is Happening In Her Head? -- one of my earliest bloggy pieces about Joy, first posted on another site before Elvis Sightings existedMaybe. - a Zen take on a few of the many reversals in our Joy-journeyand, Photo Wednesday: Wild Woman Edition - because BRatK dared me to prove that I ate fire!Hmmm.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 18, 2009", "body": "\nThe girls and I dragged JoyDad to the pool Saturday evening, lingering cough and all, so that we got at least one full-family swim into this waning summer.Did we ever fly!  Look at Joy jump: ... and jump...... and jump with Rose...... and jump with Rose some more!I loved getting to take some photos, but even more I loved an interaction I had with another mom while I was having Joy jump to me, and climb out and jump again, and climb and jump again.  No hand-holding needed, no running...  Well, there was another little guy almost her height, doing the same thing at the poolside a few feet over.  After a few rounds his mom turned to me and commented what a good example my daughter was for her son, what positive peer pressure, he's never been willing to jump like this before!  Then she asked me how old my daughter was, I told her (5), and asked how old her son was (4 1/2), and we talked a bit about how tall he was for his age, and how tall his little 2-year-old brother was for his age, but little brother was having something of a fuss and they might have to cut the evening short.  All the while our kiddos were doing the jump/climb cycle over and over.My daughter was a good example!  To her son!!  Full stop, no qualifications, no watering down, just a good example!!!With most interactions like this, something will happen that will lead to my feeling the need to do some gentle commenting or educating about Joy's developmental issues.  Like, the other parent will ask Joy how old she is, or what's her name, and of course get no answer.  And I'll say something like \"She's a lady of few words but many jumps!  I bet, though, she'd give you a high-five if you asked...\" or something like that, which often leads to questions that circle around what's-up-with-the-lack-of-language.  This time?  No such detour.  Just a short cheerful conversation about pool-jumping and positive peer pressure.That felt almost as good as the fact that Joy did not even look like she was considering running the other direction instead of jumping in.Oh, and I got to fly too.  Down the huge long twisty waterslide, bullet-like, lying down with my arms crossed tight.  Wheee!  Thanks for coming to the pool, JoyDad -- I don't get to waterslide when it's just me on duty!  What a lovely evening.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SodtzXw0ERI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/CRVgjbM_G3A/s1600-h/swimjumpjoy.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SoduAvBX1FI/AAAAAAAAAWY/YxA-Z48hVkg/s1600-h/swimjumpjoy1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SoduftJs-3I/AAAAAAAAAWo/Tz2CI0POA5E/s1600-h/swimjumpboth2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SoduRCZn2CI/AAAAAAAAAWg/vjvo8pw4ew8/s1600-h/swimjumpboth1.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/08/we-can-fly-poolside-edition.html", "title": "\nWe Can Fly, Poolside Edition\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 28, 2009", "body": "\nThe past two days have been amazing.Those who have been following the continuing saga here will know that just a few short weeks ago, I learned about an exciting program at the university here.  It's an interdisciplinary leadership training program, funded by the federal Maternal & Child Health Bureau, going by the acronym LEND, which stands for Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities.  Turns out there's a whole network of these LEND programs.  The point of the program is to catch up-and-comers as they're training for professions working with people with neurodevelopmental disabilities.  Our group of 27 includes occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, public health, audiology, genetic counseling, nutrition, social work, psychology, and \"family support\" (parents and other family members).  These people work together with the immense  resources of the university's center for neurodevelopmental disabilities, devouring the smorgasbord of content, linking up with experts, pursuing leadership goals and projects and advocacy, being mentored by families in the community.I am stunned that I am to be one of these leaders.  But oh, how right it feels.It's very encouraging to see what future leaders (guess I should say \"we,\" huh?) are being taught.  The very first slide of the first presentation of the two-day orientation started out with a series of photos -- the world, our continent, our state, our city, the university, our center's buildings.  The point was: we're starting here... to change the world!Here's a mantra worth remembering: Family-centered, community-based, culturally-competent, co-ordinated care.  (How many of us have that, blogfriends?  Who do we see in our communities who doesn't have that?  What would it take to make that ideal a reality?)We got a whirlwind overview of some federal disability-legislation highlights in the past 40-plus years, together with the observation that many big changes had their roots in parents seeking better lives for their kids...  We were given a case history of a family who might come to the center for a diagnosis, and met in groups with professionals from all our different disciplines who spoke briefly about their field and what their field might be able to bring to the diagnostic process and the interdisciplinary team that might work with this family...I'm in a much better place for taking advantage of conversations than I was in my library-grad-school days.  Back then I was mighty shy.  Quiet.  Not the one hobnobbing with the faculty, or even my fellow-students like I might have.  Well.  The \"me\" of the early 90s would hardly recognize the woman who was doing so much conversing during the breaks that there was barely time to eat!Just one example of my high-powered classmates in this endeavor -- struck up a conversation with a gal sitting next to me in a presentation, established that she's going to be on my interdisciplinary team (autism-focused, woohoo!).  Her field is public health, she's very interested in policy and advocacy, and she's actually been sitting in on the meetings with the Insurance Commissioner's office that's hashing out the rules for how Wisconsin's new autism insurance legislation will be put into practice!  Is that an awesome inside source, or what?!The last half of Thursday's orientation was to the center itself, the entity within the university that brings the focus and the education and the research to neurodevelopmental disabilities.  We got a high-powered overview and then a tour of various research labs.  My group's last stop of the day was in a first-floor room with a foot-and-a-half thick concrete door, that held a proton-accelerator with which that particular brain-imaging lab made its own radioisotopes for use with PET scans.  Good grief.  Me and my best buddy the proton accelerator!!!My brain is so full.Yesterday afternoon had another powerful component though, that spoke to another part of me.First was the introduction to the center.  I hadn't known this, but the entity has the imprint of the Kennedy family all over it.  The initial funding came from Joseph Kennedy Jr.'s foundation.  The presentation included a telegram from President Kennedy, congratulating the fledgling institution and confirming that Senator Edward Kennedy and Eunice Kennedy Shriver would be attending the opening gala...  Oh, how they will be missed!  And.  The telegram was dated November 20, 1963.  Just a couple of days before John F. Kennedy went to Dallas.  Oh my.And then.  There were images in the presentation of a sweet girl who used to be in Joy's daycare, who later went to the daycare at this university center.  An inspiring child and family... she has proved nay-sayers wrong again and again about her challenges. Then there was a panel presentation with parents and also a high-school girl who has disabilities herself.  The young lady stole the show.  Speaking was not the easiest thing for her... she had a timed PowerPoint presentation full of lovely photos with short captions and was having trouble reading the captions before the thing switched to the next photo.  After she started over several times and was getting visibly frustrated, someone came up to try and help her.  She shooed the adult away, and eventually made it work herself!!  She and her sister run a jewelry business together, and she enthusiastically sold us her wares afterwards during the break... gonna wear my new earrings at next Friday's seminar...Here's a quote from one of the parents, who has a son with autism and a typically-developing daughter.  \"When my daughter said her first word, it was wonderful.  When my son said his first word, it was heaven.\"I'm tearing up just typing this.  You can bet I was weeping during that panel.Oh yes, my brain is full.  So is my heart.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aucd.org/template/page.cfm?id=6"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-brain-is-so-full.html", "title": "\nMy Brain is SO Full.\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 1, 2009", "body": "\nGoing to the park with Joy is a mixed bag these days.  On the one hand, she's mighty stimmy on the gravel or woodchips or whatever.  Handfuls go flying into the air at random times (one of those less-than-a-good-example kinds of things when other kids are around), or into the mouth.  Bleah.On the other hand, she is doing great things on the play structures.  The other day I had her at the school playground, on equipment that had three different kinds of ladders (petal-grid, spiral, ordinary).  It was such a treat to watch her think and plan as she made her way up the petal-grid and the spiral!  The wheels were turning and she was making the most of it.Then she saw the big-kid swings, way down the hill and across the grass.WHOOSH.  She was on her way.When I caught up with her, she was trying to get into a swing.  These are higher up than our usual park, though, and she couldn't quite make it.  So she came over to me, grabbed my hands, put them under her arms.  Pick me up, Mama.  Put me in the swing.  I was so happy to help!Joy has done so well lately staying in the swing and holding on for high pushes, and not trying to get off until the swing is nearly stopped.  So I gave her the big-kid treatment, with the great big running-underneath pushes (do you call those underducks?  or underdogs?)  Anyway.  She grinned so big I thought her face was gonna split in two.Meanwhile, Rose was clamoring for the big pushes too.  I think they picked swings at the opposite end of the set on purpose to give Mama a workout...Joy's use of the hand-pulling request has blossomed lately.  To the buckles on her booster chair (unbuckle me, Mama, I want to get down!)  To the TV/video-player (Baby Einstein, please, Mama!)  To the door handle (play outside? Now?)  To her own underarms (I'm tired of walking, pick me up!)  The flip side here is that when I have to refuse (sorry sweetie, we can't start a video, the therapist is coming in five minutes!) she is declaring her unhappiness in no uncertain terms.  The fuss can persist long after the initial offense.  I should be celebrating this, I guess, right?  As in, it's not normal for a kid to give up so quickly and nonchalantly as she's generally done in the past.  Oh bliss, oh Joy, she's discovered her inner two year old!  Hurray, and a big deep sigh.One final vignette for this post.Yesterday afternoon Joy was hanging out in the living room, watching a video (yes, Baby Einstein, what else?) and I was lounging on the couch with a book.  Suddenly she went over to the quilt that stays in the room, that her baristas use for blanket-pulls and swinging and such.  Her 6-ft-7 barista-dude has been trying to teach her to help spread the quilt out a little bit -- he's the only one that can give her the full swinging treatment all by himself!  Well, she took the quilt and made spreading motions and got it laid out a little bit on the floor.  Then she came over, took my hand, pulled me from the couch.  And then she sat down on that blanket.Look Mama, I've done the planning & prep work.  Swing me now!!I called JoyDad over, and together we swung her high, to the accompaniment of that dazzling grin.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/Sp1EvmrjRwI/AAAAAAAAAWw/Ik4NGbikLd0/s1600-h/school-swings1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/Sp1FNaGRvqI/AAAAAAAAAW4/UwRobwawFIs/s1600-h/school-swings2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/Sp1GEnhuOcI/AAAAAAAAAXA/SERQg1kXWXw/s1600-h/school-swings3.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/09/initiative-and-planning.html", "title": "\nInitiative and Planning.\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 14, 2009", "body": "\nToday's slice of my parent-trainee experience has to do with the social work class that is part of the LEND trainee requirements in our program: Social Work 644, Issues in Developmental Disabilities.It's a distance-training course, that was originally conceived with the lectures broadcast on public television.  Now the lectures and course outline have migrated to the web, where they are freely available (for sure until February 2010 at least, at which point funding issues may become a problem).  Let me give you that web site again, http://www.iidd.wisc.edu/.  Quickest way to the lectures is the three links at the top of the page, Module A, Module B, Module C.  Of course to get credit for the class (academic credit or CEU) you have to register & pay, which gets you access to the readings & assignments & exams.  OK, that's my public-service announcement for the day!If you actually \"take\" the class, there's a pre-requisite document that is so important it's attached as an appendix to the syllabus.  Here's what the syllabus says:Throughout your writing in this course, you will be expected to write using Person-First Language. A required reading, \"But I Don't Have a Disability!\": Writing Inclusive Documents is offered in week 1... Person-First Language is expected in student exams and discussion postings and points will be deducted for inappropriate use of language.Elvis Sightings readers who hang out in disability-awareness circles will have encountered this issue already and formed their own opinions, which I'd love to hear in the comments!  Person-first language is not new to me either, and it's how I blog.  But my family and \"meat-space\" friends might appreciate a closer look at the principles, and the controversy (the latter of which I've not really yet seen addressed related to the course.)The idea of respectful and person-first language in writing about people with disabilities is about a whole lot more than \"political correctness.\"  It's about changing attitudes, challenging stereotypes, breaking down barriers, treating people like people instead of some kind of marginalized other.  In a word, it's about: inclusion.Here are some examples from the Inclusive Documents paper:Instead of the disabled, the crippled, the handicapped, a cripple or invalid use persons or people with disabilities; disabled persons or people so that you will put people first and avoid generalizing people as if they belonged to a disability community.Instead of confined, bound, restricted to or dependent on a wheelchair use wheelchair user or person who uses a wheelchair so that you will emphasize abilities, not limitations.Instead of epileptic use person who has epilepsy or seizures so that you will put the person first.Instead of normal (when used as the opposite of disabled), whole, able-bodied use nondisabled so that you will use a neutral, appropriate term instead of implying that someone with a disability is abnormal.The document also makes points about how not to frame an anecdote or story:Don\u2019t focus on the disability unless it is crucial to a story. Avoid tear-jerking human interest stories about incurable diseases, congenital impairments or severe injury. Don\u2019t portray successful people with disabilities as heroes because of, or in spite of, their disabilities. Similarly, don\u2019t sensationalize disability or use emotional descriptors such as unfortunate, pitiful, and so forth. Avoid \u201ctragic but brave\u201d stereotypes. I'll highlight one further \"don't\" from the list:  Avoid euphemisms such as challenged, physically inconvenienced, handi-capable, mentally different -- disability groups consider these terms condescending because they reinforce the idea that disabilities cannot be dealt with directly and candidly.So, that's what our leadership group, and anyone else taking this class, and many others I'm sure, are being taught.  And for the most part, it's all material that's already comfortable to me, and I'd encourage others to work on.  Personally, I have not chosen to refer to Joy as autistic, or epileptic for that matter (she's so much more than either of those terms!) Interestingly, the document avoids \"going there\" with autism.  Doesn't use it as an example at all, even though the rest of the course clearly situates autism among the \"developmental disabilities\" next to epilepsy and cerebral palsy and others.  I suspect it might be because the autism self-advocacy community has some substantial dissent when it comes to person-first language.  One of the most powerful and succinct arguments for why not to use person-first language in the case of autism comes from Jim Sinclair, in his 1999 piece Why I Dislike \"Person First Language\".  Here are some snippets of his three points: I am not a \"person with autism.\" I am an autistic person. Why does this distinction matter to me? 1) Saying \"person with autism\" suggests that the autism can be separated from the person.  But this is not the case....2) Saying \"person with autism\" suggests that even if autism is part of the person, it isn't a very important part.  Characteristics that are recognized as central to a person's identity are appropriately stated as adjectives, and may even be used as nouns to describe people: We talk about \"male\" and \"female\" people, and even about \"men\" and \"women\" and \"boys\" and \"girls,\" not about \"people with maleness\" and \"people with femaleness\"...3) Saying \"person with autism\" suggests that autism is something bad--so bad that is isn't even consistent with being a person.... I am autistic because I accept and value myself the way I am.The piece is not long, and is well worth taking the couple of minutes to read in full.However -- my sense is that there is at least some disagreement in the autism self-advocacy community about this.  Some prefer the term \"autist\" rather than \"autistic person,\" some are fine with person-first language.Personally, I am happy to refer to someone as \"autistic\" if they want to be referred to in that way.  I feel kind of the same way about racial/ethnic labels:  Do you as an individual prefer me to say Hispanic, or Latino, or refer to your country of origin?  I'll do my darndest to keep your personal preference in mind, and also not bring it up if I wouldn't feel the need to specify white / Anglo / Caucasian.  And when I'm talking about more than one person or don't know what an individual prefers, well, I just have to try to go with what currently seems to be one accepted term or another, and figure that a good-faith effort is fine.With Joy, I have no idea what she's going to prefer.  I've got to believe that she'll be able to tell me someday.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iidd.wisc.edu/", "http://www.iidd.wisc.edu/", "http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:qah279AbzAEJ:www.stc.org/edu/50thConf/dataShow.asp%3FID%3D158&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us", "http://www.cafemom.com/journals/read/436505/Why_I_dislike_quot_person_first_quot_language_by_Jim_Sinclair"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/09/another-arena-for-inclusion.html", "title": "\nAnother Arena for Inclusion\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, September 19, 2009", "body": "\nWe've had a couple of neat things with Joy lately.We've been hearing a lot of \"uh-oh\" again.  Last night I was up for a while during the wee small hours, and heard Joy speak a big loud \"UH-OH\" from her bed, followed by a manic giggle.  And then silence...There are a lot more attempts and variations with the \"more\" sign recently.  One particularly charming variation is to grab the hands of whatever adult is torturing is working with her at the moment, and bring that person's hands together to make the sign.Joy loves to stim on hair-combs, and now that she's got enough hair to actually comb again, we've been trying to get her to actually use the comb a little bit.  And, wonder of wonders, she's actually occasionally bringing the comb to her head and swiping a bit, with encouragement!Joy is five years and four months old.=========Joy's seven-year-old sister Rose was saying \"uh-oh\" at 8 months.She was starting to use the \"more\" sign at 10 months.And there was a startling moment at 10 months where I, on a whim and not having tried to teach her at all, handed Rose a hairbrush and asked her, \"What do we do with this?\"  She responded by bringing it to her hair.  I was amazed at how she'd simply picked that up... amazed at the course of human development... amazed that I'd not had to explicitly teach her at all.Such a different trajectory.  It's almost like there's no comparison.=========As if it's helpful to compare.  I don't do it all that often.  We haven't been forced into it lately by any of those assessments that slap a time frame (\"operating at the level of an X-month-old\") onto Joy's achievements, or lack thereof.  I try to blog \"in the moment.\"  If I'd cut off this post before the \"she's five years and four months old\" line, it would fit that framework nicely.I'm learning about developmental screening tools now, though.  And getting a bit of review of \"typical\" development.  And how our kids get put into the boxes that get them the help they need, by getting compared against the norm as best the experts know it.Also, it's not fair to Rose to try to forget about her achievements and how we rejoiced in all the things she could do, so early, so very early on.It's a balancing act, spinning plates aside.  How does one get to \"beyond compare\"?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/09/beyond-compare.html", "title": "\nBeyond Compare\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 21, 2009", "body": "\nThink for a moment about what it's like when you move to a new neighborhood.When you move in, you're the new ones on the block.  As far as you know at the moment, everyone else has been there... forever.Then of course as you get acquainted, you discover that the retired couple over here have been in their house 40 years, this family over there came ten years ago, that house over there has turned over three times in six years, etc.  It was fun for us to eventually learn that our home is built on land that used to be an orchard!I've been feeling a little bit that way about coming into the disabilities-support system.  For anyone coming in new, Birth-to-Three is simply there, free appropriate public education is a right not an innovation, etc.But, as Barbara wrote in the comments on my last post,We are less than a generation away from closeting children who were recognized early as different to an attitude where the threshold of good parenting is activism.It was almost as if she'd been in the LEND seminar presentation this past Friday... We had three speakers.  The first, a social worker, has a younger brother with Down Syndrome born in 1959.  The second, a nurse, is guardian to a man with multiple disabilities who is (I think) about my age.  The third, a family support staffer, has a daughter with Down Syndrome born in 1988.When the social worker's brother was born, the latest child in a large Chicago family, moms stayed in the hospital for a week or more after the birth.  This mom came home as usual a week later, but the baby didn't -- they were keeping him to \"help\" mom accept the \"inevitable\" outcome that baby would be institutionalized his whole life.  Mom & Dad eventually said NO and brought him home, and later went on to help found the Mongoloid Development Council, which eventually became the National Association for Down Syndrome.  Public school education was almost unthinkable; his good fortune was in his parents, and that the recently-elected President Kennedy had some energy and vision around disabilities on account of his sister Rosemary.  He eventually got his education at a new Kennedy school in Chicago, though it did mean living away from home.The nurse entered the life of the man to whom she serves as guardian when he was 22. For much of the first half of his life he lived in an institution, and in foster care.  He did not overlap much with P.L. 94-142, the legislation that first mandated public education for people with disabilities (regulations went on the books in 1977, to be implemented by 1980); however, he did catch the wave of the Medicaid waivers that allowed for long-term care supports in the community, such that though he needs round-the-clock care, he lives in an attractive house next to a park, together with three other men who need a similar level of assistance.  He has an impressive array of supports, from job coach to transportation to the continuous onsite care.The family-support staffer gave birth to her daughter in 1988, the middle child of 3, who was diagnosed with Down Syndrome within a day.  Within weeks, they had Early Intervention on their doorstep!  That early-childhood support was invaluable, and public education was available as well; however, it was assumed that she would go to a separate school.  There was a procedure in place, though seldom used, to get a child \"mainstreamed\" in the regular school: you had to get the teacher to agree, and that's what they set out to do.  The woman who agreed to be this girl's kindergarten teacher had such a wonderful experience with her that she moved up to teaching first grade the next year to accompany her student, and then went back for more schooling to become a special educator!  The young lady graduated from high school at 21, and has a job at a local brew-pub. However, she still lives at home, though she would surely be capable of living in the community with the right supports; as she transitioned into adult services in 2007, she got a letter informing the family that the waiting list for \"residential placement\" was ten years.  (Gulp.)Lots of change.  Lots of activism, parental and otherwise.Lots of work yet to do.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.therextras.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/09/much-has-changed.html", "title": "\nMuch Has Changed\n"},

Last year we had a fine success with this annual tent-camping event, Joy's first overnight campout beyond our yard.  We did another successful backyard campout on Labor Day weekend, but ended up deciding not to take the tent out this Saturday.  JoyDad was feeling under the weather, and for a while I thought I might be taking the girls for the evening on my own.Fortunately, though, he perked up enough to make the trek to the campground after Joy's afternoon therapy, so the whole family could take part in picnic potluck and campfire conviviality.Joy sat well at the unfamiliar picnic table and ate, per usual, a wider variety of goodies than her sister did.  For entertainment afterward, she found a plastic band from a firewood bundle that she held onto almost all evening, a fine distraction from the fall leaves on the ground that might otherwise have consumed her attention (and that she might have attempted to consume herself in greater numbers than she did!)  I spent a nice chunk of time blowing bubbles for her as the dusk was falling, and then when it got too dark to see bubbles, we moved over to the campfire.Our congregation is big on singing, with four-part a cappella hymns a regular feature of our worship.  This translates to lots of lovely harmony on the folksongs around the campfire as well.  JoyDad always brings along his guitar to these events; sometimes one or two other people will bring guitars as well, but this year there were three other guitars, two banjos, a ukelele, and a bunch of copies of the folk-song compilation Rise Up Singing.So at one point between songs, JoyDad inserts a query as to whether there's anything by Elvis in that thar songbook.  And our local Elvis impersonator (what, doesn't every congregation have a local Elvis impersonator?) asks JoyDad does he know the opening lick to \"Suspicious Minds.\"  And JoyDad, who knows that song forward & backward, swings into the opening bars without a pause.  Someone shines a flashlight-spot on our Elvis dude, and we get the entire song, all the moves and facial expressions and rich Elvis voice -- the whole deal.  Yours truly, with Joy on my lap, was able to chime in with some of the other gals on the back-up vocals... it was quite the highlight of the evening.

{"date": "Saturday, September 26, 2009", "body": "\nAnother seminar-Friday has gone by for the LEND program, so of course my brain is full once more.One of yesterday's seminar topics involved delivering developmental screening results to parents, when the screen had turned up some areas of concern that needed a more thorough assessment.The angle that was echoing in my mind:What if that screen were an autism screen, and the family's image of autism had been informed by THIS:This celebrity-directed video (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban fame) was released by Autism Speaks on September 22, in an attempt to raise autism awareness.  As Autism Speaks co-founder Suzanne Wright put it, \"We will all help shine a bright spotlight on autism.\"I find nothing bright about this video.  It portrays autism, as exemplified in images of people (mostly children) with autism, as a relentless monster that will inevitably destroy the lives of the families of those in its clutches, unless those families devote every waking moment to its defeat.A sample from the transcript: I am autism. I'm visible in your children, but if I can help it, I am invisible to you until it's too late...I work very quickly. I work faster than pediatric AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. And if you are happily married, I will make sure that your marriage fails. Your money will fall into my hands, and I will bankrupt you for my own self-gain. I don't sleep, so I make sure you don't either. I will make it virtually impossible for your family to easily attend a temple, a birthday party, a public park, without a struggle, without embarrassment, without pain... I derive great pleasure out of your loneliness. I will fight to take away your hope. I will plot to rob you of your children and your dreams. I will make sure that every day you wake up, you will cry, wondering 'who will take care of my child after I die?' And the truth is, I am still winning, and you are scared, and you should be. I am autism. You ignored me. That was a mistake.The second half of the video portrays families surrounding their children and vowing to defeat autism, for example, \"We will spend every waking hour trying to weaken you.\"I know that this reflects the feelings of a sizeable group of parents.Let me say very clearly (in case you don't already know something of us and our experiences with Joy):We do not live in this fearful, desperate frame.  And we do not believe that this is all there is to look forward to!Joy's challenges are substantial enough that we could have chosen a path of fear and anger and blame.  She does not speak.  She is not toilet-trained, and would play with her feces if we did not keep her wearing onesies.  She does a lot of protesting these days, and grabbing, and throwing.  She needs a constant watchful eye.But.Our marriage is strong.  We have the money we need, though we have never been wealthy and times are of course tight.  We generally get the sleep we need too.  We laugh much, much more than we cry.  Joy goes to daycare, to church, to the zoo, to restaurants, camping, swimming, and much much more.And meanwhile, she is learning, growing, smiling, kissing, and enriching our lives so very, very much.We enable this richness through our choice of frame, our choice of how we will view Joy and her uniqueness and her strengths as well as her challenges.How much harder it would be to make the positive choice if all we heard were the messages of the tenor of the \"I Am Autism\" video!One of the suggestions that was conveyed during the seminar presentation, for all the future leaders in developmental disabiities who were present, was this (not an exact quote but the basic idea):Remind parents, whether you're delivering a concerning screening result or talking about an actual diagnosis, that their child is still the same person that he or she was yesterday.  All the things you love about your child, everything that was wonderful about your child yesterday, is still true today.I'll leave you with a link to a different recently-published resource, this one from the Natural Supports Project that I blogged about earlier.It's a booklet published at the beginning of 2009, called The CORE of a Good Life: Guided Conversations with Parents on Raising Young Children with Disabilities. The link goes to a page about natural supports in early childhood, where you can find a futher link to the actual 62-page PDF document (which is over 33Mb in size, just so ya know).  It's aimed at both providers and parents, to guide conversations that explore what is important to families around ordinary experiences and relationships, beyond therapy and treatments. The approach is designed across developmental disabilities.CORE stands for:- Community connections and participation- Opportunities to explore and pursue our interests- Reciprocity in our relationships- Enjoyment in our livesHere's how the guide starts:We begin here, in the early years, to empower parents to create a vision for their child's life and explore opportunities in the community that begin to build that vision.The strategy is called Guided Conversations, described in the book thusly:Guided Conversations are an invitation to think about;- How to talk about children and influence how others perceive them;- How parents identify the ordinary experiences of being a family; and- How parents sort through the relationships that may be available to them and their child that they have not yet considered.How to talk about our children and influence how others perceive them.I submit that the proper use of the Autism Speaks video is as Exhibit A about how NOT to talk about our children.  'Nuff said.  Let's move forward.And the next move in this household is that we have to make a grocery list so we can take our daughters shopping, and then if the weather holds, get ourselves organized for the church campout tonight.  Yes, that would include Joy.

Today the bright leaves have a clear blue sky for a backdrop, with crisp fall temperatures.Joy and I walked Rose to school and then kept going, with me pushing her jogging-stroller along paths of a nature conservancy across from the school.  We saw a hawk, a downy woodpecker, and two different groups of wild turkeys.Joy kept her mittens on purt-near the whole walk.  It took some intentional distracting on my part, though.  Mitten-removal has become a giggly game, to be embarked upon for the adult reaction.  It will be less funny when the temps drop into the teens and beyond...It felt like the teens on Saturday morning as I huddled in my camp chair along with the other chilled parents on the sidelines of Rose's soccer game.  I didn't dress her warmly enough for SNOW FLURRIES either.  Was half expecting a mutiny, but she kept playing.  What a trooper.Ordinarily I'd've sent JoyDad to the game, but I wanted the leverage to send him on a computer-buying mission (better him than me).  Given the virus-munched state of our old (and yes, it's really quite old) computer, we really wanted to walk out of a store with a new desktop that we could set up right then.  Except that Windows 7 is coming out October 22.  So stores have no computers in stock, because they don't want to be stuck with a single CPU with the icky Vista operating system which NOBODY will buy once Windows 7 is out.  Fortunately JoyDad ran into a friend in one of the stores who was willing to loan us a laptop.The virus-munched computer is supposedly ready to bring home from the computer hospital today.  Now watch, we'll all catch H1N1 because some unfortunate sick tech coughed and sneezed all over it...Speaking of sneezing, a weird thing happened on the bus yesterday morning.  I sit down, pull out my notebook, some gal (student probably) comes and sits next to me.  And I start sneezing.  Once, twice.  Sniffle, grasp for tissues.  Three, four, five.  Nose and eyes both start running.  Big ol' nose-blow.  Six, seven.  I don't dare make eye-contact with my seat-mate, but she's obviously starting to shift around and get uncomfortable.  Eight, nine.  Sniffle, snork.  The bus slows at the next stop, she bolts out of the seat and flees to sit elsewhere.  And... the sneezing stops.  Apparently I am deathly allergic to certain fellow passengers.

{"date": "Thursday, October 22, 2009", "body": "\nYou heard it here first!  :-)I haven't talked about potty issues much lately because there's been nothing to report.  (Unlike various fellow-bloggers who seem to be on a gas-passing roll lately...) At age five-and-a-half, Joy's still in MA-funded diapers, and though she's had several little strings of potty-pee successes over the past few years, basically there's been little movement on the whole toilet-training issue here (heh, heh -- \"movement\"!) For what seems like forever, I've been sitting Joy on the toilet, with a seat-insert so she can balance more easily, before evening bath.  She's been fairly willing to sit on the pot and play with a board book together for a couple of minutes, but rarely produces.Something interesting has been happening lately, though.  In the past week or so, she's been waking up dry in the morning, more often than not.  We've also been seeing some incredible diaper-leaks during the day, veritable waterfalls.I think she's learning to \"hold it.\"  I think she probably also likes the sensation of \"holding it,\" little sensory-seeker that she is.Tuesday morning she woke dry, I tried a toilet attempt but she let loose between diaper-removal and actually getting onto the pot.  Wednesday morning she woke dry, we tried the potty thing, she sat for a while without producing and we put the diaper back on (still hadn't peed by the time we got to daycare).  This morning she woke dry, sat on the pot for a while, and then let the waterfall commence appropriately!!  Woohoo!!!So now what?I've been rather avoiding the whole toilet-training issue, seeing as how life has been plenty full on its own.  The Google results on autism & toilet training are pretty depressing, all sorts of stuff about spending hours and hours in the bathroom (like Joy would be willing, let alone me having that time to spend in the first place), or ABA incrementalism regarding \"first you get your child to be willing to go through the bathroom door, then s/he needs to be able to remain in the bathroom for five seconds...\" etc., which is obviously not where we are.There have been several obstacles to toilet training as far as Joy is concerned.  First is that she's not much of an imitator, so having a potty-competent big sister isn't all that helpful.  Second is that she doesn't seem particularly aware of having a full diaper, either wet or messy (probably likes the sensation, if anything.)  A big third thing is her communication delays.Is there any chance that if we view this pee-holding as a new threshold of maturity, and push fluids and take her to toilet-sit fairly often to increase chance of success... that we'd actually end up with a potty-training trajectory?  Or should we just add the morning potty-sit to the bathtime potty-sit rather than making a big push right now (heh, heh -- \"push!\")?  Or do we need to plan for some fancy autism-specific training regimen?Thoughts, dear been-there-done-that readers?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/2009/10/21/excuse-me-the-heathen-version/", "http://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/excuse-me/", "http://mamaedge.blogspot.com/2009/10/flatulent-poetry-or-how-i-learned-to.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/10/leaked.html", "title": "\nLeaked!\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 20, 2009", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis Sightings===========Apologies in advance to my regular readers for yet another policy-wonk, Wisconsin-specific post.But, this is information that needs to get out there.  I'll do a very sketchy first pass at it, and at a later date I will link to the consumer fact-sheets that the Autism Society of Wisconsin (ASW) and other organizations are now feverishly developing.[NOTE: If you have any specific questions that you would like the factsheet/FAQs to address, please let me know in the comments.  I have an \"in\" with one of the movers-and-shakers who is working on the FAQs, and I've been asked to pass your questions along!]So, here's the deal.  The legislation that passed in the Wisconsin State Budget in June 2009, requiring insurers to cover autism treatment, was just the first step.  The second step is that the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) for the state had to hammer out the corresponding changes to the insurance rules, on a short timeline.  To make this happen, the OCI convened an Autism Working Group, a group of insurance company reps, legislators, advocates, parents, and providers who have been working like crazy since July to define terms for the document that spells out what insurance companies do and don't need to do.That document is now published, at http://www.oci.wi.gov/rules/0336em09.pdf (note that it opens a PDF document).The press release announcing the document is at http://www.oci.wi.gov/pressrel/1009autism.htm.The document is what is known as an \"emergency rule.\"  This means that, while it goes into effect immediately due to time constraints, and in this case is good for one year, an ongoing process has yet to take place that involves hearings (at the OCI and likely also before the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules) and a legislative process and further opportunities to monkey with the document before it becomes permanently enshrined in the rules.However, until that long drawn-out administrative rule finalization process happens, the emergency rule applies, for at least a year.The emergency rule takes effect November 1, and will start affecting actual insurance coverage whenever the insurer's next new plan-year begins after that date.  For many insurers, that new plan-year will begin January 1, 2010 -- so that is when coverage would actually start.Here are a few highlights (note that this is my own reading, backed by additional conversations with people involved in the process -- but I am no expert.  The upcoming FAQ from the ASW & friends will be much more authoritative):Wisconsin's Medicaid Waiver program (which is how Joy currently gets her treatment) was the basis from which the Autism Working Group began their deliberations -- the insurance coverage is meant to be reasonably similar on the whole to what people are getting through the waiver right now, though there are plenty of differences, both good and not-so-good.The group did not spell out which specific treatments have to be covered, though behavioral principles are a necessary component. Instead, they hammered out a set of requirements as to what level of published evidence qualifies a treatment to be \"evidence-based\" for purposes of the rule.  The introduction to the document states that this was done such that ongoing research can be taken into account without needing to change the rule.  My understanding from outside conversations is that the evidence-requirements were crafted with the intent to include the treatments that are being covered by the waiver program right now.Insurers will be required to cover up to FOUR years of intensive-level autism treatment (to the tune of $50,000 per year as stated in the legislation), as opposed to the up-to-three years covered by the waiver program.  However, any intensive-level service that has already happened when insurance coverage starts, whether under the waiver or out-of-pocket, counts toward those four years.(update to original post) As stated in the legislation, insurers are also required to cover what they're calling \"post-intensive\" treatment to the tune of $25,000 per year.  This is autism-related treatment for people of any age.  Since I am not as familiar with post-intensive services under the waiver, I can't make a good comparison -- but I think that the post-intensive waiver coverage is somehow time-limited (certain ages? certain number of years?) and the post-intensive insurance coverage, as I understand it, is not.Those who have been reading Elvis Sightings for a while may remember my ranting and advocacy around the waiver program's [in-my-view-unreasonable] insistence on having all therapy take place in the home (as opposed to including other natural settings).  Good news -- the language in the new rule only requires a majority of the treatment to take place when a parent is present, and that it should be \"provided in an environment most conducive to achieving the goals of the insured\u2019s treatment plan.\"  Can you say, \"Joy's awesome daycare at Lynda's place\"?  Sure, I knew you could!  Woo hoo!Another change from the waiver program, this one not so fortunate: under this rule, insurers are not required to cover therapists' travel-time.  I do not know how this will work out in practice; some service-provider agencies may choose to \"eat\" this cost in order to continue to be able to hire therapists...While there is not a list of specifically included therapies, there is a specific list of exclusions.  Among the therapies NOT covered: acupuncture, hippotherapy, auditory integration therapy, chelation, cranial sacral therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  (See the rule document for a complete list.)Well, that's a few highlights from my perspective.There are many questions yet to be answered, and most caseworkers and providers and insurers haven't got these answers just yet... will my particular insurer cover my particular therapy provider?  How does my Katie Beckett (non-waiver) medical assistance coverage play in?  Does our family still keep our county caseworker if the waiver was where that relationship started?  What about co-pays & deductibles?  Et cetera. We just don't know yet.  But the answers will have to be worked out soon.Joy's particular service provider (\"Agency 2\") has recommended that current waiver-based clients with insurance contact their insurers.  Our plan is to make that contact and ask the insurer the question: how can we proceed in order to avoid any kind of gap in treatment coverage?Stay tuned.(P.S. My thanks to JoyDad for helping me sort out the administrative rule-making process!)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://oci.wi.gov/advcoun/autism.htm", "http://www.oci.wi.gov/rules/0336em09.pdf", "http://www.oci.wi.gov/pressrel/1009autism.htm", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/W3ASP/CommPages/IndividualCommittee.aspx?committee=Administrative+Rules&house=Joint", "http://www.oci.wi.gov/rules/0336em09.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/10/wisconsin-autism-insurance-rule.html", "title": "\nWisconsin Autism Insurance Rule Published\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 30, 2009", "body": "\nYou're always doing something,said seven-year-old Rose to me yesterday morning.(She was home from school due to teacher's-union conference; I was home because Joy's been under the weather, so it couldn't be a babysitter day.)I'd been swirling around picking up shoes, vacuuming, rinsing dishes, re-allocating piles of paper, my usual morning flurry.  I thought for sure this was a comment on my swirling, and wondered if she thought it was a good thing or not.\"What do you mean, honey?\" I asked.\"Well,\" she replied, \"Even if you're trying not to breathe and stand as still as you can\" -- and she demonstrated -- \"you're still doing something, because you're trying not to breathe and stand as still as you can.\"She's right.  No matter whether you're in full swirl mode, or laid back as can be, you're always doing something!So, here's a little bit of what we've been doing the past few days.As I mentioned, Joy has been sick.  There was a fever going around the daycare the other week, and we thought she'd escaped, but it seemed to hit her later and longer than the other kids.  I was all edgy about H1N1 because she's on the fragile side as far as the co-morbid conditions that seem to go along with the swine flu doing its worst, and she hasn't had the vaccine yet (she's got an appointment today!)  But it was just the fever, none of the awful cough and other stuff.  She was considerably perked up yesterday and I think we'll have a pretty normal day today.Speaking of doctor's appointments, I did take her in on Wednesday when the fever seemed to be lasting longer than it had for the other kids, for an ear and throat check since she can't really tell us when those are hurting, plus her pain tolerance is so high.  When I got in the car to make the half-hour drive across town, it started making a roar like a Harley.  (OK, I know the Harley roar is so distinctive it's patented.  But a Honda CR-V isn't supposed to sound even close to a Harley.)  The muffler had gone out.  So I had to drag Mike home from work to take that car in, and provide me with the other car.  Arghh.I did get to take advantage of a beautiful fall day on Tuesday to put Joy in the stroller and take a run, though.  Ordinarily I can't do that because I'm home with her while she's got therapy, but there's no therapy when she's got a fever!  The weather has swung between gorgeous and cold-n-rainy, and the leaves have gone from full-peak to mostly-on-the-ground this week.  Halloween should be fair and chilly.  The girls are going to be black and white Dutch bunnies, as specified by Rose.  It did involve some homemade fleece hats with bunny ears made of pipe-cleaner and felt, and I taught Rose how to make pompoms out of yarn so we could have the tails exactly the right size and color.  Like I have time for all that! but Rose was very appreciative.  Now I just hope that Joy will keep her hat on when we go door to door!Here is a little bit of autumn eye-candy, taken from our windows front and back.Here's our burning bush and spirea out the front.We think this is a Cooper's hawk.  Rose had a great view of it from her bedroom window; it sat on the feeder for a long time, which gave us lots of chance to pore over the possibilities in the bird-book.Time for me to go do my next somethings of the day.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SurJLXaInXI/AAAAAAAAAY4/goMxyEC6AQ4/s1600-h/fall-bushes.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SurJbcXnimI/AAAAAAAAAZA/ztN-t8xVW9c/s1600-h/fall-hawk.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/10/youre-always-doing-something.html", "title": "\nYou're Always Doing Something\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 26, 2009", "body": "\nI've got a brain-full again, with this LEND program stuff.  And a schedule-full.  Friday was the busy-est day I've had in a long time. Clinic observation, lunch conversation, interdisciplinary team meeting, lecture on ASDs, autism self-advocate/parent panel, trainee meeting for those of us with a special autism focus, an hour home for supper, then a glorious evening of Boggle-playing.Spin, spin, spin!  And almost every part of it (well, except slurping down the supper) was reflection-worthy.But I'm only going to blog about the panel.  Four speakers, a 30-something-year-old man who has autism, his mom, his support broker, and another mom of 4 kids with the youngest two on the spectrum.The star speaker was a fascinating guy.  He has a university bachelor's degree in mathematics (!), his own apartment, and a patchwork of 3 jobs (not all paid.)  He and his mom and support broker make up a formidable team!  He read his speech in not quite a monotone, but less inflected than most folks would do.  There were definitely intentional laugh-lines in there though: \"The last thing my parents expected was to see me on the speaking circuit, but here I am!\"  One thing that struck me personally was when he described how he used to take his mom's hand and throw it at the cookie-jar.  He said he did that because the hand was what gave him cookies.  It didn't occur to him that it made a difference that the hand had a mom attached.  Yikes -- Joy has been doing that hand-flinging thing with us, especially at the dinner table if she sees something she wants that's not on her plate.For all his mathematical brilliance, and his amazing origami creations, and the stunning fractal art he creates on his computer, he doesn't have an easy time of it.  He described it as literally painful for him to make eye contact, which in and of itself is a pretty major social barrier.  He has various sensory sensitivities that take constant energy to deal with.  He has a hard time with ambiguities or changes in plan -- we saw it happen when his cell phone rang during his speech, and he temporarily froze.  I don't know what would have happened next if his mom had not been there to calmly advise him to turn off the phone and make sure he followed through. His mom is a practiced speaker as well, a devoted advocate, and kept throwing out one zinger after another.  \"There's what, 40 students in this room?  At least four of you will probably have a child with a disability.  You just don't know who you are yet.\"Her perspective on the role she & the staff play for her son is that he outsources the administrative work to them.  Like the deadly paperwork.  Like, for instance, when his father retired, which caused him to have to accept a slightly different flavor of Social Security, which put his income just slightly over the limit allowed by his medical assistance...The other mom was a disability rights activist and LEND graduate, very likeable and engaging speaker.  What I'm chewing over from her presentation was her announcement that she has a \"secret doctor\" for her spectrum children.  \"The primary care doctor that we see is... how can I say this... rigid.\"  Rigid, in this case, meant that the doctor wouldn't prescribe hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT).  HBOT is an \"alternative\" therapy, not FDA approved for autism treatment -- here's what one of my favorite skeptics, Prometheus at A Photon in the Darkness, has to say about HBOT.  Anyway, this mom takes her kids down to Florida to be treated by a doctor who has kids on the spectrum himself and practices HBOT.  So the 130 HBOT treatments that the one son has had, she feels are a great investment, but they're a secret from his regular doctor.Oh-my-goodness.  In other words, her kids' PCP is missing important information about a huge treatment component.  Her story really caught me by surprise.  I'm aware, of course, of parents who switch doctors when they decide they want to do alternative treatments and the first physician doesn't approve.  This \"secret doctor\" situation hadn't occurred to me though.I have to confess that a big part of my empathy goes with the physician, with what little I know about this particular story.  What's a medical provider to do?  How to stick to one's medical principles, and advise people against treatments that the science & your expertise & training tells you are worthless at best and dangerous at worst, without being so \"rigid\" that your patients end up going behind your back?  Is it better that this \"rigid\" doctor keeps seeing the kids without knowing the full story, or would it be better for mom to just go ahead and switch, to seek primary care with someone who supports the treatments of her choice?  How often does this happen, I wonder, that parents keep one foot in each world and the Western/allopathic/evidence-based doc doesn't know what's happening with the patient's alternative treatments?  (Have you done it yourself, if you're still with me after this paragraph?  If so, how does that fit for you?)The most chilling words from the panel, though, came from the support broker.  \"People ask me when to start preparing for the transition to adult services -- and I say, 'At birth' and I'm only partly kidding.\"  We'd heard last month about the waiting list for housing support in the community from a family panel of LEND faculty.  This woman put it even more starkly: \"People are not getting off that waiting list until their parents DIE.  And then the system goes into crisis mode, and finds something for them, that might not be the best thing...\"The thought about preparing for adult services transition during childhood -- kinda makes me want to curl up in the fetal position and stick my fingers into my ears.  Joy's FIVE, fer cryin' out loud.  We have no idea who she'll be at age 21 and beyond, and what she'll be capable of.  And it's not like we don't have plenty of plates in the air already.  And it's not like the service structure might not be totally different in a decade and a half.  But the support-broker lady did make an interesting comment about the utility of the forward-looking perspective: \"Instead of teaching them a busy-box, teach them a tape-recorder.\"  Hmm.The mathematician's mom chimed in too, saying that her rule of thumb was to start exploring services five years before they were needed.  This led her to the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) when her son was 15 or so.  The guy at the DVR was a little incredulous - \"We can't do anything for him at this age!  Come back again when it's time.\"  But then she asked him what he would do if it were his child.  And he said that he'd emphasize putting together a resume as early as possible.  Keep track of anything that could possibly be construed as any kind of work experience whatsoever, and get it documented early.  And that, she found, was a huge help.The whole realm of thinking about adult services seems to be coming at me from several angles this past week or two.  The new issue of Autism Advocate from the Autism Society of America focuses on adult services.  And the social work class on developmental disabilities that's part of my LEND experience is in the middle of a unit on adult services too.One frustrating thing about the online social work lectures is that the lectures were recorded over a span of years, and it's not clear how old each one is.  I think some may be almost 10 years old, and the others just a couple of years.  It serves well for the history of services in Wisconsin, but not so much with the cutting-edge state of affairs.There are some major success stories around the history of services for people with developmental disabilities.  One lecturer said that back in the 1930s, when institutionalization was THE option, life expectancies were down around 19 years (he didn't qualify that with who exactly \"counted\" as being in that group).  Basically, hardly anyone in that group outlived their parents. By the 1970s, it had shot up to 59; more recently, it's more like 66!A parallel success story is that starting in 1980s in Wisconsin, people started being moved from the institutions into the community, with the support & dollars following them.  The lectures are full of examples from this effort, and we also heard about one such fellow from his guardian in the previous family panel seminar.  If I'm understanding it correctly, that movement continues, and I've heard rumor that one of the three major Wisconsin institutions is slated to actually close its doors at some point in the foreseeable future!But then there's also the parallel victims-of-their-own-success stories (depending on how you look at it!)  All these kids who have been able to grow up well-supported at home, with services from Birth to Three and the schools... living plenty long enough to go out on their own, if only the supports were there!  Instead, though, we've got the waiting lists.  A less hopeful statistic from another of the lectures claimed that only 12-15% of people with intellectual disabilities ever live outside the family home...My brain is full.  And there are soooo many things to work on for the future!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=131", "http://www.iidd.wisc.edu/?q=node/26"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/10/future-musings.html", "title": "\nFuture Musings\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 2, 2009", "body": "\nAnother week, another amazing LEND opportunity!The center that hosts \"my\" LEND program has an ongoing brown-bag research-seminar series where distinguished researchers come in for one-hour presentations on their ongoing work.  One of the LEND assignments involves attending one of these presentations each semester and reporting back.  My interdisciplinary team (with an autism focus) chose to attend last Friday's presentation: \u201cGene x Environment Interactions Contributing to Autism:  Lessons Learned from the UC-Davis Center for Children\u2019s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention,\u201d presented by Dr. Isaac Pessah.Little did I know when we signed up at the beginning of the semester to attend this talk, that Dr. Pessah would be discussing an article that would go online as a pre-pub just a week and a half before, and already be getting the blogospheric once-over right before we got to hear him in person!The article in question is Blood Mercury Concentrations in CHARGE Study Children with and without Autism.  The authors are Irva Hertz-Picciotto, Peter G. Green, Lora Delwiche, Robin Hansen, Cheryl Walker, and Isaac N. Pessah; and the sponsoring institution is the MIND Institute of UC-Davis.Quick detour about the MIND Institute -- this is an organization whose co-founders were parents of children with autism, searching for a cure and ready to lay the blame with vaccines.  (See All Things Considered transcript from Jan. 20, 2003).  Since its inception, the MIND Institute has focused on environmental considerations in autism.  They operate from the position that the rise in autism prevalence can not be entirely accounted for by changing definitions, diagnostic substitution, and increased awareness/education.Given that background, it's not at all surprising to see a study comparing mercury concentrations in the blood of children with and without autism.The conclusions might not be expected, though.Conclusions: After accounting for dietary and other differences in Hg exposures, total Hg in blood was neither elevated nor reduced in CHARGE Study preschoolers with AU/ASD as compared with unaffected controls, and resembled those of nationally representative samples.They used a substantial sample of preschoolers on the autism spectrum, plus two control groups: one group with non-autism developmental disabilities, and one typically-developing group.  They interviewed mothers to determine household and medical and dietary exposures to mercury.It turned out that the biggest contributor to blood mercury levels in all groups was fish consumption.  Once you account for fish consumption, there were no significant differences in blood mercury levels between groups.  In fact, before controlling for fish consumption, the blood mercury levels for the autism group were actually lower than the other groups.  Because the ASD kiddos ate less fish!!Sullivan over at LeftBrain/RightBrain does a fine parsing of the study and the various online reactions to it.  I won't try to re-do a job that's been already well-done!For me, it's rather a thrill to be hearing first-hand, right from the mouth of one of the actual study authors, that the ASD kiddos had similar blood-mercury levels, and any differences were pretty much all about the fish.  Now, this doesn't say anything directly about mercury and autism causation.  The authors are very straightforward about that.  Still it's another useful counterweight to what has become an insidious public perception.  It's not the thimerosal, folks!!P.S.  You may have noticed that the title of Dr. Pessah's talk was about genes & environment.  He also addressed a second paper, not yet publicly available, that delved deeper into genetic complexity than my poor notes were able to keep straight in the absence of being able to refer to the actual PowerPoint slides!  When the paper actually comes out, I might take a whack at it.  Or it still might turn out to be pretty much beyond my ken.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2009/0900736/abstract.html", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=922834", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3360"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/11/direct-from-researcher.html", "title": "\nDirect from the Researcher\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, November 14, 2009", "body": "\nHad another amazing seminar day in my LEND program yesterday.  One of the (many) components of the course is policy advocacy, and that was yesterday's theme.We were privileged to have a panel composed of a parent activist who's been involved in many organizations and policy campaigns on behalf of children with special needs; the executive director of the state's disability rights organization; and a state senator who co-chairs one of the most powerful committees in the state capitol, the Joint Finance Committee.Together the three of them told an ongoing story of a decade-long effort on behalf of children with disabilities in Wisconsin, who sit for years on waiting lists to get Medicaid-waiver funding for support in their homes.  Autism, with its high-profile political status and recent insurance mandate win, has rather jumped to the head of the line in this state; rather than playing one disability off another, they are using it as an example.  Kids with autism shouldn't have to wait for support and treatment; neither should any other child with a disability!In context of this ongoing struggle, where there have been lots of roadblocks and setbacks, they told a remarkable Wisconsin civil-rights story.  The star of the story is a woman named Vel Phillips.Vel Phillips was the first black woman to graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison law school.  She then became the first black woman to get elected as an alder on the Milwaukee city council, in 1956.  One of her first acts as \"Madame Alderman\" was to propose a fair housing law, to prohibit \"red-lining,\" the practice of refusing to sell homes in certain neighborhoods on the basis of race.  The measure went immediately down to defeat, 15-1.The rules on the council, the panelist told us, was that you couldn't re-introduce a measure for 90 days.  Guess what -- 90 days later, she re-introduced that measure.  And again, down to defeat, 15-1.She did this over and over.  Her friends started chiding her about it.  This is ridiculous, you know, they said.  You're not going to get anywhere with this.  She heard their objections, but did not heed them.  She continued right on doing what she'd been doing.After a while, some of the aldermen (remember that everyone else on the council were white men) started coming to her privately and apologizing for their repeated \"No\" votes.  I know you're right, they began to say.  But my constituency is just not going to back me on this.Vel went back to her friends and told them, They're apologizing to me!  We're making progress!And that's where the panelist quoted Vel Phillips' dictum:  Every NO is one step closer to a YES.Well, the years began to pass, some members on the council turned over, the civil rights movement was brewing nationwide, and Madame Alderman started to get a few votes each time she brought the measure forward.It took six years.  But finally a majority came through, both locally and nationally.  And, as the panelist told it, the night of that Milwaukee vote, there was a huge crowd awaiting Vel Phillips outside the city building.  And they took this petite powerhouse of a woman on their shoulders, and \"they marched all night through the red-lined neighborhoods of Milwaukee, where they had never been allowed to buy a home before.\"This was the one point in the entire panel presentation, for all its riches, that tears sprang to my eyes.  It wasn't getting to ask a direct question of the senator, as fine a privilege as that was, nor was it getting to meet him and shake his hand and exchange a few words afterwards.  It was the story.Two takeaways.Every NO is one step closer to a YES.And, stories have power.  We have to tell our stories to the people who make things happen.  Our stories are crucial in turning NO into YES.  Together, we can move policy mountains.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/phillips/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/11/every-no-is-one-step-closer-to-yes.html", "title": "\n\"Every NO is One Step Closer to a YES\"\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2009", "body": "\nAnyone for some positive stories?We've heard so few words from Joy, for so long -- other than the \"more\" sign, some photo-choice-making on her Go-Talk, and the occasional \"uh-oh\".  But tonight at dessert time, she echoed the word \"cookie,\" clear as clear.  Just once.  JoyDad and I both did a double-take.  And gave her one with chocolate chips.Speaking of the \"more\" sign.  The other day at breakfast, JoyDad came swooping past to distribute kisses to his breakfasting ladies.  Joy giggled at him, and tilted her face up.  And then after receiving her kiss, she signed a great big \"more\"!And still more \"more\" -- today I was home with Joy, and had a few minutes where she was playing in the living room and I sneaked in some plunking on the piano.  I've given up trying to play piano when Rose is around.  I don't know why, but I get great big huge objections to my playing if Rose is within earshot.  So it felt really good today to end a section of the Maple Leaf Rag with a big flourish... only to look up and find Joy grinning at me and signing \"more\"!Some totally cool imitation/initiation -- this morning one of Joy's baristas reported that Joy had snagged a tissue from the box and used it to go after the barista's nose!  She did it again to me later on in the day.  Unfortunately in my case it was with a nasty tissue that was blowing around the playground that she picked up.  But the thought was in the right place.We had a therapy-team meeting last night, where positive stories are always the first agenda item.  Joy bopped around the living room during the meeting, with her Baby Einstein video on repeat-play.  She has never shown much interest in the meetings.  But last night as the meeting was nearing a close, she decided that she wanted in on the action.  She sidled up to Lynda (her Wonder Woman daycare lady) and climbed right up on her lap.  And then she did this marvellous flirty little sequence of turning to make eye contact with Lynda, with a great big ol' grin.  Over and over.Accentuate the positive!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/11/elvis-wants-cookie.html", "title": "\nElvis Wants a Cookie\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 5, 2009", "body": "\nThe fall semester is drawing / barrelling to a close, but I have another LEND tidbit to share -- another video from the online social work class in developmental disabilities.This lecture was presented by Dr. Bill Schwab, a family practitioner and medical faculty member who is highly involved in physician education around disability issues.  His lecture, though perhaps a decade or more old, has stood the test of time and has been one of the best segments in the course so far (and the course is almost done!)  The lecture topic was issues in health care screening and preventative medicine for adults with disabilities.  You can see this hour-long lecture for yourself -- it's free! -- at http://www.iidd.wisc.edu/?q=node/40.  (You only need to watch Units 1-3; Unit 4 is a repeat of Unit 3, for some reason.)The lecture raised issues that I haven't really had to think about yet, with Joy only five years old and all.  But the years will fly by...Dr. Schwab's lecture highlighted the story of \"Jennifer,\" a 30 year old woman with Down Syndrome who became a patient of his.  When she started coming to him, she had never had a gynecological exam or pap smear, and was very clear that she did not want any such thing to happen.  She was in generally good health and had never been sexually active as far as anyone knew or she was willing/able to report.  Dr. Schwab's initial approach, in consultation with Jennifer and the staff who accompanied her, involved a gradual getting-acquainted over a number of appointments, and indeed over the course of two years she became comfortable coming to the office, weighing in, having him listen to her heart and take blood pressure.  She was still, however, not willing to do so much as lie down on the exam table.After two years, she had a staffing change.  The new staff who came in with her were of the opinion that here two years had gone by, the pap test still hadn't happened, it was time to get with the program and see that it got done.Dr. Schwab opened the discussion to the audience:  What possible approaches (right or wrong) might a physician take in this situation?  The audience started firing off suggestions:a more intensive patient-education approachmaybe Jennifer would be more comfortable with a female doctorcontinue rapport-buildingsimply defer the pap test and not pushphysical compulsion (\"make\" her do it)change in settingsedation (could be at various levels, up to general anesthesia)has she been molested in the past? / seek relevant historycreate a reward systemmodify the screening regimenThey could have gone on.Dr. Schwab then made a series of very interesting points, some of which you'll just have to see the lecture to pick up... but here are a few of them.What is the goal for population participation in this screening test among people with intellectual disabilities?  Are you trying to get 100% participation... or are you trying to approach the same participation rate as you get with neurotypical (NT) folks?  Because there are plenty of NT women who choose not to get that screen.  They just never make an appointment for it, or simply decline when asked, and nobody comes to physically compel or sedate them...Among the values the physician has to weigh are the concepts of personal autonomy versus substituted judgment.  With children, NT or otherwise, parents get to make a lot of decisions (no child is going to choose a vaccination or even to go to the doctor at all...)  At the other end of life, if dementia or other incompetency comes in to play, there are procedures in place such that people who know the patient and know of their previously-expressed healthcare wishes can make decisions on their behalf.  So then you have the question: at what level is substituted judgment appropriate with developmentally-delayed or intellectually disabled adults, who may express preferences counter to prevailing medical advice?Part of the conversation around any particular screen has to include the effectiveness of early detection (will it help?), the efficacy of the test (how many of the whatever-it-is does it actually catch?), and the question of what the next step would be based on results one way of another.  Of course, this conversation applies to NT decision-making too!  (Witness the recent change in breast-cancer screening recommendations.  Dr. Schwab actually used breast-cancer as an example, and his comments back then are not out of line with the latest recommendations.)Dr. Schwab made some important observations about going down the road of compelling a patient to be screened against her wishes.  What, for example, is the consequence to a woman when she may have been taught protective behaviors all her life around her \"private parts\" and then she experiences a violation of that in the doctor's office?  What message do we send to a person if we promote the idea that people with disabilities have rights and thoughts and opinions that matter -- but not in the doctor's office?  What message do we send to the community?He also said that his experience with partial sedation in such situations has been poor.  People who come in under sedation often feel more confused and worried than they already were, feeling even less in control and more abused than they already did.  It's important to be aware that there are modified versions of exams that can be done if the physician is trained and willing.  Dr. Schwab described in some detail a modified pelvic exam that involves no stirrups, more reassurance and eye contact (rather than hiding impersonally behind a drape), and no speculum until/unless it's deemed acceptable at the very end of the exam.The lecture was a little bit cut-and-pasted from its original form, and what's posted right now doesn't actually answer the question of what really did happen with Jennifer (to the extent that she's a real person and not partially hypothetical?)  Based on the rest of the content, though, I think I might have a pretty good guess as to what direction the doctor would have been advocating for her.I think that \"Jennifer\" and Dr. Schwab's other patients are fortunate people.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iidd.wisc.edu/?q=node/40", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/really_rethinking_breast_cancer_screenin.php"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/12/pap-smear-for-jennifer.html", "title": "\nA Pap Smear for Jennifer?\n"},

The music teacher had built the program on the theme of \"Mexico,\" connected to a social studies unit they'd all just finished.  The entire show was bi-lingual, giving the Spanish-speakers a chance to shine and the English-speakers an exciting learning challenge.  They even had a seasonal touch, a song from the tradition of \"Las Posadas\" which re-enacts the procession of Mary and Joseph from door to door in Bethlehem until they finally find shelter and welcome.  It was very well done, and of course the sight of my first-born up there singing and moving so enthusiastically brought tears to my eyes!After the program, I got a chance to visit Rose's classroom, something I've not been able to do this fall during school hours with all my LEND overload.She'd talked several times about a certain little fellow whom we'll call \"R\" who sits near her and is apparently \"in love\" with her.  When she speaks of him, I've thought I hear a sense of being flattered, but mostly buried under words of annoyance.  Was looking forward to meeting the kid, and prepared to be kinda charmed -- puppy-love and all that, so cute!And in her classroom I did meet R, and he is indeed a cutie, bright eyes and big smile and full of energy.Then he spoke to me.\"Hey, are you Rose's grandma?\"GRANDMA?!?!Rose, sweetie?

It was an end-of-an-era kind of occasion, in that we helped with the packing to move from the retirement apartment, where she'd lived with my late grandfather for more than half my life, into a smaller assisted-living apartment.Of course, when you make a move like that, there's lots of downsizing to be done.  We helped with that too, sorting things to give away, things to discard, things to keep.  In addition to the books and family photos that I knew were going to be coming home with us, we also provided a home for various keepsakes, usable kitchenware (we've already made jello from her cupboard in her casserole dish!) and other odds and ends.Grandma has always been good at saving pretty paper things to use in making Valentines and decorations.  We brought home several packets of long-saved paper doilies for art-projects at our place.It wasn't until we got home that I got a peek at the back of one of those doily-packets.  These weren't just ANY old paper doilies, let me tell you.  No, these were Roylies.  And they have astonishing super powers...Here's the text, if you don't want to burn out your eyes looking too closely at the image on the screen:Nothing wins a man more than feminine fastidiousness! Famous movie actors, writers, artists, bankers and bon vivants have oft said when interviewed that good grooming in a woman is far more important than good looks.  And the pampered male is quite as particular about fastidiousness in his lady's habits as in her habit!Next time your best beau (or your husband's boss, for that matter) comes to dinner, let lovely Roylies enhance your feminine graces.  Slip a dainty Roylie under the cocktail glass or tomato bisque.  Frame that layer cake you baked specially for the occasion in a large round Roylie.  It will look twice as beautiful!The most inaccessible bachelor in town is bound to melt under the appealing influence of feminine daintiness done in the Roylie manner.  Roylies are such a help in so many ways, there's no reason why they shouldn't help you get your man!Hey JoyDad?  Sorry I didn't have the Roylies thing going on when we met.  But you married me anyway.  Next time your boss comes to dinner, though, and I've got my eye to climb the social ladder, I'll see how well these work... oh, right, she's female.

{"date": "Friday, January 29, 2010", "body": "\nWhen I was a kid, one of the most anxiety-producing situations for me was when I felt that I didn't know what was happening.  (Still true, in fact...)  I needed things to be explained, laid out, with some idea of what to expect.  One bright-edged sample memory dates from a community Easter-egg hunt when I was maybe about Rose's age.  Mom dropped me off, a nice organizer lady told me to go stand on the far side of a big gym full of people I didn't know, I had no idea if I was standing in the right place, and I didn't know what was going to happen next.  The memory still makes my stomach clench.Rose likes explanations too.We experienced this with her earlier in the week as we began to work our way through a sad event at our house.  When JoyDad came downstairs to feed the bunnies first thing on Wednesday morning, he found that there was only one bunny to be fed.  The senior of our two bunnies, Phoebert, had died unexpectedly in the night, at the ripe old age of 11.Phoebert was Rose's favorite, though she loves Ellie too.  We had to quickly plan how to tell her, how to arrange a bunny-body to let her see (opting for a cardboard box lined with a towel), how to comfort her.  She has been doing really well, all things considered.  I think this is partly due to the fact that we had to work through a much more serious decline and loss in 2005, when Rose was three and my mother died of kidney cancer.However, JoyDad and I did have to decide what to do with a bunny body.  The ground is frozen hard this time of year, so burial was not an option.  We didn't much like the thought of putting him in the deep-freeze till spring.  So... um... we bagged his remains in multiple layers and put the bag into the trash bin, which is its own kind of deep-freeze this time of year.  We were really hoping not to have to tell Rose, that she would let us get away with saying that it's mommy's job to take care of and you don't have to worry about it.  Yeah, right.  Guess what was the first thing she asked when I picked her up from school?\"Is Phoebert still in the house?\"I tried one feeble \"you don't really want to know\" attempt, and then told the truth.  She seemed pretty philosophical about that part of it, though she did cry herself to sleep that first night.  She's been thinking about Phoebert and Ellie a lot, but no more tears since.So.  That leaves someone else in the house who is in a very different place in terms of explanations.What in the world do we do for, and with, Joy?For the most part, we have had to keep her away from the bunny enclosure.  The poops look like raisins (acck), she stims on the hay and spreads it everywhere, she rattles the cage.  The bunnies were just not very much a part of her life.We don't even know if it makes a difference to her that there's only one bunny she's being kept away from now, and not two.Which totally begs the question of talking about death.  Our verbal communications with Joy are generally so stripped down, in accordance with the Hanen precepts of speaking with a child using language that is not TOO far above the level you want them to aim at producing.  We usually speak to her extremely concretely, about objects in the immediate present and actions in the immediate present or very near future.Bunny is gone.  Bunny is dead.  Bunny is not coming back.  This is different than when a therapist doesn't show up for an expected session, or when we have a personnel change, or when a friend moves away.... oh dear, that's a lot of words.Good grief, it's hard enough to explain to a neurotypical kid!On the one hand, we're lucky in a way that Joy rolls with the punches of change, at least seems to do so, much more than a lot of kids on the spectrum.  She doesn't explode at changes in routine, though if we change too much at once she does get frayed around the edges (like any kid).But it makes it hard to know how much she even notices.  And how much explaining we need to be doing, which may be more than we are doing, just because we don't know how much explanation is helpful.This is not easy.  I don't like not knowing if I'm standing in the right place, not knowing what's going to happen next.I do know that we'll miss our bunny.Phoebert1999(?)-2010\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S2MAB82qpOI/AAAAAAAAAcE/Rt9T-pgD3xA/s1600-h/phoebert.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/01/explanations.html", "title": "\nExplanations\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 8, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the highly challenging elements of Joy's educational trajectory has been the issue of imitation.  Or, the lack of imitation.Imitation is a huge component of learning.  It's how kids just \"pick things up\" that are happening around them (I'm thinking of the example of Rose knowing the use of a comb at age 10 months).  But Joy is not wired that way.  Imitation is not something she automatically does.  Instead, we've had to try to teach imitation, model it, encourage it.  Imitation goals are part of her explicit therapy regimen.So.  Last night I'd just come in from a snow romp with Rose (Joy had started her snow romp earlier and come in earlier).  I'm shucking off my wet wraps, Joy is bouncing in front of a video.  And I hear this unusual little sound from Joy.bbrrrAAAP!What's that, I wonder.Then JoyDad chimes in, a little sheepishly (perhaps a little proudly as well?)\"Yeah, I belched earlier.  She's imitating me.\"ONE belch.  Just one, without any special effort to get her attention (no \"hey Joy, look over here, can you do this?\").

{"date": "Saturday, January 9, 2010", "body": "\nIt's been a while since I've done one of these!  But producers keep producing, and we keep consuming...First up is a clever product introduced to us by Joy's OT, that we got for both Joy & Rose as Christmas presents.These are L-Bow mittens, sold online from balmy Minnesota at http://www.lbow.com/.  The genius of the product is that they come all the way up to, well, the L-Bow.  No more snow on the wrists between the mitten and the sleeve!Joy's are the purple ones, Rose's are pink.  You can see that the smaller size (Joy's) has an un-differentiated thumb -- each mitten has an identical triangle-shaped thumb  pocket.  I supposed it's meant so that the little kids don't have to figure out which mitt is which.  I find that it's hard to get just Joy's thumb into it.  Rose's mittens, the next size up, have more standard thumb-cases.The big plus for Joy is that the mittens stay on much better than standard mittens, in addition to how well they keep out the snow.  Rose likes having un-snowy wrists too, though at first she was afraid the other kids would laugh at her.  (That issue does not seem to have materialized.)  I don't know if Rose is getting them on without assistance at school; at home she's asking for help to put the second one on.  For Joy we help her with the whole process, though she does put out her hands and assist with pushing them in.Another plus was responsive customer service -- I initially ordered the wrong size for Rose and had to do an exchange in time for Christmas.  No problem.Unfortunately we've had some glitches with the construction of the mittens.  I've had to do two sewing repairs on Rose's: the side of one thumb opened up and frayed, and the elastic band in one of the mitts had gone hard and crunchy and needed to be replaced.  I imagine they'd have sent a new pair if I'd asked, but I didn't want to throw reparable mitts into the landfill.  So I sewed up the thumb and replaced the elastic, and they're working fine.L-Bow mittens run from $18.99 to $27.99 depending if you want the basics, the breatheable mitts (those are what we got), or the top of the line with removable \"Easy Dry\" inserts.  The site also carries gloves and other products.=============Next up:  a basic item of baby clothing in a larger size -- bodysuits/\"onesies\" in a size 5T!  These seem to have gotten rarer over time.  Gerber used to make 5T a few years ago but dropped them altogether; the Gerber 4Ts are hard to find in stores but can still be acquired new on Ebay.  They were inexpensive, thin, stretchy, lapped-shoulders only, and more under-shirt quality than T-shirt quality.Joy grew out of the (small-running) Gerber 4Ts a while back, though not out of the need for them.  Still in diapers, still at risk for diaper-digging.  That's when we found Essential Whites, a company that is in the process of changing its name to TodBods but is still online at http://www.essentialwhites.com/ -- also in Minnesota!Joy's been wearing their short-sleeved size 5T all-cotton bodysuits day in, day out for half a year now, and we just ordered some new long-sleeve ones.  They shipped in a flash, and showed up in a lovely tissue wrap with a little herbal sachet:We've found the short-sleevers to be soft, durable, and to run large for 5T, which is a blessing 'cause we haven't found any size 6's yet...  Excellent quality, and we expect similar things from the longer-sleeves.  There's a sleeveless option too.  The only potential drawbacks to mention: the large sizes only come in white (great for tie-dye though I should think) and they do have neck-tags (doesn't bother Joy but may be a sensory problem for some.)The 5T bodysuits are priced to match their quality: $10 apiece for long-sleeve, $9 for short or sleeveless.  Buy 3 get 1 free, and if you go over $48 you get free shipping.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S0fkGYg3LOI/AAAAAAAAAbc/MVnOnVAruEM/s1600-h/lbowmitts.jpg", "http://www.lbow.com/", "http://www.essentialwhites.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S0fqK3YuW9I/AAAAAAAAAbk/CtpkRw9DmCk/s1600-h/onesie.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/01/product-hits-misses-warm-n-cozy.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses, Warm-n-Cozy Minnesota Edition\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2010", "body": "\nIt was a beautiful winter day, temperatures just below freezing, a couple of inches of new snow making everything look very white again, just a few lazy flakes floating down.I got Joy all dressed up in coat, snowpants, boots, L-Bow mittens... and backpack!  Joy and I showed up at 1pm at the back door of the school where the kindergarteners enter.  Her occupational therapist was waiting for us, to take us just a few feet into the hall to Joy's new locker.  It was all prepped with a laminated name-plate just for her, decorated with a dragonfly that matches the one on her new purple backpack.Have I mentioned yet that I love Joy's itinerant school-district team?Getting all those wraps off and into the locker is quite a task, but since there's no crush of kiddos in the hall at 1pm, Joy has plenty of time to work on it.Next step was a hand-in-hand trek through the halls, up and down stairs (deliberately the long way around for practice' sake) to the OT/PT room.  Which has a swing hanging from a sturdy hook in the ceiling, oh bliss, oh Joy!  First she went swinging in a stretchy-sling-swing that enveloped her entire body -- something she hasn't had access to for several years.  It felt so good, she kept signing for more.  Eventually we lured her out with a \"first-then\" statement and the opportunity to play with a little mirror while the OT changed the swing to a platform.I had intended to head home after I got Joy settled, but it was such fun seeing how this all worked that I ended up staying the whole time.After a whole lot of swinging and a little bit of table work, it was time to switch to the next staffer, Joy's special-educator, who took her to meet the gym teacher and then into the gym.  Which was totally empty, so we could shut all the doors and run and play at will.  Much delight!The gym time ended with the need for a diaper change, so I got to see the facilities for that too.  Fortunately there's another girl in a class on the kindergarten end of the building who already has a changing room set up in the accessible stall of the girls' room, so no new arrangements need be made for Joy.During the diaper change I got to go talk to Rose's teacher while their class was out to recess, lining up for next Tuesday when Rose is person-of-the-week and I'll come to visit.  I don't quite know what we'll do but now we know when and how long we'll do it... and that the time will finish off with a visit from Joy at the end of her \"school day.\"  It will be a splendid opportunity to make introductions, have more kids recognize Joy and be able to look out for her and greet her.After the conversation, I joined Joy and her teacher in a nice windowed room at the back of one of the kindergarten classrooms.  I was expecting it would be a place for one-on-one, but was delighted to see that the kindergarteners were having a free-choice time and that three other little girls had chosen to play back there with the new girl and her staffer!  They were so sweet and matter-of-fact and pleased to take turns with Joy stacking pegs, and bring her play-food to pretend-eat, and pop bubbles with her, and sing \"Wheels on the Bus.\"  It was pretty obvious that these were kids who were used to differences, and were eager to tout their own diversity as well... one of the three made sure to let us know that \"I'm Korean -- I mean, I'm half Korean.\"  The whole encounter was just so sweet and accepting!Then we got wraps back on, and went out to play on the playground for the remaining half hour before the end of the school day.  During that time, two gym classes on snowshoes came and went (don't you wish YOUR school taught snow-shoeing for winter gym?)  The gym teacher called out to Joy as they went past, and so did a couple of Rose's friends.Joy was pretty tired out, and a little out of sorts at dinner, but managed to turn on at least some energy for her barista-dude in the evening.What a spectacular first day of school.  We are so blessed.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S2lmN56z20I/AAAAAAAAAcs/AT0Y5X6uz1E/s1600-h/locker.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S2lnGuWp2xI/AAAAAAAAAc0/QkIMR7ZaNVQ/s1600-h/kindy-swing.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/02/first-day-of-school.html", "title": "\nFirst Day of School\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, February 11, 2010", "body": "\nThere's a new proposed autism definition in town.Here is the brand new draft/proposed definition of autism, as proposed for the upcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 5 (DSM-V), currently slated for publication in May 2013.  The DSM in its most current version carries the official criteria for autism, the standards by which autism is to be diagnosed.Proposed DSM-V criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (299.00)Autism Spectrum DisorderMust meet criteria 1, 2, and 3:1. Clinically significant, persistent deficits in social communication and interactions, as manifest by all of the following:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a. Marked deficits in nonverbal and verbal communication used for social interaction:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0b. Lack of social reciprocity;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0c. Failure to develop and maintain peer relationships appropriate to developmental level2.  Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least TWO of the following:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a. Stereotyped motor or verbal behaviors, or unusual sensory behaviors\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0b. Excessive adherence to routines and ritualized patterns of behavior\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0c. Restricted, fixated interests3.  Symptoms must be present in early childhood (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities)This is a substantial change from the previous definition, in a number of ways.  At a very basic level, it's a lot shorter!  The previous/current definition, which I have often referred to as a \"combination platter\" diagnosis, began like this:\"A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2), and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3):\"I'm not going to quote the whole DSM-IV definition here, because it's pretty long.  Roy Richard Grinker, author of Unstrange Minds (and originator of the term Elvis Sightings as related to autism, woo hoo!) has an excellent page on his web site listing all of the past DSM criteria.  If you scroll to the bottom, you'll see the one from the DSM-IV, which will continue to be the official diagnostic criteria until the DSM-V actually comes out.Another major change in the new draft is that it no longer recognizes separate categories for Asperger's and for PDD-NOS.  I think this is the aspect of the change that will generate the most discussion, due to possible implications for identity (how people think of themselves) and services (in situations where currently a diagnosis of \"autism\" will get you services but a diagnosis of PDD-NOS won't.)  Grinker has an op-ed in Tuesday's New York Times speaking to the identity question, and arguing on behalf of the greater clinical accuracy of folding the formerly-separate categories into the one spectrum. Another new thing is that the DSM-IV definition specifies onset before age 3; the new draft specifies more generally that \"symptoms must be present in early childhood.\"One more aspect that leaps out at me, and I haven't seen discussed yet: I've always found it fascinating that sensory issues are so much a part of Joy's life, and so present in the way I hear both parents and people on the spectrum themselves talk about autism.  But sensory issues were not so much as mentioned in the DSM-IV definition, and I've written before of Agency 1, the local intensive-services provider where we were told that they didn't \"believe\" in sensory integration.Looky there, folks... it's right there in the new draft, item 2 part a!I'm looking forward to hearing how the new draft will be dissected, analyzed, possibly changed?  There will surely be a whole raft of consequences, both intended and unintended.  One way or another, though, the DSM-V is coming and bringing a new framework for autism with it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94#", "http://www.unstrange.com/dsm1.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/opinion/10grinker.html?ref=opinion"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/02/autism-new-draft-definition.html", "title": "\nAutism: The New Draft Definition\n"},

If you check your placement at your local Chinese restaurant, you'll likely find that people born in the Year of the Monkey are clever, skillful, inventive.  One site I checked called us \"the erratic geniuses of the cycle.\"Guess who else in the family was born in the Year of the Monkey?  Yes, that would be our Joy.Miss Joy has seemed to have a special monkey-affinity for quite some time.  It was no accident that her daycare-lady Lynda chose a monkey as the animal-icon to illustrate the name-label for Joy that hangs in the daycare entry-way!I've already mentioned (several times) one manifestation of the association, which is Joy's adorable monkey-backpack.  While it admittedly leaves one open to \"monkey on her back?\" jokes, and perhaps the occasionally ignorant snipe about \"you put her on a LEASH?  She's not a DOG!\"... on the whole, people have been more likely to comment about what a smart and cute idea it is.  It's actually been a while since we've used the monkey-pack at home, opting instead for walking hand-in-hand.  But Lynda is only a super-hero, not an octopus, and doesn't have enough hands for every child when the daycare group walks to the park.  So Joy gets her monkey-pack, with the tail clipped to another child's stroller, and everyone gets their safe and happy walk.Besides the backpack and Joy's wiry monkey-strength and climbing ability, she has also long enjoyed monkey sounds: oo-oo-oo-AAAH-ah-ah!  Her favorite animal on the Fisher Price Zoo toy, pictured below, is the monkey, whom you can just see peeking out of the yellow enclosure to the right of the tree trunk.  When you push the purple lever at the right of the toy, the monkey \"boings\" up the pole to the bunch of bananas and makes its monkey noise.  Which makes her giggle up a storm if she's in the right mood.Lately she's been very \"into\" the classic monkey rhyme:Five little monkeys jumpin' on the bed,One fell off and bumped her head!Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,\"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!\"Her favorite line is \"bumped her head!\"  She'll knock on her own head three times with a great big grin, especially if you pause and wait for her.  In fact, she was even using the knock-on-the-head thing as a sign that she wanted the monkeys rhyme!  I haven't seen it for a little while, though.  Lately she's been more likely to lead me to the mantel where we've got the boardbook:Though she prefers to stim on books rather than to read them, this is one book that she will actually let us help her go through a page at a time and actually do the rhyme.When Christmas-present time came around this year, we let people know that Joy had this monkey thing going on.  Which resulted in this adorable new friend:... and this wonderful toy...Joy loves to crank the box until the monkey pops out!  It's a little tricky to get him back in, but she does let us help her do it hand-over-hand.There was yet one more monkey at Christmas time, a full-size sock monkey that looked just like the one in the jack-in-the-box.  When we checked labels, we found that it came from the same company as the jack-in-the-box... but the gifts came entirely uncoordinated, from different sides of the family.OK, enough monkeying around.  Off to do some LEND homework!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zKg8eKdWL._AA260_.jpg", "http://www.target.com/Eddie-Bauer-Harness-Buddy-Monkey/dp/B001OB9LBI", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S1nBE1Fh2rI/AAAAAAAAAbs/2sOc3rQKB1M/s1600-h/monkey-zoo.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5148DG8VRQL._SL500_AA240_.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S1nDxooWP7I/AAAAAAAAAb0/KP1W8lpKVZk/s1600-h/monkey-plush.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S1nD9b5zvsI/AAAAAAAAAb8/JuHVW470kZU/s1600-h/monkey-jack.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/01/monkey-business.html", "title": "\nMonkey Business\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 8, 2010", "body": "\nI had the privilege of attending an event the other weekend that gave community members a chance to hear various experts on autism.  We heard reports on ongoing research (the science experts).  We heard about community resources (the information experts).  And we heard about everyday life from a panel of personal experts: three parents of kids on the autism spectrum, and three people who live on the spectrum themselves.The living-it-themselves experts had the opportunity to pick from a list of what questions they wanted to answer.  I was especially interested in what the answers would be to the following questions that were listed in the program: Do you think it would be a good thing if research found a cure for autism and Asperger's syndrome?Would you want to be \"cured\"?  Why or why not?Unfortunately for my curiosity, these were not the questions that the panelists elected to address.  I wonder whether the other questions were just more interesting to the panel, or whether there was some active avoidance of these particular questions.You might say I've avoided these questions on Elvis Sightings myself, actually.  Or at least I've chosen other material.  The \"cure question\" is mighty important though -- for how people live their lives now, for how the money flows, for how autism-related policy is crafted, for research priorities, for what choices people may or may not have available in the future.  I'm reminded of my testimony back in 2007 before a state senate committee about autism insurance.  The line that got media-quoted went like this: my daughter has epilepsy and autism, and \"it's astonishing to us that of these two neurological conditions, one of them is thumbs up and one of them is thumbs down.\" [when it comes to insurance coverage -- fortunately we won! so that statement is no longer true!]Now, consider the hypothetical question: \"Would it be a good thing if research found a cure for epilepsy?  Would you want Joy to be cured?\"Well, heck, yeah!  Conditionally, of course -- we'd need to know about risks, and costs, lots of important details.  But to the basic question, the answer is a pretty solid YES.Replace \"epilepsy\" with \"autism,\" and both the question and answer feel somewhat more tangled.The rhetoric of curing autism has been deeply entangled with vaccine-autism fears, and a whole slew of non-standard / alternative medical treatments: some relatively benign, some downright scary.  When people (parents) are desperate for a cure, and science doesn't have it, the door opens wide for uncontrolled experimentation.  And quackery, alas.  Very hard to sort out.And then there are the voices from the autistic self-advocacy community and their allies, people who do not want neurological differences to be viewed as brokenness, but ask instead that the world welcome such differences as part of the beautiful diverse tapestry that makes up humankind.  This view envisions a world where we pour the effort and funding that is currently flowing toward cure-chasing into supports and acceptance instead.One aspect that makes the cure-question less straightforward is the increasing evidence for genetic factors in autism.  It's not going to turn out to be anything simple, lots of bits of genes are implicated so far, and the geneticist who came to explain the lastest state-of-the-science to my LEND class last semester left my head spinning.  But one consequence of pursuing the genetic angle boils down to what has happened in the case of Down Syndrome: once we could identify it in early pregnancy, people started choosing to end those pregnancies (at a rate of up to 90%).  Might that be what a \"cure\" for autism ends up amounting to?Another disturbing scenario was explored on a fictional level by Elizabeth Moon in her novel The Speed of Dark, in which the protagonist is on the autism spectrum and an experimental procedure/\"cure\" for autism figures prominently in the plot. (Fascinating book, by the way.)  What exactly would a \"cure\" do to the people to whom it was administered?  What would be the risks -- especially in the early stages of developing such a \"cure\"?  What would be the pressures, and where would they come from?  In the novel, the pressure is from an employer.  But I could imagine the pressure coming from the funding mechanisms of the health care system, or the educational system, or social services.  As in: this treatment is your opportunity to become \"normal.\"  This will be your chance to no longer be a burden on society.  If you do not take this chance, for the good of society, how can we offer you any further supports or services?Part of me would very much like to plant my flag proudly in the neurodiversity camp, and proclaim that I don't want a cure for Joy's autism.  But... hypothetically speaking... if we were suddenly offered the choice?Depends on the conditions.  I seriously just don't know.I do find it interesting, though, that epilepsy and autism (so often co-morbid) elicit such different reactions to the \"cure question.\"  That somehow hypothetically desiring a cure for autism might mean I think my daughter is \"broken\" but desiring a cure for epilepsy just means I have her best medical interests at heart...It's getting late and I'm beginning to ramble.  Please come ramble with me in the comments.  Ramble, not rumble, though, OK?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/02/hypothetically-speaking.html", "title": "\nHypothetically Speaking\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 7, 2010", "body": "\nSometimes the little stuff just annoys all out of proportion.  One recent annoyance is actually probably a nice little step forward in Medical Assistance cost-cutting for the state...  We learned toward the end of the year that Wisconsin had chosen a single supplier for home-delivery diapers through MA, so we were going to have to change suppliers.  So I dutifully called our old supplier, Home Delivery Incontinence Supplies, and discussed how the change was to happen.  We settled on a date for one final shipment (Jan. 28) to give me time to get things underway with the new supplier, J&B Medical.To get set up with the new supplier took something like four calls, with some phone tag thrown in, some forms to fill out and mail back, a batch of diaper-samples for us to test and choose (because of course they had different brands than HDIS).Then we got a week into February and hadn't received our final shipment from HDIS.  The first customer service rep I spoke to confirmed that no shipment had gone out, but couldn't tell me why.  Her supervisor was to call me back at work.  No call came.  I had to call again to discover that our \"prior authorization\" had run out Jan. 23, so they cancelled our shipment.  Without informing us.  No, they couldn't get a new prior-auth, because gee, they're not our supplier any more.  Meanwhile, it turned out they had called my home number instead of work, and JoyDad spent 20 minutes on hold returning that call, not aware of all my phoning.We had no leverage.  What could we do, fire them?  (Well, I guess I can tell the story on my blog... heh.)But do we have any leverage with the new supplier?  Well, no.  We can't fire them either, they've been given the monopoly.Fortunately the new supplier was nicely responsive.  Diapers arrived promptly, and they're even brand-name (Luvs).And... the annoying leakage problems that I wrote about a while back have been dramatically reduced!  So there was a happy ending to the story.  This time.I sometimes feel that I'm not exactly grateful enough for the publicly-funded diapers, especially since we wouldn't qualify if it were an income-based deal.But sometimes, it's the little things that take so much time and effort and tracking, and knowing that you're at the mercy of bureaucratic forces over which you have no leverage.  Plus we learned recently at LEND that nearly 10% of families of children with special health care needs reported in 2006 spending over 11 hours a week coordinating or providing health care for their child.I'm wondering if people were even counting this kind of stuff.

{"date": "Saturday, February 27, 2010", "body": "\n[Update: A revised version of this post has been published at The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism, July 2010.]One side effect of Joy's ongoing love of Baby Einstein videos is that I've practically got them memorized, including the self-promotion stuff that comes at the end of the VHS tapes.  Baby Einstein's creator, Julie Aigner-Clark, touts the benefits of her series with testimonials from various Baby Einstein devotees.  Somewhere in the middle of the promotion, she herself says enthusiastically,When a mother says something works, you automatically try it!She wasn't talking about alternative therapies for autism.  But perhaps she might as well have been.Two things today are making this connection for me.  One was the second half of the alternative-therapies presentations by trainees in my LEND seminar.The other was coming home to find Jenny McCarthy highlighted in the pages of the Time magazine that just arrived today.  Jenny McCarthy, the celebrity face of the unproven-therapies-for-autism movement.'Try everything,' says McCarthy.  'Hope is the only thing that will get us up in the morning.'Karl Taro Greenfield, author of the article (and also brother to 42-year-old Noah who swims in the deep waters of the autism pool), somewhat wryly states, \"it is hard to find a controversial, novel, or alternative treatment that McCarthy doesn't say has some merit.\"One of the many alternative interventions that McCarthy has tried on her son and touted along the way is the gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet for autism.  That also happens to be the intervention about which I and two classmates presented yesterday afternoon.  And I mentioned her in my portion of the presentation...So here's some of what I and my co-presenters talked about!  The gluten-free, casein-free diet is an elimination diet.  To be eliminated are gluten, a protein found in grains (wheat, barley, rye, and some oats) and casein, a protein found in animal milk.  Elimination diets have been around for a long time, and in general they rest on a very sound premise: if you are sensitive or allergic to something in your diet, stop eating it!  The gluten-free diet is pretty much the only answer for celiac disease; if you have a demonstrated sensitivity or allergy to milk, dairy-free is the way to go.  It's not an easy regimen to follow, but in those situations, it's known to be effective.The \"alternative\" part of this therapy is the claim that GFCF can cure or ameliorate autism spectrum disorder -- in up to 90% of cases, according to Talk About Curing Autism (TACA).  The underlying theory is this:  People with ASDs are said have a predisposition to a gastrointestinal condition known as \"leaky gut\" or \"autistic enterocolitis\".  The condition is supposedly triggered by an environmental insult -- vaccines, toxins, something perhaps as yet unidentified.  When the condition is triggered, the hypothesis goes, you wind up with an incomplete breakdown of gluten and casein which escape through the leaky gut.  The protein molecules/polypeptides travel through the bloodstream and attach to opiate receptors in the brain, leading to autism or magnifying the symptoms of autism.According to this scenario, if you remove the gluten and the casein from the diet, the gut will heal, the opiate reaction is halted, and the autistic symptoms are alleviated -- generally in a couple of months of strict adherence to the diet, sometimes taking up to a year.This is not an easy diet to follow, especially for someone who may already have a very restricted range of foods to begin with.  It requires constant vigilance on the part of the parents, careful ingredient checking and diet balancing and making sure that gluten & casein don't slip in from unexpected sources (a playmate's cracker snagged from the floor, a bit of standard play-doh, etc.)  Pre-fab GFCF foods can be very expensive.  If you want to do the diet less expensively, you'll spend a lot of time in preparing foods from scratch.  Recipe-sharing online can ease that burden; there's even a webpage from TACA that outlines how to do the GFCF diet on food-stamps!The questions we were to answer for our presentation included an overview of the relevant research.  There have been studies from a number of angles: measuring opioid peptides in the urine, measuring intestinal permeability, studying the outcomes of people with ASD who actually go on the diet.  In all of those areas, research is a bit thin on the ground, and the results are not definitive.  We don't even know for sure if people with ASDs have more GI issues in general than people without, though we do know that GI issues that occur in typically-developing folks do occur in folks with ASDs as well.In a happy circumstance for our presentation, a consensus paper came out just a month ago in Pediatrics (a high-profile, peer-reviewed journal.)  A whole slew of GI experts got together, weighed existing evidence, made consensus statements regarding GI issues and ASDs, and recommended a lot of new research.  Here's a the citation to the paper and some of the statements:Buie et al., Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Gastrointestinal Disorders in Individuals With ASDs: A Consensus Report, Pediatrics 2010;125;S1-S18Individuals with ASDs who present with gastrointestinal symptoms warrant a thorough evaluation, as would be undertaken for individuals without ASDs...The prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in individuals with ASDs is incompletely understood.The existence of a gastrointestinal disturbance specific to persons with ASDs (eg, \u201cautistic enterocolitis\u201d) has not been established.Available research data do not support the use of a casein-free diet, a gluten-free diet, or combined gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet as a primary treatment for individuals with ASDs.Interestingly, this consensus paper received some acclaim from both skeptics and proponents of the GFCF diet as a treatment for autism.  Skeptics said, \"Look, here it is in black and white -- current research data do not recommend this treatment!\"  Proponents said, \"Look at all this research they're recommending -- we're finally being taken seriously!\"  (OK, those were both big-time paraphrase-summaries, but I think I've caught the flavor of it).As it happens, there are already a couple of substantial studies of the diet itself in the works.  I'll be particularly interested to see the results on one coming out of the University of Rochester: the data-collection was done a while ago, and as far as I know the analysis has been marching forward. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study where all the participants are on the GFCF diet but at  certain points one group got GFCF snacks where another group got non-GFCF \"challenge\" snacks. [Update 5/21/10 - that study is now complete, and did not find any significant differences between the treatment and the control group.  In other words, the GFCF diet did not help.]A previous pilot study (Elder et al, 2006) took a slightly different approach, putting only half the participants on \"the diet\" but providing ALL foods for both groups, such that the participants and parents did not know whether or not they were GFCF.  The study did not find any significant effects on either behavior or urinary peptide levels.  However -- and here's the really interesting bit -- the parental reports and the researcher reports differed markedly.  Parents thought they were seeing improvements that the researchers could not document.  And nine of the families decided to keep going with the GFCF diet even when they were told that the researchers' observations didn't support it.To me, this screams \"placebo effect.\"  People see what they want to see.  No wonder the claims of efficacy are so high.  To others, this may scream \"only parents are the trustworthy observers; researchers can't see what's right under their noses!\"I do think that the GFCF diet is a different situation than secretin, which has been quite thoroughly debunked as an autism treatment (yet at one time had claims of helping 80% of ASD patients).The thing is, some people with ASDs do have dietary sensitivities.  Just like their typically-developing counterparts.  When you address those sensitivities, people feel better.  When people feel better, they behave better.  And learn better.  And interact better.I'm open to the thought that there are more food sensitivities out there than we're aware of.  But I'm not particularly convinced at this point that such sensitivities have any special causal effect as far as autism goes.  My guess is that the evidence against the leaky-gut / autistic enterocolitis hypothesis is going to start to pile up.  Autistic enterocolitis as a mechanism is under a certain shadow at the moment, in that the originator of the term (Andrew Wakefield) has been recently censured by the U.K. General Medical Council and his 1998 paper that fueled much of the speculation has been retracted by the Lancet. We have not tried the GFCF diet with Joy, because we have not seen anything that would make us suspect a dietary sensitivity if she weren't on the spectrum.Many, many families are trying it, however.  This therapy seems extremely attractive to parents, and I think there are a number of reasons why.  There are powerful testimonies out there, and high-profile proponents (from Temple Grandin to Jenny McCarthy).  The diet has a reputation of harmlessness, though it can be nutritionally risky if not done carefully, especially for people whose diet is self-limited to only a few foods in the first place.  There's definitely a \"why not try it, what can it hurt?\" vibe out there -- quite a bit of peer pressure, which can be hard to withstand when coupled with the 90% success rate claims.  Besides all that, dietary changes are a familiar kind of intervention.  Who hasn't \"gone on a diet\" at some point or another?  Plus it's something that people can attempt without a prescription.  There's plenty of DIY advice out there, on the web and in books and in support groups.There is value in hope.  There is value in parents feeling empowered and feeling that they are helping their child, even (I would argue) for those families in the Elder study who wanted to keep going even when the researchers weren't able to document improvements.  And, as I said before, the GFCF diet demonstrably does help some people with autism -- as it demonstrably does help some people without autism.I'm afraid, however, that the pendulum has swung too far with GFCF.  Ideally people would be able to choose not to do \"the diet\" without being made to feel guilty, or to quit the diet in the absence of observed improvement without being told that they didn't try long enough (a YEAR?!) or that they must not have been doing it right.  The counterpoint stories aren't as easy to find as the primary pro-GFCF narrative, but we do exist out here!When a mother (Jenny McCarthy or otherwise) says something works, that can carry a big emotional pull.  But that alone is far from sufficient to sort out the snake oil from the truly useful, or to decide what is really worth trying.It looks like I'll be doing at least one more post about the rest of the alternative interventions presented yesterday: hippotherapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, vitamin therapy for Down syndrome, auditory integration therapy.  Stay tuned.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/07/when-mom-says-something-works-gfcf-diet.html", "http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796,00.html", "http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/nct00090428?order=9", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/gfcf-of-no-benefit/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16555138?ordinalpos=23&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=22"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/02/when-mother-says-something-works.html", "title": "\nWhen a mother says something works...\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 2, 2010", "body": "\nIn my last post, I quoted several times from an article in this week's Time, in which author Karl Taro Greenfield profiles Jenny McCarthy, prominent celebrity-mother proponent of alt-med recovery for autism.I guess I'm not quite done with the article yet.Greenfield sums up McCarthy's campaign with these words:Of course, McCarthy is not a doctor.  She really has only the one prescription: hope.The article also quotes Age of Autism blogger Kim Stagliano criticizing her children's doctor for failing to offer that hope.'I have three children on the spectrum,' says Stagliano. 'I have yet to really get one actionable piece of assistance from my pediatrician.  They offer nothing.  Nothing... These treatments are filling a vacuum.'Joy and I have had our moments of this too.It was just about two years ago, February 2008. And Joy hit a stretch of misery.  She was having frequent seizures at that point, several a day, one-minute-long events that each carried an hour of inexorable unhappiness in its wake.  But it was more than that.  She was waking in the night to cry.  She was inconsolable for hours at a stretch.  She'd grab us by the hand and lead us to the front door -- but once we took her outside (into the frozen wasteland of February in Wisconsin), it was clear that she really didn't want to be there either.  We came to believe that what she was asking when she led us to the door was \"Take me away from here, to somewhere that will make me feel better!\"  And we had no means of doing that.  We were helpless.  I took her to Urgent Care, certain that there must be an obvious physical cause.  Ear infection?  Strep throat?  But no.Several days later found us in our pediatrician's office -- a capable woman, who'd done a good job with Joy's care to that point.  I like her very much -- she brings a good combination of empathy and no-nonsense, plus an undercurrent of shared Christian faith.  But that day, as Joy raged around the exam room taking divots out of the exam table with her teeth, the pediatrician had nothing to offer, beyond a weak suggestion that I should really seek out some respite help.Nothing to offer.  No hope.That wasn't an answer I was prepared to accept.  I began working my local network.What kept me going through the next days were two conversations.  One was a phone conversation with an expert from Agency 2, who also has a child on the spectrum.  What stood out from my conversation with her was the sympathy, the \"been-there-myself,\" and a suggestion of craniosacral therapy as something that had been helpful in their situation.  The other conversation was with a friend from church with spectrum experience.  She had several suggestions for pediatrician-switching.Those conversations gave me the hope I needed, plus something to do.  And during the days as I explored the possibilities of craniosacral, and the options for a new pediatrician, Joy's misery began to gradually ebb.  On its own.  And spring was coming.  We were going to make it after all.I'm grateful that the incident led us to a new doctor for Joy, even if he's across town.  He specializes in special needs, and has parental experience on that score as well.  We see him every 3 months as a matter of course.  I don't expect to hit that \"nothing we can do\" wall with him.  (Rose still sees Joy's former pediatrician, and I'm pleased that by \"firing\" her for Joy, we didn't lose our connection.  In fact, her office got the H1N1 vaccine before Joy's new clinic did, and she called us to let us know and offer it to Joy!)As for the craniosacral therapy, it became less urgent once we were out of the immediate crisis.  We did eventually make the attempt later that summer, to no discernable effect, and blogged about the process in detail.Interestingly, Joy's initial pediatrician was actually \"right,\" in a way.  Joy made it through the crisis without medical intervention -- we needed to do... nothing.  And respite was a sound idea!  But the lack of other ideas, and the lack of hope, was just not tolerable at the time.So far, I'm sounding like I'm resonating pretty strongly with Kim & Jenny.  And up to a point, I guess I am.Here's where it differs, though.  The hope I was seeking was not cure/recovery from autism.  The hope I needed was for a livable life.  For me, those two ideas are not the same.  Our new pediatrician isn't offering recovery/cure.  But he does offer expert medical guidance as we seek a path for a meaningful, joyful, potential-fulfilling life.  We're grateful for that.I'm wondering a couple of things, as I remember that sequence of two years ago.One: would it have been helpful for Joy's former pediatrician to offer some form of placebo?  Even if she didn't believe in it herself?  After all, hope is what was needed...Two: do parents of children with known genetic conditions (Down syndrome leaps to mind) blame their pediatricians in the same way that some parents in the autism community do for not being able to offer a cure?I'd have answered \"no\" to the second question, but after having heard the LEND presentation on vitamin therapy for Down syndrome (to be blogged about soon), I'm no longer so sure.  Though if that level of blame & conspiracy-thinking is happening, we're not hearing about it in the popular press in the same way.What do you all think about placebos, and about what level of blame is fair to heap upon pediatricians, or upon Western medicine in general?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796,00.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/03/hope.html", "title": "\nHope\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 9, 2010", "body": "\nThe deliberately-deceptive \"quack\" doctor is a well-recognized figure both in history and in fiction, particularly western movies and novels.  I have a cousin who wrote a book on three such charismatic con men of the 20th century, including one John Brinkley who promoted transplants of goat glands as a cure for infertility or lost virility (and also ran for governor of Kansas!)  One slang term for such characters is \"snake oil salesmen.\"  Ah, but nothing is as simple as it seems.  Turns out that the term \"snake oil\" comes from a particular Chinese medication, a product of the Chinese water snake, that is still used for relief from arthritis and joint pain.  The jump from traditional Chinese medicine to association with American quackery may have come about when Chinese immigrant laborers on the Transcontinental Railroad shared their joint pain remedy with laborers of European descent.  Funny thing is... for the specific joint pain application, the oil of the Chinese water snake might possibly have certain beneficial properties...The presenters in the first LEND session on alternative therapies were all students in professions who will be working with children with disabilities some day.  They were exceedingly careful about keeping their own language respectful, even when they were obviously skeptical and quoted other organizations who used strong language (such as the National Council Against Health Fraud, on record that \"chelation therapy of autistic children should be considered child abuse.\" The term \"snake oil\" didn't pop up until the second set of presentations, which had family-member trainees sprinkled among the presenters -- I think that somehow the family members were a trifle less shy about bringing quack-doctor-history and anecdotes into the mix.  Somehow the second session carried more history, more of a sense of the ebb and flow of popularity of alternative treatments and how a single treatment may be sold for a variety of ailments over time.In fact, that's one of the hallmarks of potentially fraudulent, non-evidence-based treatment: a long laundry-list of what it claims to cure.  Good for what ails you!Among the treatments that were discussed in the second session (hyperbaric oxygen therapy [HBOT], auditory integration therapy/training [AIT], hippotherapy, vitamin therapy for Down syndrome), the laundry-list history came up in relation to HBOT.Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber to increase the blood-oxygen level.  It's been around since the 17th century, and is an established treatment for decompression sickness, a potentially-fatal condition that can come about when someone goes too quickly from a pressurized situation (like deep-sea diving or working far underground) back to ordinary air-pressure.  Over the years there have been various efforts to link HBOT to other ailments as well.  One of the more flamboyant historical HBOT figures was a Dr. Cunningham, who in 1921 built a hyperbaric chamber 20 meters in diameter, in which patients could actually reside.  He claimed that anaerobic bacteria were responsible for a whole range of ills from cancer to high blood pressure, and that an oxygen-rich hyperbaric environment would discourage/treat the bacteria.  (This was the point in the presentation at which the term \"snake oil\" was used -- the idea of treating infections caused by anaerobic bacteria in this way may have merit, but that's different from cancer!)  Dr. Cunningham was eventually denounced and his massive steel chamber was demolished for scrap metal.  More recently, HBOT has received publicity as an alternative treatment for cerebral palsy and autism.  Neither of these applications of HBOT has yet been the subject of a Cochrane Review (a major go-to source for evidence-based medicine).  There have been two studies of HBOT for autism led by Dan Rossignol, most recently a double-blind, multi-center trial in 2009 that found significant improvements.  The presenters did point out, however, that the improvements were based on parental observation (and as I mentioned about the Elder 2006 study on the GFCF diet, parental reports can be much more enthusiastic than researcher observations.)  HBOT is a relatively expensive treatment, $300-400 per session -- and the protocol in the Rossignol study involved 40 sessions.Another therapy where a family member on the presentation team came down a little harder due to personal experience was vitamin therapy for Down syndrome -- I think the three presenters were all students of genetic counselling.  The idea is that the manifestations of Down syndrome, from intellectual disability to facial differences, can be ameliorated by treating the syndrome as a metabolic condition.  Some of the substances involved include thyroid supplementation, flaxseed oil, and dimethylglycine (DMG), but the list is long and varied.  One of the presenters had family experience with a prominent practitioner of this approach, a Dr. Forrest Warner, known for his travelling clinics that set up in a given city for a day.  Parents lined up with their children for a short expensive evaluation in which expensive supplements were recommended, to be taken indefinitely in the absence of any follow-up.  Granted that this is a single anecdote, but it obviously had an impact on how the presenter viewed the therapy.The research on vitamin therapy for Down syndrome is mostly negative, to the point that the National Down Syndrome Society has stated: The administration of the vitamin related therapies -- e.g. the vitamin/mineral/amino acid/hormone/enzyme combination, has not been shown to be of benefit in a controlled trial, that the rationale advanced for these therapies is unproven, and that the previous use of these therapies has not produced any scientifically validated significant results. Moreover, the long term effects of chronic administration of many of the ingredients in these preparations are unknown. Despite the large sums of money which concerned parents have spent for such treatments in the hope that the conditions of their child with Down syndrome would be bettered, there is no evidence that any such benefit has been produced.Just at the end of the presentation, someone (presenter or faculty member in the audience, I can't remember?) mentioned that flaxseed oil and DMG have some proponents when it comes to autism as well.  [Good for what ails you?]Next up, auditory integration therapy (AIT), presented by audiology students.  Given the alternative status of AIT, I suppose it's not surprising that this was not something the presenters had been exposed to in their studies to this point.  In fact, they were having a hard time trying to understand and explain what exactly was involved.  The claims for the therapy for autism spectrum disorders involve increased attention span and eye contact, and improvement in abnormal sound sensitivity.  The therapy itself involves listening via headphones to specially modulated music 2x/day for 10 days (I believe this was the Berard method.)  Cost can be in the neighborhood of $2000.There's been a bit more research regarding AIT for autism; a 2004 Cochrane Review found 6 studies worth addressing, which ended up measuring a variety of outcomes and reported mixed results. One potential risk may be that the sounds could be damagingly loud, but I don't have a citation for that.  The group concluded by citing a technical report from the American Speech-language Hearing Association (ASHA) stating that AIT has not met scientific standards for efficacy and safety and should be considered experimental.The only presentation I haven't discussed yet was the one on hippotherapy, which (contrary to the word's appearance) does not involve hippopotamuses!  \"Hippo\" is the Latin root word for \"horse,\" and hippotherapy is a strategy that uses horseback riding as part of an integrated intervention program in cases of neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction, a program that may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language.  The movement of the horse is said to mimic the human pelvic movement of walking.  Hippotherapy has a full-blown association (founded in 1992) and a certification board (since 1999) and the presenters' handout listed a whole slew of practitioners in our state.  Risks are not extensive -- allergies, and the fact that a horse is a large and potentially unpredictable animal -- and proponents claim gains in patient self-confidence along with the therapeutic gains.However, hippotherapy is one of the explicit exclusions in our state's recent autism insurance mandate -- along with HBOT, AIT, chelation and special diets, come to think of it.  Barbara at TherExtras had some reflections on hippotherapy (to some extent in conversation with me!) a month ago, exploring the ramifications of pushing to get hippotherapy recognized as medical treatment.  One of the LEND faculty brought up a related note when she compared the self-confidence gains from hippotherapy to what might result from participation in organized sporting activities.Thus endeth the roundup of our LEND explorations into alternative therapies.  Just to reiterate, every one of these alternative therapies has its enthusiastic proponents and its skeptics.  Some have been quite thoroughly discredited, others are squarely in the \"need more research\" category and that research could tip either way.  One piece of advice that I'd offer for folks gathering information on an alternative therapy.  I would suggest searching the following sources for a pull-no-punches skeptical take:Respectful InsolenceQuackwatchEven if they speak of any given therapy in harsh or off-putting terms, it's a useful counterweight to potentially overly-enthusiastic claims.  And not all of the therapies listed in these past few posts are evaluated there.  (For example, hippotherapy is not mentioned on either site.)One final note.  Back when Barbara (TherExtras) and I first met, we had a conversation about craniosacral therapy.  She included in her post the following Bible verse, which had been in the readings at her church that week:Why spend your money for what is not bread; your wages for what fails to satisfy?  -- Isaiah 55:2 That verse was among the scriptures read at my church this past week.No coincidences!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=snake-oil-salesmen-knew-something", "http://www.ncahf.org/policy/chelation.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19284641", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14974028", "http://www.therextras.com/therextras/2010/02/first-do-no-harm-.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/", "http://www.quackwatch.com/", "http://www.therextras.com/therextras/2008/08/osteopathic-medicine.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/03/oil-of-snake.html", "title": "\nOil of the Snake\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 16, 2010", "body": "\nMore emergings, that is.Joy has become much more attuned to greetings and goodbyes.  The high-five came about in the fall, I believe, and has been a lovely hook upon which to hang interaction at Sunday school and kindergarten practice.  What's new, though, is a level of engagement and interaction, plus new signals.  Joy has re-learned the bye-bye wave!  And she also does a fun new greeting, where she gives a huge grin and stretches out a pointer finger.  Sort of like in the movie E.T., if I'm not dating myself too badly here!Another re-emergence is the \"Clap, clap, uh-oh!\" game.  I don't remember when we first invented this -- I think it was a couple of years ago.  It's a two-person game, facing each other, Person 1 is set to clap their hands and Person 2's hands are on the outside.  Person 2 \"makes\" Person 1 clap hands, several times in a row.  The soundtrack is \"Clap... clap... clap...\" and then Person 2 makes Person 1's hands miss and cross instead of clapping, and the vocalization is a big giggly \"UH-OH!\"  Joy is not only willing to play the game again, she can be either Person 1 or 2.  And she is willing to supply the \"uh-oh\" herself more often than not.  AND, on Sunday when I was on nursery duty at church with her, I caught her in a quiet moment playing the game with herself.  And she did the motions and said \"cah, cah, uh-oh!\"  All on her own.She's getting good at opening the car door from the outside and getting all the way in, with our Honda Fit at least.She's mastering the \"flip trick\" for putting on her coat.This morning she was playing in the kiddie area at the carshop while we were getting an oil change, and her shoe came off.  This is a girl who, when her boot pulls off in the snow, can walk for several steps before anyone notices that the boot has gone... she not only noticed the shoe right away, but picked it up, then on voice-prompt brought it over to me.  And as we were putting in on, she said \"ahhhhn\" (a nasal-sounding, French-like pronunciation that had an implied \"n\" rather than an American \"n\" but still!)And just so as not to ignore Miss Rose, who is doing some pretty amazing things herself: she drew a picture last October for a contest at Ask magazine, where they were supposed to submit ideas to scare monsters away.  Her submission was selected and published in the March issue!Her caption: \"This monster has electric snakes coming out of his head. He will scare ghouls out of their pants!\"Boo!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.preschoolplaybook.com/2009/02/can-you-put-my-coat-on.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/03/but-wait-theres-more.html", "title": "\nBut Wait, There's More...\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "body": "\nIt feels like spring.  The snow is mostly melted off the garden, and soon we'll take the mulch off our strawberry plants.  Snowdrops are blooming on the south side of the house; tulip leaves are poking through in the front flowerbed.And for the past two weeks, new/renewed vocalizations have been sprouting for Joy like shoots from subterranean bulbs.  There've been so many, it's hard to keep track.  Some of them are Elvis Sightings: she said \"buh-buh\" for bye-bye, just once!  She said \"muh\" together with her \"more\" sign at just one snack time, two requests in succession!  She said \"bay\" for her bagel, just once!  Others are more durable: a big explosive \"pah!\" that might mean \"play\".  A lovely \"chew\" noise that is associated with her chewy toy (and also with a tickle game).Rose and I have been attuned for noticing signs of spring.  We saw the first robin of the season on Friday morning near Joy's daycare.  We saw an animal in the backyard that first looked like a rabbit, but then turned out to be a squirrel with a white tuft on the end of its tail.I remember one of the concerns I had when I first meet with the Birth-to-Three case manager who came to our house for an intake interview.  I told him about how, when I would be on for childcare with Rose and Joy and Joy's daycare buddy, I'd point to a squirrel out the front window.  Rose and Buddy would be fascinated.  I could not get Joy to look.  \"Maybe it doesn't mean anything,\" I said self-deprecatingly.  The case manager wouldn't commit to what meant what, but told me to keep paying attention.This morning Joy was looking out the front window, watching a squirrel.  Later in the morning we went for a run, with her in the stroller.  She tracked a bird that flew over.  She giggled at an airplane.  And every time a car went past, she'd turn her head around to follow it, with a great big giggle.Did I mention we went for a run?  I am picking myself back up after falling off the wagon with running during the long dark iciness of January and February.  It feels so good to re-emerge onto ice-free sidewalks and sunshine pouring down.Rose is making great strides on piano these days.  The material in her class is getting more and more challenging, and she's keeping right up.  She's got the ear... when she makes a mistake, she hears and works to correct it.  And it helps a lot to have me play through a song just once when the rhythms get too difficult.Joy's speech therapist was all set to write up a present-level for Joy's upcoming IEP that said something to the effect that imitation was not something that has moved very far forward this year.  All of a sudden, the occasional imitations are popping forth all over, from animal noises to word-approximations.  At school during her kindergarten practice the other day, she was playing Row Your Boat on one of those wooden rocking-boat kinds of toys, with a couple of other kids.  \"If you see a lion, don't forget to roar!\" went the music.  The kids roared, Joy roared.  And then she roared again, to get more roars going.  Not just imitation, but initiation too!There are other things -- more occasional potty successes, getting her coat on and off by herself, making attempts to blow bubbles.  The list is getting too long to remember.  I've been a little bit hesitant to even write about it, for fear of jinxing the whole thing.  But I think it's time to start celebrating, at least just a little.Happy spring!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/03/emerging.html", "title": "\nEmerging\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 26, 2010", "body": "\nI almost feel like I should say \"Didja miss me?\" yet again.  It's been a very full week since returning from the Autism Society of Wisconsin (ASW) conference a week ago Friday.  Many spinning plates, and per usual many are Joy-related, from conversations about inclusion at church to the fact that we've got her IEP meeting this afternoon to plan for kindergarten in the fall.But I promised some conference-reportage!One lovely piece of convergence at the conference was that Joy's itinerant special-educator, who leads Joy's school district team and has been coordinating the IEP prep, attended the first few days of the conference as well.  I'm loving the fact that the person with whom we're writing Joy's first ever official behavior plan... also attended the conference day-long workshop with Paula Kluth, a session called The Problem with \"Behavior Problems:\" Supporting Students with Autism & Other Disabilities. [Note - I'll be calling her by her first name, as I did with Temple Grandin and Eric Courchesne, though in each case the more formal choice would be the title \"Dr.\"]Paula put \"Behavior Problems\" in quotes in her title on purpose.  It seems that throughout her career around these issues, she's been wanting to write and speak about the \"supporting\" emphasis while publishers (and conference producers?) bring the pressure to use language that explicitly references \"behavior.\"  Which makes sense with the generally-used language -- Joy's going to have a \"behavior\" plan and all that -- but I love the move to change the conversation.One way in which the workshop enabled that conversational change was to challenge the attendees to do some self-reflection.  For example, one set of questions that we discussed in small groups was \"When do you behave badly?  What helps you \"recover\" from your own bad behavior?  What is one effective and positive behavior strategy that you have used?\"  I bet that nobody had trouble coming up with personal examples; I know I didn't.  Attendees reported behaving badly when they're hungry, tired, offended, stressed, overwhelmed, when people won't listen, when they're having a hot flash!Then Paula asked these questions around effective strategies: Did anybody say, \"I can't calm down until...someone drags me away?someone enforces an immediate negative consequence?someone yells at me enough?So why is this the kind of strategy that so often comes into play for students with disabilities? when what really helps the conference attendees in their own \"behavior problems\" is more along the lines of: have a snack; change of venue; exercise; walk away; etc?Really, who among us wants someone to come along and try to \"change our behavior\" anyway??But we can all use a little helpfulness and support along the way.  The reframed question, as the presentation put it, becomes \"How can we effectively and sensitively support individuals with disabilities?\" or more broadly, \"How can we be helpful to people?\"So, what does seem to help?  In very broad strokes:Being surrounded by people who carehaving meaningful social relationshipsbeing in a comfortable settinghaving an engaging curriculum (driven by novelty and joy, as opposed to \"death by sight-words\")Another nugget from the day that I found very thought-provoking was reflection on \"shepherds,\" i.e. how very much adult-presence and \"proximal support\" students with autism often have.  How much of the hovering and correction -- y'know, those things we do because it's good for them, right? -- is necessary and how much not?  Do we expect students with disabilities to be \"on task\" for more of the time than students without disabilities?Well.  The workshop was chock-full of anecdotes and suggestions and excellent ideas for providing appropriate support through environment and materials and relationship-building.  It was actually so much as to be an overload, and if I try to reflect much of that back in bloggy format, I'll just be transferring that overload.  It struck me as the kind of thing where, once you've got the right framework in your consciousness, there were almost enough ideas to be presented in a \"strategy of the day\" daily calendar format!  For me, what was truly important about the workshop was the framing -- the commonalities -- the sense that it's really all about being human and how we all react.Here's a quote that didn't come from the presentation, but rather from a favorite album of mine when I was a kid, Free to Be You and Me:Some kind of help is the kind of helpThat helping's all aboutAnd some kind of help is the kind of helpWe all can do without!For more information:http://www.paulakluth.com/including one particularly helpful page on being calm in crisisThe article is adapted from her book You're Going to Love This Kid: Teaching Students with Autism in Inclusive Classrooms.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.paulakluth.com/", "http://www.paulakluth.com/articles/calmincrisis.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/03/conference-report-part-1-paula-kluth.html", "title": "\nConference Report, Part 1: Paula Kluth\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "body": "\nThe third and final installment from the Autism Society of Wisconsin conference is the Saturday afternoon keynote by Eric Courchesne, director of the UCSD Autism Center of Excellence.  His talk was called \"The Neural Origins of Autism: Evidence of Prenatal and Early Postnatal Brain Growth Abnormalities.\" [Note - I'll be calling him by his first name, as I did with Paula Kluth and Temple Grandin, though in each case the more formal choice would be the title \"Dr.\"]In contrast to Temple Grandin's wide-ranging themes, Eric's presentation built a thesis.  He started by referring to a 2009 report from the  Information Centre of the UK\u2019s National Health Service that found an ASD rate of 1 in 100 among adults in England, using modern diagnostic standards.  This converges with the 1 in 110 rate for children in the US as published by the CDC this past December... in other words, he was taking the stance that the autism \"epidemic\" has much more to do with diagnostic changes than with a true rise in the condition.  (The England study has been somewhat controversial, and Eric was careful to caution that it needs to be replicated before we can give it too much weight.)  Come to think of it, Temple hinted at a similar position in her presentation: \"Geeks and nerds have always been here... Who do you think made the first stone spear?  It wasn't all the yakety-yaks around the campfire!\"Eric went on to point out that until recently, much of the brain-scan research in autism has been done with adults.  But if you want brain research to illuminate the \"why,\" you need to start much earlier, back to the age at which atuism first begins to be apparent.  So he and his wife, fellow researcher Karen Pierce, have been working on brain studies with little tykes.One set of results focuses on brain size.  It's well-established that people with ASD have unusually large brain size. Courchesne et al (2003) looked children with autism or PDD-NOS and traced their head circumference (HC) records back to infancy.  The findings: birth HC of the infants with ASD was smaller than the norm, but shot up to a mean at the 84th percentile by 6-14 months.  The children with autism had a greater increase in HC than the ones with PDD-NOS.  [This rings true for our Joy, by the way.  Her head was at the 70th percentile shortly after birth, 95th percentile by six months, above the 97th by 9 months, and has never gone below that figure since.  Rose had a sizable head too, 90th percentile at 12 months, but back to the 82nd percentile by 2 years of age.]  Anyway, Eric listed 7 other studies in support of this finding, starting with Dementieva et al 2005.The next work he described involved doing sleep-MRIs on one-year-olds.  To get the right group of little ones to scan, Eric and Karen have set up a network of primary care physicians who do a screener at age 12 months to identify children who show early signs of ASD.  Those identified as at-risk then become potential research participants.  This network & screening impresses me as a two-in-one coup, by the way -- not only does it serve the research, but it gets the kids screened!  I've learned via LEND that there is surprising hesitation in the pediatric community when it comes to implementing standardized developmental screening, whether for autism or just in general.Anyway.  Not only are these MRIs confirming large brain size in children with ASDs (particularly frontal & temporal lobes) but are also showing that autistic-tyke brains are responding differently to normal speech, with activation on the \"wrong\" side of the brain.So where are these brain overgrowths coming from?  Is it more brain-cells, or something else?  Cadaver research on small children can be a hard thing to think about because there's always a tragedy underlying, but generous research donations by bereaved families has allowed some study that actually counts brain cells -- with the astonishing result that the brains of children with ASD had an average of 55% abnormal increase in the actual number of cells!AND.  Eric drove this home hard.  Almost all brain cells are generated PRE-NATALLY, second & third trimester.  The overgrowth in numbers of brain cells cannot be caused by vaccines.So why don't symptoms show till later?  He showed a fascinating slide illustrating human frontal cortex development.  Even though newborns have all their brain cells, those cells are small and have few connections.  But between the ages of 6 months and two years, the cells themselves grow and circuit formation goes wild.  At that point, the difference in number of brain cells and how they connect begins to really matter.Eric's lab is currently studying the layers of the cerebral cortex, a process that he expects will lead to identification of genes that are implicated in layering defects.  He spoke of his hope that within 6 or 7 years, that the understanding of the brain-basis of autism will jump by leaps and bounds.  As he made this prediction, he became choked with emotion... \"I have tremendous hope,\" he said.When Eric talks about the importance of brain-based autism studies, he also speaks very strongly about the massive waste of research dollars that have been poured into the generally-discredited vaccine causality hypothesis.  This infuriates him.  And it's not just a casual opinion with him.  It's very personal.  You see, as he climbed the steps to the stage, he had to support himself with his arms because his legs don't work quite right.  He had polio when he was four years old, in the last epidemic wave before polio was essentially wiped out.By vaccines.He got a standing ovation at the end of his presentation.----------Note: sorry that my referencing of particular papers fell off after the first bit of the presentation.  I thought I took better notes than that, but apparently not.  Please be assured, though, that every one of the findings was backed by peer-reviewed, published articles, and that Eric took great care to mention the extent to which his work has been replicated.  Unlike, and he made this point very clearly, the work of a certain Andrew Wakefield, recently retracted by the Lancet.----------Thus endeth my conference reporting.  I hope you can see why it seemed important to me to share all three of these presentations!  Thank you for hanging with me.  I think that as LEND winds down, we'll be returning to our usual Joy-based programming here on Elvis Sightings.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsandiego.org/autism_center_of_excellence.php", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/mental-health-surveys/autism-spectrum-disorders-in-adults-living-in-households-throughout-england--report-from-the-adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-2007", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5810a1.htm", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12865374", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15664769", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/04/conference-report-part-3-eric.html", "title": "\nConference Report, Part 3: Eric Courchesne\n"},

I always love to get a new book in the mail, and the title resonated with the God Sightings theme that runs through my own blog.In Autism & Alleluias, Bolduc shares \"a love story\" -- love of God and of her son Joel, a young man who has autism as well as intellectual disabilities and an anxiety disorder.  In a series of short 3-5 page vignettes and poems, she offers gently faith-infused glimpses into life with Joel, starting not long before his autism diagnosis as he stands at the cusp of adolescence and concluding as he moves into his early 20s.Each chapter / reflection / meditation begins with scripture and ends with a prayer.  In between, she and Joel encounter the challenges of life in school and church and community, but also grace (alleluias) in unexpected places: an Easter visitor who shares a new perspective on disabilitya talented aide who composes a special song for Joel on the spotJoel's own vocal and enthusiastic worship style (which fits better into some congregations than others!)a poignant reminder from Joel himself that \"We need Jesus.\"The chapters not only have the cadence of a daily devotional, but also that of blog posts.  (I am reminded particularly of Autism in a Word, from my dear friend Rhemashope.)  With Autism & Alleluias, it feels as if we're getting the \"best of\" nuggets of 12 years of reflective blogging (or journaling), in one 140-page swoop!  Since I blog from a desktop (and don't carry an iPhone), I was able to carry the book to places I don't blog-read, like the bus.  I found myself with the impulse to post a comment after some of the chapters -- I guess that's what book groups are for.  I have not read either of the author's two earlier books, His Name is Joel: Searching for God in a Son's Disability (1999), or A Place Called Acceptance: Ministry with Families of Children with Disabilities (2001), but have them on my list now.

{"date": "Monday, May 3, 2010", "body": "\nWe've been moving toward two different outpatient surgeries for Joy, for a while now.One of them has to do with the scar from her nevus-removal.  Joy had three surgeries in her second year of life to remove the nevus-sebaceous \"blotch\" from her scalp, so that it would not run the risk of cancerous changes later in life.  Cosmetically, it was good to have it gone too!  It healed up quite neatly, but her scalp stretched as her head grew, and now the scar is about a quarter-inch wide.  Nobody notices it when her hair is long, but last year when she had a buzz cut so she wouldn't pull out all her hair by the roots, you could see it pretty clearly:Way back when she had the surgeries, the plastic surgeon advised us that we'd probably want to do a scar-revision surgery once Joy's head had grown, maybe before kindergarten -- and that our insurance generally covered scar-reduction because it was a follow-up to the original covered surgeries.  We were going to get it done last summer, but then we had other health issues to contend with and decided to wait till this year.Meantime, we discovered that Joy has a small umbilical hernia.  With many kids, little childhood umbilical hernias close up on their own by the age of 5 or so.  And when it's as small as Joy's is, even past age 5 they'd normally leave it alone.  But we've got a bit of a family history -- JoyDad had such a hernia that \"popped\" on him as an adult (as in, lots of pain and two surgeries, one on an emergency basis).  Plus, Joy has unusual pain responses and isn't reliably able to show us where it hurts, just in case things did go wrong with hers.Fortunately, the surgeons to do both procedures are in the same network.  Joy's pediatrician helped us come up with the clever idea to do both the procedures in one event, so we'd only need one go-around with the anesthesia.  The surgeons agreed, their schedulers got us all set up, we were on the calendar for June 2...And then our insurance denied the scar revision.  JoyDad went to a hearing to make our case, and they denied it a second time.  Further pursuit of the case might involve legal consultation, and would certainly not be settled in time for the scheduled surgery date.Our current plan is to pursue the hernia repair, but not the scar revision.Thought experiment:  what if these surgeries were for Rose instead of Joy?  Would we react differently?I can tell you right now, for Rose the scalp-scar would be a BIG DEAL.  She's sensitive about her appearance, sensitive about teasing.  If she reached adolescence with such a scar, it would be an emotional issue and a decided challenge to overcome (though I've no doubt she'd deal with it if need be).  Pushing the case would be worth some sacrifices.  I think I'd feel the need to at least consider the out-of-pocket option.If Rose had the hernia, however, we could let it ride.  She could tell us immediately if something did get to the point of hurting.Meanwhile, Joy has shown no self-consciousness whatever about her appearance so far (and why should she, adorable as she is, in our unbiased opinion?!)  She interacts with mirrors enough to be drawn to them and make funny faces -- does that mean she knows its her, though?  As far as noticing teasing, we've been fortunate that she hasn't encountered it yet. Though of course she's off to school in just a few months.But it doesn't take a scar to mark Joy as different. Given where we are right now, and what we know about autism and about the world: the people who are sufficiently open of spirit to accept Joy for the amazing person she is, are going to be entirely unfazed by the presence of that scar.  The people who are going to be cruel to her will find plenty of differences before they even notice her scar.Plus, the scar may simply never matter to her, even if/when she becomes aware of it.  And if it does turn out to matter?  Maybe that's something she ought to get to decide when she is at a point to be making such decisions.With the hernia, though, that could potentially turn into a medical emergency.  Even, possibly, way down the road when JoyDad and I might not be around, and nobody remembers that JoyDad had a hernia history.  And we can't guarantee that Joy will be able to communicate about it.So we're on the calendar for a hernia fix, still in early June.  Think good thoughts for us, that the surgery goes smoothly and doesn't put any major setbacks into Joy's wonderful developmental progress these past weeks, and that we've made the wise call.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SgFzRgW2kCI/AAAAAAAAATI/Jz_X246XI_k/s1600-h/nevus-removal-scar.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/05/tale-of-two-surgeries.html", "title": "\nA Tale of Two Surgeries\n"},

He specializes in special needs, and really seemed to \"get\" Joy, from the very first visit.We had a pre-op appointment this week in advance of Joy's scheduled hernia surgery.  Actually at the time we scheduled it, it was going to be for the combined scar-reduction & hernia surgery, but in the wake of the insurance company's decision to deny the scar-reduction, we had settled on doing just the hernia surgery.  This was our first chance to talk to Joy's primary care doc about that decision.He was properly appreciative of Joy's amazing developmental explosion.  He was also on the ball with a thought that hadn't occurred to us -- that when one of his patients with special needs has a surgical procedure under sedation/anesthesia, he likes to take the opportunity for a blood draw and test all those levels that you don't get a chance to do without quite a bit of trauma otherwise.But then he told me that he wanted us to think very carefully about our decision.  The hernia is really tiny, he said -- it had made sense to fix in context of the other (now cancelled) procedure, and given JoyDad's hernia history he'd still back us up if we decided to go ahead.  But to him, it didn't seem that the hernia posed a serious issue, and certainly not an imminent one.  We can always continue to monitor it, and decide on surgery later if it seems to be getting worse. And -- here was the kicker -- he asked us if we were sure we wanted to run the risk of interfering with Joy's recent developmental trajectory right now.If there's one thing we don't want to do, it's torpedo all these amazing gains.  We'd thought about that angle, but hadn't perhaps taken it seriously enough.So, we've cancelled the surgery.  It's kind of a relief to have such a fine reason to reconsider.Thanks for all the positive thoughts!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/05/reconsidered.html", "title": "\nReconsidered\n"},

Happy birthday, sweetheart!JoyDad and I decided a while ago that our gift to her would be a new tricycle, more suitable to her size.  She'd finally this spring started riding the sweet little trike handed down from her sister, just as she got to the point of outgrowing it!So we went online to see what we could find for a big-kid trike.  We didn't need anything adaptive, mind you.  Just something that acknowledged (universal-design-wise) that sometimes bigger kids like to ride trikes too, whatever their neurology.  What we found was way outside our price comfort zone.  We were not particularly interested in dropping between $150 and $250 on a tricycle, no matter how right-sized and sturdy!Fortunately our school-district team came up trumps.  The PT at Joy's school recommended a trike from Harbor Freight, which has a local store here.  The product is called the All-Terrain Tricycle, and the full price is an eminently-reasonable $59.99 (plus shipping if you order online.)  Apparently this item goes on sale frequently.  We paid $50; as of this writing, it's $42.99 online.The trike comes partially-assembled in a box:The assembly instructions were poor, but the assembly was intuitive enough I had no problem.  It was half an hour from box-opening to all-cleaned-up, with photography included!The trike rolls easily, is plenty tough, and has multiple holes for setting the seat closer or further back depending on how long your kiddo's legs are.  Downsides are minimal.  The seat is a little too tilted for my taste; the front tire assembly pivots all the way around, as opposed to our smaller trike that didn't let you turn it too far; and, the new-materials smell from the tires was so strong we couldn't store the box in the house!Other than that, though, it's an excellent bang for the money, and I think Joy will do just fine with it.  I'll write more about the presentation of the gift, and other birthday-celebratory reflections, after we're back from our traditional Memorial Day pilgrimage to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

{"date": "Thursday, June 3, 2010", "body": "\nSo -- as we left things in the previous (inadvisedly cliff-hanger-y) post, we'd been summoned back to the cabin in a voice that brooked no dispute, without knowing why.  The distance would have been an easy dash on land, but not from an anchored pontoon boat with the crew bobbing about in the water!  Had to get everyone back on board, haul up the anchors, get the boat restarted despite a balky battery, then ease it back into the super-shallow water next to the pier.  All without unduly scaring the young'uns... Rose in particular has such an imagination.As you can guess, the adults on the boat had no trouble imagining a couple of dire health-related scenarios too.  Just in case, I volunteered to keep the girls busy at the pier and let the guys go pounding up to the cabin to see what was up.GrampaK was on the screen porch, trying to catch his breath.  From the adrenaline.  According to reports, the first words out of his mouth were, \"The window exploded!\"He'd been sitting at the dining table with his back to the window in question, halfway across the room.  All of a sudden there was a huge crash, and glass from the window came flying all over the room, some of it hitting him in the back and head.  He escaped to the porch and was waiting for reinforcements to try and sort things out (and check for cuts, which fortunately were none). Guess what they found on the kitchen floor, amidst the shards.  A sizable hawk, somewhat dazed but very much alive! [Update: and here it is!]We suspect that the hawk was stooping down on one of the birds that was nesting in the eaves of the cabin -- and that the nesting bird had a much better feel for its position relative to the cabin than that hawk did.  The impact must have been full-tilt, probably deceived by the reflection of the woods in the glass.JoyDad and Uncle Marathon tried to toss an old army-blanket onto the hawk, to wrap it up and get it out of the house without any close encounters with beak or talons.  But the hawk wasn't as injured as all of that.  It kept escaping as the blanket came down.  Then it flew into the loft.  The guys ended up chasing it all around with a broom before they finally got it out the door.  Then they had to use the broom for its intended purpose.  There was glass everywhere, strewn all the way across the cabin floor and furniture.We actually only had one night with a tarp nailed over where the window should be.  GrampaK and Uncle Marathon went to town the next day, and despite the holiday weekend, found someone to cut a pane of glass to the right size.  They brought it back unbroken over bumpy roads, puttied it in, and with any luck, it'll last sixty years like its predecessor.As long as the hawks steer clear.[Great big additional update!]Great googly moogly, y'all.  It wasn't a hawk after all.  It was a ruffed grouse!!

{"date": "Wednesday, June 2, 2010", "body": "\nAs the holiday weekend approached and we watched the weather forecast for our northwoods getaway, we feared an adventure full of sweltering heat and vicious bugs.  Several years ago JoyDad and Rose had suffered through such a Memorial Day sweatbox at the lake, barely able to step out of the overheated cabins without being carried off by mosquitoes and biting flies.  (Other years, we've had snow at the end of May.  You just never know.)This year couldn't have been more beautiful.  The sun shone hot at mid-day, but the air was dry and didn't hold the heat at night.  In fact, everything was dry.  The lake was low.  But the drought meant that the bugs were at an all-time minimum for spring.  It felt like mid-summer.The dry roads meant we could go driving on paths that are usually too muddy or flooded -- and as we were out driving, we saw a black bear!  He lumbered along ahead of us for quite a ways along the road before crashing his way into the forest.  Fortunately we were several miles from the cabins at that point.  Right next to the cabins all we saw were hummingbirds, eagles, woodpeckers, loons, ducks, and a little red squirrel!Oh, and the two little crawdads I caught by hand as we cavorted in the shallows right off the pier.  And the leech I brushed off my foot.  Rose was wary of the muck and rocks in the lake, but Joy could have played all day.  She splashed and splashed...... and climbed the pier and jumped back in, over and over.She also figured out how to \"swim\" by walking on her hands in the shallow water, pulling her body along behind.All that exercise could work up quite a thirst.  One meal Joy was sitting next to me and reached over toward my share with a big \"more\"!  The most likely desirables were the beverages -- a tumbler of milk and a bottle of beer.  I poured her a little glass of milk, but she's been on an anti-milk kick lately and pushed it away after one sip.  The comment came from across the table -- \"Hey, maybe she wants your beer!\"  And from Joy, the explosive echo: \"BEE!\"One of the great pleasures of the lake vacation is the photography.  Rose now uses the old digital camera we got back when she was six months old:She's learning to identify wildflowers as well as capture them in pixels.  Here's a pink ladyslipper:And I found and photographed a nodding trillium:Ah, but I haven't yet shared the biggest adventure of all.  Splashing by the shore was fun, but the real action involved the pontoon boat (thank you Uncle Marathon, and Uncle DO who couldn't be there this time!)Take the boat out on the lake, anchor in about 20 feet of water, tighten up the girls' life-vests, and throw 'em overboard!  OK, not really.  We threatened to do it to Rose, but she shrieked and insisted on climbing gently down the ladder.  Joy wouldn't have minded -- any way into the water was fine.  Uncle Marathon was eager to take the plunge as well...One one such swimming excursion, we were anchored a ways out in front of the cabin, about half-way between the pier and the eagle's nest.  GrampaK had stayed behind at the cabin to take it easy.  We were glad that he was in good enough health to come to the lake in the first place, but swimming wasn't part of that package.  So the rest of us were out with the boat, just getting started, when suddenly GrampaK's voice came rolling out over the water, calling Uncle Marathon by name.  And then these words, urgent and chilling:Come.  Home.  Come home now!And then silence.[to be continued]\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY8FkQ9K9I/AAAAAAAAAiY/lCSAQ6ybeJc/s1600/lake0510-splash.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY8SOXxbiI/AAAAAAAAAig/VLni2iXdyio/s1600/lake0510-pierclimb.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY9QD86-yI/AAAAAAAAAio/SY6IVd3lt_0/s1600/lake0510-photographer.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY9iYXFhNI/AAAAAAAAAiw/BJMxeVzh_c4/s1600/lake0510-ladyslipper.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY9t_0CPJI/AAAAAAAAAi4/fpKs_cQDAf8/s1600/lake0510-trillium.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY-G_cftPI/AAAAAAAAAjA/1aSPB4BmsVA/s1600/lake0510-onboat.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TAY-oxdrHJI/AAAAAAAAAjI/zo-4nl6nZx0/s1600/lake0510-unclemarathon.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/06/northwoods-adventures.html", "title": "\nNorthwoods Adventures\n"},

You can read about the heartbreaking inspiration for this poem on the Autism Society of Middle Tennessee's web site.While the poem wasn't originally about autism, it fits strikingly well with how \"we\" define \"them\" when it comes to the autism spectrum.  I first heard these words in the autism context back in March, at the start of Paula Kluth's workshop at the Autism Society of Wisconsin (ASW) conference.  When I walked in a little late, there was a video playing on the big screen, in which the words of the poem were being presented in the context of autism, with music and images and additional text.  At the time I didn't even catch the name of the DVD, but I later learned that it was called \"The Power of Words: How We Talk About People With Autism Spectrum Disorders Matters!\"  The creator is Judy Endow, MSW, autism consultant and self-advocate.It was just announced on the ASW online mailing list that the video has been selected to receive the 2010 Autism Society Media Excellence award, to be presented at the July national conference of the Autism Society of America in Dallas.  Congratulations to Judy!  (Though there'd be no reason for her to remember me, I've heard her speak and met her briefly.  Her words have taught me much -- and made me think.)The DVD is sold online at the Autism Aspergers Publishing Company.Here's one more text-excerpt from \"The Power of Words\" taken from the publishing company web site above:One time I started making a turkey sandwich.Then I rememberedI had a banana that needed to be used up.So I decided to makea peanut butter and banana sandwichinstead.The group home workerlooked at the new personshe was training and said,\u201cJudy must have forgottenthat she wanted a turkey sandwich.They have short attention spans, you know.\u201dDo you recognize this kind of language, in your own speech (guilty here, probably more often than I know) or being used by others to describe your child or being used to describe you?I love words.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 23, 2010", "body": "\nYou know how when a baby is little, you have to take her to the pediatrician all the time?  First every couple of days or weeks, then every few months, then at half year intervals, then annually to age 5, then it spreads out to every two or three years.It hasn't exactly worked that way with Joy.  We started out with that basic pattern, but things kept intervening.  Like seizures, like autism.  When we eventually switched pediatricians a little while back, ending up with Joy's current family doctor who is expert in special needs, he put her on a schedule of follow-up visits every four months.  Lots of appointments.I'm happy to report, though, that we've recently \"graduated\" to longer intervals with a couple of Joy's specialists.First came the pediatric neurologist.  We've been seeing him at least twice a year for quite a while now.  The last three visits, though, we've been able to report that we've not seen any seizures since the prior visit.  And when we saw him in May, he told us to schedule the next appointment a full year out.  Woohoo!Then yesterday we had to go back to the eye doctor.  I blogged about this one last year; how I'd been sent back to the opthalmologist where we'd had the worst appointment experience EVAH, then managed with a lot of pre-planning to have a much smoother experience a year ago.  Our follow-up appointment yesterday wasn't starting out so well -- even though we had the first appointment of the day, the waiting room was crowded, the lady at the desk didn't want to hear about Joy's needs (\"you can tell the person who comes to get you\"), and Joy was starting to get fussy in the 20 minutes it took for the person to come get us.  As crowded as it was, I was fearing that we wouldn't get the private exam room to wait in low light for the dilation; plus the more people, the higher the chance of waiting delays.  Arghh.However, once we got into the exam room, people started to jump for us (jump for Joy?!)  Joy was unhappy but at least willing to let her attention be directed enough to look where they wanted her to look.  The doctor came in quickly -- and said that she really wasn't seeing the kind of strabismus/tracking-problems that had sent us there the year before.  (We still see tracking issues, but I haven't been noticing them nearly as much).  She didn't think it would be worth it to dilate Joy's eyes as we'd planned (YESSS!), and told us we wouldn't need to come back for two or three years unless the tracking got really bad, to the point that she was having trouble maybe half the time to pull her eyes back together.Fewer appointments is always a fine thing.  It's so good to have both the improvement and the maturity.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/06/another-sign-of-progress-and-maturity.html", "title": "\nAnother Sign of Progress and Maturity\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 25, 2010", "body": "\nA quote from one of Joy's daycare reports:Potty: Sat on the potty after AM snack. Diaper was damp, so didn't think she would be able to go. But she sat. After a few minutes I asked her if she was all done. She looked away from me and within 30 seconds she was peeing. When she was done, she reached for the TP. Cool!This quote was from April 2007. Joy was not yet three years old.At age 6, she's still in diapers around the clock.When it comes to toileting, the sliders and switches on Joy's mixer board (my favorite metaphor for her developmental pattern) have turned on, and then turned off again. As her words have repeatedly come and gone, so has her willingness to make beginning steps toward potty training.It's been very hard to decide about making an all-out effort to get the toileting truly underway.  I'd really been dreading any approach that involved panties and letting the accidents happen.  I'd been rocked on my heels by the experience of datri over at Opposite Kids, whose Kayla was unswayed by an all-out four-day diaper-free marathon over the winter holidays.One complicating factor for us is that most of the advice about toileting readiness for neurotypical kids has not been consistent with Joy's trajectory. Consider this list at BabyCenter.com:Can sit down quietly in one position for two to five minutes. [In our dreams!]Can pull his pants up and down. [With support - this one we've got]Dislikes the feeling of wearing a wet or dirty diaper. [Our sensory-seeker doesn't mind at all, might even like it]Shows interest in others' bathroom habits [Nope.]Gives a physical or verbal sign when he's having a bowel movement such as grunting, squatting, or telling you. [Oh, come on... you can tell when infants poop!]Demonstrates a desire for independence. [Hmmm... a little, maybe]Takes pride in his accomplishments. [Yes, but maybe not how they think]Isn't resistant to learning to use the toilet. [Totally off-and-on]Is in a generally cooperative stage, not a negative or contrary one. [Again, off and on. Those switches flip very fast.]Can follow simple instructions, such as \"go get the toy.\" [Can, yes. Does? Maybe.]Understands the value of putting things where they belong. [In a few limited situations]Has words for urine and stool. [Not even.]Understands the physical signals that mean he has to go and can tell you before it happens or even hold it until he has time to get to the potty. [Only the one \"kee\" incident.]The bits about being resistant/cooperative have been a big part of what's standing in the way about making a commitment to do anything more than sit potty in the evening before bath.  For quite a while Joy was willing to sit on the pot and happily flip through a board-book or two.  But then a few months ago she started physically resisting as soon as I would ask her to potty-sit -- and this kid can put up some powerful resistance, let me tell you!Fortunately, Joy's intensive-therapy folks, Agency 2 (serving up their own House Blend of therapy combining behavioral and relationship principles), have a nicely flexible approach to toilet training.What has come together in the past weeks has been a combination of readiness on the part of both Joy and her parents, and the willingness of Agency 2 and Joy's awesome-daycare-lady Lynda.Joy is often dry overnight.She's willing to drink a lot of water when we push it.She understands \"first/then\" and is willing to work for a relatively immediate promised reinforcer.Kindergarten is coming up and we want her to have this learning underway.Agency Two's training guidelines have the flexibility and willingness to \"schedule train\" without making the frustrating commitment to do a diaper-free boot camp approach.Lynda is happy to combine our goals for Joy with her daycare's standard potty-schedule routineFollowing the Agency 2 recommendations (which are proprietary so I can't post the helpful document online, sorry!), we first did some thinking about desirable rewards that could be reserved for potty encounters, in a hierarchy of desirability.  Then we spent several days after we got home from the lake trying to record the state of Joy's diaper every half hour.  One important switch here was moving from having Joy in a onesie round the clock to wearing just T-shirts and elastic-waist pants.  Onesies are delightful for preventing diaper-digging, but not so fine for moving toward toileting independence.  The schedule-recording didn't actually reveal a lot in the way of pattern, but it did get us into a toileting schedule mindset, and pre-shadow for Joy that there was going to be more attention to diaper-related activities soon to come.Then we sat down with our senior Agency 2 therapist and talked about initial goals, to get us and therapists and Lynda all on the same page.  We decided on a schedule of a potty-run every 1.5 to 2 hours, in which Joy would help pull her pants down, clamber up on a footstool to sit on the toilet (with insert), sit for a nice slow count of ten, and then get a reward!  Then she has to cooperate with re-diapering (generally standing up, at home anyway), pull up her pants, and work through a hand-washing routine.We started on Saturday.  So far, we have succeeded in getting through all the steps, including the ten-second-sit, every single time.  As a side benefit, Joy is learning to count to ten, and is especially eager to fill in the \"teh\" when we get as far as nine.  Sometimes she's in a mood to sit quite a while longer, though, if she's excited to play with her ribbon-reward or mylar-balloon-play reward.And yesterday morning she woke up dry, was willing to play an interactive people game for a while after the count of ten -- and did a most excellent potty-pee.I don't imagine this will be either quick or easy, and surely we'll be dealing with sliding switches for years to come.  But finally it does feel like we're on our way.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://oppositekids.blogspot.com/2010/01/battle-begunand-ended.html", "http://www.babycenter.com/0_potty-training-readiness-checklist_4384.bc"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/06/idea-whose-time-has-come.html", "title": "\nAn Idea Whose Time Has Come\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 6, 2010", "body": "\nWhat better way to celebrate a long holiday weekend than to head up north with family?It had only been a month since our last trip, so all of us knew the drill.  Pretty well, anyway.  We'd thought ahead for some helpful additions such as water shoes to protect our feet from the lake bottom; it would have been nice if I'd remembered my swimsuit, though!  (T-shirt and shorts made an acceptable substitute.)We had a somewhat larger group this time, with both JoyDad's brothers (Uncle Marathon and Uncle DO) and their spouses (Auntie Save-the-Tatas and Auntie LO).  Joy was delighted to discover that four out of the six adults could do JoyDad's special trick where he relaxes his face and shakes his head quickly from side to side, making a silly \"blub-blub-blub\" noise with his mouth.  She ran from one to the other on the screen porch, grinning up at them and shaking her head to request more!Joy also had a special connection with Auntie Save-the-Tatas, whom she doesn't see often.  This auntie was the go-to gal for special kissies and cuddles.  Cute as could be.Auntie LO and Uncle DO, meanwhile, brought the entertainment with games and goodies.  Rose loved the big bubble-wands they brought, just perfect for holding up in the wind on the pier and creating huge bubbles for Joy's delight:Joy, meanwhile, got a lot of mileage out of the swim-noodles that we bought on the way:Wonderful weekend for water-play!  The weather was warm and we had sunny skies for most of the sojourn.  Despite the wind on the water, Uncle Marathon could always find a place to anchor the pontoon boat for the whole crew to take the plunge.  Joy discovered what fun it was to lean back in the water in her life-vest and kick with her feet.  And Rose was brave enough this time to actually jump from the boat:The lake was at least a foot higher than it was a month ago, due to some rain and a strategically placed beaver dam.  This made for some fine water-play down at the pier as well:I suppose I should report that we finally broke our flawless chain of laxa-swim events.  After a less-than-ideal diaper change on the pontoon boat the first time out, we managed to have the rest of the weekend's swims without going through more than one swim diaper.  Whew.  And in further toileting news, we did bring along the potty insert so that Joy could practice in the outhouse.  I didn't have the stamina to take her for nearly as many scheduled trips as we do at home, but we practiced often enough that she did pee out there once!Though it seems sometimes that the lake vacations never change, this time there was a new addition, engineered by the inlaws who own the larger share of the property and spend most of the summer up there: a new, not-quite-finished shower house.It's quite a complex system.  First you have to pump a tank full of water by hand over by the old pump.  Then you have to fire up the generator so the sump pump can move the water over to the tank by the shower.  Then there's switch mechanisms in the shower for heat and water pressure.  Fancy stuff.Of course, it wouldn't be a lake vacation without some explosive crisis.  For some reason the girls and I are always down at the lake when the hollering starts.  We were splashing at the pier when Uncle Marathon's voice raised the alarm, and his brothers burst out of the cabin (one out the front door, one out the back) to come to his assistance.Here's what exploded this time:Doesn't it look rather like an exotic flower?  Alas, this is the remains of the hot water line coming into the shower house.  The tubing was obviously not quite of a caliber to take the heat and the pressure, and so Uncle Marathon got an unfortunate surprise during his shower experience!  (Auntie LO was the only one who got an uninterrupted shower earlier that afternoon.  Lucky lady.)Though we were there for Independence Day, we didn't take any explosives up with us.  There's been a drought up there, and we weren't interested in risking a forest fire -- though it turned out to be rainy on Sunday afternoon into the evening, so even our grilling was soggy!  The gray sky was still light when we put the girls to bed, and then we retired back to the screen porch to listen to the 1812 Overture that Uncle DO and Aunt LO had thoughtfully put on their MP3 player.  Just as the cannons were firing, we noticed that the sky behind the cabin was producing shades of pink.  As we ventured out to see, we discovered that the sunset had produced something else amazing:This rainbow was huge, and complete.  No way to get it all on the camera.  It arced all the way across the sky, and from the end of the pier we could see the entire arc reflected in the lake as well.  Full circle.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMLB4TgkVI/AAAAAAAAAko/Ca2aajR0QP8/s1600/lake0710-bubbles.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMK45qXwKI/AAAAAAAAAkg/OJuxh2Fwimk/s1600/lake0710-noodle.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMKxM8ppjI/AAAAAAAAAkY/4FLYXUl00nI/s1600/lake0710-jump.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMKnLmkG8I/AAAAAAAAAkQ/WWLt0cYlixc/s1600/lake0710-splash.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMKV0T59oI/AAAAAAAAAkI/0mRidth1N3I/s1600/lake0710-shower.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMKO0nLpGI/AAAAAAAAAkA/1jr9Ooj16MI/s1600/lake0710-explode.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TDMKBj-HgyI/AAAAAAAAAj4/ufNwA9jyYkM/s1600/lake0710-rainbow.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/07/further-adventures-up-north.html", "title": "\nFurther Adventures Up North\n"},

You just hook your fingers or thumb under the handle and exert moderate pressure upward.  Piece o' cake.The one on the CR-V, she was not able to operate.  You have to choose the correct half of the handle, wrap your hand all the way around, and pull outward with significant pressure.  Didn't come easily.So we worked on it bit by bit.First, I wrapped Joy's fingers around the handle for her, and then put my fingers on top and opened the door hand-over-hand.Then, when she got the hang of grabbing the handle, I pulled on her wrist (so she had to get her grip tight enough to keep hold through the pull). Then, I moved the pull-help back to her elbow.Then, I started asking her to make the pull, and only helped a little.On Thursday, Joy began opening the door on her own.This process took several months, practicing at least every other day, sometimes every day, sometimes more than once a day.

{"date": "Saturday, July 17, 2010", "body": "\nIn principle, I'm all in favor of saving money with no-name brands.We do a lot of that in the grocery store.  Our cart fills up with a lot of store-brand or lesser-known brands, every bit as tasty and we don't have to pay for all the advertising overhead!Then again, there are exceptions.  I happily eat the off-brand Crisp Rice (instead of Rice Krispies), packaged in the big plastic bag; JoyDad eats Mom's Best raisin bran instead of Post or Kellogg's.  But I do not like the taste of off-brand Cheerios and Kix.  Those two are not every-bit-as-tasty in the off-brand, I can taste the difference, and I'd really rather not buy/eat the inferior stuff.There are some similar -- and much higher stakes -- issues with generic drugs too.  In general, I'm all in favor.  Health care costs are way-too-high, and generics can do their bit to help bring costs down.  JoyDad and I avail ourselves of generics both for prescriptions and for over-the-counter meds.  Unfortunately, epilepsy drugs are a example of when generics aren't necessarily ideal.  The FDA rules for generic bioequivalence allow for a rather suprising amount of tolerance around how well a generic version needs to match the corresponding brand name -- to make the cut, a generic needs to be reliably \"within 20% above or below the blood level generated by a corresponding brand drug.\"  When it comes to anti-epileptics, where the therapeutic dosage can be in a narrow range, that degree of difference between brand-name and generic (and possibly even more so between two different generics) can apparently be enough to mess with seizure control, to potentially disastrous results.  A recent article at Epilepsy.com has a nice round-up of recent research conducted on generic substitution for anti-epilepsy drugs, with a number of studies pointing in the direction that the differences may indeed be problematic.There are a couple of different approaches underway to remedy this.  A citizen petition was presented to the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 requesting that the agency address the issue of brand-name/generic substitution for anti-seizure meds.  However, it does not appear that the FDA has responded substantively.  More recently, in the conference report that came out with the funding bill for the FDA for the coming year, Congress has upped the ante by including the following request:  The conferees request the FDA report on adverse events and seizures associated with brand and generic anti-epileptic drugs.  Specifically, the agency should examine the pharmacokinetic profiles of \u201cA\u201d rated anti-epileptic drugs from different manufacturers of the same therapeutic agent.  The Committee directs the FDA to submit a report not later than September 30, 2010, detailing whether the agency believes that any changes to the current bioequivalence testing should be recommended.(from FDA Law Blog)Although -- the FDA is already on record with the belief that no changes need be made, so I'm not sure how this would impel any belief-changing (why is this about \"belief\" anyway?)  Maybe if either internal or external evidence piles high enough, they might change the tolerance guidelines for this particular group of meds.  I wonder if that's been done before.Here in Wisconsin, there was also a push for a legislative remedy this past session of the state legislature.  The bill (2009 AB 506/SB 354) would have required consent from both the prescribing physician and the patient/parent/guardian before a pharmacist could substitute generic for brand-name anti-seizure drugs, or substitute one generic for another.  Wisconsin law already prohibits such a switch if the original prescription specified \"no substitutions\" -- and the opponents of the measure were quick to point this out.  A public hearing was held, but it looks as if the bill died in committee, and never came to the floor for a vote. As you might guess, we've had direct Joy-experience with this, two times this year now.  We've been so fortunate to have finally hit the sweet spot with her meds combo, such that the scary-seizure days have receded into memory for a while now.  One of her two meds has been generic from the get-go, but the other one began as a brand-name.I knew about the substitution concerns, and so I was taken aback when I showed up for a refill at the pharmacy counter this past January and was told that our insurance wasn't covering the brand-name anymore, so they'd filled it with the generic.  I pressed the pharmacist a bit, but he seemed to think that we'd be in for an uphill fight for reimbursement if we wanted to try to get doctor's orders not to switch.  I went ahead and let them ring up the generic, and contacted Joy's neurologist, who said he didn't anticipate any issues with the switch.  So we started in with the generic, and saw no problems, and so that chapter ended well except for being an extra worry in the back of the mind as we started in on that new bottle.Well, here we are only six months later, and they've switched it again.  This time it's from one generic to another.  This time the issue was with our pharmacy's wholesaler, who suddenly made a complete switch to another manufacturer.  The pharmacist was, once again, sympathetic.  He had taken a continuing education session on just this issue (generics and seizure meds), knew the concerns... and couldn't do a thing for us.  He did try, calling the wholesaler just to be sure that the other wasn't still available.  I'm sure the pharmacist's boss wouldn't thank him for this, but he even suggested that we might want to call around and go to a different pharmacy if we could find someone else who carried it!  Which we don't really want to do -- inconvenient at best, and who's to say the new pharmacy's supplier wouldn't pull the same trick in a month or two?The legislation was well-intentioned, but I wonder it would really help either situation.  It's aimed at the pharmacist, but he/she can't do anything about what our insurance will cover, nor (probably) about decisions at the wholesale level.I dislike ending a politics-wonk blog post without a call to action.  Sigh.  Maybe just to think good thoughts for us as we crack open the new generic bottle, that all continues well with Joy's seizure control.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/newsletter/july10_generic", "http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/medicationswitching/studies.html", "http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/contentStreamer?objectId=090000648046284a&disposition=attachment&contentType=pdf", "http://www.fdalawblog.net/fda_law_blog_hyman_phelps/2009/11/congress-asks-fda-for-report-on-generic-antiepileptic-drugs.html", "http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/AB506hst.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/07/generic-post.html", "title": "\nA Generic Post\n"},

The stars aligned just right: a show she really wanted to see, an open time block... and a sensory friendly showing!I've been getting announcements for local sensory-friendly movie events for quite a while, without these components lining up exactly for us, so we'd never been to a sensory-friendly showing.  We get the announcements due to our association with autism-related organizations, but Joy isn't anywhere near being able (or interested) for a feature-length film.  Rose, however, has disliked loud noises since she was very young.  And I often experience the sound level at a movie theatre as a sonic assault myself, especially during the previews!So, what makes a sensory-friendly showing?  At least for this one:Sound level is turned down.  No previews.  The showtime is not listed for the general public in the theatre's regular listing.  A non-judgmental atmosphere for viewers who need to get up and move, or do some vocalizing, or take breaks.I don't know how attendance usually is, but for us this felt like practically a private showing!  There were only two other mother-daughter families there, and though I'd tipped Rose off that people might need to move around or make noise a little more than at most showings, nobody did.So, the movie.  Ramona and Beezus.I'd read most of the Ramona books, by Beverly Clearly, long ago when I was in elementary school myself.  The books tell of an imaginative young tyke, Ramona Quimby, whose off-beat ideas and impulses get her into all sorts of scrapes, and her quiet responsible older sister Beatrice (who picked up the awful nickname Beezus because little Ramona couldn't pronounce the real thing as a toddler).  I always identified more with Beezus than Ramona, being an awkward bookish older sister myself.  The original line-drawings by Louis Darling -- example on the left -- are still what I imagine the characters to look like.The movie was sweet and age-appropriate.  Rose loved it, though she'd never really gotten into the books, which were a little slow-paced for her.  (She preferred Junie B. Jones, from a more contemporary series of books with a Ramona-like lead character.)The movie takes plot elements from different books -- Daddy losing his job from Ramona and Her Father, Aunt Bea's romance from Ramona Forever, little touches like Ramona \"boinging\" a classmate's curls and turning the \"Q\" in her last name into a cat from Ramona the Pest.  The job-loss frame turns it into a contemporary fable of recessionary struggle and family resilience with darker themes than I was expecting, and more tearjerker moments, but with lots of humor along the way and a happy ending as a \"G\"-rated movie should have.  Ramona herself is played spot-on.Rose was all excited to see Selena Gomez cast as Beezus.  Her mama was not nearly so impressed.  Beezus isn't supposed to be drop-dead gorgeous! How can I identify with that??\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bp0.blogger.com/_-74Lgo5mIZ8/RubC6HSA5tI/AAAAAAAAAN4/lD4SVxLjYRk/s400/Beezus+%26+Ramona.gif", "http://www.examiner.com/x-15334-Movie-Locations-Travel-Examiner~y2010m7d23-Ramona-and-Beezus-are-taking-over-the-neighborhood"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/07/sensory-friendly-ramona.html", "title": "\nSensory-Friendly Ramona\n"},

I'd have more time one-on-one with Joy again, with Rose at summer day-camp full time and my work schedule back down to half-time.It didn't exactly work out that way.  Just after my LEND graduation, I got offered a quarter-time summer gig through my LEND contacts, working on a guide to services and supports in Wisconsin for families of children with special health care needs.  I couldn't pass up the opportunity, and it's been a fine experience so far.  But it did eat right back up that extra time that was going to make this summer so much more relaxed.Fortunately, it didn't eat up all the time.  And with the summer weather being reasonably kind to us so far, Joy and I have been making some fun one-on-one excursions.  To the local lake-front beach.  To a kiddie splash-pad fountain setup at a local park.  To our free local zoo.  And yesterday, to the lovely conservation park right across from the elementary school that Joy will attend in oh-my-goodness-just-about-a-month.We had perfect weather for our outing yesterday, sunny and warm with a light breeze.  The prairie flowers are simply stunning this time of year.Occasionally I had to encourage Joy to keep walking over the rocky sections of the path (rather than dropping to stim in the gravel and rub it onto her legs.)  But mostly she kept going.And once we got to paths of mown grass, it got even easier.The long grass at the side of the path holds its own attractions, besides giving definition to the path to keep us from straying far.There was a park bench under this oak tree that kept us circling back to this part of the path.  We sat on it, stuffed grass strands through the slats, jumped down from it, used it as a changing table!  (Didn't see another soul the entire hour we were out, other than one jogger just as we were returning to the parking lot.)What a beautiful day.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFKwgmlfHTI/AAAAAAAAAmI/ljwwYYgo8aM/s1600/parkwalk1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFKwWJYnUUI/AAAAAAAAAmA/6_4UFIwggAA/s1600/parkwalk2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFKwO_hY2mI/AAAAAAAAAl4/alsTykfeXtU/s1600/parkwalk3.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFKwG3DLviI/AAAAAAAAAlw/uNgQd2GlN8Y/s1600/parkwalk4.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFKv4VgIIiI/AAAAAAAAAlo/DJWRTRVTdC8/s1600/parkwalk5.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/07/walk-in-park.html", "title": "\nA Walk in the Park\n"},

It's lovely to be able to go one-on-one with the girls as they get more adventuresome.  Rose has been taking swimming lessons during summer day-camp, and can now tread water a little bit and do a splashy crawl for a few yards.  She's also stretching out taller and taller, to the point where she can stand up easily in the water at the base of the lovely long waterslides.  I've been trying to persuade her to go down the waterslide for the past couple of years -- but they won't let you wear your goggles, and they won't let you go down tandem, and these have always been her excuse.  Finally on Saturday I convinced her to go down one slide while I went down the other.  Guess what she did over and over again, all on her own, for the rest of the evening, and was terribly disappointed to quit when it was time to go?!Joy, meanwhile, was making new discoveries too.  She was experimenting with going underwater (all in the 2-3 foot zone of the pool, not to worry!)  She was teaching herself to hold her breath, either popping right back up or submarining forward underwater for a bit.  No coughing and choking at all.  It was wonderful to see.Since Rose was so busy with the waterslide, I didn't get any two-girls-jumping-in photos like we did last year.  Joy didn't mind the lack of company, though.  She jumped quite happily on her own.  And the new twist this time was that she didn't always really need someone to catch her!  She needed someone to jump towards, but there were several jumps where she went in and under and then stood up all on her own, without JoyDad having to touch her at all.On Sunday we stayed in the back yard for our pool play, with a new larger inflatable pool and a big blue bucket.  Joy loves the bucket in particular.  This move I call \"the ostrich\":She was probably drinking the water.  Oh did she drink the water, both at the public pool and at home.  I don't know how she could hold that much -- her subsequent diapers certainly couldn't....Rose invented a new game to distract her sister from consuming the water (perhaps we could call it a non-drinking game?)  This one involved big buckets of dump and splash!  I hasten to add that Joy doesn't mind being deluged.  It makes hairwashing in the tub much easier than it otherwise would be.At least Rose has a sense of fair play and equal opportunity deluge:I can't believe that it's August already.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFYpvJy7b3I/AAAAAAAAAnI/eQMHCPWxQbQ/s1600/swimAug10.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFYpnvn9IOI/AAAAAAAAAnA/DpCNZYyeRc0/s1600/swimAug10b.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFYpe8_2SZI/AAAAAAAAAm4/amjcmRAM5Mo/s1600/swimAug10c.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TFYpRUtjAlI/AAAAAAAAAmw/taWbSlOt85k/s1600/swimAug10d.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/08/all-wet.html", "title": "\nAll Wet\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 14, 2010", "body": "\nI think we're in what might colloquially be called the \"dog days\" of summer.  It's been an unusually warm week, with unusual humidity, an energy-sapping combination.  And then to add injury to lethargy, along came swarms of mosquitoes.  I'm surprised that the wretched level of mosquito-ness didn't arrive earlier in the summer, as wet as it's been around here.  But we suddenly hit plague level about a week and a half ago, where even a solid soaking in repellent didn't keep the critters at bay for me.When I go out to the garden to harvest (beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers!) I put on lots of hot clothing -- jeans, long sleeves, a hat.  In this weather! but that's the only thing that helps the Deet enough to keep me from being sucked dry.Fortunately Joy isn't quite so susceptible, and doesn't get bit much if she's got on a good coat of Off.  It's more important for her, though, because she doesn't have the self-control to keep herself from scratching the bites.  So if she gets bit on the legs, that translates to open sores, and then she has to wear long pants to keep herself from further injury.  In this weather!One thing that's been very nice in this weather, and that's been swimming at the public pool.  Last summer the weather just did not cooperate, plus it was a challenge to keep tabs on Rose while keeping a constant eye on Joy.  We only made it to the pool a couple of times all summer.  This time around, we've been to the pool three times since last report!The most recent pool run was this evening, just me and the girls.  A warm humid day, but the pool felt wonderful, and the mosquitoes apparently don't venture that far out over chlorine or something.  Rose has gotten so self-sufficient, now that she's gotten so much better at swimming and is willing to do the slide on her own.  This evening she ran into a friend from last year's after-school program, and they had a happy time together.Meanwhile, Joy was building on her breath-holding skills.  Last time I reported that she was voluntarily submerging and popping back up.  This time she was going under for 2-3 seconds at a shot, and was propelling herself down to touch the red line on the bottom of the pool that marked the 3ft depth.  Swimming! and experimenting!  She also made some forays where she tried to sit down on the line rather than put a hand on it.I still have to watch her like a hawk, because I want to be aware when she goes under.  Also have to try to catch her if she's going to fill a swim-diaper...No quarter yet, by the way.  But the laxative is working -- got to look for that coin four times today.  And I did find a pink sequin as a consolation prize.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/08/mosquito-days-of-summer.html", "title": "\nThe Mosquito Days of Summer\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "body": "\nI've got a whole list of posts swirling in my head to write -- I guess I ought to at least get something written, and maybe the rest will fall into line in the coming days.It's interesting -- in the world of developmental disabilities and special education, the word transition has come to have a specific meaning: it's the big Transition from school out into the adult world.  There are transition-planning manuals, and transition-planning conferences, and transition-planning laws (in Wisconsin, for example, transition planning has to start in the IEP team at age 14, and at that age the student must be invited to participate as a member of the IEP team.)Heh.We've got a huge transition going here, folks, but it's into school instead of out of it.Transition-into-kindergarten planning for Joy started a couple of years back, when we made the decision to wait an extra year, so that with her early-summer birthday she'd be one of the oldest kids in the class instead of one of the youngest.  Back in February, I described the steps we took to get Joy some formal kindergarten practice, spending several hours of each Tuesday afternoon at the school with her early-education therapists.In April, we had a big summit at the elementary school to put together Joy's IEP, the Individualized Education Program that spells out goals for the upcoming school year, and what services she'll receive that will help her work toward those goals.  Looking back now, I guess I never did blog about that meeting.  It was a huge meeting -- Joy is going to have a LOT of staff working with her.  She's going to have one-on-one attention all the time, safety reasons being paramount but also because that's what it's going to take to work with her in a classroom -- and the school district seems to have quite the commitment to working with kids in the regular classrooms, as much as ever possible.So far, things seem to be falling into place pretty neatly.  Joy was assigned to the teacher whose classroom she got to know in the spring, a fellow with a gentle demeanor who has been assigned clusters of kids with IEPs for the past couple of years.  One of her (typically-developing) classmates will be from a family we're in good contact and on good terms with, so that's a fine development.  Her special-education lead teacher has had the chance to visit her at daycare for a couple of hours, and will be visiting at home the day before school starts to get acquainted.  Joy has had a couple of visits to school, seems comfortable in the classroom (at least when there aren't any other kids there, heh), got to meet the new principal, and got to try potty-routine in the hall-bathroom.We've got another summit with school staff coming up Monday, not an IEP meeting but a chance to share a home-grown document full of details about the amazing progress Joy has made over the summer, and tips for lunch, and a list of the songs she knows and can fill in words for.And a list of the new challenges.  There are some big ones, and it's more than a little scary.The top two are: head-banging, and hitting/hair-pulling/pinching of peers and adults.Just what you want your kid to develop in the months before kindergarten, no?I think I'll just leave that there.  These are switches that we desperately want to flip the other way, as soon as possible.  A new environment and routine might do just that -- or it might escalate these behaviors to whole new heights.Meanwhile, this is all quite a major transition for me.  I wrapped up my summer-job yesterday, so I will truly be going back down to half-time again, as opposed to the 75% time that I've been squeezing in for close to a year.  All those work hours will now take place during school hours, so I can do drop-offs and pick-ups for both girls at school, and eliminate the need for after-school paid care.  A very different routine for me.Think good thoughts for us.  This transition may not be THE big one, but it's pretty much the biggest one so far.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/08/transition.html", "title": "\nTransition\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2010", "body": "\nThe other night, JoyDad and I got to spend some quality time with Joy.  Rose was off with friends for the whole evening, and Joy was delightfully happy, and playful, and interactive.  At one point JoyDad sighed and turned to me and said, \"When she's being sweet, she's just so sweet!\"Which was funny, because I'd already been plotting a post around a rhyme I'd remembered from my childhood:There was a little girl, Who had a little curl, Right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, She was very good indeed, But when she was bad she was horrid. -- Henry Wadsworth LongfellowMasterful use of slant-rhyme (forehead/horrid) -- I guess it makes sense that it comes from a master, though I hadn't known it was Longfellow's work until I went looking it up for this post!Not that the concept of being good doesn't set my teeth on edge.  Sweet behavior and core \"goodness\" are very different things, and we conflate them at our peril.  It's even worse to assign good and horrid intention to a child whose behavior is surely coming from causes we don't fully understand...I gotta say, though, Longfellow's little ditty captures something of the contrasts we've been living with Joy lately.When we're having our good moments, she lets us record her singing, and then sings along again and again as we play it back!  She smiles, she giggles, she initiates interactions, she's truly a joy to be with.The bad moments lately, as I mentioned in my transition post, are rather scary things to have happening as we head toward kindergarten: head-banging, and hitting and hair-pulling.Take Saturday, for example.  Saturday afternoon Joy got up happy from her rest, and we went to a gallery opening.  (Elites that we are.)  Actually, it was a home-grown art show, engineered by an enterprising mama who'd been doing a home-based art camp for her daughters and then displayed the results on the walls of their home and made an event of it.  The girls are in the same grades as Rose & Joy; the older one is on Rose's soccer team, and the younger will be in Joy's kindergarten class.  So far, Joy is the only classmate that younger-daughter knows, and the family has been capitalizing on the fact that there'll be at least one familiar face!Joy was willing to let me lead her around as her classmate-to-be proudly showed off work.  Then we found some Joy-appropriate toys in the play room where she happily settled, despite rather a crunch of other kids romping and making noise.  She loved the snacks: crackers! blueberries! grape tomatoes!  We ended up staying for almost two hours, with nary an outburst or protest in sight.  (OK, she did make one break out of the yard to try & play with a sprinkler on the other side of the cul-de-sac.  But other than that.)This was a different girl entirely from the one her morning autism-therapist encountered.  Joy gave him one of the roughest sessions she's ever thrown at him -- he's usually a favorite for her.  He could hardly make the slightest request of her without getting an over-the-top frustration reaction.  Several of these involved Joy getting down on her hands and knees and trying to pile-driver her head into the floor.The head-banging.  Oh my, the head-banging.We have a whole bag of calming tricks, which we shared at a meeting with her school team yesterday.  These include:singingsoft calm talkingslip a pillow or thick quilt under her headchange of activity / distractionsilly/fun people gamesglider rockerBaby Einstein MP3s/CDchange of venuesit in highchairchewiespillow squishesbouncing on therapy ballback off / alone timepressure to the head / body-sock on the headWe've been trying very hard to take a thoughtful approach to this, trying not to panic, working to figure out the behavior and keep things from escalating, praying that the switches will slide sooner rather than later.  From a behavioral perspective, the headbanging does seem to be a frustration reaction, even though sometimes it doesn't take much to set it off.  (\"Okay, Joy, let's go potty now\"... BANG.)  We also suspect there's a big sensory component.  Some pressure -- quite a bit of head pressure -- feels good.  We'd like to get her to choose other forms of expressing frustration, such as pressing her own hands to her head, or stomping her feet.Of course the question of a helmet has come up in our thoughts.  How could it not?   There's almost an easy-fix feel to the idea of wearing a helmet... at least keep the wearer physically safe, then we can figure out what to do about the behavior itself!  Alas, this is one of those truly not-simple things.  My thinking on the helmet-question has been profoundly influenced by Kristina Chew, who has written a lot about her son Charlie and self-injurious behaviors.  Their experience with head-banging in the past couple of years has taken them through full-time helmet wearing at one school, to a much better experience and very-occasional helmet wearing at his current school.I'm going to quote a particularly relevant paragraph here, from a post of hers that's well worth reading in its entirety: One thing I have learned from all this is that often the most obvious solutions just treat the problem people see, without addressing the deeper causes. Thus did the school district (and their lawyers) insist that Charlie wear a helmet. But that blue plastic apparatus has been the equivalent of a putting a band-aid on something serious that requires much more examination. The \"protection\" offered by the helmet was limited at best. As Jim and I predicted, Charlie banged his head harder while wearing the helmet (which makes for really big holes in the walls). He probably started banging more while wearing the helmet (in part due to the discomfort of the thing?)Joy hates having things on her head.  Won't wear hats, won't wear headphones, no earmuffs, no sunglasses.  We're lucky that she is willing to accept a hood on her parka, because winters can be brutal around here.Imagine the frustration level that could be caused/escalated by forcing Joy to wear an apparatus on her head -- when she's frustrated!No easy answers.  Fortunately the good times far outweigh the horrid, even if we spend a disproportionate time agonizing about the rough stuff.Onward to kindergarten.  Our little girl has her first day tomorrow, at a public school with a fine reputation.  We like what we know of her team so far.  Ready or not, here she comes.

So our first day is September 1.  This is bigger news than usual, because it'll be Joy's first day of kindergarten!We've never been sure how much Joy \"gets\" things that are coming in the future.  It may start to feel more real when she gets a sneak-preview school visit next Tuesday.  Rose, however, is a great anticipator.  She's all excited to learn for sure at registration this evening who her 3rd-grade teacher will be (it should be the same one that she had for 2nd grade, but it isn't guaranteed).She's also mighty excited that her little sister will be joining her at the elementary school in two weeks.We talked about it in the car yesterday morning, after dropping Joy off at her daycare.Rose is particularly pleased that the 3rd graders and the kindergarteners share lunch hour and recess.  Joy's presence benefits her for lunches especially; we've been making Rose take her chances with the hot lunches, which she usually doesn't much care for but she knows that it's her own choice and if she doesn't eat, she'll just be hungry.  With Joy, we can't ask that of her, nor can we inflict the consequences of a cranky-hungry Joy on her afternoon staff!  So I'm going to make sack-lunches for Joy unless they have something awesome like pizza on the menu.  Which means that Rose gets to carry her lunch too, because that would be just too unfair otherwise.  Woohoo for little sisters!We also imagined together a little bit about what recess will be like.  Rose reflected that she usually comes out of the building together with several close friends, whom she named.  But, she assured me, the first thing she'd do is go over and greet her sister, and make sure that her friends did so too.Then she thought a bit... \"I usually play foursquare and Joy won't do that so I might not play with her so much.\"  I mentioned that one of the things Joy loves to do is swing on the tire swing, and that maybe they could start recess by swinging together.  The tire swing is a highly desirable piece of equipment, and kids line up to take turns both riding and pushing.  Rose mentioned that maybe she could line up and push when it was Joy's turn to ride.  I countered that it might be nicer just at first if she'd be willing to help Joy stand in line and ride with her.\"Well, I do love Joy,\" she said.  \"So I'll do whatever.\"You and me both, sweetheart.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 1, 2010", "body": "\nWith the barest little bit of hindsight, I see that I could have framed my expectations differently, going into the first day of kindergarten.I could have thought: well, Joy has been having some pretty rough therapy sessions lately, especially in the mornings -- and these are with familiar people, in familiar territory.  How about we make that the bar for first-week expectations.   If it's better than those sessions, we'll be doing fine.  Just get her acquainted with the new staff, probably mostly in pull-out situations because the classroom is also new and the number of classmates will likely be overwhelming.  If she gets through the days without us being called in for a rescue, that'll be a victory.If I had gone in with that mindset?  Today was a victory.  Joy was dry-eyed and in reasonably good spirits when I picked her up, and has been pretty happy this evening too.  She was dressed in the same clothes she went in with, and had no bruises on her forehead (though she did have some teeth-bruises on her knees, some of which I saw her make.)I did not go in with that mindset.This was the first day of kindergarten, after all!  My last baby's first day, and we'd prepared soooo much.Delaying kindergarten a year.  Kindergarten practice this past winter and spring.  Visits this month from Joy's new staffers both at home and at daycare.  Taking Joy to the school to meet her new classroom-teacher and spend time in the classroom, and again with her early-ed teacher from last year, just to get into the halls once more.  Creating an extra document on top of the IEP, sort of an update to the present-level but all full of tips and tricks on what goes into Joy's day -- and then meeting with pretty much her whole team on Monday for over an hour to go over it.Sending extra goodies -- nap tent, a bag full of stimmies, special bag lunch of favorite treatsI figured that we'd get there early enough to try & park fairly close to the school, greet the staffers, get Joy's backpack sitting at the right place by the school building, take some photos, swing on the tire swing, say hi to friends and their families.  Then between me & and an aide, we could help Joy file into the building with her classmates, put her stuff in her locker, and accompany her through the first couple of minutes of class time.  Then I'd give her a kiss and go unwind at the parents' coffee break in the library, then head off to work -- while Joy would begin life in her new classroom, heavily supported but included as the class community-building process began.I'd set the bar way too high.We had parking problems.  The playground was noisy and overwhelming, and Joy got upset. Began to build a reputation right away for kicking other kids.  The classes got lined up late, and we escaped into the building ahead of them with her special ed teacher.  But we couldn't stay in the classroom, because the morning snacks were all laid out on plates with a nametag for each kid's place.  The teacher and I had talked about whether this would be a problem, I over-optimistically had said to go ahead and try his usual way, and he'd kindly set out the animal crackers we'd contributed so Joy would be sure to like the first day's snack.  She liked it all right -- wanted to eat immediately.  Ramped up the upset when she couldn't.  We had to exit the classroom and go to the special ed teacher's office/playspace to start the day.As we were trying to get Joy calmed down, she whacked me in the nose.  And I started bawling.  Could not stop.  Haven't been in this bad a shape since one wretched incident not long after she was diagnosed (will have to tell you all about that one  sometime).  Just as I'd start to get a handle on myself, I'd hear the other kids in the class singing happily together, or Joy would pull a self-injury attempt, and I'd start up again.  I probably should have left sooner than I did, but I was there long enough that Joy actually did get calmed down and was sharing some nice moments with the spec. ed teacher.  I guess I still hadn't ditched the expectations, because I then ventured to say that it might be nice if Joy could at least share snack with the class.  So we went out to check things out.Alas, they were not yet ready to eat snack.  And the classroom teacher -- not having seen Joy come in -- had marked her absent and had to go change the designation.  And we couldn't deny Joy the snack at that point, so she inhaled her crackers, demanded more (because since nobody else was eating, there were the rest of those full plates), and got all wound up again when she couldn't have more.  Back to the pull-out room she went.  And I lit out of the building with a swollen face and the ugly-cry just welling up all over, and called in sick to work.That's our victory, there.  If I'd gone in with the right set of expectations and all.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/09/bringing-kindergarten-expectations-down.html", "title": "\nBringing Kindergarten Expectations Down to Earth\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "body": "\nI'd read a lot of blogging about the phenomenon.  About how kids on the spectrum (and some kids not!) put so much effort into keeping their heads above water at school, keeping it all together during the day.  Then they get home where they're comfortable and can let their hair down -- and all hell breaks loose.I read about it again just this week, as my dear bloggy friend Jess described an absolute mess of an inconsolable evening.  Her daughter's aide at school later said, \"When I saw how hard she was working to manage herself and to redirect her energy when the stress was too much, I knew full well that we were purchasing our morning with your evening.\"We'd gotten the warning from our Agency 2 autism-therapy team leader as well, who cautioned us to be very careful about how much therapy we might be planning to load into the evenings of a kiddo who was going to be working very hard all day at school.  We ended up deciding to use the start of the school year as a transition point from intensive-level therapy (24 hours per week in Joy's case) to a \"post-intensive\" level of 8 hours per week.So how have things been going at home, this first week of full school days, now that Joy's recovered from that fever she had?First off, I get the most amazing hugs when I pick her up from school in the afternoon.  She crawls up into my arms and hangs on me while I hear about the day from her aide.  It feels like somewhat like a big sigh of relief, even though she (of course) doesn't verbalize it.  Mama.  You're here.Tuesday, the first afternoon home this week, we chanced things with an impromptu playdate at our house, a family that has an older sib for Rose and a younger sib for Joy.  Joy and her friend spent the time happily in the playroom, crashing on the pillows & couch, crawling through the play-tunnel.  Joy was more interested in bouncing on her exercise ball and looking at herself in the full-length mirror, while her friend was more interested in filling plates with play-food to serve the mamas, but when they interacted, there were smiles and giggles.Wednesday we had the first encounter with an evening therapy session after a full day of school.  Joy was so happy to see her barista.  At the end of the session, the barista commented that Joy really seemed to be taking delight in familiar games with a familiar person.  There's that sense of relief again...Thursday, we went to the park after school with the same friends as on Tuesday, plus one extra.  Joy was once again in a good mood, and spent a fair amount of time on the little merry-go-round with all four of the other kids, despite much noisiness from the older ones.Maybe it's a honeymoon, maybe it's a fluke, maybe it will all fall apart this evening or next week.  But so far, this week's expectation-shattering has been every so much nicer than last week's expectation-shattering.I oughtta have figured out by now to expect the unexpected!P.S.

{"date": "Sunday, September 19, 2010", "body": "\nGiven the way that September 1st and Labor Day hit this year, the first week of school had only three days; the second week had only 4; and it wasn't till this past week that we really had a full-fledged 5-day school week.I think Joy's starting to realize that school is for real, not just a temporary state of affairs.  She's not entirely thrilled about the new normal, and she's showing it in less-than-ideal ways any time she has to do something she doesn't want to do.  Like, for example, get dropped off for the day to begin.  The other day she was fine until I parked the car at the school.  Then she tried to chomp me when I unbuckled her carseat.  When her special ed teacher greeted her at the door, and said \"hi,\" Joy responded with an angry \"bye-bye!\"  Then she made no less than four swat/bite attempts on the way down the hallway to the locker.Joy's schedule during the day is heavily modified, with one-on-one attention at all times.  She's with the class for only a few times during the day -- part of the morning welcome routine, lunch, some recess, some afternoon free-time.  In general, though, the classroom and its occupants are pretty much overwhelming for her.  She even eats morning snack separately, for now at least.  Otherwise she bolts her food so fast that she finishes long before anyone else, and then gets upset that the other students still have food but she doesn't.Joy's unwelcome behaviors (biting, swatting, hair pull, etc.) are mostly happening in pretty clear communicative contexts: she's being asked to do something she doesn't want to do.  Like, enter the danged school building in the first place.  Alas, it's not just a matter of teaching her more appropriate ways to communicate her displeasure (tell us \"all-done\" instead of biting, for example).  Unfortunately, whether she bites or (in our dreams) politely says, \"No thank you,\" we can't honor the communication/request.  She's still got to enter that building, go to her locker, etc.  So there's not really any percentage in it for her to switch communication, because she's still not going to get what she wants.  Sigh.At least she got to get out and have fun for a while yesterday at the annual church campout.  As has been the case the past two years, we had an almost-didn't-go scenario.  This year, the weather was the wild card.  Saturday morning JoyDad and I awoke at 4am to this stuff pounding down:Can't believe that Joy & Rose slept through it, though they both woke with the thunder half an hour later and I'm not sure either of them got any further sleep.   Though the forecast for Saturday was threatening, the rain held off well enough that Rose & I went out to join the campout gathering after lunch, where she ran around on the trails with her friends, and I got to toss a frisbee around with some of our congregation's Ultimate Frisbee players.  JoyDad brought Joy out for the potluck supper part of the event, and she happily ran up and down the path to the group campsite, stopping to play with stones and acorns.We didn't stay for the singing around the campfire this year to see if Elvis would make an appearance -- too wiped out from the previous night's poor sleep.  Those who did stay got their tents rained on overnight, so I think we made the right call.  We'll hope to be able to stay over at next year's event, depending on what's going on with Joy (and with us) a year from now.  I wonder what she'll have to tell us by then, either directly or indirectly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TJZt1S-f0hI/AAAAAAAAAoc/d6epZwXhysI/s1600/hail2.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/09/behavior-as-communication.html", "title": "\nBehavior as Communication\n"},

The designated replacement term is \"intellectual disability.\" I'm happy to report that Rosa's Law has now become actual law, signed by President Obama yesterday.  Disability Scoop reports that the measure was approved unanimously by Congress (an amazing development, getting THIS Congress to agree on anything!!)  The actual changes will take effect over time, as the relevant documents come up for revision.If I weren't convinced already that \"intellectual disability\" is a step from an increasingly-pejorative term to a less-freighted one, a comment from mama edge on my last year's post would have sealed it for me:You really helped me today. I've been unable to talk to Taz about his mental retardation, but I think I could definitely talk to him about his intellectual disability.That's the level of what's at stake here!Now, I'm under no illusions that intellectual disability won't pick up its own negative freight.  After all, mental retardation was an immense step forward in its day, from terms like moron and idiot into a more clinical term of art.  But now it has become a casual insult, like its predecessors.  It's time for it to go.Maybe the next time we switch terms, a few decades down the pike, we'll be able to come up with one with few enough syllables that it doesn't torpedo the reading level of any document containing it!Meanwhile -- intellectual disability is the latest and greatest.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 12, 2010", "body": "\nAutumn has come to this part of the country, with chilly nights and turning leaves.  As we planned for our annual fall getaway to close up the family cabins for the season, I watched the fall-color map on the weather.com web site.  Fall-color watching is a tourism activity in and of itself, and the past two years the leaves were pretty much at \"peak color\" when we closed up the cabins.  The fall-color forecast maps gave us reason to hope that the same might be true this year.But as dawn broke on our drive north, it was clear that the traditional peak had come and gone.  Aside from the evergreens and a few bright splashes of yellow birch leaves, everything had already fallen.And guess what?  From Joy's perspective, it was just perfect.  The forest floor, and even the roads, had a thick coat of crunchy leaves to shuffle and kick.  The leaves helped distract from the stim that's been driving me & JoyDad crazy lately, which involves grabbing handfuls of dirt and trickling the soil down onto her own body or hair.  With all the leaves around, she was more interested in making careful bouquets of the bright birch leaves, assembling and twirling the stems in her hand.  Lovely, and much less messy.Rose enjoyed the fallen leaves too.  She and JoyDad went hiking up into the woods, to find the continental divide between the Lake Michigan & Lake Superior watersheds that runs through the family property.  Rose also used red & yellow leaves to decorated the chains on the rickety old metal swingset, which was just the right height for Joy to swing all by herself this year.Other highlights:Joy went swimming (Swimming! In the lake! In October!Rose went fishing with her uncles and learned to cast.Joy learned to drink from a soda can.Rose played her first game of dice with the grownups in the evening.Joy actually echoed the name of the lake, for the first time ever!We saw some ruffed grouse in the woods -- but not in the cabins.The weather was stunning all weekend -- shirtsleeve weather, blue skies, minimal insect issues.The starry skies at night went on forever.Unfortunately, vacation is never forever.

{"date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "body": "\nHow many of you, other than health care professionals, have actually read all the way through a package insert for a medication?  If you are taking or administering any meds that come in their original packaging (as opposed to pills that the pharmacy counts into their own bottle), you've probably at least seen them -- a large thin sheet of paper, covered with miniscule type, folded into a small square.  I have to confess, I usually don't go into such depth, preferring to seek summary information online if I need more than what the doctor tells me verbally.But package inserts are available online too, and I've been poring over a particular one: Abilify (aripiprazole), one of two FDA-approved meds for \"treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder (including symptoms of aggression towards others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods)\" in children ages 6 to 17 years.  The Abilify insert prints out to eighteern 8.5x11 pages in two columns of something like 8-point type.  It's so long because Abilify is approved for use in 6 other ways other than pediatric autistic irritability, including particular situations around depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar I disorder.  For all seven indications, the insert has to recount studies, warnings, side effects, dosing, etc.Here are some of the things I learned about Abilify from the insert:\"The mechanism of action of aripiprazole, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder... (etc.), is unknown.\"  In other words, studies show that it works, but we don't quite know why.  Yikes.These were placebo-controlled trials, so some study participants got the drug, while others got a sugar pills, and they didn't know which they were getting.  10% of participants who got Abilify dropped out of the trial due to side-effects.  Meanwhile, 8% of participants who got the sugar-pill dropped out due to \"side-effects\"!!  Oh, the things we see when we're expecting to see them...21% of participants on the drug reported sedation; 17% reported fatigue.  But at a lower dose (which can be effective), the reports of fatigue were only 3.8%.  The insert didn't note any dose-differential on reporting sedation.  One in five is pretty high.  Something to think about for sure.There's a seizure-precaution in the \"Warnings\" section of the insert -- and of course Joy has epilepsy, though it's been well-controlled for over two years now.  A small number of participants did have seizures during the trials.  For the peds studies, that was 1 in 611, combining the autism studies with the bipolar & schizophrenia studies.  This does not scare me so much as one might think; up to 40% of people with autism experience seizures, and one of the times those seizures tend to come on is adolescence -- as in, the age of quite a few of the study participants.One thing I didn't find on the insert was anything about differences between boys and girls.  Which isn't surprising, since there are 4 boys with autism to every one girl, so the \"not looking at the issue\" shortcoming is shot through autism research in general.  But still.Perhaps you can guess why we're investigating this, given my earlier reports on Joy's difficult entry into kindergarten, and the injuries she's been causing to self and others since.The vast majority (95%-ish?) of the \"explosive acts,\" as we've been calling them, happen in 3 limit-setting situations:-- Joy wants something she can't have-- Joy has to do something she doesn't want to do-- Joy has to stop something she's enjoyingHer response is explosive and swift, with no warning to allow intervention.  Her Agency 2 staffers call it \"zero-to-sixty.\"  For a while, based on a school tally that started mid-September, up to half the \"explosives\" were directed outward, mostly at staff since that's who she's mostly with, but at other kids too when they're in range.  Which means, of course, that it doesn't feel safe to have her around her classmates much.I think she's bitten 4 (or 5?) staffers badly enough that they've had to seek medical attention.Interestingly, things have gotten some better in recent weeks.  We haven't really had a day described as bad/challenging by school staff since our trip up north.  There are more stretches of contentment at school, leading to notes like \"short but calm music class 10 min -- enjoyed keyboard play.\"  It's felt better at home too. JoyDad and I feel less under assault, less on pins & needles.  On the other hand, the total \"explosive acts\" tally at school is still in the range of 20 to 40 per day: biting, hitting, hairpulling, headbanging.  It's just shifted to self-inflicted rather than outwardly-directed.  There's been enough self-hairpulling that her hair is getting noticeably thinner again, though not (yet?) near the level it was last year when her hair became a stim toy and we had to cut it all off.The psychiatrist we've consulted with Joy is ready to start her on Abilify right away if we want.  We are still mulling.  We may start this week, or wait a week ro two and see if things continue to improve such that the tally goes down.  Either way, we are thinking not to tell Joy's school staff or Agency 2 therapists what we've decided (nor you, gentle readers, as the staff & therapists do check in with Elvis Sightings).  We're hoping that their (blinded) observations might serve as a counterweight to ours, which will obviously be informed by a knowledge of whether we're giving Joy the drug or not.One final note.  Up until now I have not named any medications on this blog, other than one incident with JoyDad.  That has always felt like a bridge too far in terms of privacy.  However, in our information-search about Abilify (and Risperdal, the other of the two), one thing I did was do a Google Reader search on all the blogs I follow.  I came across gems like this: Overnight, it seemed last December, the amp was turned down on his rage. His ability could shine without the glare of interruption or explosion. Suddenly, there was a filter on his impulses and reactions. (But it only lasted 10 months, as the post went on to elaborate.) Or this:Enter Abilify. This tiny little pill instantly and quite dramatically reduced (X)'s aggressive impulses. I'll never forget when, just a few days after starting taking it, (X) gave me a big hug and excitedly reported: \"Mom, I don't feel like hitting you anymore!\" I still get chills thinking about that day. It was miraculous.I know, these are anecdotes, not studies.  But it sure helps put a face on some of what the studies have to report.  And by naming drug-names in this case, I'll be putting Joy's experience into the hopper for future questioners who think to do a search in their blog reader (or just on Google in general).Think good thoughts for us, whatever we decide to do these next few weeks.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.abilify.com/", "http://www.abilify.com/", "http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_abilify.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/10/musings-on-package-insert.html", "title": "\nMusings on a Package Insert\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 5, 2010", "body": "\nAbout a month ago, as we were vacationing up at the family cabins, we noticed that something looked a little different about Joy's smile.  One of her two lower front teeth was just slightly displaced, poking forward just a fraction.Her first loose tooth!  At the age of 6 1/2, the time was right.I had wondered how this was going to go.  What would Joy think?  Would it bother her?  Would she wiggle it all day and night?  Would she even notice?  Would she swallow it in her sleep?Her experience was so different than mine.  I was a mega-wimp about my first loose tooth.  I had an over-active imagination and was terribly afraid of pain.  Those jokes that grown-ups always make, about getting out the pliers or tying a string to the tooth & doorknob, scared me silly.  I ended up going far out of my way to keep that wiggly tooth from notice, wouldn't let anyone touch it, barely touched it myself.  Eventually it got so loose it came out when I bit into a grape. (Update: the caption on the first picture in my Nov. 8 post, in my old photo album, says that my second one came out on the same day as the first, and I brushed it out with my toothbrush.  Doesn't mention the grape.  Amazing what we remember, and don't.)Joy, on the other hand, didn't seem to notice much.  I helped her wiggle it a bit from time to time, but figured that nature could take its course.And then I saw the adult tooth pop through.  Behind the baby tooth, like a shark, rather than underneath.  Arggh.  I immediately had visions of an extraction at a dentist appointment, complete with sedation.So I started wiggling harder.  Several times a day, I'd tell Joy \"wiggle, wiggle!\" and see if I could get into her mouth to loosen that tooth.  It turned out to be one of those moments when sensory-seeking worked in our favor.  She soon learned to echo \"wiggle, wiggle\" and open up for me -- and let me really wiggle it good, sometimes even bloody.  More often than not, after I gave it one good wiggle, she'd reach for my hand and show me that she wanted me to do it again!The tooth was stubborn, but it did get looser and looser.  Last night, as I was giving it the big wiggle treatment, it finally popped out.Look at the spike that thing still had on it!And look at the big-girl grin afterwards:We're not doing tooth-fairy.  It just doesn't make sense with Joy at this point.  We are doing a special homemade waffle breakfast with home-grown frozen strawberries, though.

In Joy's (still rough) kindergarten entry right now, the obvious comparison is to her neurotypical classmates, with whom she's not able to spend very much time at all right now.There are many other ways to compare destructively, though.  One can make comparisons along the autism spectrum, for example.  As in, my child is less impaired than your child, so we can at least feel superior there.  Or -- my child is more impaired, so I should feel sorry for myself and you should feel sorry for me and we all should feel sorry for him/her.  Or cross-disability comparisons -- I just read an interesting piece at Reports from a Resident Alien from a spectrum perspective, cautioning people with autism against falsely building themselves up at the expense of people with other more \"severe\" disabilities.Funny enough, parent bloggers do the compare thing to ourselves too.  For example, I've been seeing a delightful set of new spectrum-parent-bloggers setting up blogshop, and find my recent blogging to stack up poorly next to the wit and the insights and the speedy build-up of followings and commenters... as I am posting less often, less in-depth, finding it harder to find suitable words to write about this part of the journey.  Difficult not to cringe at the comparison.  My dear friend over at Autism in a Word wrote recently about her struggle with becoming too focused on the hit counter and the pats-on-the-back in the comments.  I may need to consider doing as she did, and taking a blogging break... but depriving myself of this community might not be healthy for me either.Then there's the self-flagellation self-comparison within the professional sphere, eloquently expressed over at Professor Mother (another fine relatively-new blog).  Oh, does it resonate.  I'd been hoping that all the wonderful new knowledge and contacts I'd gained through the LEND program last year would create some new opportunities for me on the professional score, an area of my life that's been less than ideal in recent years -- but that's not turning out to be a obvious path either, particularly in this economy.I need to figure out how to hang on to being \"big for me\" and keep out of the destructive comparison cycle.  Sometimes it's just not easy to see.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://chaoticidealism.livejournal.com/85084.html", "http://bigdaddyautism.com/", "http://www.starkravingmadmommy.com/", "http://www.autismarmymom.com/", "http://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/on-comments/", "http://professormother.com/2010/10/01/professional-switzerland/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/10/whole-lotta-comparing-goin-on.html", "title": "\nWhole Lotta Comparing Goin' On\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 9, 2010", "body": "\nNOTE: For more information, including links to all my posts on autism insurance in Wisconsin, visit Wisconsin Autism Insurance - Updates from Elvis Sightings===========I recently had a visitor to this site who arrived via the following Google search: \"state of wisconsin no cap on autism insurance\"I think this means that it's time to address autism insurance issues again!  [Updated 11/13 to add: I am a well-informed lay-person on these issues, but not in any official capacity.  (Want to hire me?)  My links are good, but my writing does not have official backing or vetting of any organization.]Here's the very quick recap: Wisconsin's governor Jim Doyle signed an autism insurance requirement as part of the state budget on June 29, 2009; requiring certain insurers to cover intensive-level autism treatment to the tune of $50,000 per year (with age limits and for a total of four years), and post-intensive at $25,000 per year (no age limits). I've been documenting this for several years along the way, and have a separate page on this site compiling my writings on the subject.  Here also are some links with more information on Wisconsin's autism insurance requirement. The budget legislation containing the autism insurance requirement (in PDF)FAQ on Autism Insurance from the WI Department of Health Services (DHS)FAQ on Autism Insurance (in PDF) from the WI Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI)WI OCI Rule on Autism Insurance (in PDF) [updated 11/13 to add: this is the final rule, that went into force October 1, 2010]I'll do another post on how that's all going.  It's been an interesting ride.  Joy's experience has been relatively smooth, though not without frustrating questions along the way.  Other people's experiences have been much rockier.Now another very fine development is coming down the pike -- with the potential to be an immense help to some Wisconsin residents, but also adding an extra layer of confusion and uncertainty until the details are worked out.  This new development involves the lifting of the $50,000 and $25,000 caps.On October 3, 2008, then-president George W. Bush signed Public Law 110-343, the Paul Wellstone & Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.  This law is aimed at group health plans with more than 50 employees that provide mental health and substance abuse coverage as part of their benefits.  The law aims to ensure that mental health financial requirements and treatment limitations are no more restrictive than what the plan specifies for medical and surgical benefits.  There's a fine factsheet at Mental Health America that goes into much more detail.The Wellstone/Domenici Act of 2008 was initially supposed to take effect Jan. 2009, but the insurance rules were not hammered out and published until Feb. 2, 2010.  Here is the link to the applicable rule in the U.S. Federal Register (in PDF). On page 11 of the above-linked rule, under applicability date, it says the rules are effective for plan-years beginning on or after July 1, 2010.Governor Doyle heralded the federal legislation and rules, and made it very clear his administration's interpretation that mental health parity applies to autism, in a March 1, 2010 press release under the headline: Governor Doyle Announces Expanded Health Insurance Coverage will Benefit Families with AutismNew Federal Laws Will Further Help Children with Autism Access Full Treatment[Update 11/13, paragraph & quote added] More importantly and officially, this is also the position of Wisconsin's Insurance Commissioner, as included in the final WI OCI rule on autism insurance, which went into effect this October.  On page 4, the rule explicitly includes the position that federal mental health parity applies to autism in Wisconsin:Although there is no direct federal guidance that autism spectrum disorders are subject to federal parity requirements, it is the position of the Commissioner that parity for autism services does apply to group health plans with more than 50 employees based upon preliminary review of the regulations.We've been aware for some time that at least one of the large health plans in Wisconsin has been pro-active about lifting the caps for autism insurance coverage -- because if you don't have similar caps for surgical/medical treatment, you can't have them for mental health treatment including autism.  For us, that's slated for January 1 when our plan renews.However, we've heard that other plans are not addressing this, or have been trying to push the issue off till January 2012.Part of this was apparently being enabled by the State of Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds, the entity that administers health plans for State of Wisconsin employees.  Their parameters for plans covering state employees were originally written to allow the caps to remain in place for the extra year.  When JoyDad found out about this, the phone-calls and e-mails flew, buttressed by the links from the Federal Register and Doyle's press-release -- making it clear that the effective date needs to be January 2011 for state plans and that Governor Doyle's press release made it very clear that his office interprets the parity legislation to apply to autism. It might have been coincidence (but I think not) when JoyDad got a communication from ETF saying that, after further review, their legal counsel determined that the autism benefit dollar limit would, after all, need to be lifted for state-employee plans beginning January 1, 2011.  The correction has been posted, and here's the quote:On Page 72, the Schedule of Benefits in Uniform Benefits erroneously lists dollar limits for Autism Spectrum Disorders. The bullet should be removed.On Page 97, Item 6, Coverage of Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorders erroneously lists dollar limits for the benefit in the second to last sentence. It should read: \u201cBenefits are payable for intensive-level and nonintensive-level services.Our insurance plan will be lifting the autism-coverage cap for our (state-government-employee) plan starting January 2011, as they had intended.All the other insurance plans that compete for state employee coverage will have to do likewise.  It's unclear what this may mean for their non-state-employee plans.  If your health insurance plan in Wisconsin is not intending to lift the caps when your plan renews, you might want to use information and links from this post to help you advocate with them.The upshot: Wisconsin state government employee insurance plans, and at least one forward-looking insurance company more generally, are lifting the autism coverage caps as of January 2011.Other insurance companies are not yet on board.Still other insurance companies are not included in Wisconsin's autism insurance mandate in the first place, nor by Wisconsin's version of mental health parity.  A somewhat smaller set is not even included in the federal version of mental health parity.And, there's been a big election here.  For the past two years in Wisconsin, both houses of the legislature plus the governorship have been in the hands of the Democratic party.  In the wake of the 2010 elections, all three have flipped Republican -- and quite hard-right Republican at that.  I have been told that the new governor Scott Walker has some insight into, and support for, autism-related issues.  I also know that the Republican party has not been supportive of insurance mandates in general. [Updated 11/13 to add the following sentence] And, the Insurance Commissioner is appointed by the governor. Stay tuned.  This story is still being written.Meanwhile, if any of you know how mental health parity is playing out in other states regarding autism coverage, please share in the comments!UPDATE 11/11 -- This post originally included a paragraph about 2009 WI Act 218, the Wisconsin Mental Health and Substance Abuse Parity Act, signed by Governor Jim Doyle on April 30, 2010, an act which in general strengthens the Domenici/Wellstone parity act, applying it to smaller companies than the federal legislation.  However, WI Act 218 contains an exception for autism.  The federal act contains no such exception, so the federal rules still apply when it comes to autism (as Governor Doyle celebrated in his press release).\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/acts/09enAB0075-veto2.pdf", "http://dhs.wi.gov/bdds/clts/autism/autismfaq.htm", "http://www.asw4autism.org/Data/FAQ_12-22-09_Autism.pdf", "http://oci.wi.gov/rules/0336fn10.pdf", "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-6983", "http://takeaction.mentalhealthamerica.net/site/PageServer?pagename=Equity_Campaign_detailed_summary", "http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-2167.pdf ", "http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=19&prid=4976", "http://oci.wi.gov/rules/0336fn10.pdf", "http://etf.wi.gov/publications/dc_content/dc_2011/ErrorsforWebStateRG.pdf", "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/acts/09Act218.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/11/autism-insurance-and-mental-health.html", "title": "\nAutism Insurance and Mental Health Parity in Wisconsin\n"},

The pecan pie (complete with caramel candy and rum) was about the best ever.

For Joy, she chose a non-traditional present of two little bundles of curly-ribbons from the gift-wrap aisle.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!  For Rose, a Barrel of Monkeys, with which she played as if it were a brand-new invention.For Joy's delight in tossing the curly ribbons back and forth in a \"my-turn, your-turn\" game with AuntieS's mother-in-law -- with whom Joy has never actually played before.For my amazing 101-year-old grandmother, whom we helped to move into assisted living quarters last Thanksgiving.  Not that she felt quite ready for the move at age 100, mind you.  Her new apartment is bright and comfortable, and she's among the least \"assisted\" of the residents there.  She took us on a tour of the building, she played cards and dominoes with Rose, she and I compared reading lists, she took us out to dinner!For the family of Joy's playdate pal J-Cat, who loaned us a portable DVD player for the trip, making Baby Einstein possible at Great-Grandma's and in the car.For the swimming pool at the hotel, so the girls could work off some of their energy while JoyDad (who did ALL the driving) and Great-Grandma could take an afternoon break.For zero \"acts of ow\" between Joy and Rose for the entire trip cooped up in the car -- right up until a hair-pull when we had arrived back home in our own driveway and I wasn't getting Joy out of the car quickly enough to suit.For Joy's success in putting a few carefully-chosen ornaments onto our little artificial Christmas tree, and for Rose's delight in decorating the rest of it.For seventeen years of marriage between JoyMama and JoyDad, as of yesterday.

This classmate's older sib had been a kindergarten classmate of Rose's three years ago and they're still close, so it was a double-decker playdate of younger girls and older.  This was the first time in several years that the younger sib had come over to really spend significant time with Joy.We started the playdate with all of us walking home from school together, about a 15 minute affair.  On my way to school, I had grabbed a couple of little twigs of pine needles for Joy as I often do, because it's a favorite stimmy of hers.  This time, as Joy's classmate came running over to us instead of heading for the bus, I realized that the pine twigs could be a great tool to invite her into a bit of Joy's world for the walk home.So I gave one twig to Joy (who grabbed it with gusto per usual) and one to her friend.  I explained to the friend that Joy loves to play with pine needles, and had her try the things that Joy likes to do -- tickle herself with the soft needles, twiddle them in her fingers, crush the needles a little bit and take a sniff of the piney aroma.Both girls carried their pine twigs the whole walk home.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TOkd99adgqI/AAAAAAAAAr0/aLdqsKCxZFE/s1600/pinetwigs.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/11/included-walking-home-to-playdate.html", "title": "\nIncluded: Walking Home to a Playdate\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 16, 2010", "body": "\nAs with the autism-insurance post -- it's been a while since I've done one of these!I'm really excited about a new goodie that has come into my sensory-seeking daughter's life lately.I posted briefly at one point about Joy's home-concocted weighted vest.  Unfortunately I never posted a photo, and now it's been disassembled and discarded, alas!  But I'll re-describe it, and then tell you about the newer-and-better version.Foy Joy, a weighted vest helps give her some of the sensory input she so seems to crave.  While she's wearing it, it seems to help her get to a place of being calmer and more focused.  The theory would have it that the effect should last after the vest is removed, which doesn't actually seem to be the case with Joy.  (If you've seen one person with sensory issues, you've seen one person with sensory issues!)  Here's a page with a little more information on weighted vests.Commercial weighted vests can get pretty expensive, and so one of Joy's occupational therapists set her up with a homemade vest based on one of those swim vests with removeable floats.  Looked kind of like a pink barrel.  Take all the floaties out, replace with weights, and there you go!  Add as much or little weight as you need, in consultation with your OT.  Weights can be bags of rice or beans or fishing weights or shot, either plastic baggies swathed in duct tape or homemade cloth beanbags.  Since they're removable, you don't have to worry if the weights can be gotten wet in the wash.  We even added weight with a couple of duct-taped door-hinges!The floaty/weighted vest worked well but had some disadvantages.  First, it was obviously not a standard piece of clothing (see barrel comment above), so it sets the wearer apart and people do tend to gawp or ask questions.  Second, it was made of polyester-ish material, liable to snags and runs.  The weights in particular tended to poke out of their pockets eventually.Our new improved replacement is a kiddie fly-fishing vest from L.L. Bean!  We have to credit Joy's kindergarten staff for introducing us to this.  Price is $34.The vest is breatheable and durable, woven cotton instead of the snaggy knit.  It looks like a real garment, and comes in khaki or pale blue or pink.  It has rings on the front to clip chewies on, and one in the back for a caregiver to grab.  It has a clip over the zipper in front to keep the vest on.  And, it has pockets all over the front for weights, plus a big flat zippered pocket for weight in the back!We're using the weights from the old vest.  It's working out really well so far.  This one's a hit.[Update: I just remembered a post from Both Hands & a Flashlight a while back, about their adventures in homemade weighted vests, that you might want to peek at as well.]Another hit with Joy, in general and specifically, is keys.  Real keys, none of your plastic fakes, thank-you-very-much. She loves to handle them, clink them, carry them around, stim on them.  Mama's ring of keys is the ultimate prize -- Mama's got to be very careful not to bring out the keys when Joy might request them and have to be told no, or great unhappiness ensues.So, we've come up with a replacement.These are keys from the hardware store.  They're \"mis-keys\" -- keys that got flubbed up in the process of cutting and had to be discarded.Different hardware stores have different policies with mis-keys.  One store near here cheerfully gave us a whole handful for free.  Another said sorry, but they return them to the manufacturer for some sort of refund.  Yet a third tosses all their mis-keys and metal shavings into a big ol' bucket that you can dig through and choose the keys you want for twenty-five cents a pop.The ring of keys pictured above is connected to a mega-chewelry bracelet from National Autism Resources.  I'd initially bought a cheapo curly-bracelet keychain at the hardware store, but when Joy started chewing on it, the teeth marks stayed and the bracelet got deformed very quickly.  The real thing is worth the extra money.We've also recently acquired a ChewEase Clip-on Chewy Tube from National Autism Resources.  The product has a plastic clip at one end, attached to a chewelry-type coil with a key-ring and a chewy-tube at the other end.  Yes, I did say \"key-ring.\"  You could see how this product might work together with our keys obsession...Just be careful to track the keys when your kiddo is carrying them about.  We've lost two sets on the prairie, one because she dropped them when I wasn't looking, the other because I apparently hadn't fully joined Joy's key-ring to the ChewEase key ring and it wiggled off.   I do hope that, if anybody found them, they didn't knock themselves out trying to find the poor soul who's been locked out of a non-existent home & office & car!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sensory-processing-disorder.com/weighted-vests.html", "http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/40367?feat=40364-ppxs&dds=y", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TN6DzASqRlI/AAAAAAAAArU/mrvAO_uPDBI/s1600/vest.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TN7K2nfkj0I/AAAAAAAAArc/Y3yI-OBPCy4/s1600/weighted-vest.jpg", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/", "http://www.bothhandsandaflashlight.com/2009/07/06/be-our-vest-be-our-vest-we-love-our-weighted-vests/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TN7MAoEnP-I/AAAAAAAAArk/cQA_CmCIHr8/s1600/keys.jpg", "http://www.nationalautismresources.com/mega-brac.html", "http://www.nationalautismresources.com/clip-on-chewy-tube.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/11/product-hits-and-misses-sensory-seeker.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits and Misses: Sensory Seeker Edition\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 22, 2010", "body": "\nSaturday night I sat with Joy on the couch, helping her brush her teeth as per our bedtime routine.  Joy was very tired, drifting toward sleep.  Then all of a sudden, her legs made a swift jerking motion.Any other kid, and my first thought would be that it was the kind of jerk-awake thing that happens as sleep threatens to overtake you.  But since it's Joy -- first thought was: seizure?!?I asked JoyDad if he'd seen that jerky motion, and what it looked like to him.  No, he'd been looking the other way... but that reminded him, at snacktime earlier in the day, Joy had zoned out for a few seconds.  It felt somehow beyond just lost-in-thought, really seemed \"not there.\"  And he'd briefly thought: seizure?!? but then she was back and it slipped his mind until my question.So, was it or wasn't it?And, if it was, what was it about?If it was, we've got several potential culprits to consider.One thought is that she's been growing like a weed, and it's been a long time since we upped her seizure meds (no change in dose since the seizures stopped over two years ago.)Another thought is the whole thing about the ramifications of switching between manufacturers in the use of generic epilepsy drugs.  Since I wrote about the issue in July, our drugstore has switched manufacturers on that particular medication every time we have renewed that prescription.  Every single $*#&% time!  And we cracked open the newest bottle from the latest manufacturer just a few days ago.Yet a third thought is the Abilify.  Yes, even though I said I wasn't going to tell you, I'm telling you now.  We started a couple of weeks ago and it has not gone as we hoped, which is an whole 'nother post in and of itself.  But she's still on it as of this writing.  More important to today's reflections is that Abilify does have a seizure-caution in the package-insert, because one person did start having seizures during the clinical trial, which could easily have been pure chance due to the population -- or not.  We did get the OK to start Abilify from Joy's pediatric neurologist, who didn't think it was likely to change her seizure threshold.  But Joy has proven to be unusually sensitive to Abilify in a number of ways, even at half the dose of the smallest pill.So maybe it was.  But maybe it wasn't.  We didn't see anything at all seizure-ish on Sunday.For now, we're watching and waiting.  And hoping and praying.We'd love it if you'd join us in the hope-and-pray part.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/11/was-it-or-wasnt-it.html", "title": "\nWas It, Or Wasn't It?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2010", "body": "\nMonday night marked an important milestone in our family.It was the first time EVER that all of us slept on adult-size beds!Ever since Joy first climbed out of her crib, long time since, we've been using one form of tent or another to keep her safe during night-times and rest-times.  She doesn't protest the enclosure at all -- I think it makes her feel safe too -- but if it's not there, she's up and about in a flash.  Won't stay still long enough to have any chance at sleep, and her bedroom is not currently safe to be up-and-about in the middle of the night.  (We're having some modifications done.  But still.)I wrote about tented products in my very first Product Hits and Misses post two years ago.  Crib tent from Tots-in-Mind was a huge hit, making the crib usable all the way up to age 6 and a half!  Pack-n-play tent was helpful but fiddly, making overnight travel possible but it always took such a long time to set up, plus it's definitely got a size limit to it.  The PeaPod Plus travel bed, which took the place of the Pack-n-Play tent, was an astonishingly fine find.  Good up to age 6 depending on kid-size, this portable tent sets up in one springy motion (though you do have to pump up the little air mattress to insert in the base separately).  It folds away with nearly equal ease.  We've used this for both travel and out-of-home napping for two years, at daycare and now at kindergarten.  Amazing product.Less amazing was the Pacific Play Tents Secret Castle Twin Bed Tent.  This product fit over a twin mattress, and we'd hoped that it might serve a containment purpose for Joy with a few modifications (for example, the front door zipper only went top-to-bottom, but the base of the door was open, so I tried to modify that with snaps.)  Not only could Joy get out easily, but the tent was poorly ventilated and also wasn't well-set-up for bedding.  Big miss, alas.Well, since we did that product search two years ago, a new invention has come on the scene.  May I present: the Nickel Bed Tent from Ready, Set, Bloom LLC.This parent-invented product came about due to the needs of a youngster with autism (named Nick, hence the Nickel Bed.)  It's sized for a twin mattress like the play tent I just mentioned, but unlike the play tent, with the Nickel Bed you insert the mattress INTO the tent, so you can put a full set of bedding on it.  The tent has great ventilation, and zippers open on three sides: two long sides plus one end.  It also comes with little carabiners for hooking the zippers together, assuming you don't want them to be unzipped from the inside.Joy loves her new tent.  She popped right in with no trouble at all, snuggled the familiar blankets, went right to sleep.  Two nights now, no troubles.  We've started with an air mattress, but a \"real\" mattress is on order and with any luck will be able to pick it up today.  Rose is a little bit envious, but she got to move to her own room with a queen-size platform bed some time ago, so I think she'll deal.The tent is proving popular enough to keep selling out.  It was on back-order when we discovered it, and is now on back-order again.  The inventors/proprietors of Ready, Set, Bloom have been making tweaks to improve the product with each new batch from the factory, so the tent is apparently still a work in progress.  The price is good: the current iteration sells for $139.99 (I think we paid $125).  Compare that to a hospital-bed type enclosure!!  One thing I really appreciated was being able to follow the company on Facebook, thus getting the inside scoop on product updates and shipping updates and such.While this product is a huge hit with us, we've also found a few things that could use improvement.The tent is, unfortunately, a bit of a challenge to set up.  The tent poles have square-cut ends that don't slide particularly easily into the tent-fabric channels.  The four main poles, instead of starting out straight and bending in the process (like most tent-poles these days do), are actually curved aluminum, probably more sturdy but also a little more finicky to put together and thread through.  The set-up instructions seemed to refer to a previous iteration of the product, referencing  straight poles of three different lengths when actually there are two matching short straight poles and then four matching curved poles -- confusing at first!I do believe I'm spoiled by the \"spring-right-out-of-the-bag\" set-up of the PeaPod Plus.  I could wish for a similar set-up in a large size product! though the PeaPod has an oval footprint and requires its own custom inflatable mattress, while the Nickel Bed Tent accommodates a standard twin mattress & bedding, and therefore can fit a twin-bed frame -- it has straps at the base of the tent to fasten onto a frame if you're using one.  We'll likely travel with the PeaPod for a little while yet, as long as we can, due to the differential in set-up ease.  When she outgrows that, we'll have the Nickel Bed Tent and air mattress, such that overnight travel will still be possible.  For that awesome benefit, we can overlook a little bit of set-up time.The fact that the zippers are made to attach together also technically makes the Nickel Bed a form of restraint.  So we couldn't spend Medicare Waiver funds on it -- though if we'd needed a hospital-ish bed, we could have accessed that funding to the tune of a couple thousand.  Fascinating how things work, or don't, sometimes.All told, Joy's new Nickel Bed is a huge step forward, and I salute the inventors for seeing the need in their own lives and making their solution available to the world as well!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.totsinmind.com/products/crib.html", "http://www.babyage.com/baby-gear/kidco-peapod-plus-travel-bed-37082.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Play-Tents-Secret-Castle/dp/B00009IMAN", "http://www.myreadysetbloom.com/Home.php", "http://www.myreadysetbloom.com/Home.php", "http://www.facebook.com/ReadySetBloomLLC"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/11/product-hits-misses-big-girl-bed.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses: Big Girl Bed Edition\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2010", "body": "\nIt's interesting, but sometimes claiming friends can be the cherry on top of a big credibility-loss sundae.Consider the statement that starts \"Some of my best friends are...\" and ends with the naming of a minority group, generally a minority group which the speaker has just been disrespecting.  It's such a cliche that I'm amazed anyone tries to defend themselves anymore with a \"some of my best friends are\" statement -- but it happens, and publicly too.One example from the news lately would be John Cook of the State Republican Executive Committee of Texas.  He's been leading a charge to replace the Texas state Speaker of the House, Joe Straus -- who is Jewish -- with someone with \"Christian conservative\" values.   But I'm not a bigot, Cook told a reporter for the Texas Observer.\"They're some of my best friends,\" he said of Jews, naming two friends of his. \"I'm not bigoted at all; I'm not racist.\"Uh-huh.  No bigotry to see here, folks, let's move on.I'm also reminded of an incident at a local business a while back, where I got into a casual conversation with the proprietor about the history of the area since the (long ago) founding of his shop.  I didn't see it coming, but his reminiscences turned suddenly ugly as he began ranting against the folks he blamed for causing all the problems in our neighborhoods and school system: those gang-banging black low-lifes who'd come up from Chicago to take advantage of our fair city's generosity.  As he saw me scrape my jaw off the floor and start to frame a rebuttal, he quickly interrupted himself, \"But don't get me wrong, now.  Some of my best friends are black!\"Uh-huh.  Sure.  I'm quite positive I haven't gotten you wrong.So why am I writing about this on Elvis Sightings?Because it occurs to me -- I don't think I've ever heard anyone say:Now, don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are autistic...I'm no bigot -- some of my best friends are disabled!Try plugging those \"some of my best friend\" phrases into Google.  Nada, unlike if you plug in Muslim, black, gay, Hispanic, Jewish, Mormon.Why is that?  It isn't as if people don't blame people with disabilities for certain societal ills -- like, for example, supposedly sponging up a disproportionate share of tax-supported resources.  Or for \"burdening\" businesses with onerous accessibility regulations.Is it that disability isn't a front-page, hot-button issue on the national scene right now?  Unlike, say, gay marriage, or building a Muslim cultural center in New York, or electing our first president of African descent, or immigration across our southern border.Is it that the disability rights movement isn't on people's radar, unlike civil rights or gay rights or women's rights?  (I'll freely confess to being awfully ignorant on this score before Joy came along.)Maybe people without disabilities don't even notice the discrimination?  Even -- or especially -- when they're/we're complicit in it?Does it perhaps not even occur to some folks that having best friends with disabilities... is even possible?  (Another confession: my circle of close \"meat-space\" friends is not nearly as diverse as it might be, and disabilities are one aspect of that lack of diversity.)Maybe it's a combination of the above, or some other aspect that hasn't occurred to me?  What do you think?UPDATE 12/20/10: There's a bloggy conversation going on today about a blogger who disparaged comments on her (otherwise quite compassionate) autism-related post, comments from a person with autism and a parent of a child with autism, because she'd \"had classes in autism\" and doesn't like receiving unsolicited advice.  Check out the first comment on this post about the issue for why this may be related...==============And, welcome to anyone who came over here from Elvis Sightings' new Facebook page.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 1, 2010", "body": "\nAt the beginning of the school year, before the craptacular spectacular transition issues, we'd discussed with Joy's teacher his system for rewarding good behavior.  Each child has a star-chart, and during the course of the day he publicly awards stars when he \"catches\" a child behaving well.  The charts live in the children's lockers, and when they fill a chart, they get to go \"shopping\" at the special reward-shelves for a book to take home.We'd originally contributed some board books (more expensive than the usual paperback rewards) for Joy to take part in the system.  But then with Joy not in the classroom much at all, and having the reward so far removed from the good behavior, on top of the rough way she treats books...  she ended up getting more immediate small rewards instead, and just not participating in the classroom's system for the first weeks.Until I was volunteering in the classroom one Monday.  One dear little girl went out of her way to tell me that Joy was doing well (bless her heart!)  But a young fellow at the same table wanted to make sure that the record was set straight -- or maybe he just liked \"telling\"?  Anyway, he swiftly pointed out that maybe it wasn't so great after all, because Joy never got to go book-shopping.So I took this perspective to Joy's team -- that, even if the reward system is not perfectly set up to be meaningful to Joy, the other kids are noticing and her participation (or lack thereof) has meaning to her classmates.  They immediately agreed to make a change.  Now Joy gets stars like the other kids, no matter what level of meaning they may or may not have for her.  And if she's not in the room much that day, her aides make a point of coming to the teacher and announcing audibly that Joy should get stars for thus-and-such she's done OUT of the room.The first full star-chart that came home with a board book brought tears to my eyes.  Her teacher had signed it with the message, \"I'm so proud of you!\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/included-rewards-at-school.html", "title": "\nIncluded: Rewards at School\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 4, 2010", "body": "\nJoy's big sister Rose (in 3rd grade, age almost-nine) was assigned this past week to write a poem.  Unprompted, she chose her sister Joy as the subject of the poem.  She neither asked for nor received any suggestions other than confirming how to spell some of the longer words.I wish I could blog the whole poem here, but I can't do that without blowing the pseudonyms.  Joy's full real name is part of the poem, and I can't remove/replace it without making it something considerably other than what Rose wrote.  But I can tell you that she described her sister using the words \"intelligent\" and \"really impressive\" and \"magnificent.\"I don't know if it's actual perception or wishful thinking, and I don't really care. It captures something of the eyes through which Rose views her sister -- eyes that simply shine with love.I have to think of two sibling stories I've encountered recently, from generations not so long past, that started in circumstances very different from ours.One story is a minor strand in the amazing book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by science journalist Rebecca Skloot, which I read earlier this fall.  (Here's a fine review of the book.) Henrietta Lacks was a young woman in Maryland whose cancer cells, taken without her knowledge or consent shortly before her death of the disease in 1951, led to a huge list of scientific advances and a multi-billion-dollar industry in cell culture -- at no financial benefit whatsoever to the Lacks family.  One small part of the difficult history of the Lacks family: Henrietta's oldest daughter Elsie had epilepsy and substantial developmental delays, and was placed in a mental health institution, where she died two years after her mother's passing.  Or perhaps I should say, an overcrowded hell-hole of an institution called the Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland, where she was almost surely subjected to brutal experiments -- a practice more common in those days than we'd like to think.  Elsie's youngest sister Deborah had no idea about all of this (either her mother's story or her sister's) until Rebecca Skloot started unearthing the history, and then Deborah joined Rebecca on the quest to find out about her sister, and so much more.  It was only this past May that Elsie Lacks' remains were relocated to the family plot and honored with a proper headstone -- little enough that anyone could do in her memory after all she most likely suffered.Another is a story that the JoyFamily happened to catch just this past Sunday on CBS Sunday Morning.  This one was the sibling-story of Jeff Daly, whose little sister Molly was sent away in 1957 to an institution (one that passed for \"enlightened\" at the time) due to her developmental disabilities.  \"Where's Molly?\" he'd ask his parents, and they'd tell him \"Molly's not here any more.\"  Eventually he stopped asking, and the memories receded until his parents' deaths in 2004.  He found Molly's Social Security card in his father's wallet, enabling him to begin a search for his sister -- who turned out to be still alive and residing in a nearby group home.  They are now part of one another's lives once more, feeling very blessed to be able to be family again.Rose was watching this with us, and struggled to take it in... that families used to be advised to send their Joy-children away and be told not to visit them, that everyone would be better off if you'd just forget about them.  (Oh yes, she made the connection immediately).  She couldn't imagine Joy living anywhere else, when Joy so very clearly belongs with us!I found out even more of the story when I started poking around online -- there was a Reader's Digest article in March 2006 that gave some details that I'm glad Rose didn't hear.  That Molly disappeared suddenly, when Jeff was six: one meal she was at the table, and the next she wasn't.  That he used to get sent to his room for asking what happened to her.  That their mother only ever visited Molly once and seemed to have been relieved to send her away because, as Jeff was told when he started interviewing relatives to make a movie of the story, \"a disabled child wasn't right for her perfect life.\"  That Jeff and his wife Cindy, even in the mid-2000s, had to fight to change laws that were preventing other families in their situation from finding relatives who had disappeared into institutions like Molly had.I'm so grateful that we live when we do, and where we do.  That the Joys of this country have a legal right to a public education.  That we have not personally encountered a single soul, doctor or educator or family or acquaintance, who has suggested that Joy would really be better off living somewhere else without our interference (of course such attitudes do exist, it's not hard at all to find them online! but nobody in our immediate circle has even hinted at it.  Which is good.)We still have a long way to go.  Warehousing happens.  Abuse happens.  Much is still wrong.  But we've come so far, so very far!  And sisters like Rose and the \"really impressive\" Joy, and their families and communities, are so very much the richer for it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-immortal-woman-henrietta-lacks", "http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/28/sunday/main7096335.shtml", "http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/sisters-keeper----the-reunion-between-a-man-and-his-long-lost-sister/article21766.html", "http://wheresmolly.net/", "http://motherofshrek.blogspot.com/2010/11/labelled.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/07/un-calls-shock-treatment-at-judge-rotenberg-center-torture/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/sibling-stories.html", "title": "\nSibling Stories\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 8, 2010", "body": "\nThe other night we took advantage of a no-longer-so-unusual luxury -- an evening with no special plans.  We decided to go to a local mall and see a display of gingerbread houses.  As we bundled up, I remembered that this mall had advertised a take-your-own-photos Santa, so I slipped a camera into my purse, even though a Santa sitting would be a major departure for both girls.  (See Here Comes Santa Claus from December 2008 for the backstory on why.)I think that Joy maybe actually looked at the gingerbread creations this year, a new development.  She was more interested, however, in peering into the shops and looking up for ceiling fans.  Each time she found one, she made sure to tell us: fan! OK, actually she kind of leaves off the \"n\"... but did you catch that?  She actually told us!We spent quite a few minutes hunkered down in front of one particular store window, where there were two mechanical toys.  One was a skating rink where little figurines circled the ice in pre-ordained patterns; the other was a sledding hill on which the same two sleds appeared again and again and again.  Though we've never owned any such thing, these toys were like old friends -- they appear on the Baby Bach Baby Einstein video, one of the first Baby Einsteins we acquired when Rose was a wee thing! Long, long we sat and watched, with occasional glances up at the store ceiling, where spun (oh bliss, oh Joy!) a ceiling fan.The Santa-sitting mishaps of Rose's early years in the aforementioned post happened at this very mall as well, but all these years later they now have a different Santa and a different setup.  He was sitting out in the open, next to a 20-foot-high gingerbread house, all twinkly and smiling with a small bench at his knee where children could pose rather than actually having to climb into his lap.  Not a soul in line, we could walk right up to him!  Rose put on a mild pre-teen-ish protest, too old for all this, but to my surprise she then actually sat on the little bench and pasted on a smile for the photo, earning herself a little candy cane and coloring book.Then it was Joy's turn, the girl with whom we had never even attempted a Santa visit.  The girl who has two new relevant words that she didn't have before -- \"Picture,\" at which she will sometimes actually mug for the camera, and \"Santa\" which is very familiar from the Baby Santa Baby Einstein video (and also sounds like \"panda\" which is one of the funniest words in the world.) So we said \"Santa\" and she sat on the bench!  We said \"picture\" and she looked at the camera!  And she smiled!And just as JoyDad was taking the shot, she opened her mouth wide and lifted one finger to point out where she'd lost a tooth earlier that day.Her middle finger.I guess there's always next year.  Ho, ho, ho!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TQBOl1WojYI/AAAAAAAAAsc/IAH84iL2DgY/s1600/Dec2010WindowShopping.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/mall-santa.html", "title": "\nMall Santa\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 3, 2010", "body": "\nI have the good fortune to have settled within walking distance of a dear college classmate of mine -- someone I met the first week freshman year.  We went on to bear girl-babies within 5 months of one another, and they too have become fast friends.  Every year since Halloween 2002, including this one, Rose and her neighbor-friend Elizabeth have trick-or-treated together.At the end of the evening on Sunday, I wound up at their house while Rose and Elizabeth sorted through and traded their obscene hauls of candy.  JoyDad & Joy had called it a night earlier, but I was able to hang out for a bit and join the entertainment of looking at past years' Halloween photos on the computer.How young we all were, back in 2002 when a one-year-old Elizabeth-lion with an orange pacifier visited a few houses with a white-bunny-rabbit Rose!  In 2003 I created my first homemade kiddie-Halloween costume for Rose, discovering the versatility of solid-color sweats and sticky-back felt.  (My mother never did make a homemade costume for me -- multi-talented though she was, crafty-ness was not among her many virtues). Despite the preggo-nausea that went along with gestating Joy, I managed a rather delightful ladybug outfit for Rose.Then came Joy. For Halloween 2004, at the age of 5 months, she wore a fuzzy bumble-bee outfit that I'd snagged at a thrift shop.I created a homemade bee costume for rose, and got a sweet, sweet photo of the two sister-bees on Elizabeth's sofa.  We didn't know it at the time, but that was the only good sister-photo we'd have to look back on when we flipped through the old photos this year.Not in 2005, when Joy wore Rose's old bunny costume and Rose went as a homemade carrot.Not in 2006, when Rose talked me into costuming them as hula dancers like Molly in the American Girl books -- and then Halloween night was downright wintry!Not in 2007, when they'd just been flower girls in their aunt & uncle's wedding, so we re-used the dresses, but Joy was sick that night and couldn't even go out.Not in 2008, when Rose dressed as Lucy the Diamond Fairy and Joy was her diamond.Not last year, when they went as black-n-white Dutch bunnies.  I made them both fleece bunny-hats and taught Rose to make homemade pompoms for the tails.  Joy protested the whole costuming & trick-or-treat affair that year.  So disheartening, I didn't even feel like re-hashing it on the blog.  We didn't get a single photo of either girl that year.And then came Halloween 2010.I had very strict requirements for Joy's outfit this year.  Nothing on her head.  Nothing dangly & stimmy.  No boxes, no wings.  Meanwhile, Rose decided early on that she wanted to be a pirate.  Arrrr.Here's what we wound up with: a pirate wench (boughten costume) and her hook.Didja see that?  They're standing together.  Joy is smiling!  We got THREE good shots of the sisterly duo, plus another shot of the whole costumed trick-or-treating crew (4 girls + 2 costumed parents).  Joy cooperated happily with the whole photo shoot.We were still a little nervous about the trick-or-treating, and had planned that carefully too in the wake of last year's debacle.  Only a few next-door neighbors were on the agenda if that was all Joy could handle, and then the older girls would continue on.  But Joy walked nicely, stayed upright (i.e. very little stimming in dirt & leaves), stood with Mama on the steps, squealed & jumped when the treats went into the bucket.  We went all the way up and down our street with her, and probably could have gone more.It is so nice to have a photogenic Halloween for once, amid all the school struggles and health struggles this fall.Ahoy, onward to Thanksgiving, me hearties!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TNFCjAfwdnI/AAAAAAAAAqk/NSzhKMusv1Q/s1600/Oct2003ladybug.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TNFCzN2sZMI/AAAAAAAAAqs/HQ1bMfol6qw/s1600/Oct2004Joybee.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TM_021icqkI/AAAAAAAAAqM/eQ9G1o6RaQc/s1600/Halloween2010both.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TM_1Ex_gH9I/AAAAAAAAAqc/GOVA54b4j_Q/s1600/Halloween2010hook.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/11/halloween-to-remember.html", "title": "\nA Halloween to Remember\n"},

{"date": "Friday, December 17, 2010", "body": "\nIn general, as a parent, I tend to look askance at the argument \"But Mo-o-o-o-m!  All the other kids have one!\"  My poor, deprived children have neither Nintendo DS nor Playstation nor X-Box nor even Wii.  Rose will tell you that on such scores, particularly with the expensive stuff, Mama has a cold Grinchy heart.And yet.  As with so many things, Joy leads me to new perspectives.  For Joy, the opportunities to be like other kids are fewer and farther between than for her sister.  I find myself actively seeking out opportunities to emphasize the \"just like the other kids\" aspects of her life.  In some cases, like the two below, that includes products -- products that don't break the bank, even!When we sent Joy off to school this fall, eating and drinking were a special consideration.  I can pretty easily send a bag lunch that will keep her well-nourished.  Drink, however, was a bit of a question.  Joy doesn't \"do\" milk or juiceboxes these days.  Fortunately she still likes water (and soda, though we don't send that to school!)  She gets an open cup with supervision at meals at home, and was still using sippy-ish cups at daycare.But Mama can't send a toddler-ish sippy to kindergarten with her big girl!  So I went looking for a spillproof cup that:fits in a lunch boxholds a decent-size drink of waterdoesn't leakis easy to open and closeis easy to drink fromis not particularly susceptible to chewing damage (no soft-straws)has gradeschool appealI found it at Target, at the appealing price of $3.99!Target's Embark water bottle is BPA free, comes in bright colors (but without commercial character images), and has held up for a number of months so far.  Joy has a pink one, Rose has a purple one, both are happy with them.  We know of at least one friend whose mom got her one too after seeing my girls using theirs at the park after school!  The only downside of these I can see is that they're in-stores only.  Which is where Santa went to buy some stocking stuffers lately -- it will be good for each girl to have a back-up bottle...Well, we got the original bottles back in the summer when the weather was still hot and the hydration need was more evident.  But now we've got 10 inches of snow on the ground and temperatures in the deep freeze.  Growing girls need winter gear, and that includes snow boots.  Fortunately Joy does not have any particular foot issues / need for orthotics or any such.  What I do require in Joy-boots is rugged construction and ease in getting the things on and off.  What we've used over the past several years for both Rose and Joy, just like many of their classmates use, is the Snow Flurry boot from Land's End:The big draw of these boots ($29.50, and you can order them online) is the velcro side-closures.  You can't entirely tell from the picture, but each of the sides pulls open into a big wide gusset that makes lots of room for a little foot to go in, and then clings tightly closed to keep the boot on.They've been improving these boots since we first tried them a few years ago.  My only complaint with last year's pairs was that they got pretty stinky after a long season.  This year's version claims \"Antimicrobial finish helps fight odor\" so we'll see if it helps!  They've also made last year's little pull-tabs at the top of the closure into actual loops that a little finger can fit through to pull.Joy's got the purple ones, and a couple of days ago as we were walking home we fell in with one of her classmates, a little guy who always greets her with a \"hi, Joy!\" even though he usually doesn't pay much attention to her other than that.  This time, however, he noticed and took care to point out that Joy had the exact same boots as his younger sister -- and the same style as his own.  Just like the other kids.... ahhhhh.=========I've been lax about \"disclaimer-ing\" these product posts, but I do want to make clear -- I receive no compensation nor consideration from the companies whose products I write about.  If I ever get a review sample of anything, I will disclose that fact and would point out both positive and negative features forthrightly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.target.com/Embark-Eastman-Tritan-Water-Bottle/dp/B002VXO2IK", "http://www.target.com/Embark-Eastman-Tritan-Water-Bottle/dp/B002VXO2IK", "http://www.landsend.com/pp/FlurryBoots~212822_1055.html", "http://www.landsend.com/pp/FlurryBoots~212822_1055.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/product-hits-misses-just-like-other.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses: \"Just Like the Other Kids\" Edition\n"},

JoyDad is off in North Carolina, celebrating the newly-minted PhD earned by his sister, Auntie Running-at-the-Mouth.  We're all mighty proud of her! but Joy and Rose and I get to be proud from a distance.Rose especially is missing her daddy, so I've tried to add some extra fun to the weekend.  One of the fun things we did Friday night was to make an unusual meal, a meal beloved by the female contingent of our little household, but of which JoyDad isn't a great fan (and especially not for dinner): Eggy Bake.Eggy Bake is a dish I learned way back in high school at a service-week I did with some other volunteers in Ontario one summer.  Very simple, all the ingredients are household staples, and you serve it hot with maple syrup.  The name I learned it by is Aggkaka, a Scandinavian title and treat -- but the name just sounds so gutteral and scatological, I just couldn't bring myself to call it that with the kiddos.However, Rose was on the ball.  \"Is it really called Eggy Bake?\" she asked while devouring her portion, having glanced at my recipe and noticed another title.  \"No,\" I fessed up, \"the real name is Aggkaka.  But I call it Eggy Bake because 'Aggkaka' doesn't sound so great.\"\"Aggkaka?  Why doesn't that sound great?\" she persisted.Oh sh..., I mean, crap, that is, caca!  I wasn't planning this vocabulary lesson!\"Well honey, in some languages 'kaka' with a K means 'cake,' like in Swedish I think.  But in other languages like Spanish, 'caca' with a C means... poop.\"Her eyes opened a little wider.  \"Oh,\" she said, \"I think I'll keep calling it Eggy Bake too, then.\"Down at the other end of the table, her younger sister was inhaling her own serving  with delight (and independently with her fork!)  Between bites, we suddenly heard Joy's comment on the situation:\"Uggh...ka...ka!\"========Here's my Aggkaka / Eggy Bake recipe, exactly the same as I found it on this website when I went scouting around to confirm that people really do call it \"Aggkaka\":2 T. butter3 eggs2 c. milk1 c. flour2 T. sugar1 t. saltMelt 2 T. butter in a 9x9 baking dish at 425 degrees.  For batter, beat the rest of the ingredients together.  Pour batter into the hot butter.  Bake 20-30 minutes or until set and golden brown.

{"date": "Monday, December 20, 2010", "body": "\nTwo back-glances today!First up is a linky-list called Blog Gems: Air Your Archives that runs every two weeks over at The King and Eye.The current airing-of-the-archives asks: \"Point us all in the direction of your first public post\"!Join in the Blog Gems airing of the first public posts (as I did! fun game!) or visit mine directly, all the way back to July 2008.The other glance back is just a week, to my Dec. 14 post wondering why one doesn't hear the phrase \"Some of my best friends have autism!\"  I just picked up a fascinating new insight from a comment to a post called \"She's had classes in autism, people. Don't offer any suggestions.\" over at A life less ordinary.  The original incident that's being discussed is a little convoluted -- you can go read about it there if you like.  More interesting to me was the first comment on the post.  The comment suggests that in the case of autism, the formulation of the \"Some of my best friends\" line goes more like \"I've worked with people with autism\" (or, as in the original incident, \"I've had classes in autism.\")  The claim is a little different, but the use is similar: it can be used as cover for whatever unfortunate or offensive stance about autism one might stake out.I didn't mention it in the earlier post, but I'm still sort of chewing over the thought of whether/how the claim of such an association can be used for good (as opposed to being used as cover for an opinion you know will mark you as insensitive/bigoted/whatever).  It occurs to me that I stake out my bona fides as the parent of a child with autism all the time.  But then again, I don't think I've ever used it to say, \"I've got nothing to learn from you,\" or \"Don't get me wrong, I'm not prejudiced against people with disabilities / autism.\"Still cogitating!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thekingandeye.com/", "http://www.thekingandeye.com/p/blog-gems.html", "http://www.thekingandeye.com/2010/12/blog-gems-air-your-archives-5.html", "http://daisymayfattypants.blogspot.com/2010/12/shes-had-classes-in-autism-people-dont.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/glancing-back.html", "title": "\nGlancing Back\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2010", "body": "\nWe're a week and a half into a two-week Christmas holiday, and all things considered, it's going pretty well.  The biggest \"considered\" is that all four members of the immediate JoyFamily have been feeling less-than-healthy.  JoyDad and I have had colds; Rose had an ongoing bout with abdominal pain that made us think \"appendicitis\" and also made us think \"stressing out\" but cleared up with a course of antacids; and Joy had fever & upchucks on the Tuesday before Christmas, followed by a week of -- well, let's call it \"bowel disregulation.\"  Merry, merry.But, as I said, things haven't been too bad for all of that.  We made it through a snowy drive on Christmas Eve to AuntieS' place for the first Christmas celebration: JoyDad family fun, and Chicago pizza from Lou Malnati's, and a big pile of gifts.  Then we went home for a nice quiet Christmas Day.  Here was the scene before we dug into the pile for Christmas #2:We had been very careful not to bring out any presents before that morning, nor to even hang the stockings, because that living-room space is very much Joy's territory and we worried whether the stockings would survive.  Funny enough, after the unwrapping was done, we hung the stockings back up just to be a little festive, and Joy let them hang.  They're still up! as is our tree, which she's tall enough to bring down with one grab if she wanted to! as are the Christmas cards on the back doors which she can easily reach and hasn't even touched!Christmas #3 came with Grandma Joy and GrandpaJ (my side of the family), who drove up from Kansas on Monday.  The girls hadn't seen these grandparents since we went to Kansas for Easter, but Joy remembered, all right.  She ran up and gave Grandma Joy a huge smiling unsolicited hug.  Ahhh!  We had yet another round of gifts on Tuesday morning, followed by a sledding outing.  Both grandparents took their turns on the sleds going down the long hill, perhaps not surprising when you consider that Grandma Joy celebrated her 70th birthday earlier this year by going sky-diving...Anyway, we've got a couple more days of visit from the Kansas grandparents, and then will have Christmas #4 just after New Year's with the grandparents on JoyDad's side. It will be hard to go back to the post-holiday existence after all these treats.Here is Joy with a few of her treats -- a new Christmassy Joy-outfit, and a lovely stimmy fleece boa that I made her, and a set of mis-keys that I had carefully selected in hopes of coming \"close enough\" to my own car keys that they could serve as a substitute.  (Who was I kidding?  When is \"close enough\" ever good enough for our kids when they've got their obsession on?)Another favorite gift with a Joy-tag on it came from AuntieS on Christmas Eve -- another stimmy delight, a pin-art toy.  Joy has had to share that one, though.  Here is Rose demonstrating some dramatic faces: The ScreamThe GrinEven JoyMama got into the act, demonstrating here her dissatisfaction with a lip-enhancement surgery gone just a little too far:(I kid, I kid!)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TRsl_WDlcqI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/g_IbyCOHb6w/s1600/Dec2010Presents1.jpg", "http://www.exploringwomanhood.com/homelife/ideas/pom-jan04.htm", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TRsmuHi5iLI/AAAAAAAAAtw/SwXfip0WDaY/s1600/Dec2010JoyShirt.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TRsmjs0tfCI/AAAAAAAAAto/31ttvggpyTs/s1600/Dec2010RosePins1.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TRsmYhJXEFI/AAAAAAAAAtg/YRMXMTGIUS8/s1600/Dec2010RosePins2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TRsmMvTC67I/AAAAAAAAAtY/pAL2v0CY5uI/s1600/Dec2010JoyMamaPins.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/12/three-christmases-down-one-to-go.html", "title": "\nThree Christmases Down, One to Go\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 1, 2011", "body": "\n\"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\"-- Cartoon from the New Yorker, July 1993\"Facebook makes cyberspace more like the real world: dull but civilized. The masked-ball period of the Internet is ending.  Where people once led double lives, real and virtual, now they lead single ones again.\" Time magazine, Dec. 15, 2010 -- \"Person of the Year 2010: Mark Zuckerberg\"The turn of the year is a traditional opportunity for introspection, taking stock, looking back and looking forward.  In this medium, I tend toward what I call \"bloggy navel-gazing\" -- reflections on what this Elvis Sightings enterprise means for me (and about me) as Joy's mother, JoyMama.  Of course the blog is framed around Joy herself, but she's not the one with the words to speak for herself.  Someday, someday! but till then, I'm afraid that most of what you're getting here is me.The other evening JoyDad and I had a holiday date-night, dinner and a movie thanks to the babysitting team of Grandma Joy and GrandpaJ.  Our movie of choice was The Social Network, a fictionalized account of the founding of the wildly-popular online social-network known as Facebook.  Well-paced show, zingy dialog, compellingly plotted, the two hours flew by!  The lead character, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and billionaire CEO of Facebook, was a geeky Harvard undergrad when he launched the first version of Facebook in 2003.  While Facebook was a student-members-only operation for its first three years, in 2006 it expanded to anyone over the age of 13.  Facebook now boasts over 500 million users worldwide, most of us under our \"real names\" -- because much of the point for Facebook users is that you want your friends and acquaintances to be able to find you.The movie took as its frame the real-life legal battles over Facebook's origins, but played very fast-and-loose with Zuckerberg's character.  To hear the movie tell it, the core motivation for the creation of Facebook had to do with Zuckerberg's inability to hold onto a certain girlfriend (or any other friends), as well as a desire to belong to Harvard's exclusive social circle.  According to the Time article, however, Zuckerberg is still together with his Harvard girlfriend, and has devoted friends as well as a strong family, and founded Facebook because it was just such a cool thing to do!The dance between real-name identity and pseudonymous identity has been of interest to me since I first started Elvis Sightings under the pseudonym JoyMama.  At the time, I'd say that maybe half the autism-parent blogs I followed were under pseudonyms.  About a year ago, there was even a cluster of three or so blogs that had started out with real-names and then made a retroactive switch to pseudonyms.  But lately it feels like there's a trend toward blogging under real-names.  The new bloggers I've been adding to my list are predominantly real-name bloggers.  I'm also one of very-very few contributors to The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism to contribute under a pseudonym.  I'm mostly happy with staying pseudonymous.  For Joy's protection and my own, I don't want my real name to be too easy to connect to the blog, particularly since it's an unusual enough name that pretty much all the Google hits on it are really me -- and I've been leaving trace-able real-name trails online since about the time of that New Yorker cartoon.  (Unlike a fellow I once met who shares a name with a world-famous Olympic athlete, who commented that he could post anything he wanted under his real name because it gets buried under famous search results!)  But many of you knew my real name before you visited this blog, and I've shared it with others who have become bloggy friends.Here's where I think the dance gets interesting.  In general, I think that people tend to equate online anonymity with inauthenticity.  After all, on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog!  You can create any identity you want for yourself under a pseudonym -- or say awful things without having to own the consequences in real life, if so you choose.  On the other hand, face-to-face communication isn't free of identity-creation either.  We make choices all the time about which of our thoughts we want to share, how we want to present ourselves, what face we want to show the world.  And, as a recurring pseudonymous presence, JoyMama has to own what is said on Elvis Sightings and in comments on other blogs.  I can't hit-and-run under my established pseudonym, not that I'd want to!JoyMama is me.  My reflections here have a great deal to do with my identity, even if they don't have my real name directly attached.  In fact, readers can learn a lot more about the real me on this blog than through occasional casual face-to-face encounters -- or, for that matter, than by reading my real-name Facebook status updates.  I wonder if that's maybe the best of both worlds: the protection (and fun!) of the masked-ball that the Internet can be, yet also the authenticity of a real-person identity, firmly attached to the pseudonym.That identity is not a static entity.  Joy is a work-in-progress, JoyMama is a work-in-progress, so are Rose and JoyDad... and all of you.  I expect Joy and myself to be life-long learners, and I'm looking forward to blogging about what we learn in 2011.

We'd last done swimming lessons at this facility back when I was just getting this blog going, the second half of 2008. Joy had a great one-on-one teacher for the summer session, and I posted triumphantly to Elvis Sightings to show off a perfect report card for the beginner Crab-level skills. Graduated after one session, just like any other kid, woohoo! (That post, by the way, is among my all-time most popular in terms of hits, as people go Googling for images of swimming report cards. Go figure.) \n\n\nAlas, the second session of lessons did not go so well.  Joy's fall-session teacher didn't \"get\" her and Joy responded accordingly.  The second report card was so disheartening I didn't blog about it for months -- not only did Joy not get a Guppy (level 2) report card, her Crab report card suddenly had her going backwards, losing mastery of skills marked \"M\" the first round, even though I'd witnessed them working on new skills.  (The staff fumblingly made it worse by explaining they'd been more honest the second round.  Ugh.)\n\nAnd then we got fully-underway with intensive autism therapy, and stopped the swim lessons altogether.\n\nLots has changed since then.  Our schedule is more open now that school is underway.  Joy is longer, taller, stronger.  We've seen some glorious gains over those several years in communication and interaction.  (Hurrah for Agency 2 and relationship-emphasizing House Blend therapy!)  We've also seen Joy get braver at the public pool with jump-ins and dunking under on her own.\n\nTuesday with a new one-on-one teacher, I saw it all come together.\n\nJoy had grown into Rose's old swimsuit that matched the one Joy was wearing last time we had lessons!  She and her new teacher hit the same wavelength immediately, as the teacher led off right away with big smiles and animated praise -- a lovely repertoire of enthusiastic affirmations.  Joy not only responded but started initiating little giggly face-making games!  They were having more fun together than anyone else in the whole pool.  And the kicking around against the resistance of the water was just the kind of sensory input that Joy needed.\n\nShe kept up with every one of the Crab skills her teacher put her through:\n-- Submersions with Instructor\n-- Backfloats with Assistance\n-- Comfortable on Platform\n-- No Tears\n\nAnd, she's already got one of the Guppy skills nailed: unassisted jump-ins.\n\nI have yet to confirm it with the new teacher.  But if Joy doesn't get a Guppy report card this session, I'll eat my swim goggles.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TUKzEdrQ5aI/AAAAAAAAAwA/TWc0YhMvkZ4/s1600/swim-diploma1.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/01/joy-is-guppy.html", "title": "\nJoy is a Guppy\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 12, 2011", "body": "\nBack in September when I wrote about my terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad experience with Joy's first day of kindergarten, I mentioned another even-worse breakdown that I'd have to write about someday.  That experience came back to me this week at swim lessons, so I think it's time to tell the story.\n\nDuring Tuesday's lesson, I was avidly peering through the glass at the pool waiting-room, watching Joy interact with a new swim teacher. (The wonderful one she started with has left the school, gah! but Joy loves the water so much that she smiled for the new gal anyway.)  All of a sudden, a daddy behind me started telling me and another mom how he was a victim in a bizarre robbery incident that got written up in the newspaper.  I'm thinking, gosh this guy looks familiar.  As he proudly told us how he hassled the cops because he didn't want to tell them his name, and resented that they hassled him back, the feeling of familiarity grew.  And suddenly, it clicked.  I'd met this guy four years ago at the Children's Museum.\n\nIt was about this time of the season in 2007, and I'd been taking Joy to a weekly toddler-music program at the museum.  It wasn't an easy thing to do.  Joy likes music, but she didn't participate the way the other kids did, and I had to hover carefully to make sure she didn't grab for the other kids' tambourines or whatever.  It had only been a few short months since the diagnoses that put the autism and LNSS labels to Joy's situation, labels that still sat like a massive weight on my shoulders.\n\nSuddenly Joy decided she was all-done, and headed for the door.  There were two little girls in her way, and instead of going around them like I expected, she gave the first one a shove.  The two went down like dominoes, with the second domina grazing her head on a table on the way to the floor.  A little blood, a lot of wailing -- and as I started to apologize to the girls' father -- THIS GUY -- his face twisted with anger and he snarled/spat \"Thanks a LOT!\"  He hustled his daughters furiously out of the room before I could say another word.\n\nAnd I started to bawl.  The ugly-cry.  Hot, awful tears that would not stop.  The sobs just got worse when people started being kind to me... an acquaintance who worked another children's museum program and told me that \"this guy\" had a museum-wide reputation for unpleasant interactions... another mom with a kiddo on the spectrum who had made great progress... yet another mom who pointed out that any kid might have dealt that shove.  It was all so supportive, and yet I couldn't pull it together.  Someone even went and tipped off \"this guy,\" who tried to apologize to me on the way out.  I was over-reacting so hard to his initial over-reaction, I could hardly acknowledge him.  It's a wonder I didn't crash the car on the way home.\n\nFour years later.  Once again \"this guy\" and I have our kids in the same program -- but this time my girl has the support she needs and is having a ball, and I'm in a much better place too, the start of kindergarten notwithstanding.  It's kind of amazing to look back over those years and see how far we've come, how much we've learned, how much we've done, how much Joy has grown and matured and progressed.\n\nIt has gotten better.\n\nAnd, we may even be switching our swim lessons to another day so we can have yet a third teacher this term, who happens to be the same wonderful teacher who taught Joy's very first swim lessons in the summer of 2008.  Which would have the nice little bonus that I wouldn't even have to hang out poolside with \"this guy\"!\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/02/it-has-gotten-better.html", "title": "\nIt Has Gotten Better\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 7, 2011", "body": "\nJoy's GoTalk communication device had a once-in-a-lifetime message on it for sharing time with her kindergarten class a week ago Thursday.\n\nI said goodbye to my (GrammaJ) last night.  We laughed together.\nGrammaJ has survived so very much.  She lost half a lung to lung cancer years ago, I think it was before Joy was even born.  She battled back from a temporarily paralyzing stroke and walked again.  She triumphed in a round with breast cancer.  She adapted her lifestyle to diabetes and shed a lot of pesky pounds, learned to speak in a whisper after her vocal cords were damaged in surgery, slowed her pace to accommodate heart issues.\n\nBut this time is different.  GrammaJ is in a hospice facility, and her remaining time with us is likely very short now.  It happened suddenly.  On January 2, she and GrampaK hosted the family at their home for our fourth Christmas of the season.  A week later, she went into the hospital for some tests.  A week and a half after that, she was on her way to hospice, with the news that the lung cancer had roared back overwhelmingly, untreatably.\n\nGrammaJ is GrampaK's second wife, with the longer of the two marriages: they just celebrated their 20th anniversary this past year.  They married just a couple of years before JoyDad and I started dating.  They were in Wisconsin, we weren't -- so I didn't get to know either of them very well until we too moved to Wisconsin in 1998.  Then we discovered her warm hospitality and sweet personality and fun-and-feisty sense of humor, and we grew to appreciate how well she and GrampaK were matched!\n\nWhen we had kids, there was no question that she would be \"Grandma\" -- not step-grandma or some other nickname, but really-truly grandma.  JoyDad's mother passed away before the girls came along; Joy had just turned one when we had to say goodbye to my mother.  The girls' step-grandmas ARE their grandmas.\n\nGrammaJ has been so flexible and loving with Joy's needs.  She carefully Joy-proofed their home when we'd visit (an extensive task due to many knick-knacks and collectibles!), made sure to serve food the girls would eat, and brought the most delicious cakes for their birthdays.  In fact, Rose had me make lemon cake for her birthday party this weekend, with GrammaJ's special super-lemony recipe.\n\nGrammaJ's Elvis Collectibles\n\nThe chance to say a final goodbye is a difficult gift.  Rose remembers the goodbye trip to Kansas when my mother was in her final hospice-weeks, so for her there's a familiarity to this.  She has been processing this farewell quietly and somberly so far.\n\nWith Joy, I've had bouts of angst in the past about not being able to properly explain deep and momentous things, from the death of our bunny Phoebert to the birth of the Christ child.  Somehow in this farewell, I'm not feeling that way.  Not that I have a much better sense of what she does and doesn't understand.  I don't.  But somehow a few simple, straightforward sentences are enough this time.  Maybe, put together with whatever she heard when her classmate's father died of cancer last fall, she is processing this on some deep level.  Or maybe not, and these connections will come together another time.  Either way, she is who she is, and it's going to be OK.\n\nIt was very important that our whole family get to be in on the visit to GrammaJ.  We went mid-week, heading out directly after school.  Rose had drawn a picture for GrammaJ, an early Valentine to hang on her wall.  Joy had brought -- herself.  And her giggles!  GrammaJ was sitting up in bed, awake and happy to talk with us and exchange hugs.  Joy entertained GrammaJ with a giggly sneezing-game, where Joy & partner exchange utterances of \"ah... ahhh... ahhhh...\" and then comes a joyful \"CHOOOO!\"  GrammaJ shared her apple juice from dinner; we weren't sure what Joy would do, since she's been refusing apple & most other juices since last April.

And that I love her, and to share the message that I first told Rose during our last visit to my mother -- that a loving God is taking care of all of us, and will still be taking care of grandma, even when she's not with us any more.\n\nWe love you, GrammaJ.\n\n\nElvis - Can't Help Falling in Love\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TVAgU39QKoI/AAAAAAAAAw0/zWsWWKYfGM8/s1600/elvis-shrine.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/02/farewell-gifts.html", "title": "\nFarewell Gifts\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 17, 2011", "body": "\nIn autism circles in Wisconsin, it's often (and not-quite-accurately) referred to as \"The Autism Waiver.\"\n\nIt's a section within a the Children's Long-Term Supports (CLTS) Waiver, allowing Wisconsin to use Medicaid dollars for intensive autism treatment.\n\nMy daughter received two years of intensive autism therapy through the autism section of the CLTS waiver and now has funding available through a different section of the waiver for things like respite, home modifications (like a plexiglass layer on our picture window so she doesn't bang her head through it), and more.  The postive impact on her progress and on our lives has been astonishing.\n\n\"The Waiver\" is subject to be changed/slashed without notice or hearing if the Walker budget-repair bill passes -- and it just passed the Joint Finance Committee last night, along party lines.\n\nI wrote yesterday about the process part of how the cuts could be made.  Today I want to emphasize that the intensive autism therapies are absolutely a part of this, even if the bill doesn't mention them by name.  \n\nHere's what kind of changes the Walker appointees in the Wisconsin Department of Health services would be empowered to make to MA and MA Waivers, affecting the autism community AND the broader disability community AND people with low incomes.\n\n-- cost sharing could go up to the full extent allowed by federal law, and if people couldn't pay, they could be denied services.\n-- modify existing benefits (as much as they want, as far as I can see!)\n-- change eligibility standards \n-- revise how providers get reimbursed \n-- and more!\n\nAgain, as I wrote yesterday -- after the bill passes, this can all happen without public hearing, without public notice.\n\nThis analysis comes from a summary of the bill released by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau on Tuesday, on page 8 & 9.\n\nThe version that passed the Joint Finance Committee was amended to sunset the power to make these sweeping cuts by emergency rule:  They'll only be able to work this way until January 2015.  When Scott Walker's current term comes to an end.  So any new administration would not be able to use the new emergency-rule process to undo the damage.\n\nYou should also be aware that the new Secretary of the Department of Health Services, Dennis Smith, is no friend of Medicaid.  He has written in the past, during his tenure with the Heritage Foundation, advocating that states should DROP MEDICAID ENTIRELY.  This is who will be in charge of the changes.\n\nTime is short.  The bill could pass within days, and the only issue that's making the news, that most people know about, is the union-busting part.  Even if the unions are saved -- which I surely hope happens! -- the assault on Medical Assistance and the MA Waivers will go through untouched unless somebody starts noticing.\n\nMake some noise, people!  This is HUGE and it's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\nP.S.

{"date": "Saturday, March 5, 2011", "body": "\nIt hasn't been the kind of week that serves coherence.  So, today on Elvis Sightings, a heaping helping of stream-of-consciousness.\n\nWe all went to Grandma Judy's wake last night.  It was so good to be with family, and to take part in this shared ritual of closure.  Neither Rose nor Joy had ever encountered an open casket before.  But Rose bravely went up to the front to \"pay her respects\" as we had discussed with her beforehand.  Joy went up a little later in my arms.  I think she might have been a little confused, as she reached out to Grandma Judy with an uncertain smile.  I told her that it was time to say \"bye-bye.\"  She gave a small wave and an adorable spoken \"bye-bye.\"\n\nGoodbyes are so hard.\n\nWe had brought all sorts of tools and tricks to get the girls through the evening, from a portable DVD player & Baby Einstein to Rose's sketchpad and her little ZhuZhu-pet video game.  But it was AuntieS who saved the day.  She brought a brand-new travel set of the game Guess Who? that Rose could play with her cousin.  For Joy, she brought one of those soft plastic bath-scrubby-poufs with a terry-cloth ducky in the middle.  Once again AuntieS scored big, as she did with the curly-ribbons at Thanksgiving time.  Joy spent the rest of the evening watching video and happily shredding the bath-pouf.  Simply perfect.\n\nJoyDad will represent our little family today at the memorial service and burial.  It didn't make sense to try to chivvy the girls through a day as long as this one will be.  I'll be there in spirit, though.\n\nThis all comes at the end of a long, hard week.  It's been on my heart to join the amazing huge creative peaceful protests at the Capitol building, and re-fill myself with their hope and energy, but I've been unable for over a week.  Schedule is part of it, and sickness even more.  Both Rose and Joy were home from school most of the week fighting the flu, and I was trying to care for them and fight pneumonia myself.  Thank heaven for antibiotics (for me), and for speedy recovery (for all of us.)\n\nThe events of the day in Wisconsin continue to seep into most everything we do.  When I went to the deli counter last weekend, wearing my \"Save Medicaid\" sticker on my coat, the guy at the counter asked \"So, what can I get for you?  [pause]  Besides a new governor?\"   When I went to the doctor with my complaint of sleeping difficulty and on-rushing bronchial issues, he asked me whether there was a movement to recall this governor who has pushed forward this extreme agenda so very far in excess of anything he'd campaigned on.  I left with prescriptions for the aforementioned antibiotics, a sleep aid, and the doctor's personal e-mail address -- promising to send him the website address where he could add his name to the pre-recall database at http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/.  (In this state an official must hold office at least a year before a recall can take place; at that time, there is a 60-day window to collect sufficient signatures.)\n\nHealthcare workers and professionals are marching in support of Medicaid in Wisconsin today (Saturday), starting at 11am on campus at Library Mall.  I wish I could join them, but I'm on childcare today.  I'll be thinking of them, and looking forward to seeing pictures.\n\nI was on childcare last Saturday as well, while JoyDad and brothers were helping GrampaK get some things taken care of.  Let me be clear, I am ever-so-willing to hold up my end and do what needs to be done! but last weekend it meant that I ended up forgoing the opportunity to be in this political ad:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecsX7HxRork. I have not embedded the ad-video here because it is highly partisan, and frames the events in Wisconsin as a \"war,\" terminology that I would personally prefer to avoid.  But it's a powerful piece, and I would very much have liked to add my story and get a mention of Medicaid into the ad, something that did not happen in my absence.\n\nHowever, it's not as if I'm lacking a voice this week.  I've had the opportunity to have some of my writing published on a national level (under my real name, so no link here, sorry!)  And that feels good.\n\nAfter several weeks of high intensity, I do feel now that the initial frantic urgency of \"Medicaid emergency and nobody even knows!\" is receding.  People do know now, and many other voices are being heard.  It's time to take a deep breath, and move things to a level more manageable for the longer term.\n\nRight after I write just one more blogpost / Facebook status / protest letter...\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=187586847943694", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecsX7HxRork"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/03/random-thoughts.html", "title": "\nRandom Thoughts\n"},

It took years of patient long-term advocacy (with some good old-fashioned hollering thrown in), but finally in 2009 it became law: insurers in Wisconsin were required to cover evidence-based autism-related treatments.\n\nBut now two new bills are circulating, expected to be introduced in the next week or two, that would undermine autism insurance and a whole series of other insurance requirements.  Orwellianly-dubbed the \"Health Choices and Opportunities\" bills, they would set in motion a chain of events that would eventually allow the insurance commissioner to waive the mandates we fought so long and hard to put in place.\n\n\nThe ten hours per week of autism therapy that Joy now receives are covered by our insurance.

{"date": "Monday, February 28, 2011", "body": "\n\"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\"  \nMatt. 25:40, from a parable of Jesus\n\nI heard something from Joy last night that came as a total surprise, something long awaited, something I've wanted to teach but I didn't know how.\n\nShe said, \"Sorry.\"\n\nIt wasn't just once either -- it was all of three times!  Granted all three were echoes, prompted by adults.  And I'm not at all happy about the incidents that prompted the need for apology: a hairpull, throwing a toy in the church nursery, tromping hard on her sister's toes.  I'm simply rejoicing, however, that she's able to make that echo, no matter how much she understands or doesn't!  It will make peer relations so much easier.\n\n\"Sorry\" has a steep learning curve.  I'm engaged in a process with a steep learning curve as well.\n\nI gave a presentation last night to the adult Sunday-school class for my congregation, on Medicaid in Wisconsin and the so-called \"budget-repair\" bill.  Members of our congregation have been deeply involved in citizen action in the wake of the various threats represented by the bill: to livelihoods, to the right to negotiate collectively, to the University of Wisconsin, to public education, to our economy as a whole, and so many more.  People from our congregation have marched, written letters, signed petitions, shared information, and even had a group sleepover at the Capitol building on Thursday night (complete with kids!)  I was moved by the enthusiasm at last weekend's retreat, creating a lovely pile of protest signs about the still-little-understood threat to medical assistance and public input that the bill contains.\n\nAt the retreat sign-making activity, I found myself asked to explain exactly what I meant when I said \"Medicaid\" and \"medical assistance\" and \"BadgerCare,\" and found myself coming up short.  Fortunately the press event that next afternoon got me started with a lot of information that I then wanted to share.  I did share some of it here on the blog, but Medicaid is a complex program with many, many parts.  I realized that I was feeling called upon to share still more, and to ask my congregation for further commitment and action.\n\nSo I offered to teach an adult Sunday-school class, and they gave it to me right away.\n\nI wish I could do justice to the insightful questions and comments that came up during those 45 minutes.  I was surely pushing the limits of my expertise, and others -- doctors, social workers, MA recipients -- chimed in with a will.  One comment right at the end of the session, though, reminded me most poignantly how much I still have to learn.\n\nI am coming from a frame where my family receives medical assistance funds for the purpose of making it possible for my daughter Joy to live at home rather than in an institution.  During my LEND fellowship last year I heard a great deal about the history in Wisconsin and beyond of the policy shifts than now enable people with disabilities to move out of institutions into the community or to avoid institutions altogether, generally at significant cost savings.  I also heard moving stories at last week's press event from people who rely on Medicaid dollars to live as productive community members, and are scared beyond belief that their support will be taken away and they will be warehoused in nursing homes.\n\nThis bias rang so loudly through my presentation that I failed to acknowledge the immense, vital role played by institutional facilities in situations where people's needs are so great and complex that living at home or in the community is not the best, or healthiest, or even survivable choice.  And the commenter was deeply concerned about that aspect of my presentation.\n\nShoot, I knew better!  I'd only to think of GrammaJ, now in her last days in a hospice facility.  GrampaK could never have taken care of her at home these weeks!\n\nSo I needed to get called on it, a painful but necessary public corrective.  Indeed, the voices of those who need such a level of care are even less represented than those who are succeeding in the community.  Truly \"the least of these\" when it comes to having a voice in the public debate.  Their funding is at risk too.\n\nI listened.  I let my thoughts be changed.  I acknowledged my shortcoming, and apologized.\n\nThere is precious little listening coming from the Governor of Wisconsin and most of the legislators of his party who have (for the most part) been marching in lock step with the bill and its outrages and its timing.\n\nHowever, word has it that one of the Republican state senators who has previously been in favor of the bill, has now changed his mind and says he will vote against it: Sen. Dale Schultz of District 17.  He can be thanked at sen.schultz@legis.wisconsin.gov.  Only two additional no-votes are needed.  Update: the previous paragraph now appears to have been an unconfirmed rumor.  Sigh.\n\nThere have been calls for Governor Scott Walker to begin listening, and mind-changing, and even perhaps apologizing. This scenario is not likely.  But minds and hearts will need to be open to change, to negotiation, to the needs of the vulnerable, in order for the outcome of this budget process to be anything but catastrophic.\n\n==========\n\nSo as to end on a lighter note, I'll close this morning with a joke that's making the rounds on Facebook.  Peace out!\n\nA unionized public employee, a member of the Tea Party, and a CEO are sitting at a table. In the middle of the table there is a plate with a dozen cookies on it.

{"date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "body": "\nJoy has a very useful new \"word.\"\n\nActually, it's a cleverly generalized new utterance of protest.\n\nI think it started as a \"don't fence me in\" kind of thing.  When she encountered a door she wanted to go through, but the plastic safety-knob was foiling her, she'd demand \"open\" with a loud \"P...puh...puh!\"\n\nThat \"p...puh...puh\" has now become her generic noise of protest, to be used whenever she isn't getting what she wants, whether the remedy requires \"open\" or not.  Then if we can't get her re-directed, the next step is the explosive acts we're familiar with: swatting, self/others bite attempts, pulling out her own hair though I've got it chopped down to under two inches long now.\n\nI think I spent most of yesterday saying \"p...Puh..PUH!\"  And it got louder in the evening.\n\nI awoke yesterday morning to news of a blog-post by a prominent professor of history at UW-Madison.  William Cronon, an even-handed, mild-mannered, non-partisan scholar, had published a magnificent blog-post the other week, detailing his findings on what organizations were involved in the flood of look-alike anti-union, anti-immigrant, anti-Medicaid, pro-big-corporation legislation that's been coming down in Wisconsin and other states.  His scholarly March 15 post, Who's Really Behind Recent Republican Legislation in Wisconsin and Elsewhere? pulled the veil back on the secretive, well-financed national collaboration on the part of the Republican party that is resulting in... that which we've been protesting here.\n\nTwo days later, the Republican Party of Wisconsin set out to shut him up.\n\nWisconsin Republican Party headquarters served the University with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, demanding all of Cronon's university e-mails since Gov. Scott Walker took office, containing any of the words \"Republican, Scott Walker, recall, collective bargaining, AFSCME, WEAC, rally, union, Alberta Darling, Randy Hopper, Dan Kapanke, Rob Cowles, Scott Fitzgerald, Sheila Harsdorf, Luther Olsen, Glenn Grothman, Mary Lazich, Jeff Fitzgerald, Marty Beil, or Mary Bell.\"\n\nFirst they want to catch him using university e-mail for partisan political purposes, something he's way too smart to have done.  But secondly, they want to intimidate Cronon and anyone else who works at the university.  And thirdly, it seems clear they want to comb through all those e-mails to find some snippet that (when taken out of context) can be used to discredit and embarrass him.\n\nCronon's reponse to the absurd demand, Abusing Open Records to Attack Academic Freedom, was level-headed and lengthy.\n\nSo after a day stewing about this, we get the evening news.  About THE BILL that was rammed through the Wisconsin legislature via dirty tricks.  THE BILL that was blocked by a temporary restraining order that had us celebrating a week ago, because now it was going to have to work its way through the courts instead of being published into law on March 25 by the WI Secretary of State.\n\nGuess what, friends.  They don't give a fig for the rule of law.\n\nThey ordered the Legislative Reference Bureau, a non-partisan agency of the Wisconsin government that analyzes legislation and keeps the archive of what's been made official... to PUBLISH THE BILL INTO LAW.  Even though only the Sec. of State can do that, and he's been enjoined by the courts not to do so.  And then, even though the LRB and a number of others have said that this end-run does NOT make the bill law, Sen. Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald has announced that they're going to act as if it's law anyway.\n\nP...puh...PUH!\n\nOnce again, due to family obligations, we won't be on the Capitol Square this morning.  Maybe we can take a trip there later in the day.  I hope that the crowds are huge... and vocal... and continued non-violent, as we have so proudly accomplished through all these weeks despite the ratcheting up of the provocations.\n\n\nCheck out the lower button: Keep Calm, and Protest On.\n\nI got these buttons on State Street the other Friday during my activist-date with JoyDad, an image that I had first seen on a portable sign at the top of Madison's State Street right near the Capitol.  I loved it already without knowing its history.  Now that I've looked it up, it resonates even more.\n\nThe underlying image is a poster that says Keep Calm and Carry On.  The poster dates back to Britain of 1939, where (according to a well-sourced Wikipedia article) it was produced by the British government to raise morale under the threat of invasion.  The poster was re-discovered eleven years ago and has been distributed widely since then.\n\nNow, with the substitution of the word \"Protest\" for \"Carry,\" it has become an iconic image of our Madison response.  In many ways, it feels as if Wisconsin has been invaded by a hostile occupying force -- not through bombing but through stealth and lies and corporate financing.\n\nKeep Calm, and Protest On.  Here are the crucial upcoming voting-related priorities:\n\n-- Vote JoAnne Kloppenburg for Wisconsin Supreme Court April 5.\n-- Volunteer or donate to the recall efforts for the 8 eligible Republican state senators.\n\nWe won't bite.  We won't pull hair, tempting as it is.  We will keep calm, we will carry on, we will protest on.  And we will win -- their very desperation is the best indication.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://scholarcitizen.williamcronon.net/2011/03/15/alec/", "http://scholarcitizen.williamcronon.net/2011/03/24/open-records-attack-on-academic-freedom/", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_f22629e6-572a-11e0-ab2f-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UskzKuoULq4/TY22MBjAvHI/AAAAAAAAAys/YFiDRUZDrQE/s1600/protest-on.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On", "http://www.kloppenburgforjustice.com/index.html", "http://act.boldprogressives.org/survey/vol_wiunion_recallinformation/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/03/keep-calm-and-protest-on.html", "title": "\nKeep Calm and Protest On\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2011", "body": "\nThere's some wonderful stuff going on with Joy, beyond the birthday party and swimming I talked about in the last post.\n\nI haven't yet told you about the birthday card she decorated for her classmate.  Poor Joy has not had a happy relationship with writing-utensils over the years.  We keep trying to get her to make marks on paper, and she would rather do anything else -- crumpling the paper ranks much higher on her preference list than drawing on it.  Even so, I've made her \"sign\" every card that's gone out under her name or from the family, usually a hand-over-hand mark made under protest.\n\nBut they've been working at school with drawing-on-paper.  And look what she produced when I put marker in hand and held down the birthday card for her to \"sign\":\n\n\nAll I did was hold the paper down.  She did the spirals herself, no hand-over-hand involved except to help get the marker-cap back on.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nIn our computer-bookmarks for years has been a fun baby-game site called Kneebouncers.  The games are super-easy and work by just clicking on the screen or hitting any key.  Unfortunately they recently went to a paid-subscription model, but there are still a couple of freebies, and we made a great breakthrough with one of those this weekend.  The game is called Peek-a-bouncer, and to make it work, you have to click-and-hold (or push any key and hold).  Then the curtains slide open and you see a funny face and a voice intones \"peek-a-boo!\"\n\nJoy always tended to get frustrated with this game, because with the other games, all she had to do was a quick click to make things happen.  In Peek-a-bouncer, if you just quick-click, the curtains barely budge and the voice gets cut off.\n\nBut on Sunday, after much hand-over-hand play, where I'd help her hold the mouse-button and I'd say the words \"push-and-hold!\" in the same tone as the \"peek-a-boo!\" -- she actually began to push-and-hold on her own.  Experimenting with how much hold it took to create how much effect.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd then!\n\nLast night Joy's newest barista (autism line-therapist) got Joy to turn a difficult evening around quite dramatically.  Joy had been having a rough time, didn't want to be in any of our standard rooms, the barista was trying all the favorite stuff to no avail.  They were working in Joy's bedroom when the barista as a last-ditch effort thought to ask her: \"Break?\"  And Joy understood immediately, and dived on her own into her bed-tent, where she immediately set to work on putting herself back together.  Over the course of 5 minutes in the tent, Joy stimmed herself from angrily-overwrought into pleasant-mood.  The rest of the session then took place in pleasant-mood mode.\n\nThis is something we're going to USE.

{"date": "Thursday, March 10, 2011", "body": "\nRose and I went to the Capitol for an hour last night.  We stood with our signs as the crowd demanded to be let in and speak the outrage over the bill that passed the Wisconsin Senate last night.  In a nutshell, the Republicans in the Senate replaced the so-called \"budget repair bill\" with just the supposedly non-fiscal items from the bill, so they didn't need a budget-level quorum to go ahead and have the vote.  That's right folks, the \"budget-repair\" bill that passed last night is the non-budgetary stuff.  (Shame on them.  Shame.)\n\nThey intend to have the Assembly pass the bill this morning.  They have the votes.  Then the governor will sign it, and collective bargaining as we know it for public employees in the state of Wisconsin will be gone. \n\nA version of the provisions surrounding rule-making on Medicaid was in the bill.  However, it is not the full outrage that was in the original budget-repair bill.  It appears they have blinked at least so far as to leave the standard administrative-rule making process intact.  They did not give themselves the power to do it behind closed doors -- though the outlines of what they're now going to do in broad daylight are ugly enough.\n\nHere's a quote from the Save BadgerCare Coalition Facebook page, from Jon Peacock of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families:\nthe new version doesn\u2019t give DHS any new rulemaking authority, yet they can still use rules to supersede nearly all of the portions of MA law, and they could probably use the existing emergency rule authority, but they would have to follow up by using the regular rulemaking authority, which improves opportunity for public input and more legislative oversight.\nFor anyone policy-wonky enough to be wondering \"why do they need to do all this?  Don't departments usually have broad rule-making authority anyway?\"   The answer lies in another measure that was passed by the Walker administration earlier in this \"special session.\"  In that measure, the governor increased his own power over administrative rule-making, decreasing the power of the departments.  These provisions on Medicaid -- if I am reading correctly -- are now giving back that power to the Department of Health Services in particular.\n\n[UPDATE: I should also highlight the important part of Jon Peacock's information about using the rules to supersede Medicaid-related statute (laws).  This part is not the way things normally work in Wisconsin, and is actually quite a sweeping new authority.  Ordinarily the Constitution is the top authority, statutes cannot conflict with the Constitution, and rules cannot conflict with statutes or the Constitution.  This bill -- soon to be law -- makes an exception for new emergency rules about Medicaid, allowing them to trump statute.  This is still undemocratic, it's still huge, and it's not well understood.]\n\nOh, and the bill also includes some tricky maneuvering that will repeal the powers given to the DHS regarding Medicaid, as of 1/1/2015.  Which marks the end of the Walker administration.  If he lasts that long.\n\nI have added links to the text of the bills on my WI Budget 2011: Medicaid page.  Keep checking there for further links.\n\nA few more things to point out.\n\nIf Walker is recalled, and a Democratic governor is elected, that new governor will be able to make appointments to head all the agencies.  Which would mean a Democratic-friendly replacement for DHS's Dennis Smith.\nPledge to Recall Scott Walker -- complete with donation form!\n\nThe first opportunity to stem this rising tide of damage will be to recall the 8 eligible Republican Wisconsin State Senators.\nSign up to help with the Senatorial Recall\nDonate to Recall the Republican 8\n\nOn April 5, we will have the opportunity at the ballot box to reverse the conservative majority in the Wisconsin Supreme Court.  This will be immensely important as court challenges to various actions of the Walker administration wend their way to the high court.  Vote JoAnne Kloppenburg!\n\nWear black today in solidarity (Thursday 3/10/2011).  Contact your legislators.  And come down to the Capitol if you can.  There were protests around the clock last night.\n\nShame on the Walker administration.  Shame.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_8747fa04-4a74-11e0-8e6b-001cc4c03286.html", "http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Save-BadgerCare-Coalition/109369585797735", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_655ff8b6-0d1a-11e0-a369-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/", "http://action.seiu.org/page/s/wisconsinrecall", "https://secure.actblue.com/page/recallrepublican8", "http://www.kloppenburgforjustice.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/03/medicaid-and-what-passed-wi-senate-last.html", "title": "\nMedicaid and What Passed the WI Senate Last Night\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, March 20, 2011", "body": "\nFriday was a good day.\n\nJoyDad and I both had the day off.  Unpaid, since it was a required furlough day for me and he took a \"moveable\" furlough day.  But still, a day off for the both of us, with both kids in school.\n\nSeveral hours into our spring-cleaning & online activism, we got some lovely news.\n\nThe so-called \"budget repair\" law, passed in an undemocratic sneak-attack the previous week, had been put on hold by a Dane County judge!\n\nJudge MaryAnn Sumi of the Dane County court agreed with Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne that the apparent violation of Wisconsin's open meetings law was sufficiently serious to warrant a temporary restraining order, preventing the law from going into effect until the court can hold a full hearing the week of March 28.  (The law was scheduled to be published March 25, to take effect March 26).\n\nJoyDad and I decided to go downtown and celebrate.  After all, if the law were to delay our paycheck-whacks even one week, that's over $100 we'd have available again to pump back into the local economy!  \n\nSo we went to the Capitol around noon.  I carried a sign that thanked the judge on one side, and on the other said \"Rule Against the Bill!\"  Got lots of thumbs-up and car honks.  (In Madison these days, you don't just lay on the horn to support the protesters.  Instead, you tap the horn to the cadence of the chant: \"This is what democracy looks like!\")  We walked through the Capitol, and then joined a group singing protest songs at the top of State Street for a while.\n\nThen we walked down State Street and found a restaurant with supportive signs in the windows, and had a lovely lunch.  We made sure to tell them exactly why we felt able to do so, and why we chose them in particular.\n\nAnd the sun was shining, and our crocuses were blooming in the flowerbed, and we felt some of the first real hope we've felt in an entire month of unrelenting bad news.  Not that this is over, by any means.  The majority party will appeal every step of the way, probably up to the Wisconsin Supreme Court if it gets that far.  (Vote JoAnne Kloppenburg for Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice April 5!)  They can even take up the bill again from scratch, give appropriate notice, and presumably pass it again.  But the public outcry would be immense, it would be an admission that they didn't do it right the first time, and the protest movement would only gain new steam.\n\nAnd then!  I took Joy to her swimming lesson after school, which is just about her favorite part of the week.  I got to see her hoist herself out of the pool on her own, at the place where the water was too deep to get a boost from the bottom.  I got to see her propel herself from one platform to another one five feet away, all under her own steam.  I got to see her blow bubbles in the water (in between drinking it.)  And I didn't even have to do a big clean up in the locker room of the generally-inevitable laxative effects of water-play -- she waited till later that evening!!\n\nSaturday, too, was a good day.\n\nJoy and I attended a birthday party for one of her classmates in the afternoon, an invite-the-whole-class affair.  It was held at the apartment-dwelling of the birthday girl, probably about 10 kids in a small space with hard surfaces.  The noise was pretty intense.\n\nJoy, however, hung in remarkably well.  We had a good 20 minutes before she began a big protest, and then we were able to go into the hall and walk the stairs and laundry-room for a while and calm down enough for a second try.  I had provided ribbons for her own use, so the wrapped packages wouldn't be too much a temptation.\n\nSince it was all classmates, they are well-acquainted with spending time with her and were very sweet.  The birthday girl made sure that Joy got a turn with the blindfold from the pin-the-tail game -- we turned it into a peek-a-boo game, and then Joy did manage to take a turn sticking a tail onto the donkey (after everyone else was done, and without blindfold or spin.)  At a later point I asked another little girl if Joy could play with some discarded paper from an unwrapped present.  Not only did she bring that paper over, a minute later she came around again bearing a curly ribbon for Joy's use!\n\nWe made it through over an hour in total, long enough to enjoy some cake.  Joy wasn't the only kid who cried during that time, and none of the other crying was caused by her.  And as we left, there was another kid who was also overwhelmed by the noise -- the hostess was just calling his mom to come pick him up.\n\nSO included.  It felt great.\n\nOne more \"good\" to share.\n\nRose and JoyDad got to take a turn at the Capitol while Joy & I were at the party, but I got my turn in the evening.  I joined an interfaith vigil that meets every night now for an hour at the Capitol, 7-8pm.\n\nWe weren't a big group, and we weren't allowed to light our candles -- a couple of law-enforcement fellows very nicely told us that they had their orders regarding the defacing qualities of dripping wax.  (One of our number spoke up, \"That's OK, these guys are public workers, they're on our side!\" and got some discreet grins and nods from the cops.)\n\nWe held signs, and sang.  Last night's organizers had also printed out brightly-colored slips of paper with relevant quotes from various scriptures and philosophers and other leaders and thinkers.  We took turns reading quotes and then taped them into a collage.  I also took some chalk and put one of the quotes onto the pavement:\n\"There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.\" \u2014 Elie Wiesel\n\nAmong our number were two boys on the autism spectrum.  One of them played a hand drum enthusiastically as we sang.  He wrote his own message in chalk to the Governor on the Capitol's very front step after the vigil, just as I was leaving.  I believe the message was taking a turn for the rude... but y'know, this young man has the right.  He's among the ones who stand to lose the most.\n\nTwo very good days.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_9b967cde-5176-11e0-b8df-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://www.kloppenburgforjustice.com/index.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/03/two-good-days.html", "title": "\nTwo Good Days\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 28, 2011", "body": "\nI carried a new sign to the Capitol Square yesterday:\n\n\nIt says:\nALEC is hazardous to our health care - protect Medicaid & insurance mandates!\nSo what is ALEC?  I actually had an oblique reference to it in my last post -- it's the organization that distinguished professor William Cronon wrote about so convincingly in the blogpost that caused the Wisconsin GOP to start a witch-hunt into his university e-mails two days later.  One small excerpt from Cronon's writing to set up the explanation:\nIf it has seemed to you while watching recent debates in the legislature that many Republican members of the Senate and Assembly have already made up their minds about the bills on which they're voting, and don't have much interest in listening to arguments being made by anyone else in the room, it's probably because they did in fact make up their minds about these bills long before they entered the Capitol chambers.\nALEC is the organization that provides the text of those bills on which they have already made up their minds, marching in lock step with no room for debate.  ALEC stands for the American Legislative Exchange Council (their site has been up and down since Cronon's post was published, but it is up as I type now).  It's a membership organization with a secret membership list of Republican legislators and business interests.  Not just anyone can join: Republican legislators can join after being vetted, paying $50 per year in dues.  Businesses pay thousands of dollars for a seat at the table.  Then those conservative legislators and the deep-pocket business partners sit down together and draft legislation that then shows up, with minor modifications, in state-houses across the country.\n\nThis is how, when they get majorities like they have in Wisconsin, they can move so fast and so ruthlessly.  The legislation is all ready-made from out of state!\n\nNow, as Cronon pointed out in his piece, there's nothing wrong with like-minded folks getting together and strategizing about legislative goals.  On the other hand, what makes ALEC different and frightening, as Shawn Doherty of Madison's Capital Times sums up the objections, is \nthe corporate and wealthy interests behind ALEC (which others note include the billionaire Koch brothers) are far more organized, coordinated, and stealthy than anything we've seen before in this country.\nDoherty has been doing amazing investigative work on a fast-shifting landscape on the health beat here in Wisconsin, and I hope she wins awards for it.  She's the one who broke the story on the impending GOP bills I wrote about earlier this month, the ones that would smash not only the autism-insurance requirement we worked so hard so win, but also every other insurance mandate in Wisconsin as well.\n\nGuess what?  The mandate-busting bills are ALEC bills.\n\nDoherty makes this connection via an ALEC publication called The State Legislator's Guide to Repealing Obamacare (.pdf) [alternate Google-space copy here in case the ALEC original goes down.]  From Doherty's post:\nAlso included in ALEC's list of model legislation are proposals aiming to undo the power of health mandates, which the guide complains are \"often steamrolled into existence by politically active interest groups.\"\nThat's us, friends, a politically active interest group.  You better believe it.  Except that we don't have the deep pockets and conservative credentials that it takes to buy a seat at the table where the legislation is being templated.\n\nHence the ALEC bills that are waiting to be introduced in Wisconsin, LRB0373 and LRB1529.  From Doherty's post again:\nThis legislation, dubbed \"Health Choices and Opportunities\" by authors Sen. Leah Vukmir, R-Wauwatosa, and Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, Sen. is similar to what the ALEC guide calls the \"Health Care Choice Act for States,\" which allows people to purchase health insurance across state lines. In 2010, according to the guide, 19 states introduced such legislation, and Wyoming enacted it.\nThat's what my new sign is all about.  I want to see \"ALEC\" pop up on as many signs at the Capitol, and in as many bitter jokes, as quickly as the name \"Koch\" did when the funding connection and the prank call between a fake billionaire brother and Gov. Scott Walker made the news.  This needs to be a well-known part of the conversation, on everyone's lips, part of the argument as to why we need to vote JoAnne Kloppenburg into the Wisconsin Supreme Court April 5, and recall the 8 eligible Republican State Senators who are forcing this ALEC legislation down our throats, and then recall Scott Walker when the time comes.\n\nThere's an interesting tension here when it comes to talking about ALEC.  On the one hand, Bill Cronon did it and got a huge heavy-handed response just two days later.  As a university employee myself, it makes me at least a smidge-bit nervous about blogging too, though I'm doing so early in the morning on a personal computer on my day off!  But the more of us who spread the word, the harder it will be to come after us all... I am Spartacus!  (There are folks at the university who are now including all the open-records-demand keywords in their sig files on every message: \"Republican, Scott Walker, recall, collective bargaining, AFSCME, WEAC, rally, union, Alberta Darling, Randy Hopper, Dan Kapanke, Rob Cowles, Scott Fitzgerald, Sheila Harsdorf, Luther Olsen, Glenn Grothman, Mary Lazich, Jeff Fitzgerald, Marty Beil, Mary Bell.\"  Just in case someone asks, y'know.)\n\nOn the other hand, I've got friends in legislative-related jobs who have known about ALEC for years.  It's not as if the organization's existence and its mission are secret, or else they wouldn't have a web site, etc!  Plus, again in Doherty's article, she interviewed WI Sen. Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who took an almost nonchalant approach:\nBut so what, asks Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, when I call him about my discovery. Fitzgerald says he has been a proud member of ALEC since he first became a legislator in 1994, and is currently the Wisconsin State Chairman. State lawmakers have always turned to such national organizations for help brainstorming ideas and crafting legislation, Fitzgerald says. \"These groups are about exchanging ideas between different state legislators from around the country to be sure we're not isolating ourselves in Wisconsin,\" he tells me.\nWhich is it, guys?  Harmless collaboration or sinister plot?  Until the open-records intimidation-demand on Prof. Cronon is withdrawn, I'm going to have to go with the latter.  Especially since the legislation resulting from ALEC templates is so radically hazardous.\n\nWhich takes me back to our trip to the Capitol yesterday.  This time it wasn't just me -- it was me and both daughters, Joy's first protest participation.  There wasn't any formal protest planned, but these days there is a constant ongoing protest during daylight hours, a small but determined trickle of people circling the Capitol Square, carrying signs and encouraging one another in our resolve.\n\nThe following photo (a little freaky-looking with blurred faces but it was too good not to post!) was taken by a fellow protester we met on the Square, a stranger who turned out to have Mennonite connections back in my hometown Kansas community.\n\n\nKeep an eye on ALEC.  This story is still being written.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q7vVrzYpmcY/TY_19gXGG0I/AAAAAAAAAy0/U1kWGyGCTmc/s1600/alec-protest1.jpg", "http://scholarcitizen.williamcronon.net/2011/03/15/alec/", "http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home", "http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/health_med_fit/vital_signs/article_30e0cb12-5719-11e0-970f-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/health_med_fit/vital_signs/article_cff5e032-48ed-11e0-8d81-001cc4c03286.html", "http://www.alec.org/AM/pdf/hhs/State_Leg_Guide_to_Repealing_ObamaCare.pdf", "http://tinyurl.com/ALECvsObamaCare", "http://wisconsinhealthnews.com/wihealthnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/LRB-0373.pdf", "http://wisconsinhealthnews.com/wihealthnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/LRB-1529.pdf", "http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/health_med_fit/vital_signs/article_30e0cb12-5719-11e0-970f-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://dailybail.com/home/koch-prank-call-listen-to-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-as-he-t.html", "http://kloppenburgforjustice.com/", "http://www.recalltherepublican8.com/", "http://www.unitedwisconsin.com/", "http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_54c271b2-56e6-11e0-b524-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I%20am%20spartacus", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TOEWG0nujTc/TY_2Cd-7zVI/AAAAAAAAAy8/YZf0o-IPlWY/s1600/alec-protest2.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/03/alec-is-hazardous-to-our-health-care.html", "title": "\nALEC is Hazardous to Our Health Care\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "body": "\nThe amazing story in Wisconsin continues apace.\n\nYou would think that complying with a direct temporary-restraining-order (TRO) from a circuit court judge would be a no-brainer for the governor and legislators.  Accept the judge's temporary order, play the case out, then appeal if you think the outcome was unjust.\n\nBut in Wisconsin, we've apparently got no-brainers in charge of both the executive and legislative branches.\n\nAt issue is Act 10, THE BILL, the supposedly non-fiscal version of the so-called Budget Repair bill (!!).  This is the legislation that essentially kills collective bargaining for public employees in Wisconsin, gives the Medicaid-hostile Secretary of DHS unprecedented new powers, eliminates the organization that does payroll and beyond for Joy's respite-care provider, whacks the JoyParents' paychecks, and more.\n\nI'm not even going to try to recap the torturous route that Act 10 has taken over these past weeks, but we've gone rollercoasting from celebration to mouths-hanging-open at the lawlessness of the Walker administration, and that cycle has been repeating.  Temporary injunctions!  Defying the courts!  Slapdowns in court proceedings!  More defiance!  More slapdown!  \n\nAs of this writing, we're on a celebration cycle: right now, Act 10 is NOT law and NOT to be implemented.  The judge ruled yesterday that the TRO remains in effect until late May, when the legislative session is over and the Walker cabal can no longer declare immunity and have to haul their sorry selves into her courtroom so she can actually finish the case and make a real ruling. (Of course, if they waive immunity like their Democratic counterparts did, they could get this all over much more quickly.  Likewise, they could just go back and pass the bill over again, but they're afraid they don't have the votes and they're worried about the protestors!)  Expect shenanigans, expect appeals.  And vote JoAnne Kloppenburg for Wisconsin Supreme Court April 5, because the state supreme court is where all this is going to wind up.\n\nOne thing it's hard to deny is that we're winning on the recall front.  Less than halfway through the 60-day signature collecting window, the recall campaign has filed sufficient signatures to recall Sen. Dan Kapanke (R - LaCrosse).  His recall election will be the first to happen -- more will reach their signature goals after a flood of signatures is collected adjacent to polling places on April 5.  The recall organizers have announced that they're confident that there will be elections in six of the eight efforts to recall Republican state senators in Wisconsin -- which they wouldn't be saying publicly if they weren't very sure.  SIX!  And we only need to flip three of those districts to regain control of the state senate!\n\nThere's an inspirational recall-campaign ad that I'd like to share with you, that captures some of the passion and determination driving this movement.  Well worth a minute of your time to watch:\n\n\n\nWhether you're in Wisconsin or not, if you would like to affirm your support for workers' rights and beyond, you might be interested to know that there are events all over the country on April 4 and the week to come.  Why April 4?\nMartin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., where he was standing with sanitation workers demanding their dream of a better life. There are over 600 events scheduled across the country in the upcoming week in conjunction with this commemoration.  Find one near you.\n\nIn the midst of all this, the JoyFamily received some powerful affirmations this week.\n\nIt dates back to the church retreat in February, the one at which I coordinated a craft-project to make Medicaid-related protest signs.\n\n\nWe had to leave early before the Sunday morning worship so we could take the signs to a Medicaid-related press conference.  So we missed the conclusion of an activity that had been going on all weekend, in which every retreat attendee's name was written on a brightly-colored slip of paper and people could drop by the table to write anonymous affirmations.\n\nThe JoyFamily's affirmation slips made their way into our hands just this past Sunday.\n\nRose squirreled hers away to be a private source of delight.  I'm going to share from the other three, though.\n\nA snippet from JoyDad's:  \n\n\"I really appreciate your thinking -- your knowing that what happens to one affects all.\"\nA snippet from JoyMama's:  \n\n\"You have such perspective on anything you're passionate about & you draw me into your passion.  Love it!\"\nAnd the affirmations from Joy's sheet, in their entirety:\n\nWe are so glad you could be at Retreat!\n\nI value all you teach us.\n\nI love to see your smiling face.\n\nYou explore, connect, and explore some more.  Thank you for your spirit.\n\nThank you for everything you teach us, and for being your unique self.\n  \nThe tears are welling again as I type Joy's affirmations, as the tears came down when I read the sheet to her out loud.  We are blessed, so wonderfully blessed, to be part of such an affirming and caring church community.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_f22629e6-572a-11e0-ab2f-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_9bb38eb8-5a14-11e0-a6ee-001cc4c03286.html", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_195e7dd0-5b20-11e0-83bb-001cc4c002e0.html", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_0abe773a-5ba2-11e0-a42c-001cc4c03286.html", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_ef1b1a0a-5c97-11e0-adcb-001cc4c03286.html", "http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/would-wisconsins-anti-union-bill-pass-secon", "http://www.kloppenburgforjustice.com", "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_d60cbd02-5c6f-11e0-9fab-001cc4c03286.html", "http://local.we-r-1.org/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xgsQVOw41Vc/TWMRbeQVa-I/AAAAAAAAAxc/K0bPdLPsKoI/s1600/signs-table2.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/04/denials-and-affirmations.html", "title": "\nDenials and Affirmations\n"},

But it's also during jump-ins that one notices the tracking-device around Joy's ankle.\n\nI had noticed her daughter too.\n\nOne of the older students, doing racing-dives and more complex strokes (butterfly!) with a bunch of classmates in the long lane at the other side of the pool.  Young teen, maybe, with a not-yet-a-woman-but-getting-there kind of shape.  Obviously very fond of her male teacher, hanging on him noticeably -- what would have been cute in a first-grader was beginning to shade into the inappropriate for a 13-ish-year-old who didn't quite seem to have figured out the new boundaries.  He was patient with her.\n\nYesterday in the pool observation area, another mother was sitting near me, obviously watching Joy and her teacher, the closest people in the pool.  Joy's teacher nudged her to poolside, and Joy climbed out all on her own, moves that her teacher had had to help with just a couple weeks ago.  Great concentration and effort.\n\n\"Hardest-working kid in the pool,\" I commented proudly to the other mom.\n\n\"Oh, is that your daughter?\" she responded, and proceeded to amply reward my compliment-fishing.\n\nAnd then she said, \"Autism?\"\n\nI nodded.  \"Autism, and a few things more.\"\n\n\"My daughter's on the spectrum too.  PDD-NOS.  That's her in the far lane, green suit, just diving in.\"\n\nYes, that girl.\n\nThat girl had never had the one-on-one lessons that Joy has now, but her mom said that watching Joy had some very familiar feel to it.  How her daughter reacted differently to the water than the other (much younger back then) kids in her class.  How the sensory issues made such a difference, and then in her daughter's case the emotional part was huge too.\n\nAnd now she's doing the butterfly and looking just like the other kids in class, with the slight exception of hanging just a smidge too much on her teacher.  She won't likely swim on a competitive level, said mom, but she loves it and it's great exercise.\n\n\"It gets better.  It really does!\" she said.\n\nI can see it from here.  Joy is doing so well, we can track her progress at the pool by the week...\n\nAnd yesterday she got another achievement-ribbon.  I'll use the image of the one she got in February to illustrate, but the new one is like unto it -- a Level 2 / Guppy ribbon, in the \"Becoming More Independent\" category.  Her new achievement is \"Swim 3-5 Feet.\"  Unassisted, between 2 platforms, no feet on the pool bottom.\n\n\nI look forward to the day Joy can do the butterfly the full length of the pool.  And if she hangs a little too much on her teacher, well, she won't be the only awesome achiever who's ever done so.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pl74jc-5Z2M/TV-i68EE0iI/AAAAAAAAAxM/N5Cq93bsQtg/s1600/swim-ribbon.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/04/girls-at-pool.html", "title": "\nGirls at the Pool\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 7, 2011", "body": "\nHere's the long-promised roundup of our Memorial Day at the lake.\n\nBalloons for the birthday girl:\n\nAnd for her big sister:\n\nWe walked in the woods:\n\nAnd blew bubbles on the pier:\n\nAnd played with the bubble-swords on the screen-porch (thank you AuntLO and UncleDO for the gift of bubbly entertainment!)\n\nAnd enjoyed the heck out of pine-needles (so soft! so fragrant!):\n\nWe had unusually long stretches of independent play with the ring-stacker:\n\nAnd lots of people-peek play with the pompom:\n\nAnd the rocking chair:\n\nRose learned to cast with a borrowed fishing rod:\n\nAnd caught a 20-inch northern pike off the end of the pier!  (Actually, Rose hooked it, JoyDad landed it, and GrampaK de-hooked and released it.  Rose was not interested in even get near enough to \"her\" fish to be photographed with it.)\n\nVery tame, so far.  Minor adventures only.  Nothing nearly so eventful as last year...\n\nUntil we set out for home.\n\nWe'd decided to try & save some time by going out the \"back way,\" down a remote logging road that had recently been widened a little by a new logging operation.  We actually drove out to town that way on Monday, so we knew the road was passable (if a little muddy & exciting to drive.)  We and GrampaK were the last ones out on Tuesday -- he went one way, we went the other.\n\nAnd before we'd gotten more than a couple miles out, we zigged where we shoulda zagged -- and the passenger wheels sunk deep into soft mud at the side of the road.\n\n\"Everybody out,\" declared JoyDad, after the first attempt at backing up went nowhere.\n\nI swung my door open... and it barely cleared the mud.\n\nSo we all clambered out the driver's side doors, and I spent the next 10 minutes holding Joy and getting bitten by mosquitoes while JoyDad got muddier and muddier trying to dig out (without tools) or toss something under the wheels for traction (a losing battle.)\n\nFinally we decided that someone needed to hike out.  Probably about 3 hours walk to the nearest house.  We only had the one cell phone (mine) and of course no reception back-of-the-beyond as we were.\n\nSo the mud-spattered JoyDad set off down the road, glancing down at my cell for \"bars\" about every ten steps.  I piled back into the car in the mud with the girls, out of mosquito range, to settle in to try & entertain them for who-knew-how-long.  With no means of outside communication whatsoever.\n\nRose and Joy were two different entertainment challenges.  Rose was aware enough of the situation to have some imaginative worries, and kept asking when Daddy was coming back.  (As if I knew.  He'd set out at 8:45.  In my mind, the earliest he could possibly return with help would be 11am, and that was terrrrribly optimistic.  But I didn't name a time.)\n\nWe snacked.  I read chapter after chapter from Little Women.  Joy watched DVD -- how long would the battery last?  The sun started streaming through the trees onto the car, but I didn't dare run the air for more than 5 minutes every half hour, for fear of killing the battery too...\n\nAnd then, just at 11:00, a tow-truck appeared through the leaves.\n\nI didn't remember to get out with the camera to record the sunken car, but here's how it looked just after rescue:\n\nWe had guardian angels watching over us that day.  JoyDad got a shoulder-tap from the first one about 15 minutes into his hike.  He was watching that phone for the non-existent \"bars\" when all of a sudden... it RANG!  Still no bars visible, but just enough connectivity that it was able to let him know that there was a message waiting.\n\nThat message was from the angel -- because I almost NEVER use my cell unless I'm setting up a specific call.  Very few people have the number, and even fewer use it unless we've set up to speak.  And yet, someone from home-town had called, just about the time we were getting stuck.\n\nIf JoyDad hadn't gotten that voice-mail alert, he'd never have known about the patch of connectivity back there in the woods.  As it was, he was able to call 911 and be connected to a towing-company dispatcher and get help on the way.\n\nAnd then he walked out of the connectivity and didn't hit another patch before finally intercepting the tow-truck, about two hours after his hike began.\n\nSecond angel was a mechanic in Merrill, Wisconsin, who was able to take a look at our vehicle when it started making awful noise en-route, and (instead of taking us for a huge sum of cash in our distress) assured us that we'd make it home as long as we didn't accelerate into any sharp turns.\n\nI'll spare you the account of the rest of the trip -- it was long and warm and kinda cranky -- but we made it.  And even the total expense, between the tow and the next day's necessary repairs, weren't nearly as awful as they could have been.\n\nWonder how next year's trip will go (she says with fear and trembling!)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SVNADFomVHU/Te4FkuhDwNI/AAAAAAAAA0c/9_popB8FCNQ/s1600/2011-05-lake1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LEUvqMFFNvQ/Te4Fqw9gdQI/AAAAAAAAA0k/2iCfyt6QDig/s1600/2011-05-lake2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jd7se-Mz5XQ/Te4FxcOpoPI/AAAAAAAAA0s/EJ8PVaoleP0/s1600/2011-05-lake3.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FEnFXOBh2k4/Te4F3A7PTtI/AAAAAAAAA00/U8ZiQYCndnE/s1600/2011-05-lake4.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2E0lkzrWi9M/Te4GAp8hRlI/AAAAAAAAA08/iqe5m0a7aDw/s1600/2011-05-lake5.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Ti6H_GnysU/Te4GRfH2u0I/AAAAAAAAA1E/TDEqwF43rHA/s1600/2011-05-lake6.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WsQYUlLgYU4/Te4GZRtMxSI/AAAAAAAAA1M/Qm-9bmoBuYA/s1600/2011-05-lake7.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AmUXUvRsWA8/Te4GgOdBTFI/AAAAAAAAA1U/4fK0JGnGG0U/s1600/2011-05-lake8.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VWJMeNbRJUY/Te4GlHAIMNI/AAAAAAAAA1c/ZShDgQqS1DM/s1600/2011-05-lake9.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-894OE1TwLgk/Te4GrRqWEmI/AAAAAAAAA1k/zHlCGFtbF-s/s1600/2011-05-lake9a.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HBRaUwa3kBs/Te4HErdBYUI/AAAAAAAAA1s/KUDtJdXAqtY/s1600/2011-05-lake9b.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2I46EXUaFZw/Te4J8_X5CnI/AAAAAAAAA10/Z8ciYVDUcGU/s1600/2011-05-lake9c.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/06/northwoods-adventures-may-2011.html", "title": "\nNorthwoods Adventures, May 2011\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "body": "\nWhat are your long-term plans for Joy? asked her grandfather.\n\nWe were up at the family cabins for the long Memorial Day weekend, and we'd been very happy with how things went for Joy, compared to the struggles we've sometimes had in previous years.  But she turned seven while we were there, and one can't deny that she needs an awful lot of assistance for a seven-year-old -- diaper changes, constant close surveillance lest she dart away or eat something dangerous, lots of interpretation given that she speaks few words (and not many of them clearly).\n\nSo, what will we do when she grows up, assuming that serious issues still persist?\n\nShort answer: We don't know.\n\nLonger answer: The \"not knowing\" got a whole lot scarier this past week, here in Wisconsin.\n\nYou see, while you have a certain \"not knowing\" with any child -- What will I be? Que sera, sera! -- of course the \"not knowing\" is automatically more intense with developmental disabilities.  Joy is fortunate to have access to a lot of services right now, between her guaranteed public education through the age of 21, and the autism insurance that pays for therapies. We also get respite care and other services via a Medicaid waiver for children's long-term care services that helps families like ours keep their children at home rather than the institutionalization that was the norm not so many decades ago.  (Many children are on a waiting list for that waiver program -- we are SO fortunate in that regard.)\n\nBut both the schooling and the waiver run out when Joy reaches adulthood, and the program that would offer the next step, long-term community-based care into adulthood has been FROZEN by Wisconsin's budget committee.\n\nWisconsin has been making great strides in the past years when it comes to community-living services for frail elders and people with disbilities, primarily through a program called Family Care.  The top goal of Family Care, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, is\n\nGiving people better choices about where they live and what kinds of services and supports they get to meet their needs.The Family Care program provides Aging and Disability Resource Centers to help people figure out what assistance is available, and then (for those who qualify), \nthe new Family Care benefit, which combines funding and services from a variety of existing programs into one flexible long-term care benefit, tailored to each individual\u2019s needs, circumstances and preferences.Depending on the person's need, services might include things like:  adult day care, home modifications, home delivered meals, supportive home care, health care services, daily living skills training, day treatment, pre-vocational services, supported employment and more. \n\nBut in the slash-and-burn budget that is coming down the pike, the expansion of Family Care is slated to halt.  As of June 30, new Family Care enrollments will stop, and people will go on waiting lists instead.  This freeze will last the entire biennium, during which time waiting lists are expected to DOUBLE.\n\nThe majority-party nay-sayers on the budget committee (the Joint Finance Committee, for those folks keeping score) figure that families will figure out ways to pick up the slack for the most part -- caregiver quit her job & stay home, anyone? -- but meanwhile they've set aside some funding to put people in nursing homes in case of emergency.  Talk about going backwards!\n\nFor a family like ours, the \"not-knowing\" is looking across a span of years yet, with frightening consequences if the trend continues.  For Wisconsin families and youths currently planning their transitions out of high-school and into the adult world in the next couple of years?  This is a calamity, right here and now.\n\nA new grassroots effort called Wisconsin Families Forward is looking to avert the calamity as the budget containing the long-term care freeze moves on to the full legislature.\n\nFirst, Wisconsin Families Forward is conducting a survey of families (Urgent deadline, June 3!!) to discover how it would affect people to not have the services there when their young-adults needed them: \nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s/wilongtermcarecap\n\nThe Wisconsin Families Forward group also has a Facebook page! \n\nThe group is encouraging people to contact their legislators -- the budget goes to the full legislature next, so there's one last chance to lift the caps.\n\nThere will also be press events around the state; the one in Madison is Thursday, June 9, 10am at the Capitol.\n\nWe've got to keep telling the stories!\n\n==========\n\nThose of you who have been long-time readers of this blog know that after Memorial Day weekend, I have great fun with the post-getaway wrap-up blogging.  I promise, there will be such a post -- perhaps not such a cliffhanger as last year, but with some special excitement nonetheless!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Survival-Press-Release-JFC-Action-on-the-Long-Term-Care-Freeze.pdf", "http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/ltcare/Generalinfo/WhatisFC.htm", "http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/ltcare/Generalinfo/CMOs.htm", "http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/wilongtermcarecap", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wisconsin-Families-Forward/123421554407716", "http://www.dawninfo.org/news4/post.cfm/long-term-care-ltc-programs-cap"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/06/freezing-future.html", "title": "\nFreezing the Future\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2011", "body": "\nI note that my posts of late have been very upbeat.  There is plenty in Joy's life, in our lives, to feel upbeat about!  Joy has continued to do some amazing things as spring transitions into summer.  Here's a sequence from just yesterday morning that I snapped while she was playing independently with her musical gears-toy, experimenting all-on-her-own with placing things on the central gear to see them spin.\n\nA stack of gears that she built herself:\n\n\nThe bouncy-ball she got at the drugstore the other day:\n\n\nHer echo-ey microphone:\n\n\nThese are true stories that we tell, that encourage us to keep going -- despite the fact that she's pulled enough hair out of another patch on her head to make us consider going with the buzz-cut again.  And the fact that she's been apparently-randomly refusing food, and making those protests by suddenly spit-spraying large mouthfuls right into our faces.\n\nHere are some more lovely true stories from yesterday morning, as we went to the Capitol Square once more to protest the impending disastrous budget bill:\n\nI found myself being interviewed by a reporter for our local paper, who was intrigued by my \"Budgets are Moral Documents\" sign.  Here's the interview as it was happening...\n\n\nI got a chance to put in a plug for community long-term-care:\n\n[JoyMama] pushed her daughter in a stroller and carried a \u201cBudgets Are Moral Documents\u201d sign. She said her family would be harmed by proposed cuts to state funding for the long-term care of people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cWe keep hoping folks who have acted as moderate Republicans in the past will listen to their consciences,\u201d she said.\nThen Rose found, to her delight, a group of protesters hula-hooping for justice!  An intern from a local paper filmed her and Twittered the video out into cyberspace -- Rose is the one on the left doing the stand-on-one-foot tricks.  (Sorry 'bout the ads.)\n\n\n\nThen around the corner came a stream of educators marching against the education cuts in the budget -- and who should be leading the march but Joy's special education team!  So Joy and I left Rose with the hula-hoopers \nwhile we made a circuit of the Square in the company of Joy's beloved teachers.\n\nIt was a beautiful day.  It was good to be with sincere, creative people, determinedly protesting the trainwreck of a budget and other legislation that is being crammed through double-time, in a little-used procedure called \"extraordinary session\" that has NEVER been used to passed a budget before.\n\nAnd then we learned that, late in the day, amazingly-coincidentally in the nick of time, the Wisconsin Supreme Court (along partisan lines) had overturned a lower court's ruling that the so-called \"budget repair bill\" violated the state's open-meetings law.  The conservative members of the supposedly-non-partisan Supreme Court, bought and paid for by floods of corporate campaign cash, argued that the courts could not make the legislature abide by laws governing its own procedures unless those laws were part of the Constitution.  And the open-meetings law is just a statute, not part of the Constitution.  [I think I'm understanding this right.  It's very tangled.]\n\nHow did we come to this?\n\nWell, perception creates reality.  And the wealthiest corporate interests of this country have bought the perceptions of anyone who gets their information from Fox News, or right-wing radio, or conservative campaign commercials.  They've ridden those perceptions to electoral victories that then allow them to pass rapid-fire, coordinated, cookie-cutter corporate-written legislation via the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\n\nAnd they've effectively spread the lie that the coordinated propaganda and fear-mongering over at Fox News is somehow equivalent to how the rest of the news networks run... \n \nI am still hopeful about the recall elections in Wisconsin, that we can flip the state senate this summer and temporarily stop the bleeding.  If you are at all inclined to contribute to this effort, you can do so via the Act Blue fundraising page.\n\nBut I am feeling very low right now about the powerful, incredibly wealthy forces that brought us to this point, and the alternate propaganda-reality that they have created.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aXkv_DMrHfE/TfiaCXHrtnI/AAAAAAAAA18/XvnpbFtSEVE/s1600/2011-06-gears2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CHRlzaOJpCw/TfiafGxG3nI/AAAAAAAAA2E/TWjcsVkyO3Y/s1600/2011-06-gears1.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6sGM8jaCs1s/TfiaoGfgNUI/AAAAAAAAA2M/3yyytvuJlg4/s1600/2011-06-gears3.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tN_tFe5Uak4/TfidyXyZwRI/AAAAAAAAA2U/IJl-ryxy8F0/s1600/2011-06-interview.jpg", "http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-roger-ailes-built-the-fox-news-fear-factory-20110525", "https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/takebackwisconsin_pu"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/06/perception-creates-reality.html", "title": "\nPerception Creates Reality\n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 17, 2011", "body": "\nNow that school's out, I'm getting to spend a lot more time with my girls!\n\nYesterday started with a taunt left on our deck railing, from one of the squirrels who've been raiding our strawberry patch:\n\n\nOur top two morning activities were puddle-stomping and Capitol-visiting.\n\nIt was a sunny day, making for some excellent reflections.\n\n\n\n\nThen after we got cleaned up from that little escapade, we headed down to the Capitol, where the Senatorial rubber-stamp was about to be put on the devastating Wisconsin budget, all-cuts-all-the-time (major tax cuts for corporations, major cuts to schools and health care and middle-and-lower-income families, zero shared-sacrifice for those at the top of the heap.)\n\nThe Capitol was fairly quiet at mid-morning, other than a signficantly beefed-up police presence.  We got one kindly officer to take our picture beside Wisconsin's replica of the Liberty Bell.  Here's the plaque that sits next to it:\n\n\nThe top line reads, \"Dedicated to you, a free citizen in a free land.\"  Oh, the irony, after having had to go through a security gauntlet to get into the Capitol, designed solely to squelch protest (they'll be removing the metal detectors soon, within days of the budget taking effect.)  \n\nWe felt the \"freedom\" gut-punch once more as we attempted to visit our Senator's office.  We walked past Senator Risser's office door by accident a couple of times, because the 3-officer law-enforcement presence obscured our view of the names on the door.  (Risser's office shares a front door with Senator Leah Vukmir, from across the aisle).  When we finally figured out that this was where we wanted to be, and asked the lawmen if we could please enter, they asked us if we had an appointment.  Well, no, we didn't -- we're used to dropping in unannounced for visits with the staff, that's how things operate in Senator Risser's office!  No ma'am, we're not supposed to let you in without an appointment.  \n\nI'm glad I'm a known quantity in my state senator's office, for I was able to send in my card with one of the officers, and then the doors swung wide.  After our visit, one of the Risser staffers came out to speak to Senator Vukmir's palace guard the lawmen, and let them know that Senator Risser's office wants to speak with any constituent who shows up, appointment or no!  \n\nNext we took the elevator up, to wander around the observation deck at the base of the dome, and look out over the city and lakes from all angles.\n\nAnd then we went down to the Square again, and left some messages for anyone who wanted to read them, until the next rain washes them away.\n\n\nBudgets are moral documents.  And the budget that passed in Wisconsin last night badly, badly fails that standard.\n\n(Funny how sidewalk chalk is cute when it's a hopscotch frame or child's artwork, and VANDALISM! if it's got certain political content.)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z-81Jn_fM0M/Tfszcf9kNUI/AAAAAAAAA2c/9_WyNVDXbcE/s1600/2011-06-strawberry.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iJ4BRjzoQlI/Tfs204D7CpI/AAAAAAAAA2k/zZb6Z1_4YwM/s1600/2011-06-puddle2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8n0wdDSZdZQ/Tfs26VIpIKI/AAAAAAAAA2s/ghOJ-zi7fuU/s1600/2011-06-puddle1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zYdh2wz-S3M/Tfs3EAN-CAI/AAAAAAAAA20/gHFnsyy6EJM/s1600/2011-06-puddle3.jpg", "http://wisconsinbudgetproject.blogspot.com/2011/06/ten-year-tax-cut-tally-tops-two-billion.html", "http://wccf.org/pdf/budget_impact_wi_families_052311pr.pdf", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kHjHhB03-vs/Tfs48H9LtUI/AAAAAAAAA28/v_FORSi3p-Q/s1600/2011-06-libertybell2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ryxhL2uq3k/Tfs8gkPb8BI/AAAAAAAAA3E/QVUlAqamsNs/s1600/2011-06-chalk.jpg", "http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/15/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce-says-proteste/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/06/summer-activities-and-budgets-are-moral.html", "title": "\nSummer Activities (and, Budgets are Moral Documents)\n"},

We're continuing to practice at home:\n\n\nOur street is quiet enough that she can ride on the street as well as the driveway, though it's good to have another person nearby.\n\nRose doesn't want to be left out of the fun either, though her recent new inches have made it more challenging to fit herself onto Joy's trike:\n\n\nSpeaking of sizing, I pulled out Rose's old training-wheels bike just to give it a try.  Joy's too big for it!  We tried just a little bit, and she at least stayed upright, but she kept wanting to stretch her feet forward to the front wheel where the pedals SHOULD be, and also wanting to press the pedals backwards (which on the bike activates the braking function, but on the trike puts you into reverse.)  I'll see if I can adjust the seat and handlebars for our next try, but I'm thinking we're going to need a larger training-wheels bike to make this work. \n\nMeanwhile, we're having a long, summer-y weekend here.

Don't regulate curriculum or even visit campuses to see where the money is going.Except that description isn't fair to science experiments, in the absence of an attempt to create a hypothesis capable of being tested, or to collect meaningful data.\n\nThe article, titled \"McKay scholarship program sparks a cottage industry of fraud and chaos,\" tells a very different side of the story than the glowing voucher-advocate reports that are being used to promote similar legislation in Wisconsin. \nThe program works like this: any public school student with an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may enroll in a private school using taxpayer dollars that would have been spent for their public-school education.  Public schools are required to provide a free and appropriate education to students with disabilities under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\n\nUnfortunately, the private schools have no such requirement.  They don't have to provide anything, or have so much as a single special-educator or therapist on staff.  Not even when they're taking students funded with taxpayer dollars. \n\nIn Florida, according to the Miami New Times article, getting in on the McKay money is ridiculously simple:\nRegistering a private school is as easy as filing minimal start-up paperwork. Becoming eligible to receive McKay payments isn't much tougher and relies mostly on the honor system: You must claim to have a location, promise to run background checks on staffers, and either have been in business for three years or have access to a surety loan or line of credit.These astonishingly loose conditions are followed up with an almost total lack of accountability, allowing fraud to flourish.  In the 12 years since the program was introduced, there have been 39 Department of Education investigations in McKay voucher fraud, only 3 of which have resulted in arrest.  Far from being an accolade for the quality of the program, it's an indictment of the lax oversight: the department rarely looks for trouble unless someone -- often \"an associate with an axe to grind\" according to the Miami New Times article -- files a report.  Former Florida DOE investigator Seth Stoughton, specializing in voucher fraud, told the New Times that the most proactive his investigations ever got was driving around with an address list of McKay schools to make sure that schools actually existed at those addresses.  He claimed that the DOE failed to uncover \"even a significant fraction\" of the existing fraud.\n\nA couple of examples via the New Times of the fraud that was revealed:\n- The most common caper involves simple forgery: school administrators doctoring attendance records and signing parents' names to show that students are enrolled when they're actually not. Jacksonville's Success Academy \u2014 which received $4.8 million \u2014 was likely the largest such case. From 2001 through 2005, the school accepted $421,000 for 52 students who were enrolled in public schools.\n\n- At Muskateer's Academy in Hialeah (Stoughton says of the name: \"I think they just had no idea how to spell\"), husband and wife school owners Jacqueline and Erick Cermeno were indicted for stealing several students' disability information to falsely enroll them and pocket thousands in tuition. Muskateer's received $794,000 from the state.But outright criminality is only one of the problems among schools accepting McKay vouchers.  Since the curricula and teachers and locations are essentially unregulated, it leads to situations like the following at South Florida Prep:\nTwo hundred students were crammed into ever-changing school locations, including a dingy strip-mall space above a liquor store and down the hall from an Asian massage parlor. Eventually, fire marshals and sheriffs condemned the \"campus\" as unfit for habitation, pushing the student body into transience in church foyers and public parks.\n\nThe teachers were mostly in their early 20s. An afternoon for the high school students might consist of watching a VHS tape of a 1976 Laurence Fishburne blaxploitation flick \u2014 Cornbread, Earl and Me \u2014 and then summarizing the plot. In one class session, a middle school teacher recommended putting \"mother nature\" \u2014 a woman's period \u2014 into spaghetti sauce to keep a husband under thumb. \"We had no materials,\" says Nicolas Norris, who taught music despite the lack of a single instrument. \"There were no teacher edition books. There was no curriculum.\"Not only are desperately substandard schools receiving taxpayer money, the public schools appear to be actively pushing high school seniors out the door and into McKay schools before they have to take the all-important FCAT exam:\n\nBeginning a few school years ago, Carol City Senior High social studies teacher Paul Moore was mystified by a new, perennial exodus of his \"problem\" seniors \u2014 students who might fare badly on FCATs. They were kids he usually liked to have one last-ditch shot at improving their studies.\n\nEventually, he figured out where many of them had ended up: Parkway Academy in Miramar, a charter school and target in 2009 of the Florida High School Athletic Association's largest fine \u2014 $260,000; later reduced to $118,000 \u2014 for dozens of football recruiting violations. Other of Moore's missing seniors had scattered to private schools, most of them McKay-funded. \"It's an absolute policy in this state now to move at-risk kids to charter or private schools,\" Moore says.... The illicit practice even has a name: \"FCAT cleansing.\"I'll let you read the article itself to learn about how new McKay start-ups go recruiting in economically-disadvantaged urban areas, and how the program is set to expand.\n\nYou can bet that the proponents of the Special Needs Scholarship legislation that has cropped up in Wisconsin and elsewhere are not acknowledging these abuses in their materials (for example on this site pushing the Wisconsin version of the bill).  I'm perfectly willing to be fairer than that and acknowledge that there are families who had bad experiences in the public schools, who have been able to use these vouchers to move into better private-school situations.\n\nPriority number one, though, should be to FIX the public schools for students with special needs, rather than diverting their funding.  And why in the world would Wisconsin want to open the door to the abuses that have become evident in Florida?  As a press release from the Survival Coalition of Wisconsin Disability Organizations puts it, \"This is not what we want for Wisconsin students with disabilities!\"\nCurrent voucher proposals on the table in Wisconsin, which have been crafted without the support of any established statewide disability organization, do not include formal oversight or accountability to families or students. There is no guarantee that a child will receive the required and individualized services they have a right to in the public school. At the same time, voucher programs are expected to drain resources from already strapped public schools which are trying to serve special education students with research-based practices.\nThe Special Needs Scholarship Program bill in Wisconsin, AB110, which had a public committee-hearing this spring, will receive a new legislative push in the fall.  I invite friends of Elvis Sightings to join me in opposing this deeply-flawed legislation -- for the sake of Rose and Joy, and so many others like them!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-06-23/news/mckay-scholarship-program-sparks-a-cottage-industry-of-fraud-and-chaos/", "http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-06-23/news/mckay-scholarship-program-sparks-a-cottage-industry-of-fraud-and-chaos/", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/05/08/973973/-Piratizing-Special-Education-in-Wisconsin:-AB110", "http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2011-06-23/news/mckay-scholarship-program-sparks-a-cottage-industry-of-fraud-and-chaos/", "http://www.specialneedsscholarshipswi.org/", "http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Survival-press-release-on-Florida-voucher-investigation-6-23.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/07/special-needs-vouchers-in-florida-like.html", "title": "\nSpecial Needs Vouchers in Florida: \"Like a Perverse Science Experiment\"\n"},

Thank you so much for all your hard work the last few days in sending him emails and making phone calls.==============\n\nI've got several blogposts backed up in a jumble in my mind, but I'm going to hit an urgent advocacy-alert one first.\n\nThe Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2011 (CARA) needs our help to pass by September 30th.\n\nCARA is a 3-year re-authorization of federal funding that's been in place since 2006, which was first passed during the GW Bush administration.  The funding focuses on expanding research and coordination through the National Institutes of Health, increasing awareness and surveillance at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, and expanding the interdisciplinary training of health professionals to identify and support children with ASD and their families.\n\nFor me on a very concrete level, growing from how Joy has propelled me into autism advocacy -- this is what funded my LEND training two years ago, an amazing program that Elvis Sightings readers heard about at length as my LEND year progressed.  Via a state implementation grant, it also made possible the summer work that I did in 2010 on a recently-released publication called Finding Your Way: A Navigation Guide for Families Who Have Children and Youth With Special Health Care Needs and Disabilities.\n\nOn a macro level, this funding has helped with great strides in research and education and awareness all across the country.  We can't let it stop now!\n\nThe key legislator right now is House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who was a co-sponsor of the original 2006 act and must bring CARA to the House floor for a vote in order for it to pass.  UPDATE: He pledged to do it!!  Can you give his office a quick call?  Here's the phone info & a short script:\n\n===============\nCall House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and politely ask him to allow the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2005) to go to the floor for a vote.  CALL HERE: 202-225-4000\n\nWhat to say:\n\"Hi. My name is [name] and I am calling to ask Leader Cantor to allow HR 2005, The Combating Autism Reauthorization Act, to go to the House floor for a vote.  The funding is crucial for research and awareness on autism, and support for children with autism and their families. Thank you.\"\n================\n\nIf you've got another couple of minutes, here are some quick next-steps:\n\n1) Follow up the call to Cantor's office with an e-mail -- this link will help generate one for you!  Here's a new link to communicate a thank-you message!\n\n2) E-mail your own Senators & Representative: if you follow this link to the Autism Society \"Vote 4 Autism\" page, you can read more about CARA and then click on the \"Take Action\" button to send messages to your legislators.\n\nThank you so much, in advance!\n\n============\nP.S.

{"date": "Thursday, August 4, 2011", "body": "\nJoyDad & I had the immense good fortune last Friday to attend the premiere of a brand new play last weekend, The Lamentable Tragedie of Scott Walker, Govnour of Wisconsin.  The playwright and director is a friend from church -- and also our favorite Elvis impersonator -- and we'd been hearing for weeks about the play from various angles within the congregation: the writing, several of the actors, the props, the costuming (including Republican codpieces aplenty!)\n\n\nThough we weren't able to assist with any of the requested props, nor lend our acting talents, we did get a back-channel participation request right from the start.  Would we be willing, the playwright asked, to lend him our story for use in the play?  We were glad to say him \"aye,\" trusting that he'd do right by us, reflecting what the Wisconsin budget means for us and others like us, and why we've raised our voices as we have.  We didn't get much in the way of updates after that, a brief hint or two about who we'd turned into, and then the last update made it sound as if the final product had morphed quite far afield of any JoyFamily roots.\n\nIn the final weeks of preparation, JoyDad ended up contributing a recorded guitar solo for an original song, so we knew he'd have at least that presence in the production!\n\nLots of anticipation as we left Rose & Joy with yet another pair of friends from our congregation, to go see how the Lamentable Tragedie would represent what has happened in our state since February.\n\nIt well exceeded my high expectations.\n\nThe play takes the form of \"Fakespeare,\" telling the Wisconsin 2011 story in lively Bardic borrowings and transformations.  This English-major would see it again just for the thrill of trying to keep track of how many snippets from the canon I could identify!  The tragically over-reaching, self-absorbed yet un-self-aware Walker character wreaks his administration upon the state of Wisconsin, eminently recognizable as our governor, with moments as Hamlet, Macbeth, and even Juliet!  (Believe me, it works.  Just go with it.)\n\nA small but multi-talented cast of characters, gloriously costumed in multiple roles, ably represented state senators on both sides of the aisle, protesters and other Capitol denizens.\n\nAnd then there was a touch of Dickens among the Shakespeare, a little Cratchit-ish family where the hard-working father is a non-partisan public employee (who plays a mean electric lyre), and the Tiny Tim-ish character relies on Medical Assistance, and the mother finds herself giving testimony that is openly ignored by the powers that be.  And yes, my moment on the barrel with a bullhorn gets a nod as well.  We were definitely recognizable to ourselves, and to friends as well.\n\nEven without the interweaving of personal elements, I'd have been bowled over by this play, and how well it evokes what happened (and is still happening) here.  The dialogue is wickedly funny and clever, and manages not just to bring a powerful critique of the Walker administration, but swipe at protester and senatorial foibles on the left as well, making the heroes all the more heroic as they eventually band together. \n\nThe glimpses of JoyFamily on that small, spare stage made me feel simultaneously both proud and very much aware of being a small, small part in the larger play that is working out on the stage of Madison, and Wisconsin, even now.  That larger play is still being written, and will take a dramatic turn in one way or another on Tuesday with the recall elections as six Republican senators, who have been marching in lock-step with Walker, must answer to the voting public.\n\nOn Saturday morning, JoyDad and I were still thinking on the Lamentable Tragedie, and singing hey, nonny nonny.  And we had an Elvis-sighting at the breakfast table.  Joy clearly echoed \"nonny, nonny.\"  Just once, but it was definitely there.\n\nThank you, Doug, and players and participants all!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/LamentableTragedie", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yfFnoqz6EZY/TjtX_wCwsOI/AAAAAAAAA4s/d316AGJnJLw/s1600/2011-08-Lamentable.jpg", "http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=34253"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/08/hey-nonny-nonny.html", "title": "\nHey, Nonny Nonny\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 28, 2011", "body": "\nI'm dating myself with this memory, but the 1982 song \"99 Red Balloons (99 Luftballons)\" by Nena was part of the soundtrack of my high-school years.\n\nNinety-nine red balloons \nFloating in the summer sky \nPanic bells, it's red alert \nThere's something here from somewhere else...This was at about the time as the movie \"War Games,\" when the thought of accidental global thermonuclear war was in the public imagination.  The song protested the war machine with a fable of two children who release a bevy of toy balloons.  Some country's surveillance software takes the balloons for a security threat and: \"This is what we've waited for -- this is it, boys, this is war!\"\n\nI hadn't thought of that song for years, even when my daughters began to show great delight in helium balloons.  A red birthday-balloon tradition became especially strong with Rose, whose February birthday falls at just the right season for discount Valentine balloons!\n\n\nFor Joy, mylar balloons have always been a stimmy delight, from their dangly ribbons to their delightful crackly feel.  Once Joy came along, Rose had to learn to share the heart balloons -- though there were always plenty to go around.\n\nNow in Wisconsin, mylar heart-balloons have taken on a whole new meaning.\n\nIt started in February, when the protests against Governor Walker's appalling budget proposals broke out.  At some point during the initial protests, someone released a heart balloon in the Rotunda.  It floated up to the dome... and stayed there.  And stayed, and stayed.  As the protests morphed into work on the recall elections, and the major remaining protest presence in the Capitol was the daily Solidarity Singalong, the heart balloon became a symbol of the endurance of the protests.  A Capitol Balloon Facebook page sprang up, and a Twitter account.  When eventually the balloon did come down toward the end of June, it was taken to the Wisconsin Historical Society to be preserved for posterity.\n\nWith the original balloon gone, replacements began trickling in.  More balloons floated up to take its place, and protesters began delivering balloons to legislators.  The Department of Administration and the Capitol police began to take notice.  Soon there were reports of an arrest for a balloon release, and of police officers tailing a protester as she delivered balloons to legislative offices.\n\nThen on Tuesday, a bizarre act of violence.  The protester who had delivered the balloons was singing toward the end of that day's Solidarity Singalong, bearing a balloon ready for delivery to yet another office, when the facilities manager accosted her and began stabbing her balloon with a knife, repeatedly!  By the time the balloon was good and dead, there was blood on the protester and on the floor, though she had not been injured (it seems the knife-wielder had managed to cut himself in the process.) He then took off, leaving spatters of blood in front of the stairs that lead to the Wisconsin Supreme Court -- and she followed to demand his identification.  Instead of providing it, the protester & witnesses relate, he grabbed her and threw her into the door of the women's restroom.\n\nThe mainstream media coverage has been misleading, sadly at odds with the witness accounts, painting the incident as a little ol' argument that ended in a state employee popping a protester's balloon.  The Department of Administration says that their employee hurt his hand in a tumble on the stairs before the confrontation (why he'd go accost a protester rather than attend to the dripping blood, nobody can say.)\n\nFortunately, between Facebook and Twitter and blogs, we needn't rely the mainstream press for the whole story.  By the next day, the eyewitness accounts had made the rounds -- and the response at Wednesday's Solidarity Singalong at the Capitol was incredible.\n\nOur little family was there.\n\n\nWe didn't bring any balloons ourselves, but there were plenty to go around.  The Rotunda was alive with heart balloons, and clever signs (\"You've already broken my heart -- you didn't need to STAB it too!\"), and children running and playing.  The crowd was close to 200!\n\n\n\nInstead of ruffling the Capitol authorities with a big balloon-release, the organizers attached their balloon-clusters to large spools of ribbon, reeling them up to the dome for the singalong hour, and then back down afterwards.  Of course, with so many individual balloons handed out to folks like Rose & Joy, some were bound to escape.  We almost lost Joy's, but I caught it just in time and re-attached the string!\n\n\nJoy isn't entirely thrilled with these singalong events, but she tolerates them if we provide enough food and enough distraction.  The balloon was a great help, and has been fun at home too.  Meanwhile, the noon protests do provide a small way for me to contribute while still on childcare duty, and lift my spirits as well.\n\nOur struggle in Wisconsin isn't quite the apocalyptic vision from Nena's song, but the metaphor isn't unrelated.  Gov. Walker himself referred to his first budget-attack as \"dropping the bomb\" when he thought he was talking to billionnaire David Koch on the phone -- but was actually getting pranked by a blogger.  And this legislative session has surely left a swath of destruction and rubble in its wake.  (Examples abound at a clever new website called WTF has Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker done so far?) \n\nRecall elections in under two weeks.  On August 9 the recalled Republicans face their Democratic challengers, on the 16th the recalled Democrats try to hold their seats as well.  Polling shows most of the races close -- Republicans have no insurmountable leads -- we've got a real chance to flip the Senate here!\n\nBut meanwhile...  \n\n...Ninety-nine dreams I have had \nAnd every one a red balloon \nIt's all over, I'm standing pretty \nIn the dust that was a city \n\nI could find a souvenir \nJust to prove the world was here \nHere it is, a red balloon \nI think of you and let it go\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Luftballons", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uVtMRLXd4vI/Ti_2jKhxzYI/AAAAAAAAA4U/qNJqLkbKTZ8/s1600/Rose-2nd-birthday.jpg", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/05/05/973075/-WI-Solidarity-Singalong:-Aint-Gonna-Let-Nobody-Turn-Me-Round", "http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Capitol-Balloon/129221227155983", "http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/004634.asp", "http://www.facebook.com/notes/jenna-pope/since-when-have-heart-shaped-balloons-been-dangreous/10150263237632410", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqJrNVS7IT4", "http://www.bluecheddar.net/?p=11776", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y6sP1j6hxKI/TjFCXXFNi4I/AAAAAAAAA4c/WJTQRVI_G_M/s1600/2011-07-joyballoon1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dfg2kx3Mzag/TjFC-vSAh1I/AAAAAAAAA4k/w0_S1c9FX9E/s1600/2011-07-solidaritysingalong.jpg", "http://wtfwalker.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/07/ninety-nine-red-balloons.html", "title": "\nNinety-nine Red Balloons\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 23, 2011", "body": "\nWe're all swatting at the same mosquitoes\nEating burned-up burgers\nAt the picnic of the world.\n-- Tom Chapin, \"Picnic of the World,\" to the tune of the CanCan\nIt was an ambitious project.  I first heard about it at a PTO meeting last November -- Joy & Rose's school had won a grant to host a dance residency in January.  For three intense weeks, a university dance professor and one of her doctoral students would swoop into the physical education classes, teaching grade-appropriate dance curriculum while choreographing (with major student input) an hour-long all-school performance.\n\n\"Every child will participate,\" said the principal.\n\nI raised my eyebrows.  Even the non-verbal second-grader with CP who relies on staff to wheel her chair around?  Even Joy, who follows very few directives and has trouble with noises and large groups of people?\n\nCome January, though, Joy's staff was ready and willing.  PhyEd is one of Joy's best bets as far as being in class with her peers, and her gym teacher and special educator collaborated with me on how best to make the experience successful for Joy, and the initial dance-class sessions went reasonably well.  We hammered out a plan whereby Joy would participate in only the first of two evening performances, with her trusty special educator at her side the whole time.  We cancelled Joy's therapy for the evening of the performance, re-scheduled Rose's piano lesson, and went second-hand-store scrounging for the right color of shirt for each of them to wear.  Brown for Joy, yellow for Rose.\n\nThe first hint of trouble came from Rose.  She wasn't enthusiastic about the dance residency from the beginning, and ramped up the complaints as the performance neared.  It's too chaotic -- this isn't coming together -- we don't know what we're doing -- everyone is SCREAMING in the gym, it gives me a headache!\n\nUh-oh.\n\nThen on the day of the performance, the whole school had dress-rehearsal all afternoon, first class-by-class, then as an all-school group.  When I came to pick up the girls at the end fo the day, one mama (who had come to see the rehearsal) told me that Joy had danced and done just fine.  But then out came the special educator with a teary-eyed Joy, and gently told me -- the performance might not be such a good idea.  As long as Joy was sitting on her lap in the noisy chaotic rehearsal, it was at least manageable.  But when she and her group were \"on,\" Joy had been frustrated, tearful, lashing out.  Her special educator had had quite a dance herself, trying to guide Joy through the motions while anticipating and blocking all the other-directed acts-of-ow.  It wasn't fun for anyone, just an unfortunate spectacle.  (That last was my summing of the situation, not her words!)\n\nOne on level it felt like the first days of kindergarten all over again.  All that prepping, all those plans, lost in a whirl of tears and frustrated injurious outburst.\n\nOn the other hand, I've had some practice now in adjusting expectations on the fly.  Plus Joy's special educator was great.  She was willing to hold and sing to Joy through the whole performance if we wanted, or to care for her in another room while we watched Rose perform.  We decided, though, that Joy would be happier at home, and did a parental tag-team instead: JoyDad went to the first iteration of the show that evening, I went to the second.\n\nIt was entirely the right decision.\n\nThe gym was way overcrowded, and noisy, and hot.  This stood in contrast to the outdoor temperatures which were plunging toward zero and beyond!  By the second performance, the one I saw, even some of the NT kids were tired and teary.  SO not Joy's scene.\n\nThe show came together really well, though!  They were working on the school's motto, the theme of \"Growing Strong.\"  Then they divided it into four things you need to grow strong: sleep (kindergarten), shelter (first-graders), food (2nd/3rd graders), and clean air (4th/5th graders).  Then each division had a wide latitude for interpretation.  Joy's class, for example, had learned about Great Horned Owls -- sleep, night, owls... toldja it was widely interpretive! -- and moving with bodies held tightly and loosely.  Best moment: watching the kindergarteners pounce and consume their prey, and then mimic regurgitation!\n\nRose's class, on the theme of food, went with a Picnic of the World dance.  Their movement goals included African dance forms and cross-rhythms, which brought in the international component.  Then for the picnic/food component, they split into small groups, each of which designed its own dance moves incorporating a picnic blanket.\n\nRose's complaints about the dance residency vanished for the performance.  And I realized I didn't have much to complain about either.  Joy had gotten the benefit of the instructional part of the residency, really quite a neat experience in itself, and Rose got to perform (which she loves to do, even if she couldn't articulate one single thing she'd learned from the dance residency.)  Each child participated on her own terms, and at the end of the day, I guess that's really what it's all about.\n\nWe're all knowing at the deep-down heart of it,\nWe're all a part of it,\nThe picnic of the, picnic of the, picnic of the world!\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/01/every-child-will-participate.html", "title": "\nEvery Child Will Participate\n"},

Her SEA had not been back in the building a minute before I noticed that gaping new hole!\n\n\nI figured she had maybe swallowed the tooth, and was giving her staff enough of a run for their money that it had maybe gone unnoticed, seeing as how she wouldn't have made a fuss about it... but Tuesday morning we got a belated tooth-loss report as soon as we came in the school door, words-tumbling-over-one-another apologetic!  And then by the time I picked her up Tuesday afternoon, the missing tooth had been found as well, and was stowed in a little plastic treasure chest in her backpack.\n\n\nDoesn't that look like a first-grade smile, though?\n\nThe other wide-open space we've been dealing with lately is one that dates back to the beginning of the summer, when we starting having another bout of hair-pulling-out.  Over the course of a week or two, Joy managed to create a noticeable totally-bald patch along her nevus-removal scar, even after I gave her a short haircut to make the hair harder to grab.  This time I opted not to go the full buzz-cut route, planning to even things up through future haircuts. \n\nBut before we got as far as haircutting, another space-within-a-space opened up.  I think it might have started as a mosquito bite right on the scalp-scar, that Joy scratched open the way she generally does with mosquito bites.  Long after the summer bites on her legs healed, the one on her head was still open.  For a while she semeed to be scratching it for stimmy-delight, then it turned into a self-injury frustration lash-out thing.  (What, I can't get through that forbidden door?  Well, SCRATCH MY SCAR!)\n\n\nScratch after scratch, the start of the school year was approaching and the wound was getting bigger instead of smaller.  Complicating the matter was our long-standing experience that band-aids only draw further attention to any boo-boo, by encouraging picking.  So we knew that putting on a band-aid would just make things worse.\n\nExcept -- the other thing that we might have remembered is that Joy's mixer-board switches do tend to flip between settings, from time to time.  After a few days of school and a Labor Day weekend full of scab-scratches, I finally decided that trying a band-aid couldn't be any worse.\n\nShe left it on for a couple of days.  Long enough to begin a cycle of some healing... it's been three steps forward, two steps back since then, including a resumption of unwillingness to wear the band-aid, but we've been making progress. Perhaps by the time the hair grows back, the wide-open space will have closed again for good!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cAbEI0UuW1s/ToDAKEli3WI/AAAAAAAAA5c/K2LRElHucb4/s1600/2011-09-hole1.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3JLlBsSOFXw/ToDAXqf-ucI/AAAAAAAAA5s/uXaQTSvN3DI/s1600/2011-09-hole2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k2laXtIh4uw/ToC_6k1LbEI/AAAAAAAAA5U/FHiWivoJ8Kg/s1600/2011-09-puzzle.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/09/wide-open-spaces.html", "title": "\nWide Open Spaces\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 11, 2010", "body": "\nThese past few weeks have been a very interesting ride.Regular readers will recall that Joy began a trend of increasing \"acts of ow\" starting last summer.  Injury-attempts were directed both at herself and others, peers and adults -- and the number of incidents simply sky-rocketed with our rocky transition to kindergarten.  Most alarming were the bites to staff and to us -- nasty painful injuries (the bites to herself were unsettling too, but her self-bites were at least somewhat less extreme).  I've still got bite-marks dating back to September.  But we've been concerned to keep everyone safe, Joy and her peers and staff and sister and everyone all around.So we began to explore whether medication was a potential tool to get Joy to a better place.  Lots of kids with autism are on meds, even if it's maybe not talked about as much as other interventions!  As things go, we managed to move relatively quickly -- got a psych referral from Joy's primary care doctor toward the end of September, took Joy to the psychiatrist mid-October and wound up with a recommendation to try Abilify, considered and blogged my reflections on Abilify and e-mailed the psychiatrist with questions, had him get Joy's neurologist to sign off, got a pre-authorization for our insurance to cover the medication -- and started at a 1mg ramp-up dose, half the smallest pill, on the evening of November 8.  We were to go up to 2mg in 5 days; the clinical trials had gone up to 10mg and 15mg doses.  The decision to start Abilify was one that we actually ended up having to re-decide several times.  The thing was, after the psychiatrist appointment, the outwardly-directed \"ows\" had begun to fade away, and the self-directed \"ows\" had dropped too.  As the numbers declined, the question repeatedly arose: do we still need to do this? and the discussion continued.  JoyDad and I had different impulses in this could-go-either-way debate.  It's a tricky thing when parents disagree about treatment.  (See a recent excellent essay by Lynn on The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism blog.  JoyDad and I are fortunate to be on the same page much more often than not.)  In the end, we decided that since the injurious stuff was still happening, though at the lower level, we'd go ahead with what felt like the more pro-active approach.The very next day at school after she took that first half-pill, Joy had a noticeably rougher day.  And the next, and the next.  The self-directed \"ow\" numbers shot back up, she was unhappy, she was drowsy, she took unusual naps, she got constipated, she was hungry and more intense around food issues.  When things were still problematic several days later, we got permission to not bump up the dose.  When things were still problematic a few days after that, we began to ask, \"How long do we need to go to give this a fair trial?\"  The psychiatrist advised us to try switching the dose to the morning, which seemed to help with the tiredness but didn't change much of anything else.  Our follow-up psychiatrist appointment came around on December 2, at which point we sought and received dispensation to halt the Abilify.  We plan to make another stab at the drug-free approach (well, OK, she's still on powerful anti-epileptics), and so far Joy does seem to be in a better mood and the \"ow\" numbers have dropped somewhat.The weeks on Abilify were frustrating, but not really crisis-feeling.  The incident-data patterns were more spiky than consistent, with a couple of pretty darn good days among the rougher ones -- and our (data-free) Thanksgiving trip went better than expected.  Still, why push ahead with a drug when it's not clearly helping, seems to be making things worse, and is definitely side-effecting?The incident data after the quit-point hasn't been spectacular, but it's at least somewhat better.  Things feel noticeably better to us though. Last Saturday morning we had the best weekly grocery-shopping trip in recent memory.  The therapy-sessions since then have been unusually good.  The mood in general has been improved.  And the side-effects have faded.Though Abilify didn't do what we hoped it would, I'm glad we tried it.  If we had chosen otherwise, we'd still be in the position of making the to-start-or-not-to-start decision over and over again, every time things started getting rougher.I'd mentioned in the previous Abilify post that the hair-pulling self-injury was getting worse to the point that Joy's hair was getting thin again.  It's been a different situation than when we last encountered hair-pulling, a year and a half ago.  Last time was all about the stimmy; this time, it's overwhelmingly about the frustration.  I was beginning to worry that we might need to go the buzz-cut route once more, which would feel like an even bigger deal now that she's in school.  Before going that far, however, I pulled out the trusty shears on Sunday and inflicted a boyishly-short layered cut, the most ambitious I've ever tried.  I think that practice is making progress for my untutored beautician techniques:(updated) Photo credit: RoseAnd, guess who else is making progress.

I have done both -- feel free to either do the same, or choose one or the other.\n\nOption One:  DHS has a \"Virtual Town Hall Meeting\" online survey, where you can submit suggestions for how to save money for Medicaid in Wisconsin. (This one does require your name and ZIP, and asks for full contact info as well).\n\nOption Two:   Wisconsin's Council for Children with Long Term Care Needs is collecting Medicaid-related suggestions to convey to DHS, and also to post on the Family Voices of Wisconsin web site.  This one is child/youth focused, and does ask for an age-range of your child, and also asks your county but does not ask for personally-identifying information.\n\nHere's what I told them both:\n\nDue to Wisconsin's autism insurance requirement, passed in 2009, the state saved at least $30,000 in Medicaid expenses for my daughter in 2010.  In 2008 and 2009, she received intensive autism therapies via the Children's Long Term Support Medicaid waiver.  In 2010, our insurance paid in full for 8 months of intensive therapy that would otherwise have been borne by CLTS.\n\nUnfortunately, two bills that have been drafted but not yet introduced(LRB0373 and LRB1529) would neutralize not only the autism insurance requirement but all Wisconsin's other insurance mandates as well.  DHS should oppose this proposed legislation, as it would shift significant costs back to the state's Medical Assistance programs.\nI also included a few other suggestions from a document called Survival Coalition Ideas for the DHS Town Hall Meetings (.pdf).\n\nAnyone in Wisconsin can submit suggestions.  Bonus points if you have a Wisconsin autism-insurance story of your own, and an even bigger bonus if you send your autism-insurance story to me as well (ElvisSightings@gmail.com) or post it in the comments!  If you send it to me via e-mail, I'll be in touch about how you would or would not like me to share your story further.  \n\nOur stories are SO important!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://bit.ly/dInAXp", "http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WI-Medicaid", "http://www.dawninfo.org/co/sc/2011/SC%20Ideas%20for%20DHS%20Town%20Hall%20Mtg.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/04/autism-insurance-medicaid-savings-pass.html", "title": "\nAutism Insurance = Medicaid Savings: Pass it On!\n"},

{"date": "Monday, November 28, 2011", "body": "\nThe brief review sounded like a good bet for our 18th anniversary dinner-and-a-movie celebration -- plus it was at the cheap-theatre, which also sounded good after the spendy restaurant we had in mind!\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\nIn this funny, tense and fascinating film, a researcher (James Franco) raises a young chimpanzee uniquely affected by his experimental brain-repairing drug. Here's a movie where you can almost forget you're watching special effects, and simply fall into watching a great story.\nThe dinner was savory, leisurely, lovely.  The movie -- was beyond tense for me.  After the first half hour I was knotted up with such a strong emotional reaction that I nudged JoyDad and told him I wanted to leave.  He was all in favor.\n\nSo here's the deal with the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and be warned, this is spoiler-filled, at least about the first part of the film!\n\nThe film is a prequel to the famous Planet of the Apes, a post-apocalyptic fantasy in which apes have become ascendant and humans have become slaves.  Rise of the Planet of the Apes creates a contemporary groundwork for the apes' ascendancy.  The \"experimental brain-repairing drug\" alluded to in the review is to be a block-buster cure for Alzheimers, and potentially a whole raft of other conditions.  The researcher who raises the young chimp is also caring for his own father at home -- his father who has Alzheimers, and is simultaneously deeply impaired yet still physically strong, such that he'll need institutional care very soon (there's no evidence of the family receiving any services that would help him remain at home, by the way.)\n\nThe researcher treats his father illicitly with the super-drug, which works amazingly for a while.  The young chimp Caesar, meanwhile, is the offspring of a mother who received the super-drug in the lab, and the son ends up with beyond-human intelligence, in (of course) a powerful chimp body, able to communicate via sign-language.  The researcher and his father become dad & grandpa figures to Caesar, who eventually falls afoul of the law while attempting to defend his \"grandpa\" in an Alzheimers-related altercation with a neighbor.  It was at the point soon after, when Caesar is locked away for the good of society, that I felt the need to walk out.\n\nThe institutionalization of poor Caesar is a devastating betrayal by society, enabled by his researcher-father, though the researcher does try to go through channels and get it reversed.  It was just too much for me to watch Caesar, a more sympathetic character than the humans around him but with no place in human society due to his chimpanzee form, comprehend what was happening to him (and the \"institution\" was far worse than the researcher-father realized.)\n\nPerhaps you can see where my reaction might have come from.  Institutionalization for people with disabilities is not just part of our history -- we're living in a state here that has frozen enrollment for programs that help frail elders and people with disabilities live in their communities... except that if there's a crisis, they'll fund emergency institutional care.\n\nOn top of that, the film was raising issues of genetic meddling to \"cure\" disabling brain conditions -- there was one scene where the researcher was pitching his drug for approval for testing on humans, and in his presentation the word \"autism\" floated across the screen among the conditions that were going to be... fixed.  There have been other fictional explorations of this kind of thing: Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, and The Speed of Dark by Elizabeth Moon (an autism-specific tale).\n\nIssues, our society has issues.  If you want to see them explored in a tense action drama, you might want to see Rise of the Planet of the Apes -- it tells an effective story and the CGI-animation is pretty impressive.  But if you've got a personal stake in disability issues, don't be expecting to fall happily into to a funny story.  There's a whole lot more at stake than that.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/11/rise-of-planet-of-apes.html", "title": "\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2011", "body": "\nI started out as one of those moms who was going to take a stand against the whole princess-i-fication of little girlhood.  No Disney-princess videos or clothing or toys or other assorted stuff for my money, thanks!  We tried to hold off on the Barbie thing too.  But the culture is persistent.  There are ads and Happy Meal toys and sweet relatives who give Christmas gifts, and Rose's first Barbie that came when she broke her arm (by way of an emergency-room staffer)!  So the princesses have encroached, and I kinda learned to live & let live.\n\nAnd this year, the princesses saved my bacon for Halloween.\n\nFor some reason, Halloween costume ideas didn't flow freely this year.  We've had some really cool themed-costumes where we dressed the girls in a coordinated way, like last year's pirate wench (Rose) and hook (Joy).  Last year's Halloween post took a trip down costume memory lane, as I perused old photos with my college classmate whose daughter Elizabeth is our regular trick-or-treat companion.\n\nWe'd sort of settled on costumes whereby Rose would be a soccer player -- just wearing her soccer gear -- and Joy would sport a soccer ball on her sweatshirt.  But then Elizabeth's mom made an offer we couldn't refuse.  She just happened to have princess dresses from two of Elizabeth's previous Halloweens, a magnificent home-made Snow White dress and an elegant dress from a couple of years later.  Would these possibly fit our girls?\n\nOh yes, and perfectly.\n\n\nThe Snow White dress was comfy cotton, just the thing for a kiddo who gets distracted by too many furbelows.  Though at first glance Joy doesn't look just thrilled in the above pic, she's actually mugging for the camera here.  That grimace is her current \"cheese\" smile!  (I love it that my daughter should have figured out a  \"cheese\" smile!)\n\nOur trick-or-treat group was a large one, between the Joy-family, Elizabeth and her mom, J-Cat and his sister and parents, and two of this year's LEND trainees who are doing a family-mentoring experience with us to get a glimpse into what it means for our family that Joy is who she is.  The noisy crowd didn't seem to bother Joy, though.  She was remarkably chipper and cooperative as we traipsed up one side of the dark street and down the other, making a fine effort to convey candy from the proffered baskets into her plastic pumpkin, and ringing the doorbell with minimal prompting when it was her turn.  Of course it took a parent keeping a solid hold on her hand and guiding her with the group every step, but she didn't protest a bit.\n\nIn fact, she didn't even protest when the clock struck midnight, and the prince pursued her down the flight of marble stairs leading from the palace, and her glass slipper fell from her delicate foot...\n\nYou may think I've got the wrong fairy tale here, but bear with me.\n\nAs JoyDad shepherded our princess toward the second-to-last house we were going to take her to, he suddenly looked down and noticed that Joy was missing a shoe.  It was hard to catch in the darkness, because she was wearing dark pants under her dress, and dark socks, and the little velcro tennies were a dark brown.  But somewhere along the line she had stepped out of a shoe, and trotted on entirely uncomplainingly!\n\nYou can perhaps imagine how it looked then, as our large party suddenly began to retrace the route.  It was only up and down one block, but we didn't know how long the shoe had been gone, we didn't have flashlights (duh), and there were nice brown autumn leaves all over the place.  We ended up back at home with a single-shoe princess, and even two more search party forays with flashlight did not find the elusive footwear.\n\nWell, Joy ended up playing back indoors, cheerful as could be, while I chatted a while further with the LEND trainees.  Rose and company went on trick-or-treating -- she eventually brought home a HUGE stash of candy, apparently having told at each house the sad story of how her sister-princess had lost a shoe and had to stop trick-or-treating and so could I please have extra candy for my sister?\n\nThen after the trainees had gone, and the house was still, the doorbell rang once more.  It was the prince!  And the royal grandma!  Well, OK, it was one neighbor each from the two houses in between which we had discovered that the slipper had been cast.  The two of them had gone out in search of that elusive little shoe, and had found it for us!\n\nAnd it fit perfectly, and we all lived happily ever after.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VvO1hHmuNpw/Tq_U7XhKa4I/AAAAAAAAA6E/axXiWSmZ9-g/s1600/2011-10-Halloween1.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/11/princess-adventures.html", "title": "\nPrincess Adventures\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, January 28, 2012", "body": "\nMy favorite post from my first year of blogging (all the way back in 2008!) was called Spin, Spin, Spin.  It referenced an occasion when I'd gone as a chaperone with Rose's class on a field trip to see the Peking Acrobats, and one particular part of the act where a troupe of women danced while spinning multiple plates on sticks.  I mused that the spinning-plates act had a great deal in common with my life!  \n\nActually the controlled chaos of the field trip itself was something of a spinning plates act.  Busloads of kindergarteners and first-graders from all over the district descended on Madison's Overture Center, vying for downtown space to disgorge their noisy wriggling kid-loads, who then all had to be organized and seated for the show.  There was enough noise and waiting that I recall it was at least mildly anxiety-producing for Rose at the time, at least until the show started.\n\nIt wouldn't have been Joy's scene AT ALL.\n\nIn fact, four years later, it still isn't.  Joy doesn't like chaos, or noise, or waiting.  (Heck, who does?)  She doesn't cotton much to sitting still, either.  Sitting through a long performance in an unfamiliar venue after the chaos, noise and waiting would be a recipe for deep unhappiness, for Joy and for those around her.\n\nWhen the note came home that Joy's class will have their turn to see the Peking Acrobats this year, I thought hard about how to do it.  Of course we could demand that her staff figure out how to make the trip work for her, but at what cost -- and what are we trying to teach?  Surely one day we'll be able to manage large public performances: maybe with accommodations, maybe without.  But that's a goal to work on in increments, not by jumping into a situation where she'd be locked in to staying on site the full time because of bus transportation, in a noisy sea of hundreds of kids in a huge strange theatre.  This is not, we decided, a field trip we want to inflict on Joy at this time.\n\nWe got a video instead.\n\nLibrarian that I am, I first went looking for a DVD to borrow.  It turned out, though, that the only video out was too recent to be in libraries, a just-released DVD from the Peking Acrobats 2011 tour.  So we bought a copy of our own.\n\nTurns out there wasn't an online-ordering option, so I had to make a call and talk to a person.  The call brought up some interesting echoes of some of the readings we'd done for the Partners in Policymaking program that I'm participating in, that started last weekend.  (My next post will have more description about the program, I promise... it's off to an amazing start so far.)\n\nTwo of the readings, both by Kathie Snow of DisabilityIsNatural.com, talked about how parents and professionals tend to un-necessarily blab details about their kids'/clients' disabilities in situations and ways that we wouldn't dream of talking about people without disabilities.  Here's a sample from The Problem with \"Problem\" (.pdf):\n\nWe don't usually share intimate details of our own lives with casual acquaintances, but we routinely expose the lives of people with disabilities for public consumption.  Parents, accustomed to reviewing a child's history with every professional they come in contact with, frequently get in the hapbit of blabbing very intimate details about their children to other parents, educators, and even strangers in the grocery store! ... In general, we reveal intimate details about people with disabilities even though they have never given us their permission to do so.  How dare we behave in such an arrogant and patronizing manner?\nEven after this, and an additional piece called The Lost Art of Manners (.pdf), I still (gratuitously) told the guy on the phone when ordering the video -- why I was doing it.  That I had a daughter with developmental disabilities whose class was going on a field trip to the Peking Acrobats show, the live show wasn't going to work for my girl, so the video was a substitute experience.  It was a snap decision, quickly balancing the readings vs. a vague impulse in favor of awareness-raising.\n\nOn the one hand, I so totally didn't need to do that.  If I'd had a chance to order online, I'd have typed in a bunch of keystrokes and the order would have arrived all depersonalized, no story attached at all.\n\nOn the other hand, the fellow who took the order seemed grateful to know that we valued the show enough to make an extra effort.  He ended up sending us a free DVD of Jigu! Drums of China, another act represented by the same production company.\n\nI feel pretty good at this point about the decisions we've made regarding this upcoming field trip.  Others might disagree, be appalled, whatever.\n\nActually, the whole disability-mommy-blogging enterprise leaves lots of room for disagreement, appalled, whatever.  Or mommy-blogging in general, as we spin intimate life-details into the blogosphere for the consumption of anyone who happens to wander by.  In fact, as far as social media is concerned, things have changed since 2001 when Kathie wrote \"We don't usually share intimate details of our own lives with casual acquaintances.\"  Facebook and blogging and YouTube et al. have altered that equation immensely, disability or no.\n\nIt's a balance.  I'll have to continue to cogitate, both about this blog and about my in-person conversations.  As Joy continues to grow up, as I learn more and my thinking evolves, the balance will likely change.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking of changing the balance -- I notice as I read how I described my life in the Spin, Spin, Spin post -- there was nothing about policy advocacy in there.  No spinning plate designated for legislative contacts or Board work (or protesting, for that matter).  How things can indeed change over the course of a couple of years!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.disabilityisnatural.com/", "http://www.disabilityisnatural.com/~k061480m/images/PDF/problem.pdf", "http://www.disabilityisnatural.com/~k061480m/images/PDF/manners.pdf"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/01/peking-acrobats-redux.html", "title": "\nThe Peking Acrobats, Redux\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 22, 2011", "body": "\nJoyDad and I had a remarkable time at Monday's Solidarity Singalong!  Hundreds of protesters filled the Capitol rotunda on the ground floor and balconies, singing recall-themed versions of Christmas tunes, in cheerful defiance of our governor's latest attempt to quash dissent.  A resounding win for free-speech!\n\n Photo credit madtowntj of Daily Kos\n\nThe re-purposed tunes of the Solidarity Singalong are at least somewhat analogous to a little ditty to the tune \"The Farmer in the Dell\" that we've\nbeen experiencing a lot lately:\n\nThe A says \"aaa\", the A says \"aaa\"\nEvery letter makes a sound,\nThe A says \"aaa!\"\nThe song is from a series of products by a company called Leapfrog.  (Link goes to a YouTube video -- I'd've embedded it, but it looks like they've disabled that option for this one.)\n\nThe \"A says 'aaa'\" phonics-washing of Joy began around the time of her birthday at the start of the summer, when she got a Leapfrog Fridge-Phonics toy from Auntie S as a present.  The toy has a magnetic back, so you can stick it on the fridge -- or in our case, the fireplace.\n\n\nYou choose a letter to put in the slot, and then the toy sings the song for that letter.  Or, push the little orange notes above the letter and it sings the familiar ABC song.\n\nSome months after we got the toy, we discovered that the Leapfrog Talking Letter Factory DVD, which we'd gotten for Rose when she was just beginning her love affair with letters and words, had become acceptable to Joy as well.  The cartoon story on the DVD involves a tour of a factory that makes letters, and sings through their \"every letter makes a sound\" songs one by one, with funny little additional mnemonics (for example, the E cups its hand to one ear and says \"eh?\" as if it couldn't hear you!)  Joy particularly loves the opening menu-sequence, something she apparently shares with quite a few kids on the spectrum.\n\n\nThen still more recently, just at Thanksgiving, we pulled out yet another saved Leapfrog artifact from Rose's toddlerhood -- her \"My First LeapPad.\"  Kids interact with this clever toy by touching a series of printed pictures with an attached electronic pen.  You can buy a variety of spiral-bound books, each coming with its own game-cartridge.  To tell the toy what page you're on in any given book, you have to touch the green \"GO\" circle on that page with the pen in order to get the correct noises that go with that page.  It's definitely a couple of steps beyond the baby-toys that have been the staple of Joy's repertoire.\n\nAnd guess what?  We already had the \"I Know My ABCs\" book and cartridge, built around the \"A says aaa!\" song!\n\n\nI was amazed how fast Joy figured out the sequence of turning on the toy, turning the pages of the book, and tapping the \"GO\" cicle.  The latter is a particular accomplishment because the \"GO\" circle is at a different location on the perimeter of each page, in order for the toy to differentiate which page's fun to serve up.  I love to watch Joy scan all the way around the edge to find the \"GO\"!\n\n\nAfter all this musical phonics-washing, Joy now can fill in the blanks when we sing her a letter:\n\nJoyMama: \"The B says...\"\nJoy:  \"buh!\"\n\nAnd look what else she's been doing lately, another Rose hand-me-down:\n\n\n\nOne more Songs of the Season post yet to come... stay tuned!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.progressive.org/wis_aclu_and_protesters_assail_walker_new_rules_on_speech.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UNS-OTGo5Hs/TvMb_yj3lXI/AAAAAAAAA78/koffF7o2zz8/s1600/AnnieJo.jpg", "http://www.dailykos.com/user/madtowntj", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsPbIjENEWs", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-euZUdaigwls/TvMdZhpdyCI/AAAAAAAAA8I/9otDdnUAjKA/s1600/2011-112-fridgephonics.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Q0OcTcidC0/TvMejR_JzRI/AAAAAAAAA8U/fsUPafh6TgA/s1600/TalkingLetterDVD.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KzaePbRa3g0/TvMfqjVcaYI/AAAAAAAAA8g/QhHWa4frcs4/s1600/TalkingLetterABC.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2YSEvon-KeQ/TvMgLM7NQnI/AAAAAAAAA8s/UGh8-o3RjXw/s1600/2011-12-Leappad1.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jPbPqXwmtm4/TvMgjeY3m7I/AAAAAAAAA84/wUAY80Uj6HU/s1600/2011-12-Alphapuzzle1.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-G4xhxCvfybc/TvMgnwfLaxI/AAAAAAAAA9E/2NEUK0mZBhQ/s1600/2011-12-Alphapuzzle2.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/12/songs-of-season-part-2.html", "title": "\nSongs of the Season, Part 2\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 31, 2011", "body": "\nDuring the holiday-preparation whirlwind earlier this month, I also had the chance to help out a couple of students doing end-of-semester projects relating to special needs.  My niece interviewed me by e-mail with a series of questions about Joy's diagnosis and development and how our family manages.  Between my answers and this blog, she wrote up a paper that earned her a 100% grade, highly satisfactory!\n\nThe other interview was by phone with one of the LEND trainees we mentored this fall, who had an occupational-therapy survey for me about OT goals and progress.  There was one flavor of question that came up again and again, that I struggled with answering.  The question had to do with satisfaction, on a scale of 1 to 10... how satisfied are you with the goal?  How satisfied are you with your child's progress?\n\nIt's not easy to assign a meaningful number to a question about satisfaction!  Thinking about it later, I realized that for every one of the progress-questions, I could have truthfully answered almost anything between 1 and 10 each time.\n\nOf course I'm not satisfied!  How can I be satisfied, when Joy is so clearly behind her peers in comparison, and likely always will be?  We can't let ourselves be satisfied.  We're always going to have to keep striving, pushing for the next step, giving it our all to achieve... first the possible, and then the impossible!\n\nOf course I'm satisfied!  Look how far this girl has come, look what wonderful progress she's made this past year!  She's working with good people who are responsive to her needs and to our participation, and the forward movement is obvious.  We've had extra affirmation of that in the visit we've got going on from GrandpaJ and GrandmaJoy right now, and what they observe in Joy just since their last visit in September!\n\nOf course there must be a balance.\n\nSatisfied can't mean \"OK, we're done, no need to work any more.\"  In our goals for Joy, our goals for ourselves, our goals for our state and country, quitting is not an option.  We can't be stagnant-satisfied.\n\nOn the other hand, there is in our culture an almost pathological urge against satisfaction, against having enough and counting our blessings.  We are bombarded with messages urging us to consume, to buy, to live better by acquiring more.  The country is only now waking up to the pathology of the insatiability at the tippy-top of the income ladder, the barons whose individual wealth is greater than the GDP of entire countries, who are in the process of buying United States' political system.  How many billions are enough, and at what cost to how many of the little people down at the bottom of the heap?\n\nHow can we learn to balance a truly grateful satisfaction with an appropriate moving-forward?\n\nI'm reminded of the Jewish Passover song Dayenu, which tells of God's great gifts to the children of Israel: bringing the people out of slavery in Egypt, the miracles of being led and fed in the desert, the gifts of the Sabbath and the Torah.  As each gift is listed, the chorus affirms \"Dayenu\" which translates as \"it would have been enough for us\" -- or, as in the version I first heard, \"it would have satisfied us.\"\n\nAnd yet, the scriptures tell us one story after another of the exodus in which the people were not satisfied and complained to Moses, complained to God.  It would have been better if we had stayed in Egypt as slaves rather than come out here into the desert -- at least there we had enough to eat!\n\nSatisfaction is a choice, an attitude, a commitment, whether we remind ourselves in song or otherwise.\n\nI blogged about it only in passing, but last year instead of traditional New Year's resolutions, I chose three words to shape the year: active, tidy, relax.  They rather morphed into \"active, organize, relax\" as events in Wisconsin exploded in February, and I never did manage the \"relax\" one very well.  But active and organize took on new dimensions!\n\nThis year, I'm looking at these three:\nbalance\nforward\nkindness\n\nBalance in the right kind of satisfaction; balance in schedule; balance in mindset.\n\nForward for Wisconsin; forward in goals for myself and goals for Joy; forward rather than stagnation.\n\nKindness in everything -- to myself, to those who disagree with me, to everyone I encounter.\n\nWhat three words would make a satisfying 2012 for you?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/255530/jewish/Dayenu.htm", "http://niv.scripturetext.com/exodus/16.htm"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/12/satisfaction.html", "title": "\nSatisfaction\n"},

In anticipation of the holiday in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., they talked about King's famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, and then they were assigned to come up with a dream of their own to share with the class.\n\nRose's dream was that her sister Joy would get a good education and go to \ncollege.\n\nIt shouldn't take a prophetic voice to articulate what I grew up with as a basic expectation in my own family.  But sometimes it does.\n\nWe've been cautious about educational expectations for Joy, as you may well have picked up if you read my reflections on the ABLE Act.  It's hard to see college when your first-grader still doesn't meet most of the standard criteria on the kindergarten-readiness lists.\n\nAnd yet, it's all too easy to fall into the \"soft bigotry of low expectations.\"  (That phrase has entered into the conversation so completely, I was surprised when I looked it up to see where it had come from.  I see it as rather an ironic source to use on this day of all days, but there's an important truth carried in the words.) \n\nHere's how Kathie Snow, who writes at DisabilityIsNatural.com, put it in her essay \"The 'Right' to a Normal Life\" (emphasis is mine):\nIs a child with a disability given an allowance? Expected to help around the house?  Taught how to use the phone? ... Is the child expected to participate in and experience the traditional, ordinary, typical activities of her brothers, sisters, and similarly-aged children?  Is she expected to achieve an academic education which will enable her to attend college, vocational school, and/or be employed in a real job?  Do we expect the child to leave home one day, live on her own, get married, and live a REAL LIFE as an adult?  When we don't encourage and provide typical experiences (and have high expectations), we're robbing the child of the \"right\" -- the opportunity -- to lead a normal life.I had just read Snow's piece as preparation for a program I'll be participating in over the next six months, Wisconsin's Partners in Policymaking, a training for self-advocates and family members who want to learn to influence public policy around issues of developmental disability.  In fact, I'd read it the very morning of the day that Rose told me of the dream she'd shared.\n\nNo coincidences!\n\nI know I'll be paying a lot more attention to our expectations for Joy in the coming months.  In a couple of long-overdue baby steps, we've begun serving her meals on the same ceramic plates as the rest of the family, instead of the plastic pocket-plates she's used up to now, and transitioned her to Rose's beloved \"Cooshie Booster\" instead of the buckle-in booster that's been the default (she's way past big enough not to have to buckle in at mealtimes!)\n\nThere will be other changes too -- small steps can go big places.\n\nIf we're going to live in a nation where Joy will be judged, not on the elements of her disability, but as a capable human being who will spend her lifetime learning and growing and achieving, we need to lead with high expectations ourselves.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=278522", "http://www.disabilityisnatural.com/", "http://www.disabilityisnatural.com/~k061480m/images/PDF/normlife.pdf", "http://www.partnersinpolicymaking.com/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/01/she-has-dream.html", "title": "\nShe Has a Dream\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 2, 2011", "body": "\nI guess if one's child is going to be driven by an unspoken imperative to \"Go jump in a lake!\" it's good to have a beautiful lake to jump into.\n\nThe JoyFamily returned on Monday from another long-weekend jaunt to the family cabins in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  I'm pleased to report that our trip home was nicely uneventful, in contrast to our Memorial Day mudbath.  The vacation itself was free of marauding ruffed grouse, and nary an exploding shower pipe was to be found.\n\nThe big novelty of the trip was the company of AuntieS, who hadn't been up to the lake in 3 decades.  It was such a treat to have her there, I didn't even mind \"letting\" her win a round of dice the last night we were there...  Besides, she took pictures!  (Photos below are courtesy of AuntieS).\n\nFor Joy, the top-priority draw this visit was the lake itself.  We hadn't been in the cabin five minutes, just beginning to unload and unpack, when we suddenly heard the lake-side screen door slam and Joy was hurtling down the steep embankment toward the pier.  How she kept on her feet the whole way down, I'll never know -- I'm not even sure how I managed to stay upright in pursuit.  I caught up with her at the last second, just as she paused at the far end of the pier before launching herself into the drink.\n\nIn past years, we've been able to sit on the pier and play little games, or swing on the rickety metal swingset between the cabins, or hang out happily for hours on the screen-porch overlooking the lake.  Not this time around.  Some switch on Joy's mixer-board had assumed a new setting -- the \"Go jump in a lake\" setting.  Being in sight of the lake without actually jumping in?  Not to be considered.\n\nFortunately, the weather cooperated for lake-splashings every afternoon we were there.  Summer is waning up north, but by afternoon the sun had always warmed up the air and the lake enough for a swim.\n\n\nThe first afternoon, we splashed both off the pier and with the rest of the family off the side of the pontoon boat.\n\n\nThe next day we learned to float tummy-down on a little inflatable life-ring toy.\n\n\nThe third day, Joy discovered the delight of driving her hands down into the muddy sand of the lakebed.  That was so much fun, she was even willing to dunk her head under when we went into slightly deeper water, for the joy of that sloppy lakebed.\n\nWe had other fine moments as well: unusual success at going for walks down the woodland roads, and playing with ferns WITHOUT consuming them, and an unusually calm ride home.\n\nGorgeous weather aside, this was not really an ideal weekend to upset the Joy-routine with a trip to the lake.  We've had fruit-basket-upset with our therapy staffing and schedule and location through the course of August, with changes still happening.  Then our summer childcare arrangement came to an end mid-August, leaving us patching together the last two weeks.  And then the crowning routine-buster -- the start of first grade, with shortened days both Thursday and Friday, and a new teacher and case manager.  \n\nSince I didn't get this written before Day 1 of school actually happened, I'll let you in on the first day's outcome -- Joy's two main special education assistants are with her again this year.  The first day of first grade was not at all like the traumatic first day of kindergarten.  Not without some stress of course, but overall a big relief to everyone involved.  Onward to Day 2!\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ozqafCTSvqk/TmC_araNidI/AAAAAAAAA48/XRSDsZLZuEk/s1600/2011-08-Joylake.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7RzOfmieUw0/TmC_pD1V6RI/AAAAAAAAA5E/krf9nDlLNhs/s1600/2011-08-RoseLake.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g-gVnIpmq-0/TmC_3iKYgvI/AAAAAAAAA5M/3TFaB-85Eb0/s1600/2011-08-Joylake2.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/09/go-jump-in-lake.html", "title": "\nGo Jump in a Lake!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "body": "\nTime is flying again.  Today's the day I get another chance to be social with my new Partners in Policymaking friends in the capital city (in the shadow of the Capitol), where last month we learned about a simply capital concept -- applying the idea of social capital to our thinking about disabilities.\n\nBut first, I still haven't gone into detail about what Wisconsin Partners in Policymaking is.  This is Wisconsin's first go at a program that's been around in other states for over 20 years: a leadership training for self-advocates and family members regarding public policy in developmental disabilities.  There's a select group of thirty of us from across the state, with 10 self-advocates and 20 family members (mostly parents but a few sibs as well), meeting one weekend per month across six months.  We're sponsored by the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities and several other organizations besides.\n\nIt's a power-packed group of folks, many of whom have already held various leadership positions and done great advocacy work on their own behalf and on behalf of their loved ones.  The point now is to take it to the next level, and start to build a statewide grassroots advocacy network.\n\nAs with the LEND program I did two years ago, there's way too much to be able to share it all.  I'm going to have to pick and choose what to pass along.  From the January meeting, I've already referred to a couple of the readings in my last post.\n\nSo I'll just highlight the \"social capital\" presentation, because I think it's important.\n\nSocial capital has to do with the give-and-take, the mutual relationships between people that make society what it is.  As a research concept, there are a couple of competing definitions.  The World Bank definition, not surprisingly, refers to economic prosperity.  Robert Putnam, of Bowling Alone fame, defined social capital as \"features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.\"\n\nThe point of the Partners presentation -- people with disabilities also have social capital, need social capital, can build social capital.  Mutual relationships.  People with disabilities aren't just the recipients; social capital is a back-and-forth thing.\n\nI like this a whole lot better as a concept than the natural supports construct I wrote about from LEND a couple of years ago.\n\nNot that \"natural supports\" isn't on to something important: it points out that all-too-often we focus way too much on the paid personnel who support and accompany people with disabilities, to the exclusion of the more natural web of support that a community provides.  Extended family, classmates, neighbors, fellow church-members, there's a whole world of people out there who can provide support in a more natural, normal, it-takes-a-village-to-live-a-good-life kind of way.\n\nThe one thing that the concept of natural supports lacks (well, besides an immediately-understandable name) is the element of mutuality.  The nomenclature tends to focus the attention on the caregivers/supporters rather than acknowledging that people with disabilities are participants in the relationships, just like people without disabilities.\n\nSo, social capital.  Give-and-take relationships, a network to cultivate, a concept that applies to everybody, not just people with disabilities.\n\nIt strikes me that social capital also applies to some extent in paid relationships. I was on to that back in 2008, when I blogged about how I wanted our house to be a favorite place for the in-home therapists to come!  Little gifts of produce from the garden, being organized and courteous and available, making sure the house wasn't too disgustingly grungy.  Building social capital -- and we end up with employees who interact with us on a friendship level as well as professional, and remain in contact after the professional relationship ends.\n\nFor Joy, she doesn't know she's doing it, but she's been building social capital with smiles, with bye-bye waves, with hugs and requests for attention and just being willing to share her space.  Someday I hope she'll do it via conversation -- maybe even blogging?  \n\nA few caveats: Autism has its own special layer of challenge when it comes to social capital -- the whole \"social deficit\" part of the equation, in all its many challenging aspects.  I also have some hesitancy about the way \"social capital\" may tend to define as \"poor\" those who prefer a less-socially-interactive existence just in general.\n\nStill, I think as a concept \"social capital\" does a whole lot better than \"natural supports\" in contributing to what it means to envision people with disabilities living lives of inclusion in mutually-supportive communities.\n\nBack to blogging as social capital -- it occurs to me that a year ago I was doing much better at the give-and-take of social-capital building, the commenting back and forth on other blogs that led to such awesome blog-conversations here.  So out of the social-capital loop am I at the moment, in fact, that I've failed to acknowledge receiving an award way back on my New Year's Satisfaction post, where Briane P over at Thinking the Lions bestowed upon me the Smart Cookie award:\n\nFortunately in this case I've left myself an out by my previous declaration way back in 2008 that I don't really \"do\" awards.  Unless I feel like it.  With this one I'm supposed to thank the giver (Thanks, Briane!), link back to him in my post (here ya go), list four little-known facts (oh well), and link to other Smart Cookies (I guess that would build social capital, eh?  Oh well, again.)  \n\nAnyway, back to the Capitol environs for me, for another heapin' helping of Partners in Policymaking.

The school practices \"clustering,\" whereby the kids with IEPs all get assigned into just one or two classrooms per grade, so that the special-ed staff can focus there and collaborate with just one or two regular-ed teachers. (A similar thing happens with students for whom English is a second language).\n\nWhat ends up happening is that the ratio of disability to non-disability in the cluster-classes gets pretty far out of whack in comparison to the real world.

{"date": "Sunday, May 6, 2012", "body": "\nWhen I first heard what Apple had named their new tablet-technology, back when it came out a couple of years ago, I chortled along with the wags who made Kotex jokes. \u00a0What company in their right mind would give their product a name that sounded as if it belonged in the \"that-time-of-the-month\" aisle?\n\nOK, fine, nobody's laughing anymore, and that includes me (except at myself for my skepticism). \u00a0Two years later I'm happy to admit: the iPad is an amazing piece of technology, and Joy is reaping the benefits in a big way.\n\nAs long-time readers of this blog know, we've been making fits-and-starts at picture-communication with Joy for quite a while. \u00a0We have lots of little laminated photos and icons that we velcro-ed on to various pages or sequences for Joy to grab and hand to us to indicate choice-making or to tell us something. \u00a0We used the same velcroed items or laminted sheets of icons in a GoTalk4\u00a0where we could record a message or word and Joy could push the right picture to make the device \"say\" that thing. \u00a0We even spent a couple of months of regular appointments at the Communication Aids and Systems Clinic (CASC) at the Waisman Center in Madison to see if Joy would take to a more sophisticated programmable talk-by-icon-choice computer device with a touch-screen from the Prentke Romich Company (PRC) -- I believe it was a SpringBoard Lite. \u00a0Every one of the approaches showed some promise, but had drawbacks. \u00a0The laminated photos and icons, for example, were highly desirable in and of themselves as \"stimmy\" objects, which interfered with what their communication-meaning was supposed to be. \u00a0The GoTalk wasn't particularly flexible compared to computer-based products, and also became an object of desire in and of itself -- she wanted to use it as a noisy-toy. \u00a0The PRC device, she wasn't showing nearly enough interest and progress to be able to justify Medicaid card-service funding (two-and-a-half thou'worth). \u00a0So we sort of went into a holding pattern for a while with the GoTalk and velcro-icons, at least at home, and things stayed that way for a while.\n\nFast-forward two years, and much has changed. \u00a0We've had some developmental surging, along with a new funding stream via the Children's Long-Term Support MA waiver that allowed us to purchase an iPad and apps for Joy with a significantly less stringent burden-of-proof and paperwork (and at lower cost than the SpringBoard Lite as well).\n\nAnd oh, how she has taken to it! \u00a0The iPad touch-screen is somehow just the right thing at just the right time.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur basic setup is an iPad2 (16GB with WiFi), with an AMDI iAdapter2 protective speaker box (which I'll have to review in a separate post). \u00a0The most important app is ProLoQuo2Go ($189.99), a communication program in which the user taps labelled icons to get a synthesized voice to \"say\" the word or phrase. \u00a0You can set the icons/words up in the categories you want, and control how many appear on the screen (hence their size as well), and take or import your own photos or select from a sizeable collection of pre-programmed icons.\n\nWhat a technological leap forward! \u00a0For a brief comparison, in order to put a photo on the GoTalk, I had to:\n\ntake the photo\nimport the photo from camera to computer\nre-size the photo\nprint the photo (at some cost in printer supplies)\ncut the photo to size physically\nlaminate the photo (more supplies)\ntrim again\nadd velcro (still more supplies)\nrecord the right word in my voice, or get Rose to do it, on the GoTalk\n\n\nTo make an icon in ProLoQuo on the iPad, the only supplies I need are: the iPad.\n\n\nI tell ProLoQuo to make a new icon (easy tap-and-type process)\nI type in a label for it to say\nI indicate whether I want to use an icon from the collection, or use a photo (existing or take a new one)\nIf I choose to take a new one, the iPad camera launches and I can snap the shot, and re-size it right there.\n\n\nAnd voila, new photo icon created.\n\n\n\n\nSo now when Joy wants to watch a video, she can tell me which one by tapping a photo of the video cover. She is making real choices from a field of 25 icons/images, and has mastered the tiny 1/4-inch \"Back\" control icon that navigates between levels among the folders.\n\n\n\nMy beefs with ProLoQuo2Go are minor so far. \u00a0I miss the ability to record my own voice, or Rose's, and I don't always like the inflection of the synthesizer, particularly in phrases or sentences. \u00a0(At least one can override any given word's pronunciation with a new phonetic concoction of one's own -- I had to do that with the Baby Mozart video\u00a0icon, for example, for which the default pronunciation sounded like \"Baby Moe-ZHAR.\")\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge for Joy so far in using ProLoQuo has been less about understanding and navigating, and more about us keeping up with her. \u00a0At home we only have a few useful categories for making choices (songs, videos, LeapPad cartridges). \u00a0There are other categories for school -- occupational thereapy, classroom choices, lunch/sharing-time. \u00a0We need to give her more.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, though, there's no doubt that she gets it. \u00a0One day not long ago, I was puttering in the kitchen while Joy played in the living room right around snack time. \u00a0Suddenly she came running, jumping up and down expectantly. \u00a0I led her back to the living room to grab the iPad so she could tell me. \u00a0And there lay the iPad on the couch, open to the \"snack\" category within ProLoQuo.\n\n\n\nShe had told me.\n\n\n\nI just hadn't been close enough to hear.\n\n-----\n\nI'll have a lot more to say about the iPad and the various apps we've been using so far, because I know this is information that's important to share! \u00a0For now, I'll link to a couple of useful lists of iPad apps that are excellent starting points:\n\niPad Apps for Communication, Learning, & Fun\u00a0(pdf) -- by Amy Nelson, Kristi Otto and Connie Biksacky, presented at an Autism Society of Greater Madison April mini-conference\n\niPad Apps & Resources for People with Autism: Reviews, Links, Prices (Google spreadsheet) -- by Shannon des Roches Rosa, Corina Becker, and Jordan Sadler -- a parent, an adult with autism, and an SLP -- updated frequently\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://store.prentrom.com/product_info.php/cPath/11/products_id/8", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C-Ec99gyQW8/T6ZuJ9rGzmI/AAAAAAAABAY/ROZ-LDlKNcM/s1600/2012-05-iPad1.jpg", "http://amdi.net/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=111", "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/proloquo2go/id308368164?mt=8", "http://autismmadison.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ipad-apps-for-communication-learning-and-fun.pdf", "https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AjbIta8OTS0KdHRMVWx0Q3pvOWRXRXBfd01jc3lqakE&hl=en&single=true&gid=0&output=html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/05/joys-ipad-ipads-joys.html", "title": "\nJoy's iPad, iPad's Joys\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, June 2, 2012", "body": "\nI haven't written much about Wisconsin politics here lately. \u00a0For one thing, the legislative session is over for the year, so there haven't been any new laws in the pipeline to promote or resist.\n\nBut next week is a big one here in Wisconsin. \u00a0On Tuesday June 5, voters will head to the polling places to determine whether Scott Walker gets to finish his term as governor, or whether Tom Barrett will step in to finish the term and try to begin to repair some of the damage that the Walker administration has wreaked on this state since January 2011.\n\nFaithful readers may remember my spree of outraged, astonished posts in February 2011, as Governor Walker \"dropped the bomb\" (his own words) on Wisconsin -- blindsiding the state with an unnecessary \"budget repair bill\" carrying immense, devastating policy consequences for Wisconsin Medicaid, collective bargaining, and more. \u00a0If the protests hadn't happened, and 14 state senators hadn't chosen to work from Illinois for a couple of weeks, that bill would have become law within a single week's time, with most of the public not even knowing what was in it, let alone having the chance to weigh in. \u00a0Inaccessibility, autocracy, secrecy\u00a0and flat-out lies have continued to be hallmarks of the Walker administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, by contrast, is Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett as he started his campaign a month ago -- reaching out to the \"Stand With Walker\" counter-protesters who showed up at one of his events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication and listening and reaching out to ALL the people is so basic, and it's been so badly missing this past year and a half in Wisconsin. \u00a0But what's at stake goes well beyond that.\n\n\n\nWalker's Wisconsin represents a future that the wealthiest of the far-right have been coordinating and working toward in America for decades now. \u00a0I didn't understand it until the events of last February opened my eyes. \u00a0But it is real, it is dire, and it has been in process of happening for years now in this country. \u00a0The end-game is plutocracy -- government by the wealthy, for the wealthy.\n\n\n\nThat's what the ginned-up anger about taxes is about -- so the wealthiest and their corporations can continue to pay less and less toward the common good.\n\n\n\nThat's what the privatization movement is about -- private prisons, private schools, private all-sorts-of-things that have traditionally been public enterprises but are in the process of claiming more and more tax dollars to the profiteering benefit of the few.\n\n\n\nThat's what demonizing unions is about -- the last coordinated voices on behalf of workers, who have already seen wages stagnate over the past few decades, falling further and further behind the rising cost of living, while CEO pay rises into the stratosphere and the wealthiest of the wealthy hoover up the lion's share of the past decades' economic gains.\n\n\n\nThat's why money has been defined as free-speech -- for the purposes of buying electoral majorities in both the courts and the legislatures, so that the plutocratic policies can pass with unstoppable margins. \u00a0(Witness the astonishing flow of big-donor dollars, 70% from out of state, to the Walker coffers.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the money-is-speech definition, disability issues tend to be pretty darn silent as well. \u00a0I've written before about the ALEC threats to insurance mandates, the devastating and irresponsible cap on Wisconsin's Family Care program\u00a0(which the federal government subsequently forced the state to lift), the (so-far unsuccessful) attempts to privatize special education in Wisconsin. \u00a0The disability lobby is not a wealthy one. \u00a0We've got people-power -- but not money-power.\n\n\n\nWisconsin's issues are a microcosm of a nationwide takeover. \u00a0I've come to believe that plutocracy is THE central issue of the upcoming national elections this November.\n\n\n\nWe need to push back whenever and wherever we can.\n\n\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, on Tuesday, we can speak via the ballot box against Wisconsin's Walker big-money juggernaut by voting Tom Barrett for governor on June 5.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://host.madison.com/article_531276b6-3f6a-11e0-b288-001cc4c002e0.html",

{"date": "Tuesday, July 3, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nThe unprepossessing back of a turtle escaping through a mud puddle\n\n\n\n\nThe spectacular undercarriage of that same turtle\n\nRose and I have read two excellent young-adult novels in recent weeks: Out of My Mind by Sharon Draper, and Wonder by R.J. Palacio. \u00a0(Some parts she read for herself, but mostly we did them as read-alouds). Both books feature 5th-grade student characters, a girl named Melody in Out of My Mind\u00a0and a boy named Auggie in Wonder. \u00a0Rose will be a 5th-grader herself this fall! \u00a0Each 5th-grade protagonist has a strong family with two parents and a sister. \u00a0Each is intellectually ahead of the pack when it comes to their school peers.\n\nAnd each has physical differences that shape how they interact with the world, and how the world reacts to them.\n\nOut of My Mind was recommended to me via Partners in Policymaking. \u00a0Melody, who narrates in first person throughout the novel, has cerebral palsy. \u00a0She has a photographic memory, she's addicted to words, she can control an electric wheelchair, she can point and tap with her thumbs, but she can't walk or talk or feed herself -- so the world sees only the disability, and only Melody has access to the rich inner life of her own mind. \u00a0At least at first... When you put an electronic communication device at the disposal of a girl who knows how to read, you can expect that some amazing things will happen!\n\nMelody's school experience, though, is just ugly. \u00a0She's been shunted off to a segregated \"special-needs\" room since she started school, and only in fifth grade is the school beginning to experiment with \"inclusion\" classes, where everyone (students and teachers both) completely underestimates Melody and her \"special needs\" classmates.\n\nOne aspect of Out of My Mind\u00a0that hit me particularly hard was Melody as Cassandra-prophetess, when she sees something that's about to happen or in progress of happening that she needs to warn someone about -- and nobody can understand her or even get that they're supposed to be listening.\n\nThe story also brought back strong memories of my experiences on high-school quiz team. \u00a0(No further details about the novel forthcoming here; you'll have to read it to find out how this fits.) \u00a0My junior year, I was the only girl and the only junior on our high school's state championship Hi-Q team, a high-profile televised experience. \u00a0Our come-from-behind win in the last two minutes of the championship round was about the most exciting bit of my entire high school career. \u00a0It was fascinating to look back at my own experiences through the lens of Melody's adventures.\n\nRose was interested in Melody, and made a few tentative connections to Joy and her iPad. \u00a0But it was Auggie's story in Wonder\u00a0that really grabbed her. \u00a0August Pullman gets to start prep school in grade 5 after a childhood of homeschooling through facial surgeries and medical fragility. \u00a0A stew of genetic irregularities has left him with a face to which people react with disgust and ridicule. \u00a0It makes for a challenging 5th grade year. \u00a0Fortunately Auggie, like Melody, is clever and has a strong sense of humor.\n\nI think Rose was particularly captivated by Auggie's story for several reasons. \u00a0One, the author (a first-time novelist!) really captured the rhythm of middle-school dialog. \u00a0It sounded like people Rose knows. \u00a0She also appreciated the current pop-culture references (Diary of a Wimpy Kid! \u00a0Justin Bieber!) \u00a0She also liked that Wonder\u00a0wasn't solely narrated by Auggie -- you also got to hear parts of the story told by other kids from Auggie's school, plus his big sister and a couple of her friends. \u00a0Oh yes, Auggie has a big sister! \u00a0So Rose got to hear big-sis Olivia describe the family as a solar-system where her brother is the sun and the rest of the family orbits him and his needs. \u00a0(To what extent is that us?) \u00a0She got to hear Olivia talk genetics and how she carries a gene for part of Auggie's condition that might affect her own child-bearing decisions... a new idea for Rose, and something we could assure her was not part of her situation. \u00a0But there were some genetic-science words introduced that have relevance to our story too, like \"mosaicism.\"\n\nI liked that neither story set up their 5th-grade protagonists as saints. \u00a0For the most part, they resisted the temptation to make everything too\u00a0OK at the end. \u00a0And they both did a great job of weaving the end of the story with threads that had been introduced at the beginning.\n\nI had to wonder, though -- I don't think that it's a coincidence that both characters were written to have above-average intelligence and were able to outshine their typical peers. \u00a0Melody could demonstrate (given the right technology) that she didn't belong in the \"retard room\" as her typically-developing classmates cruelly called it. \u00a0Auggie's academic performance could withstand the scrutiny of mean-spirited parents who didn't think a kid with a face like his could possibly be worthy of their precious (and deliberately non-inclusion) prep school.\n\nAnyone got any good recommendations for novels with protagonists whose disabilities affect their intellect?\n\nMeanwhile, on the drive home from the annual Memorial Day sojourn in the Upper Peninsula (whence cometh the turtle pics), Rose started to write a story based on herself and Joy, inspired by Wonder and Out of My Mind. \u00a0Maybe I'll be recommending her opus to you one of these days.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uvuHdv7OcKU/T_LQyPDZeDI/AAAAAAAABCQ/fvkhoukur_U/s1600/2012-05-turtle2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yYBsk6wJcQg/T_LQ255DncI/AAAAAAAABCY/hzYj28CON3k/s1600/2012-05-turtle1.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/07/you-cant-judge-book-by-its-cover.html", "title": "\nYou Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover\n"},

Occasionally she'd get up and jump around a little bit. \u00a0On one of those jump-arounds, at about the 45 minute mark, she peed just a little on the floor. \u00a0I quick swooped her onto the pot, and mopped up the little puddle, and expected the rest of the release any second.\n\nThat little bit of release was enough to enable her to hold the rest for another 23 minutes.\n\nShe gets a much-desired candy reward when the pee goes in the toilet. \u00a0I can't have the candy in-view-but-out-of-reach, though. \u00a0Tried that, it only makes her mad, and puts Mama at risk of getting swatted in the face. \u00a0Which never feels good, and is even dicier when Mama is balancing on the edge of the tub. \u00a0There aren't a lot of seats in the bathroom, and Joy gets the prime one...\n\nOther than avoiding the candy fight, it was a relatively peaceable hour-plus as far as Joy's response was concerned. \u00a0Mama, though, gets antsy with all that cooped-up time. \u00a0After all, I don't get to play with an iPad while I perch on the bathtub edge. \u00a0And perch, and perch.\n\nI've decided that I can only try these marathon wait-outs at times when I don't have any deadline at all on the other side. \u00a0Otherwise it comes across as \"caving\" when I call a halt, and I can't have Joy holding out with the expectation that I \"cave.\" \u00a0 (Pigeons pecking forever at the lever that once provided food, etc.) \u00a0So I can't do this on my work-mornings.\n\nWe're trying all the tricks. \u00a0Running water. \u00a0Dipping hands in water -- though she finds it puzzling that I'd let her dip in a basin but not the toilet. \u00a0Playing with the Pocket Pond app on the iPad to make splashy-water noises. Squirting water at her privates while on the pot -- apparently some kids respond to warm water, others to cool water. \u00a0Joy doesn't respond to either in the desired fashion.\n\nIt's quite clear that we've got contest-of-wills on pee-holding here. I'm also pretty sure that she's deliberately using the diapers instead holding in between toilet visits. \u00a0Before we started this training push, we used to find dry diapers during the day at least occasionally. \u00a0Now, not so much.\n\nAt the clinic they've got a higher tolerance for dribble, so they're working with her in underpants and just dealing with the soaked shorts. \u00a0At home, we really aren't ready to deal with pee-stink all over everything. \u00a0Hence the long bathroom sessions.\n\nI was really hoping that after a couple of successes, Joy would \"get it.\" \u00a0She'd understand what we were asking, realize how it felt, start working for the candy.\n\nAlas, this has not yet come to pass.\n\nThink good thoughts for us in our bathroom vigils! \u00a0The summer is waning, and I would purely love to be able to send Joy off to second grade with toilet training well underway.\n\n\nEvening update -- All day we had the baseline 3-minute sits, the minimum that I'm requiring on our schedule.  Then at a 7pm sitting, she'd filled her diaper both wet & mess, I was just having her go through the sitting motions after getting cleaned up, and lo & behold she PEED after just 1 minute!!!  Maybe there's hope after all...\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id370256313"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/07/bladder-of-iron-will-of-steel.html", "title": "\nBladder of Iron, Will of Steel\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 2, 2012", "body": "\n\nCan you hear me now?Can you hear me now?Can you hear me now?- Verizon wireless commercial\n\n\n\nWhen we look back at the summer of 2012, I think we may remember it as the summer of the toilet training -- and of the iPad.\n\nI threatened way back when to do a bunch of product reviews around\u00a0Joy's iPad\u00a0equipment and apps. \u00a0I naively figured that I'd work my way down Joy's list of apps and tell you all about them. \u00a0But at the pace I'm blogging versus the pace we're adding apps -- yeah. \u00a0It's not going to happen quite like that. \u00a0What I decided to do instead was to create a separate page that will represent a running list of her apps, with notes (see the new tab at the top of the blog!) \u00a0As well as being a good way to share, I figure it will be a good record for me, too. \u00a0 \u00a0I'm also resurrecting my \"Product Hits & Misses\" category, one I haven't used in quite a while. \u00a0The old ones are chock-full of useful information though, even across several years' time.\n\nOn to the product reviews!\n\nBack when Joy's speech therapist was evaluating iPad technology with Joy, but before I'd had any chance to explore the iPad myself, she noted a concern about the iPad's volume levels. \u00a0She wanted Joy to be able to use the iPad to speak above a noisy classroom if necessary -- and indeed, the iPad's speakers are not among its most highly-praised features. \u00a0So she recommended that we look into external speakers. \n\nWhen we did so, we found that most external speakers connected to the iPad via cords, which absolutely wasn't going to mesh with our active, tough-on-equipment young lady. \u00a0There was one product, though, that combined external speakers with a tough-looking case, complete with carrying handle: the iAdapter 2 from AMDi. \u00a0It's a pricey product, at $265. \u00a0The reviews looked good, though, and for what we were trying to do it was about the only reasonable option. So we pitched it, together with the iPad and ProLoQuo2Go and a couple other apps, for funding via Wisconsin's Medicaid waiver for children's long term support. \u00a0And we got the whole shebang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iAdpater encases the iPad in a 2-part assembly that fastens together with nine screws. \u00a0The speakers sit behind the iPad. \u00a0The case has openings for the front and back cameras and the iPad recharging plug, while the the opening for the Home button has a removable sliding cover. \u00a0(Joy figured out how to slide it open and get to the Home button pretty quickly.) \u00a0The case covers the iPad's volume controls, offering instead a 3-position volume switch, Hi/Lo/Off. \u00a0The case offers its own Sleep button that sits atop the iPad's Sleep button; the iPad's rotation-lock / mute switch is not accessible without unscrewing the case.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, we were pleased with the iAdapter sound quality. \u00a0We found that we seldom wanted to turn the iPad's internal volume higher than about three-quarters; Joy generally prefers the iAdapter volume switch set to \"Hi.\" \u00a0We did run into at least one situation where an app wouldn't play well with the iAdapter -- in the Whizzit 1-2-3 counting app, some of the spoken instructions were inaudibly soft, while the rest of the directions and sounds were fine. \u00a0When the iPad was removed from the iAdapter, the problem disappeared.\n\n\n\nOf my two other concerns with the iAdapter, one is an issue that affects all users, and the other is more specific to Joy.\n\n\n\nThe universal issue has to do with the fact that the iAdapter itself needs charging, separately from the iPad. \u00a0It comes with a cord and a wall-plug adapter for the purpose, which is great. \u00a0However, there's no indicator to let the user know how far the battery has run down, or how close the iAdapter is to being recharged. \u00a0We've never run it all the way out, so I don't know what would happen. \u00a0Does the iAdapter just go silent, and would the cause be obvious? \u00a0 Meanwhile, we learned that we couldn't charge both the iAdapter and the iPad in a single standard 2-socket wall outlet: the wall-plugs are too big to both fit simultaneously. \u00a0You'll need either a powerstrip or two wall outlets close together.\n\n\n\nThe other issue is more Joy-specific though it applies to other kids like her: \u00a0girlfriend is tough on equipment. When Joy gets frustrated, stuff goes flying. \u00a0The iPad in its iAdapter case has gone flying down the stairs a couple of times, along with various lesser flings, since we got it at the beginning of the year. \u00a0Soon we began to hear little rattles within the case. \u00a0When I opened it up, I discovered that the inside of the case isn't as tough-looking as the outside. \u00a0The iPad is essentially held in place by slender plastic tabs, and several of these tabs had begun cracking off. \u00a0After several flinging incidents, the tabs had crumbled enough that the iAdapter case began to rub the wrong way against the volume control, causing the volume to suddenly mute at inopportune moments -- a development that Joy did not appreciate.\n\n\n\nThe tech support fellow I corresponded with at AMDi was extremely helpful. \u00a0He answered e-mail promptly, did a fine job of diagnosing the volume issue, and set things up so that we could send the iAdapter in for free repairs even though technically the flinging damage was not\u00a0covered by warranty (and if it happens again, we're on our own.) \u00a0He also filled me in on the design principle behind the relatively-fragile internal support tabs. \u00a0Apparently they function like crumple-zones on a car, designed to absorb impact at their own cost in order to protect the cargo. \u00a0Of course you'd rather have your car-body crumple in an accident rather than your own body! \u00a0Turns out that both with iAdapters and with cars, the safety/protection features are secondary functions, and the crumple-zone protection is a one-shot affair.\n\n\n\nBefore I packed up our iAdapter to send in for repairs, we needed something to keep Joy's iPad usable and safe in the interim. \u00a0After a bit of surfing around, I settled on the SuperShell from M-Edge ($34.99). \n\n\n\nThere are several similar products out there, apparently. \u00a0The SuperShell is made of the same kind of material as Crocs footwear. It doesn't have any amplification qualities, though it does have a little cut-out for the iPad's speaker. \u00a0There are also cut-outs for the cameras and the charger plug. \u00a0The volume control and sleep button are accessed via partial cut-outs; the rotation lock/mute button is covered. \u00a0To install the SuperShell, just stretch it around the iPad and it springs tight.\n\n\n\nWhat really sold us on the SuperShell (besides the awesome hot-pink color option) was this video, wherein the interviewer flings a SuperShell-clad iPad into walls and the floor of an exhibit hall:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe SuperShell really does work just the way it does in the video. \u00a0Joy has tested it, repeatedly. \u00a0It bounces.\n\n\n\nThe one criticism we have so far is that the cutout for the charger plug doesn't really let you get the plug in and out, so you have to pull the SuperShell off that side of the iPad to do the plugging in. But that's easy to do.\n\n\n\nAfter the SuperShell arrived and we sent off the iAdapter for repairs, we learned something interesting. \u00a0The iPad on its own was actually PLENTY loud. \u00a0I'm not sure what the concern was in the first place. \u00a0We actually find ourselves repeatedly diving for Joy's iPad to turn the darn volume DOWN (she has become adept at adjusting it loud-where-she-likes-it.)\n\n\n\nAnd the SuperShell is so cute, and we feel confident that the shell itself is not going to break when flung...\n\n\n\nWe actually never did re-install the iAdapter. \u00a0We probably ought to find another good home for it.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://amdi.net/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=111", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Efs5K_Z_3co/T7kUt0OO9vI/AAAAAAAABAk/NVPkl7_HtN8/s1600/iadapter1-500x500.jpg", "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whizzit-123/id323246993?mt=8", "http://www.medgestore.com/products/ipad2-supershell.psp", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TBApbZdFcR0/UEKL4VZVy7I/AAAAAAAABCk/pvME6YzyaKw/s1600/supershell.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/09/product-hits-misses-keeping-ipad.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits & Misses: Keeping the iPad Audible (and safe)\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 24, 2012", "body": "\n\nWe got our piano tuned the other week. \u00a0Rose has been making great strides with her piano lessons, making the instrument sing each morning with her practicing -- so we wanted to be sure it was singing in key! \u00a0(Didja hear the one about how people keep having to break into song because they can't find the key? \u00a0Heh.)\n\n\n\nAnyway, the guy who did the turning also plays a variety of instruments but is particularly skilled with the marimba. \u00a0He's won numerous awards, plays from a repertoire of over 250 songs, and has performed in Wisconsin's Capitol Rotunda.\n\n\n\nHe also has autism, and didn't speak until he was eleven. \u00a0Now, in his mid-thirties, his list of accomplishments is long. \u00a0In his work as a piano tuner, he is accompanied by his mentor, a retired piano tech who supervises his work and helps him stay focused. \u00a0His mom, who manages his scheduling, also taught him at home. \u00a0By the time we'd completed the whole transaction, I wound up with two of their CDs -- one of his performances, one of her compositions.\n\n\n\nMom's songs, as it turned out, were integral to his education. \u00a0Twenty-some years ago, public schools were open to students with disabilities thanks to the 1975 \"Education for All Handicapped Children Act\" (predecessor to IDEA) -- but in his case at least, they weren't very successful at figuring out how to serve him. \u00a0His mother was a kindergarten teacher, and she discovered that what he best responded to was music; that if you sang his lessons to him, the material would actually stick. \u00a0So her CD features the songs of his education, created as she put together a music-laced curriculum for him.\n\n\n\nJoy, meanwhile, has gotten off to a fine start this school year. \u00a0I was concerned that the transition back into school, with a mostly new-to-her team and coming off a late-summer riddled with behavioral challenges, was going to be rocky at best. \u00a0But her new special-educator and teacher and student-teacher met with us repeatedly in August, processed the mounds of input we had for them, and felt like partners in the education of Joy before classes even started.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, Joy has been blessed with musical SEAs (special education assistants). \u00a0The past two years, she was met first thing every morning by an SEA who plays drums and teaches piano. \u00a0We were sorry to leave that aide behind as Joy moved up to 2nd grade, but simply delighted to hear her new morning-greeter SEA announce, \"I'm a singer!\" \u00a0Joy's affinity for melody and tempo was quickly evident to this new SEA. \u00a0We've been hearing updates about Joy echoing little tunes and tapping rhythms.\n\n\n\nThen on Friday, she sent home this piece of artwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Song Spots\"\n\n\n\n\nJoy, who had never made it all the way through art class before as far as I knew, hung in for a full 45 minutes with her singer-SEA on Friday and dotted this sheet in one marker-color after another -- in time to music. \u00a0It sounds like her art teacher got into the act with the music as well. \u00a0I know he plays the bass, and the note said \"Teacher plays quiet jazz too!\"\n\n\n\nTeachers have been badly scapegoated lately in Wisconsin and nationwide, and SEAs are even further down the totem pole. \u00a0As a Madison teacher-blogger posted just yesterday:\n\nSEAs choose to stay in a career where they are often sworn at, kicked and challenged. They do this, because they care about our children and they understand the importance of their role in our students\u2019 lives. We need to start rewarding SEAs both financially and by treating them with the professionalism they deserve. \u00a0Most importantly, we must create school conditions that foster success for the students they serve.\n\nIndeed.\n\n\n\nIn tandem with the new music delights, we've had a burst of words these past weeks as well. \u00a0The speech-settings on Joy's mixer-board are hitting new highs. \u00a0I now regularly hear at snack-time, when Joy finishes the first serving of goldfish -- \"moh... CACK-uh!\" \u00a0Not too long ago, when Joy was angling for her iPad (which was busy charging up on the other side of the bedroom door), we got a three-word prompted utterance out of her: \"I... want... iPad\"! \u00a0Heck, just yesterday JoyDad was watching football with her, and was teaching her to raise her arms and say \"Touchdown\"! \u00a0(Next on the list of sports-speak to teach her will be \"Go Bears!\")\n\n\n\nMusic to our ears.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, while all this wonderful music and speech and overlap between the two is happening on the home front, down at Wisconsin's Capitol, a new Chief of Capitol Police has been tasked with squelching musical free speech in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\n\n\nI've blogged about the Solidarity Sing Along before: red heart balloons, and holiday defiance in the face of an attempted December crackdown last year. \u00a0Since March of 2011, the Sing Along has gathered daily to continue expressing opposition to the ongoing depredations of the Walker administration. \u00a0This remarkable resistance-movement has been a thorn in the side of the Republican regime since the singing first began. \u00a0They tried to squelch us last December with a ridiculous, unconstitutional re-interpretation of Capitol permitting rules, flying in the face of the Rotunda's rich history of being a public square, intentionally designed with acoustics suitable for free political expression. \u00a0We showed up by the hundreds in December, daring them to arrest us all -- and, in large part due to the thoughtful leadership of the previous Capitol police chief, no arrests were made and the Sing Along continued.\n\n\n\nNow, however, the arrests have begun. \u00a0Chief David Erwin, a former Scott Walker bodyguard, has led the Capitol Police in an anti-singer campaign. \u00a0The arrests and citations have targeted the people who attend the Sing Along most frequently. \u00a0While Erwin gives interviews complaining about disruptive protesters who go around \"terrorizing\" tourists and Capitol staff, the arrests are for holding signs. \u00a0Or banners (like the one held by JoyMama the rabble-rouser in the red coat below). \u00a0Or for attending an unpermitted event, or for sections of the Administrative Code that have never been interpreted in this way before. Despite repeated requests for clarification, the Capitol Police are declining to specify what activities might be deemed citation-worthy on any particular day. \u00a0They've taken to showing up at people's homes and workplaces to deliver citations, without having approached the individuals at the Capitol at the time of the supposed infraction. \u00a0It's intimidation, and they're pairing it with a cynical propaganda campaign that Rebecca Kemble wrote about compellingly in The Progressive the other week: The Two-Pronged Assault on Dissent in Wisconsin's Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe citizen-lobbyists of the Solidarity Sing Along believe that our permit to lift our voices in musical dissent is contained in the following words of Wisconsin's Constitution (Article 1, Section 4):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe right of the people peaceably to assemble, to consult for the common good, and to petition the government, or any department thereof, shall never be abridged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What part of SHALL NEVER BE ABRIDGED don't you understand?\"\n\n\nAnd if we poke a little bit of fun at Chief Erwin with masks and signs, that too is free speech, a bit of political theatre to bring home our message. \u00a0We gather and sing in peace, but we are determined. \u00a0We intend to keep singing until Wisconsin is back on the right track. \u00a0Even then, we will continue to be involved on a new level.\n\nThere's too much at stake -- and my Joy, who delights in rhythm and song, is at the heart of the future I'm fighting for.\n\nSee you at the Capitol.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3iLRbmvRQL8/UF9TFYUEoFI/AAAAAAAABDA/xzyM1jqGh8A/s1600/2012-09-songspots.jpg", "http://www.runningreflectionswi.com/2012/09/23/seas-open-the-doorway-to-learning/", "http://www.progressive.org/2-pronged-assault-on-dissent-in-wisconsin-capitol", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UNS-OTGo5Hs/TvMb_yj3lXI/AAAAAAAAA78/koffF7o2zz8/s1600/AnnieJo.jpg", "http://www.blogger.com/", "http://www.blogger.com/", "http://www.blogger.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RULOaEvRmO8/UF9TEgALgEI/AAAAAAAABC4/RGQrzIgCeq8/s1600/2012-09-erwin1.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/09/music-and-speech.html", "title": "\nMusic and Speech\n"},

It seems almost strange to have so much to celebrate on the disability-advocacy front in Wisconsin, in a year when so many things have careened in such a miserable direction.  But it's true -- and it was bi-partisan, too!\n\nI wrote in greater detail on four big legislative wins in a piece on Daily Kos earlier this week, but here's the short version:\n\nBig Win #1: We managed to halt a cash-grab of a bill, a terribly-flawed school voucher program written by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and called the Special Needs Scholarship Program Act.  I wrote about it on Elvis Sightings back in May and July last year.\n\nBig Win #2: The legislature lifted the caps on enrollment in Wisconsin's long-term care programs, fixing a serious problem that had been created by Gov. Walker's 2011/2013 budget.  I've been active on this one too; wrote a personal take here called Freezing the Future last spring when the caps were imposed.\n\nBig Win #3: The legislature passed a bill limiting and regulating the use of seclusion and restraint in public schools, an issue that falls disproportionately on students with disabilities.  The vote was unanimous in both chambers!\n\nBig Win #4: The legislature passed the People First bill, updating terminology in Wisconsin statute such that the outdated & pejorative \"mental retardation\" will be replaced with \"intellectual disability.\"  Another unanimous bipartisan win -- down with the \"R-word\"!\n\nMy Wisconsin Partners in Policymaking class had our fingerprints all over these.  Many of us had been involved in one or more of these initiatives for years!  Now that we were organized as a class, we went into high gear during the last month of the legislative session: testifying, organizing, and writing and calling and lobbying our legislators in person.\n\nWhen we met last Friday just after a week of all these wins becoming official, we were ready to celebrate!  Mad props to every last person in the group!  To our great delight, we received an invitation as a group to attend the bill-signing event in Milwaukee in which Governor Walker was to sign Big Wins #2-4 into law!  About half of our class were able to attend.  (I didn't make it, but was there in spirit -- while hand-delivering thank-you letters at the Capitol to legislators on both sides of the aisle.)\n\nOur training last weekend focused on the ins and outs of the legislative process that we'd just experienced so powerfully, with lessons and role-plays on communicating with law-makers, and how to craft a winning message on our issues.  One dominant theme was the importance of a nonpartisan approach.  We heard again and again that our issues transcend party lines; that there are disability champions on the right as well as on the left; that we need both parties on our side no matter who's in power.\n\nThat's a challenging lesson to internalize at this point in Wisconsin history.  I've proudly staked out a personal partisan stance in full-throated opposition to what's been wreaked on Wisconsin from the right this past year.  And yet, my Partners in Policymaking family (it's really starting to feel that way) has a range of partisan leanings.  I was one of three Partners who sat for hours waiting to testify against the voucher-bill before the Senate Education Committee, sitting in solidarity on this issue right next to a colleague whose political leanings are quite different than mine.\n\nI was tempted at that hearing to rail against the corporatist, cash-grab ALEC roots of the voucher bill, something that Rep. Mark Pocan (D) did very effectively later in the Assembly when the bill came to the floor.  However, I resisted the urge and kept my remarks focused on Joy and on the substance of the legislation.  Having done so, I was then able to take a thank-you letter to the office of the Republican chair of the Senate Education Committee, and have a cordial and productive conversation with the clerk who had staffed the hearing for him.\n\nI don't know who in our Partners group has signed the recall petition, but I know that it didn't really matter when it came time for people to decide whether or not to attend the bill-signing ceremony.  The importance of the legislative victories FAR outweighed any political point-scoring maneuvers.  We were enjoined to keep the date & time of the signing a secret such that political protest would not overshadow the content of our victories, and we all did so.  After all, it takes a governor to sign a bill into law, and we've got the governor that we've got, not the governor that some of us might wish to have!\n\nBeing present at the signing was a powerful experience for my Partners colleagues, as evidenced in post-signing blogging -- there were a ton of photos and stories on Facebook as well.  It was jarring and dis-heartening after the ceremony, then, to learn that a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin had made the following statement to a news reporter about Governor Walker and the event:\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty shocking that he\u2019s using a community that he\u2019s almost ground underfoot in this budget as props, as he\u2019s seeking recall here.\"\nProps.  The spokesman for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin thinks that all those incredibly hard-working, politically-savvy, overwhelmingly-committed disability advocates at the bill-signing were nothing more than mindless props for Governor Walker.\n\nWe're not props.  And being called props makes us... well, MAD.\n\nBoth I and another Partners colleague wrote letters to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, pointing out the error of the spokesman's ways.\n\nWe need to work with both parties, celebrate what both parties do right, and hold them accountable for what they don't.\n\nAnd with that, I promise that the next post will be much more Joy-centric!  Because that's what all this policy stuff is about.  It's about people, and making better lives for all of us.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mad+props", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/19/1075456/-Four-Wisconsin-Disability-Victories-incl-the-Demise-of-ALEC-s-AB110-", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/07/1071984/-WI-Rep-Mark-Pocan-Rips-Into-ALEC-on-Assembly-Floor-re-Special-Needs-Vouchers-", "http://www.cudahynow.com/blogs/communityblogs/143590176.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FpJVs7XYztM/T2xeoKaEQtI/AAAAAAAAA-I/flj_8E_99cI/s1600/shadow.JPG"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/03/mad-props.html", "title": "\nMad Props\n"},

I see a red bird looking at me!\"\n\n\n\nAnd then I was just about to move on to the next question, when we heard a quiet utterance from Joy. \u00a0She had picked up her aide's hand and begun tapping in rhythm, singing, \"bow beh, bow beh...\"\n\n\n\nJoy wants to sing? \u00a0Joy gets to sing. \u00a0The class all joined in as I led them through a memorized rendition of the entire book, with Joy smiling and singing and tapping along. \u00a0They were all with me, all the way through. A glorious connection.\n\n\n\nAfter the poster, I stuck around to help as the class moved on to a math lesson. \u00a0But first the teacher went in search of a book. \u00a0She didn't have a copy of Brown Bear in the room, but she did have \"Baby Bear.\" \u00a0So while the class did math, Joy and her SEA went through the whole \"Baby bear, baby bear\" book over and over again. Joy simply glowed.\n\n\n\nLast night at home during her bath and after, I heard Joy talking. \u00a0There were definite, separate words -- some one syllable, some two -- with pauses between, and different vowels and consonants. \u00a0It happened three different times. \u00a0It felt like there was a sentence there each time, but each time was different. \u00a0And I couldn't understand. \u00a0I was in awe, feeling something new and big pushing through, but not quite connected enough myself to understand what was there.\n\n\n\nJoyDad said afterwards that Joy had been singing bits of Brown Bear to her therapist at her clinic session. \u00a0That might be part of it. \u00a0I'll listen for that next time, assuming that this wasn't an Elvis Sighting that goes away for goodness-knows-how-long.\n\n\n\nBut it might have been something completely new. I think there may be something big about to happen. \u00a0I'm wishing on my Star, because this just may be a dream waiting to come true.\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wvGe0AXFvHM/UGwevgEVEbI/AAAAAAAABDU/rC0DPtwYOWw/s1600/2012-10-star.jpg", "http://allrecipes.com/recipe/moms-zucchini-bread/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/10/star-of-week.html", "title": "\nStar of the Week\n"},

{"date": "Monday, December 19, 2011", "body": "\nAs the introduction to our annual Christmas newsletter this year pointed out, \"the local oldies station has switched to 'all Christmas music, all the time.'\"  Christmas, more than any other holiday, comes with its own musical soundtrack.\n\nThe JoyFamily appreciates the holiday soundtrack -- JoyMama in particular was simply delighted with the Messiah singalong at church on Sunday!  (Rose, in contrast, left the sanctuary at the first chorus, claiming that the singing and instruments were painfully loud.) \n\nWe have our own songs going on this season too.\n\nI've written before about Joy's bedtime routine, that involves filling in the blanks for Rock-A-Bye Joy and Twinkle, Twinkle, with Joy filling in the words.  In recent weeks, these songs have gone to a whole new level.  They've become an interactive people-play, where Joy decides what will be rocked or twinkled and when it will happen.\n\nIt looks something like this: she'll bring me her stuffed penguin and cuddle up to me with penguin in her arms.  Then she'll rock slightly back and forth, saying something like \"WOH-woh.\"  Which is my cue to sing:\nRock-a-bye PENGUIN, on the tree top,\nWhen the wind blows...\n... and Joy fills in some \"peh-peh\" word so I can continue\nPENGUIN will rock!\nThe funnier the item, the better the Joy-giggles.  One of my favorites has been the plastic tomato slice:\n\nTwinkle, twinkle, little TOMATO!!\nBut wait, there's more!  JoyDad and Joy then added a variation where Joy points to her own body-parts, with a one-finger point even, to direct him into verses such as:\n\nRock-a-bye KNEE, on the tree top,\nWhen the wind blows, BELLY-BUTTON will rock!\nThe most recent variation has to do with a home-made board book dating back to Joy's days in daycare and early-childhood ed.  The book has photos of people close to Joy, plus useful shots representing daycare, home, mealtime booster-chair, potty, etc.  When Joy brings this book with a cuddle and a \"WOH-woh,\" and starts flipping to the desired pages, we get something like:\n\nRock-a-bye GRANDMA, on the tree top,\nWhen the wind blows, POTTY will rock!\nI've got a few more musical offerings to share before Christmas rolls around next week.  Meanwhile, though, I'm off to the Solidarity Sing-Along at the Capitol, something I've written about here and elsewhere.  Today's singalong of holiday-themed protest songs will end up being a test of a set of new restrictive rules designed to quash protest, this regular protest in particular.  Might be something of a showdown today, though it sounds as if the administration isn't going to try any mass arrests.  I'm all dressed up respectable-like just on the off chance, though!\n\nKeep singing, and I'll report more Joy-family song-related goodies in days to come...\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://myspacefilehosting.com/lmnyh/Twinkle.mp3.html", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/06/27/989178/-Wisconsin-Singers-Meet-a-Counter-Protest?via=blog_472852", "http://passionatedemocrat.blogspot.com/2011/12/karl-rove-acolyte-says-wisconsinites.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/12/songs-of-season-part-1.html", "title": "\nSongs of the Season, Part 1\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 1, 2011", "body": "\nUPDATE -- This post from 2009 had somehow disappeared from the web into \"draft\" status!  I'm glad to retrieve it, because it's time for an update.  The Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act failed to pass in its 2009 incarnation, but was re-introduced in November as the ABLE Act of 2011.  The link is to a widget from Autism Speaks that will help you to contact your federal legislators and ask them to sign on as co-sponsors.  Please read the piece below -- it may be familiar, if you're a long-time reader of this blog! -- and then please click and contact.  Thanks so much!\n\n= = = = = = = = = \n\n\"You're in a bad place.\"\n\nThat's how the lawyer summarized our situation, with regards to saving for Joy's future needs.\n\nNot long after the births of Rose and Joy, we started saving for their future higher education needs, with our state's 529 educational savings plan, a nice tax-exempt  way to be saving and planning ahead.  We have a relative who has done the same for them in another state, too.\n\nRose is, pretty obviously, a very good bet for higher education eventually, little human dictionary and all.\n\nWith Joy, the educational trajectory has been so confusing.  We really have no idea what will be going on with her by the time she finishes school (or the school system finishes with her).  Heck, she's only four [update: now she's seven, and we still have no idea!]\n\nBut as she gets closer to entering the school system and yet keeps regressing away her various gains, we started to wonder about the wisdom of the 529 accounts for her.  The rules of the 529 are clear: you can only use it for higher education expenses.  If you take it out for anything else: big honkin' tax hit.\n\nWe surely don't want to sell Joy short, but it seems pretty clear that she's going to have some needs beyond the norm as she matures.  Those needs may have to do with higher education, but they may not!  We don't want our savings for her to be locked into something that's not flexible enough to meet her needs.\n\nThat's the situation that sent us to the attorney, to ask about the potential of a special needs trust.\n\nThat's the situation he shook his head at, and called \"a bad place.\"\n\nThe thing is, a special needs trust isn't designed to be a place for you and other relatives to sock money away incrementally, like the 529 for higher education.  The special needs trust is a vehicle where you move a big chunk of change for the later support of a disabled person, and it's highly hemmed around with restrictions to keep unscrupulous folks from using it as a tax shelter when disability isn't really the issue.  You need to be very sure you've got an ongoing disability situation before you start down the special needs trust road, and then it's definitely lawyer-business (i.e. attorney's fees) to set up, unlike the 529 that you can do on your own.\n\nBut the 529 isn't a great bet for her either, given the uncertainty of her situation.  The attorney didn't know what to advise us, except that there weren't any really good options for us.\n\nWe were told that federal legislation had been introduced in the past, to create a vehicle similar to the 529 but for expenses related to disability.  But it had never managed to go anywhere.\n\nExcept that there's been a big election between then and now! [Update: hmm, the 2008 elections didn't manage to make the difference. Maybe there will be some traction as elected officials campaign for 2012?]\n\nAnd... the legislation has been introduced again, both in the House and Senate, on February 26, 2009.  It's called The ABLE Accounts Act of 2009 (ABLE stands for Achieving a Better Life Experience), and the bill numbers are H.R. 1205 and S. 493. [Update: the 2011 version bill numbers, introduced Nov. 15, 2011, are H.R. 3423 and S. 1872]\n\nHere's a summary of the legislation (updated link & summary for 2011):\nThe ABLE Act -- introduced with bi-partisan support in the House (HR.3423) by Congressman Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), and in the Senate (S.1872) by Senators Robert Casey, Jr. (D-PA) and Richard Burr (R-NC)-- would amend Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Service Code to allow individuals with disabilities and their families to deposit earnings to tax-exempt savings accounts. The funds could be used to pay for qualified expenses, including education, housing and transportation, and would supplement, not replace, benefits provided through private insurance, employment or public programs.\n \nAnd what could it be spent on?  Glad you asked...\nQualified disability expenses would include: school tuition and related educational materials; expenses for securing and maintaining a primary residence; transportation; employment supports; health prevention and wellness costs; assistive technology and personal support; and various miscellaneous expenses associated with independent living. \nHere is a link to the text of the bill itself (Senate version for 2011, in pdf).  One element that I was glad to see: it looks as if one would be allowed to transfer money from an educational 529 into an ABLE account without the tax hit.\n\n[In 2009] the bill was introduced in the House by Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), with co-sponsors Congressmen Patrick Kennedy (D-RI), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), and Kendrick Meek (D-FL).  In the Senate, it was introduced by Senator Robert Casey (D-PA), Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), and co-sponsored by Senators Richard Burr (R-NC), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), and Sam Brownback (R-KS).  Update: in 2011, it was sponsored in the Senate by Robert Casey, Jr (D-PA) and Richard Burr (R-NC); in the house by Ander Crenshaw (FL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA).  Bipartisanship, can you even believe it?!\n\nPlease take a moment to drop a note or call to your senators & representative urging them to support/co-sponsor this bill.  There's a handy page for generating constituent support letters over at Autism Speaks, or you can look up your elected officials' contact information here and contact them directly.  \n\nIf you can take a few minutes to do this, that would make us so happy!

{"date": "Tuesday, November 6, 2012", "body": "\nThe presidential candidates have made their final arguments. \u00a0I've been making a final electoral argument too, on the political sites I frequent, arguing that for many people whose lives are affected by disabilities, this election hinges on Medicaid. \u00a0(Prof. Paul Krugman of the New York Times has made the Medicaid argument too, so I'm not alone in this.)\n\n\n\nHowever, when I went and looked at my closing argument regarding the Walker recall here in Wisconsin this past June, I realized that what I said then still does a great job of summing up this presidential election, from a different emphasis. \u00a0Here's what I said\u00a0[with a few additions in square brackets]:\n\n\n\n===========\n\n\n\nWalker's Wisconsin represents a future that the wealthiest of the far-right have been coordinating and working toward in America for decades now. \u00a0I didn't understand it until the events of last February [2011] opened my eyes. \u00a0But it is real, it is dire, and it has been in process of happening for years now in this country. \u00a0The end-game is\u00a0plutocracy\u00a0-- government by the wealthy, for the wealthy.\n\n\n\nThat's what the ginned-up anger about taxes is about -- so the wealthiest and their corporations can continue to pay less and less toward the common good.\n\n\n\nThat's what the privatization movement is about -- private prisons, private schools, private all-sorts-of-things that have traditionally been public enterprises but are in the process of claiming more and more tax dollars to the profiteering benefit of the few.\n\n\n\nThat's what demonizing unions is about -- the last coordinated voices on behalf of workers, who have already seen wages stagnate over the past few decades, falling further and further behind the rising cost of living, while CEO pay rises into the stratosphere and the wealthiest of the wealthy hoover up the lion's share of the past decades' economic gains.\n\n\n\nThat's why money has been defined as free-speech -- for the purposes of buying electoral majorities in both the courts and the legislatures, so that the plutocratic policies can pass with unstoppable margins. \u00a0(Witness the astonishing flow of big-donor dollars, 70% from out of state, to the Walker coffers.) \u00a0[This time around in Wisconsin it's the Baldwin/Thompson US Senate campaign, which has attracted more outside spending than any other national race this cycle other than the presidency and a Senate race in Virginia.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the money-is-speech definition, disability issues tend to be pretty darn silent as well. \u00a0I've written before about the\u00a0ALEC threats to insurance mandates, the\u00a0devastating and irresponsible cap on Wisconsin's Family Care program\u00a0(which the federal government subsequently forced the state to lift), the (so-far unsuccessful) attempts to\u00a0privatize special education in Wisconsin. \u00a0The disability lobby is not a wealthy one. \u00a0We've got people-power -- but not money-power.\n\n\n\nWisconsin's issues are a microcosm of a nationwide takeover. \u00a0I've come to believe that plutocracy is THE central issue of the upcoming national elections this November.\n\n\n\nWe need to push back whenever and wherever we can.\n\n\n\n===========\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease vote.\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/05/1155775/-Medicaid-Wisconsin-the-Ryan-Plan-Scared-Spitless", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/opinion/krugman-medicaid-on-the-ballot.html", "http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2012/10/26/baldwin-thompson-senate-race-sets-new-spending-record-led-by-outside-groups/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vI0CX1h6QSQ/T8n9ilocfmI/AAAAAAAABB4/3x4XfmycKtk/s1600/poverty.jpg", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/22/1067476/-Piratizing-Special-Education-in-Wisconsin-AB110-Plunder-Revisited", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sWsYkm6pM7k/UJj6wTbi9xI/AAAAAAAABFc/yBJpdpjiW6Y/s1600/IMG_5438.JPG"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/11/election-day.html", "title": "\nElection Day\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 22, 2012", "body": "\nI know several people who are posting daily \"thanksgivings\" throughout November, either on Facebook or on their blogs. \u00a0I didn't take up that challenge, mostly because committing myself to one more daily obligation, no matter how soul-nourishing, would have been -- well, committing myself to one more daily obligation.\n\nBut I do believe I could have blogged a Joy-Thanksgiving pretty much every day of the month. \u00a0It has been an incredible November!\n\nHere a just a few of the Joy-Thanksgiving events of November. \u00a0Milestones, not just inchstones!\n\nJoy's participation in her school music class annual program was more robust than it's ever been. \u00a0Her music teacher burned a CD of the songs in the program to send home, and we loaded them up on Joy's iPad so she could listen to them at will. \u00a0This year's show was in honor of Veterans' Day, so we had patriotic music mixed in with Joy's usual Baby Einstein soundtrack. \u00a0Her favorites among the program were This Land is Your Land (mama approves, even if they didn't include the populist-protest verses!) and a little marching ditty called I am Proud to be an American (not the Lee Greenwood \"God Bless the USA\" song, thank goodness.) \u00a0On concert day, Joy's class was stationed at one end of the risers, so Joy could stand or sit with her staff members next to her class. \u00a0She marched in place a little bit in the right place, and waved a little flag, and made it through the whole show. \u00a0Proud, proud mama!\n\nSome days later, when GrampaK came over for lunch one Saturday, I was telling him all about the concert and Joy's participation. \u00a0Joy was on the couch with her iPad -- and as I told Grampa about the songs on the iPad, all of a sudden the iPad started singing\u00a0I am Proud to be an American. \u00a0Which means that Joy not only followed our conversation and acted upon it, but she also must have gone deliberately to the music-program song list rather than playing Baby Einstein. \u00a0Oh. \u00a0My.\n\nThen there's this e-mail message to share from one of Joy's school staff the week after the music program, which sent me over the moon for the rest of the workday:\n\nJust have to share my goosebumps delight from the first ten minutes of [Joy] and my day.\u00a0 Tons of language in context.\u00a0 No cue prompts.\u00a0 We sailed thru our multiple tasks and I can't stop smiling.\u00a0 Wish u had been here to share\nThat day, something came home that made me smile even wider: \u00a0Joy's first homework. \u00a0Oh, we've had schoolwork tasks come home before, but they were always framed in terms of showing us what Joy's working on in school, rather than actually being called HOMEWORK. \u00a0I was surprised how deeply this affected me -- all it entailed was a square 4x4 grid, on which Joy was to place smaller paper squares, using the terms \"take\" and \"put.\" \u00a0But the importance of it was driven home a week later, when I was asked by another kiddo on the schoolyard, \"Does Joy ever have homework?\" and I was honestly able to say, \"Yes. \u00a0Yes, she does.\"\n\nIn the wake of all that, you might guess how much smiling went on during Joy's parent-teacher conference mid-month! \u00a0I was surprised to see Joy's team so well represented, having only been sure that the teacher and case-manager would be there, but her student-teacher/SEA and her speech therapist and her occupational therapist were all there too. \u00a0So much good news to share, together with ideas for how to tweak things even better!\n\nThe best piece of news from that conference, as far as I was concerned, was the piece of construction-paper artwork above Joy's locker. \u00a0It turned out that they'd had a class project making construction-paper clouds with rainbow bands dangling below, where each cloud had the student's name and each rainbow band carried an adjective describing the students. \u00a0Most students came up with their own, but since that's not Joy's scene just yet, the teacher invited the students to help come up with a rainbow of adjectives for Joy. \u00a0She said they were just tumbling over one another with suggestions, and the themes were all directly from the kids. \u00a0Here's what they came up with:\n\n\nSensitive\nOutdoorsy\nTechnical (they refined this one from \"computer-y\" in admiration for her iPad mad-skillz!)\nSwift\nBeautiful\nMusical\n\n\nEven after just a couple of months, my daughter's classmates know her really well, don't they? \u00a0Because that rainbow there is an awesome representation.\n\nThe LEND trainee who came along to observe the conference was deeply impressed, and we had a fine conversation afterward about the importance of inclusion even when a student isn't in the classroom. \u00a0(There's a whole 'nother blogpost in there, my friends!)\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nThis past week, Joy was invited to not just one but TWO birthday parties, together with her sister. \u00a0On back-to-back days, yet! \u00a0The first party was for a neighbor and the venue was a bounce-house facility. \u00a0How perfect is that? \u00a0Joy bounced and bounced, and repeatedly tossed a bouncy-basketball up through a basketball net (from the bottom up, rather than making a basket, but who's counting?) \u00a0Then after an hour and a half of bouncing and sliding, the kids all herded into a room with tables for cake and ice-cream and present-opening. \u00a0And Joy sat down between two kids she didn't know, with Rose a little way down on the other side of the table. \u00a0Once we got her served with goodies and lemonade, I went over to the edge of the room and sat on the benches with the other parents. \u00a0And stayed there, while Joy competently ate by herself and drank her drink and hung out uncomplainingly!\n\nWhile I sat, a gregarious dad with a German accent served me cake, and then asked me if that blonde girl in the green shirt was my daughter. \u00a0\"Yes,\" I said, preparing for the usual autism-solidarity conversation: is she on the spectrum, I have a close relative who is, etc. \u00a0\"She looks so much like my niece!\" was what I heard instead. \u00a0\"I did a double-take, she could almost be her twin!\" \u00a0JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KID. \u00a0No disability-related content to the conversation AT ALL. \u00a0I can hardly remember the last time I had a conversation with a stranger about my daughter that went that way.\n\nAnd then we had another party the next night, for a classmate of Joy's, who also has an older sister who's a friend of Rose. \u00a0This one was at a gymnastics-sort of facility, with crash pads and climbing ropes and play structures and swingsets and free arcade games like air hockey and basketball.\n\nJoy shot hoops with glee, over and over.\u00a0\u00a0Look at her go!\n\n\n\n\nAmong the guests were classmates both past and present, who are happy to interact with Joy but also to give her the space she needs. \u00a0Then crowning delight came when we learned that the birthday girl's mom had assembled a special goody-bag just for Joy, full of stimmy-delights instead of the pencils and Blow-Pops that interest her so little.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Thankgivings are hardly enough. \u00a0We are grateful beyond words to see our daughters grow and mature and move forward.\n\nMay your own celebrations of gratitude be plentiful and delightful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9oR51rYqy5M/UK5hlGDWl5I/AAAAAAAABGE/FP6iVcuss6I/s1600/2012-11-hoops.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j4yWgXLrco4/UK5hwwLaRtI/AAAAAAAABGM/h3ILLWLKqDk/s1600/2012-11-goodybag.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hhPwxK3U0lI/UK5h4TRuH2I/AAAAAAAABGU/CAysbyvO3Wo/s1600/2012-11-turkeys.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2012/11/thanksgivings.html", "title": "\nThanksgivings\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "body": "\nYou won't hear about it in the national news, because they didn't care to cover it.  Not a single national news truck was there; the only national news figure was Ed Schultz, and he was there to march with the firefighters (though I'm sure he'll report on it in his Monday show.)\n\nBesides, there was no riot.  In fact, there wasn't a single arrest.\n\nSomewhere between 25,000 and 40,000 protesters converged on downtown Madison Saturday to fill the Capitol Square -- and the Capitol Building -- with a determined reprise of our gatherings this past February.\n\nThe occasion was this week's launch of the signature-gathering drive to recall Governor Scott Walker, who bulldozed into office this past January with a secret agenda, heavily-funded by ultra-wealthy out-of-state corporate string-pullers.\n\nThat secret agenda has since marched forward in lock step with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), that secretive organization where corporate representatives and Republican state legislators get together to write legislation to the benefit of the corporations.  Then the legislators take the agreed-upon texts back to their states and we get waves of cookie-cutter efforts at:\nprivatization of activities funded by tax dollars, such as education and health care -- corporate profiteers want those lovely other-people's-tax-dollars to redound to their own benefit, while paying as little as possible in taxes themselves\nconsolidation of political power -- union-busting is a two-fer, as they get workers disempowered both on the job and in the political sphere.  But power-grab is also at the heart of the Voter ID laws, which seek to disenfranchise groups that tend to vote Democratic: African-Americans, the poor, people with disabilities.\nrolling back environmental protections -- after all, what corporation wants to pay for that sort of stuff?\ntax cuts for the wealthy and -- of course -- corporations.\n\nALEC's secret database of agreed-upon cookie-cutter legislation was laid bare this summer by the Madison-based Center for Media and Democracy, at the ALEC Exposed web site.  The legislation templates are no longer secret -- it's no use to deny the extent to which this legislative assault on the average American (the 99%, if you well) is coming directly from the corporate string-pullers via ALEC.\n\nI've had rather a dry spell of political writing since the summer senatorial recalls here in Wisconsin.  That long, exhausting effort did not manage to change the majority in the Wisconsin State Senate, though we flipped two seats such that the Republican majority is a single vote, 17-16.  The slightly-swingy nature of that single vote majority has at least curbed a few of the worst proposed excesses, but isn't enough protection against the overall Walker juggernaut.\n\nSince the summer recalls, the Medicaid slashing that I wrote so much about in February has rolled forward toward predictable devastation.  The Wisconsin budget bill set the terms -- over $500 million in cuts, to be specified later, and the the full legislature wouldn't vote on the specifics of the cuts even if they went against current law.  Those cuts have now been specified and voted in by the Joint Finance Committee, along party lines of course.  The proposal agreed to by the JFC is projected to result in nearly 65,000 people losing Medicaid coverage, due to things like changed eligibility or income limits, or higher premiums, or if their employer offers insurance (even if it's expensive and crappy and they can't afford it -- I'm looking at YOU, WalMart.)  To go into effect, though, the plan needs to get approved for an exemption/waiver by the feds, because it falls afoul of some current federal requirements.  If that approval is not forthcoming by December 31 -- an entirely arbitrary, self-imposed deadline -- they'll implement instead a plan that kicks off a different 53,000 people.\n\nIt didn't have to be this way.  There was an alternate state budget proposal, called the Wisconsin Values Budget, that called for a much narrower Medicaid cut.  And as an alternative to the proposal passed by the JFC, a Madison organization called ABC for Health proposed an alternative called the Pathway Plan for 2012, seeking a sustainable solution that actually expands the health-care safety net instead of devastating it.\n\nContrary to my initial personal fears, Joy's current services have remained largely unscathed.  Her funding through the Children's Long-Term Support waiver has been frozen at current spending levels but not reduced; her Katie Beckett MA funds that cover diapers and co-pays were not cut either.  The two-year freeze on enrolling new participants in the Family Care long-term care program may have an impact on her future, but whatever is up with that reality when she needs it is a long ways down the road for her.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I had no reason to take Joy and testify at a Medicaid hearing at the Capitol the other Thursday.  (The Joint Finance Committee declined to hold a public hearing, so the only option was to testify before sympathetic Democrats who aren't \"in power\" right now.)  On the one hand, I didn't have personal testimony of impending healthcare disaster.  On the other, \"then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me...\"  In addition, I could bear witness as a member of my congregation, who have signed on as members of the Save BadgerCare Coalition (yes, we can do that -- it's issue-based, not party- or candidate-affiliated.)  So I spoke my opposition, with my daughter on my lap.\n\nAnd on Saturday, our whole family took to the streets with tens of thousands of our closest friends!\n\nThis was Joy's biggest rally so far.  It wasn't until after the largest of the protests in February that we figured out a routine to get Joy downtown with her jogging stroller to protest and lobby.  Now we're old pros, and so was she.  We drove from our house right up to the edge of the rally within minutes, finding free parking just a couple of blocks off the Square!  Then into the jogging stroller with Joy, and off we went, well prepared with stimmy-toys and snacks and Kleenex, along with food-drive donations (\"Can\" Walker!) and protest signs and camera.  And warm clothes, of course.  Would it be a Wisconsin protest without coat and mittens?\n\nI had already signed the recall papers on November 15 (Day 1) for both Walker and Lt. Gov. Kleefisch -- if we don't recall them both, there's the possibility that Walker could resign before the election and Kleefisch would move up.  Can't let that happen!  However, JoyDad hadn't signed yet, and was looking forward to the opportunity.  Lo and behold, there were signature gatherers right at the corner of the Square, so we could take care of that crucial business immediately.\n\nThen it was off to circle the Square with the marchers, and revel in the energy and creativity.  For example, we made sure to be on the State Street corner at 12:30 to catch the flashmob dance to \"Forget You\"  (I see you causin' lots of trouble in the state I love, and I'm like, FORGET YOU!)\n\n\n\nThen there were the signs, from the familiar...\n\nto the artistic ...\n\n... to the potty-humor!\n\nMy sign had two sides.  I've gotten so experienced at hand-lettering, I don't even need to draft in pencil anymore!\n\n\nAnd then there was Rose's sign:\n\nJoy didn't carry a sign, but she did carry the whole event off with class.  The entire hour and a half we were out there, she rode uncomplainingly, playing with Mardi Gras beads or pine needles and observing all the ruckus.  The few times she tried to reach for someone's long hair or beaded fringe, folks were gracious.\n\nThe highlight of the event for Joy was encountering one of her favorite school staffers, along with two of last year's staff.  You should have seen her face light up!  And then she wanted to go right into playing some of their favorite games.  Just a delight to see Joy welcome someone out of context and bring the context right along for the ride.\n\nOverall, it was a remarkably satisfying event.  And when we got home, we learned there'd been an announcement at the rally:  from Tuesday to Friday, 105,000 recall signatures had been turned in, out of the 540-some thousand needed (though we'll be collecting 700,000 or more to have a cushion.)  That's in just four days of the 60-day window, and that's without a weekend!\n\nI think we're going to make this recall happen, and I can hardly wait.  Recall Walker!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://alecexposed.org/wiki/ALEC_Exposed", "http://citizenactionwi.org/healthcare/alt-budget-2011.html", "http://www.safetyweb.org/healthwatchwi/PathwayPlan2012.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came%E2%80%A6", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bh_M9ZrRIdA/TssGbVmTHUI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/XsRqc4ddjng/s1600/2011-11-stand.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q70hJ9iitwY/TssGkuQzLcI/AAAAAAAAA6c/WGgqRhqUIg8/s1600/2011-11-occupy.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SBdCqDQuzGg/TssGwF7l0CI/AAAAAAAAA6o/0sJ1ofRUeEc/s1600/2011-11-royalflush.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jAm7HUKjM-8/TssG3QZFEUI/AAAAAAAAA60/cwuGz93Zxfo/s1600/2011-11-halfthereasons.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jHDiJ8lHcgU/TssG8cObZDI/AAAAAAAAA7A/8zBNdpODzGI/s1600/2011-11-resist.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1WqUHpdyVko/TssHlrMcjZI/AAAAAAAAA7M/6gyr17R__Fw/s1600/2011-11-recall.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/11/recall-walker.html", "title": "\nRecall Walker!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 22, 2011", "body": "\nI had the occasion to go through some old e-mail earlier this summer, from around the time of Joy's autism diagnosis at the end of 2006.  The diagnosis was not what we'd been expecting, though we'd visited a developmentalist who is a recognized autism expert.  The post-diagnosis e-mail conversations with daycare & birth-to-three providers reminded me of one of the painful eye-openers from the evaluation appointment.  Since (as my regular readers know) I like to look on the bright side, I was wanting to make sure the doctor saw what Joy could do if we gave her just a little help.  But for evaluation purposes, the doctor needed to see everything that Joy could not do when all our little helpfulnesses were taken away.  So we had to back off, and take a good hard look at what happened when Joy was on her own in unfamiliar territory with an unfamiliar doc being asked to do unfamiliar things with no intercession from us.  It wasn't an easy thing to witness.\n\nWe'd been accommodating like crazy, without quite realizing the extent of it.\n\nAnd guess what?  We still accommodate like crazy, probably on auto-pilot too often still, though I like to think that we have a better framework for evaluating what's getting in the way.  Accommodation is a balance, with immense positives for doing it right, and negatives (as with just about anything) for going overboard.\n\nOf course, with any kid, you can't always be doing everything for them or they'll never learn to do things by themselves.  Joy's no exception.  But with Joy, and with autism in the picture, we have to figure out what we do need to do for her, and how to arrange her surroundings and our schedules, just to make things even possible.\n\nOur backyard setup is one example that's been on my mind lately.  Back at the beginning of this blog, we enclosed our large backyard in a lovely tall wooden fence, so Joy couldn't dash away into danger outside our yard.  Immediately our stress level during outside play went down!  We no longer had to hover on high alert lest Joy should suddenly dash and we'd need to spring into full dash ourselves to keep up & catch up.\n\nThis summer, unfortunately, there's been some stressful dashing within the yard, with Joy determined to acquire and CONSUME things she really shouldn't.  One example has been our huge old 30-foot apple tree, which loads up with apples every other year.  This was the year! and, not only does it load up, it drops them on the ground.  And Joy has an insatiable desire to eat these luscious windfalls, no matter how full of rot and worms and ants they may get after sitting on the ground for a while.  So I've spent hours collecting rotten windfalls and carting them to the compost pile at the back of the yard, often trying to get out in the early morning to take care of the overnight mess before Joy gets out of bed -- because once I'm on my own with her and we're in the yard, I can't move fast enough to clean up one apple before she gets the next one.  Fortunately, apple season does eventually come to an end.  We keep thinking the tree has dropped its LAST apple.  Maybe the one-more it dropped yesterday will be it?\n\nThen there's been a little stand of ferns and other shade-plants that grows up under the cherry trees in the middle of the back yard, that we affectionately call \"the jungle.\"  The little fronds on the ferns have been irresistable to Joy as well.  She hovers by the plants (a mosquito-haven with all that greenery and shade), fondles and picks the fronds, carries them around -- and then, quicker than lightning, into the mouth they go.  Bleah!  We found ourselves having to cut yard-play short because Joy would get so fixated on picking and eating the ferns.  Eventually Rose and I went the full-accommodation route.  We cut down the jungle on Friday evening.  Though it no longer provides a haven for the wild bunnies that Joy loves to chase around the yard, at least the fern issue is gone.  Joy lost interest immediately, hurrah!\n\nShould we have tried to teach her just to stay away from the apples and the ferns?  Maybe.  But what was happening instead was that the yard was becoming a non-livable place -- which, now that we've started having some gloriously comfortable weather, would be a crying shame.\n\nIt would also be too bad not to get full use out of this:\n\n\nThree cheers to JoyDad for making this delightful belated-birthday present happen!  Neither he nor I have a particular bent toward construction projects, so it's a step out of the comfort zone to do something like this.  But we've got neighborhood friends who did this project in their own yard a few years ago, and the dad volunteered both his experience and his powertools to set up a temporary woodshop in our garage.  JoyDad acquired the swingset kit and the lumber, and with two other helpers (one from his band, one from church) they got the swingset knocked together all of a Saturday morning.  Then we re-assembled that evening for a barbecue & kiddie pool and swingset play.\n\nJoy wasn't in a mood to come out and swing and reward the laborers for their work the minute it was done.  But we've had hours of swinging since then -- and it has become much easier without the temptations to go dashing off for a snack of apple or fern between swingings.\n\nThis hasn't been an easy summer, on the whole.  It's the first year we've had the situation that both kids have been in school, so both kids need new summer care -- previous years, Joy had year-round daycare and we sent Rose to summer day-camp-care.  But day-camp-care that works for Rose won't work for Joy... so we went the sitter route.  Two days of sitter, two and a half days of JoyMama, half a day of JoyDad per week.  Quite a lot more direct Joy-care than we had during the school year!  On top of that, we've been doing a home-based therapy schedule where we've had two-hour sessions 4 nights a week, plus one on Saturday morning.  But then our provider changed policies, such that they'd no longer offer in-home services to families like ours... existing home-based line therapists were grandfathered in, but they wouldn't train anyone else to work at home.  So the one line therapists who did 3 nights with us moved out of town mid-summer, and the clinic doesn't do evening hours in the summer, so that's three more evenings we're on-duty now.  Then our remaining therapist gave notice, and we'll have to start with someone new in clinic when the school year starts.\n\nI'm apprehensive about the upcoming school year.  Long-time readers may remember the traumatic transition into kindergarten last year.  The one saving-grace anchor was the familiar evening therapy routine that Joy could come home to... an anchor that has now been cut loose.  We know that she'll have a different case manager at school, new teacher of course, and we don't yet know if she'll have ANY familiar staff, though we're hoping.  We're getting a lot less prep-meeting time than we got last year too.\n\nAnd we've had some rough behaviors ramping up as the summer wanes, probably due in some part to the fact that it's SO MUCH me & JoyDad on duty lately.  We're feeling stretched thin, holding things together with duct-tape-and-string.  (I can hardly imagine what it would be to have only one parent to do it all, for whatever reason.)\n\nSo we continue to accommodate what we can, hoping we can find a better balance once we get through whatever transition issues will be upon us with the start of September.  I might even be able to blog more often, but the ongoing activity on the blog will have to be part of what I consider as the balance becomes (hopefully) less duct-tape-and-string and more deliberate.\n\nThink good thoughts for us and Joy!\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9WAsnW1kALE/TlI6CtIFlvI/AAAAAAAAA40/sc4ZehIkP0E/s1600/2011-09-swingset.jpg", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/duct-tape-and-string/", "http://rhemashope.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/held/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/08/accommodation.html", "title": "\nAccommodation\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 8, 2010", "body": "\nIn honor of the LEND program from which I just graduated yesterday (!!), I've got one more seminar topic to pay forward.So for quite a few years, the vegetable peeler of choice in my kitchen has been the Good Grips peeler from OXO.  It's got a comfy wide handle, it's sharp as the dickens, and it slices off a nice thin reliable peel every time.  Been using it for years.What I didn't know until recently was that this product was originally designed to make vegetable-peeling more comfortable for people with arthritis -- as well as everyone else.  Now, if they'd viewed and advertised it solely for the arthritis market, it would have been a tiny little adaptive niche item, sold in special needs catalogs, nobody who didn't have arthritis would have thought to buy it and even those who did would be aware of a certain stigma of using such an item (\"sigh, it's a great product but it just makes me feel so old!\")  But that's not what they did.  They had the foresight to realize and capitalize on the fact that what was good for arthritis in this product would be good for a whole lot of people, with or without vegetable peeling challenges -- and they've got a whole line of highly popular kitchen utensils now.The Good Grips peeler is a fine example of Universal Design.Universal Design is defined as \"the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.\"  The concept rests on seven principles, which are spelled out in detail at the Center for Universal Design at NC State University.  I'm going to list just the principles and their basic definitions here:Principle One: Equitable Use -- The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. Principle Two: Flexibility in Use -- The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. Principle Three: Simple and Intuitive -- Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. Principle Four: Perceptible Information -- The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.Principle Five: Tolerance for Error -- The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. Principle Six: Low Physical Effort -- The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. Principle Seven: Size and Space for Approach and Use -- Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.We had some interesting small-group work in the seminar, each table of students analyzing a group of products that were placed on our table, and then making forays through the building to critique design issues from the perspective of case-study scenarios -- if you were a person with certain challenges and needed to do a certain daily-living sequence of tasks in the building, how does the current setup help or hinder?It made me think of some everyday products and some recent experiences with Joy.Consider these two battery-powered toothbrushes:The Dora-toothbrush on the left, from Colgate, is the first one we tried when we decided to try the battery-powered toothbrush thing with Joy.  It was a good success.  She can turn it on and off herself with minimal support (the pink buttons just above Dora's head), and likes the feel of it in her mouth.However, eventually it wore out, and when I went to get another one (I think I'd forgotten which store I'd gone to), the Colgate/Dora one wasn't there.  So I grabbed the one on the right, the Little Mermaid from Oral B.Not a good move.  Not only was the toothbrush kind of ugly -- the lithe form of the Little Mermaid doesn't lend itself well to wrapping around batteries!  Look at the on/off switches -- the on switch is right between her clam-shell bikini, while the lower button approaches her maiden-bits.  Why didn't the designer dude (it HAD to have been a guy) just put the on-off switches horizontally, press the right clamshell for on and the left for off -- but I digress.  More importantly, the buttons were hard to push.  Joy couldn't summon that extra force, and got very frustrated with it.  In addition, the bristle-movement was more extreme, and if you didn't get the brush into your mouth right away (and Joy's not that fast with it), it would fling little bits of toothpaste around.Big universal-design fail on the \"low physical effort\" principle, plus being ugly and kinda demeaning.  We went back out and sought Dora in particular.  Accept no substitutes.Here's another example from our everyday life -- the door handles of our two vehicles.Our Honda CR-V, which we've had for 10 years now:Joy cannot yet operate this handle.  It takes a pretty sturdy pull, and you pretty much have to wrap your hand around the handle to do it. (Principle 6, low effort).  It also doesn't pull straight out, but pivots such that the right side stays in place and it's really the left side that you're pulling out (Principle 3, intuitive).Fortunately things are better from the inside, when it comes to pulling the door shut:Look at that nice long snaky handle, with multiple places and heights to grab and pull.  You could even use that holder-space lower down as a place to pull if that were more comfortable for you.  (Since we have the child-lock on at all times, the door-open handle from the inside doesn't enter our calculations at this point).  Joy does well at pulling the door closed, though it's kind of a heavy door and does take some effort.Then we have our new car, the Honda Fit that we got just about a year ago.  With this car, Joy can let herself in.The handle pulls up, pivoting along the entire top length, with a minimum of effort. As long as you get your fingertips under, you don't have to wrap your hand or anything.But oh no, what did they do to the inside?There's only one little place to put your hand and pull.  And it's only at one height, which isn't a good height for Joy because she's buckled into a car-seat by the time she needs to close that door.  Fortunately she can do it if she stretches.  And the door pulls easily, which is a plus.  But why couldn't they have provided options, like the long snaky inside pull-bar did in the CR-V?  (Principle 2: Flexibility in Use.)I want to leave you with one final statement here, something that one of my LEND-trainee colleagues quoted in his final Leadership Presentation the other week.  The quote applies to systems of health care, and it struck me as really thought-provoking, implying the applicability of universal design for systems well beyond toothbrushes and veggie peelers and car door handles:Delivery models that work for populations with special health care needs will have applicability for everyone.It's not just about what's good for special needs.  It's about what's good for ALL of us.  Universally.To all my readers -- thank you for providing a sounding board and the opportunity for me to reflect on this year's LEND experience.  This has really been a pivotal year for me in moving toward what I want to be when I grow up!  :-)  The journey continues, and it's so good to have so many people sharing that journey with me.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.oxo.com/about_howwe_peeler.jsp", "http://www.oxo.com/about_howwe_peeler.jsp", "http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprincipleshtmlformat.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S-VJUw8zO8I/AAAAAAAAAfo/65qBY1U7LVU/s1600/toothbrushes.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S-VJgf13taI/AAAAAAAAAfw/MpBt3QTeid4/s1600/toothbrush-joy.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S-VLq-DtfBI/AAAAAAAAAf4/JeHsgtgXewU/s1600/cardoor-crv-outside.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S-VMeweV3CI/AAAAAAAAAgA/9tbEdjpHXjQ/s1600/cardoor-crv-inside.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S-VNE2r_thI/AAAAAAAAAgI/KLwmtuMjY8Y/s1600/cardoor-fit-outside.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S-VNrjjTWRI/AAAAAAAAAgQ/5B21qLIqq0o/s1600/cardoor-fit-inside.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/05/product-hits-and-misses-universal.html", "title": "\nProduct Hits and Misses: Universal Design Edition\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 8, 2010", "body": "\nA couple of posts back, I promised a reflection on Joy's sixth birthday party, a gathering that took place on May 23.We've fallen into something of a pattern for these birthday parties, inviting families from church and the neighborhood and school, with kids both Joy's age and Rose's age.The weather cooperated for playing out in the backyard, unlike last year (which was rainy and cold, to the point that we barely got out onto the deck).  It was unusually warm, summery warm!  Almost too warm for the bouncy castle, which heats up fast in the sun.We had a fine turnout, and the kids were soon running all over the back yard and playing, and riding Joy's new and old trikes up and down the driveway.The only one who wasn't having much fun... was Joy.  She tolerated it OK, but all she really wanted to do was play with her mylar balloon and watch her videos.Even the present-opening wasn't a thrill.  Oh, she tolerated that too, and pulled on the paper and got them open.  But when we looked at the photos JoyDad had taken of that part of the party, there wasn't a single smile on her face.  (Though the presents were well-chosen and she's been playing happily with them since.)Even our own big present, the big kid tricycle, we managed to bungle somewhat.  After the party-preparations were in place but before the guests arrived, we decided it would be a good moment for the tricycle presentation.  So we all trooped out the back door and I went to the back of the garage where the trike was hidden, to bring it out and surprise her as she got to the driveway.  Unfortunately, the family trooping out to the garage made Joy think she was going to get a car ride, something she loves to do.  She was terribly disappointed that no car ride was forthcoming, and wouldn't even look at the trike as she expressed her displeasure.Basically, the party worked for everyone but the person it was ostensibly celebrating.  Not that it was a train wreck, it just wasn't much fun for our six-year-old.Next year I hope to do better.  One thought would be a series of birthday playdates, such that we could involve the friends but make it less a crowd situation.  (And there will be new people in the circle; we'll need to work explicitly on involving kindergarten classmates, I think.)  Another thought would be a pool party at a local motel, something that was a good success for some friends of ours a couple of years ago.It's good to see possibilities for learning and growth, for Joy's parents as well as for Joy.  Happy birthday, Joy, and here's to the upcoming year!\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/TA4mZdjsu-I/AAAAAAAAAjg/4-XaoXODmKY/s1600/sixth-birthday.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/06/point-of-party.html", "title": "\nThe Point of a Party\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, February 14, 2010", "body": "\nThere's a joke I've heard a number of times on the skeptic blogs that I frequent:Q: What do you call alternative medicine that's been proven to work?A: Medicine!We've been talking a lot on my LEND seminar about evidence-based practices. There's a hierarchy of evidence types, from the randomized controlled trials at the strong end to anecdotal reports at the waaaay weak end.For good or ill, however, people don't automatically tend to weigh evidence in this way. Human beings are story-tellers and story-experiencers. The weakest evidence in the chain, the personal testimony, is often what pulls the deep visceral reaction for us. I had just such a conversation at a party (of all places) yesterday afternoon, with a paramedic who is hesitant to have a back surgery that is statistically quite likely to give him good relief. But, he knows too many people who have had bad experiences with similar surgeries. I shared with him in return my refusal to have a \"routine\" amniocentesis with Joy's pregnancy at the age of 36, primarily because I had a former colleague who lost a healthy 20-week pregnancy to a routine amnio gone awry.Now, those are both examples of refusing medically-recommended procedures. Things get just as tricky or more so on the other side, when medicine doesn't have much to recommend and alternatives step into the gap. As I said a week ago in my post on the \"cure question\":When people (parents) are desperate for a cure, and science doesn't have it, the door opens wide for uncontrolled experimentation. And quackery, alas.I expanded further in a comment on a post from Barbara at Therextras, as we continue our bloggy cross-pollination:I'm thinking now about the whole issue of parents -- like me -- touting \"what worked for my child.\" All of us have to make those judgments, to decide whether a treatment is working, and if it's worth it to continue something we've started. And then, very secondarily, to what extent we want to recommend it to others. It does feel good to share good news, and to offer the positive benefit of experience. I love blogging about what works.And yet, and yet... every one of us is mightily prone to seeing what we want to see. That's just human nature: we've made a certain investment in whatever treatment/intervention, and the whole point is that we want our kids to do better. And hence, alas, parent reports of \"X worked for my child\" don't get to count as scientific evidence. Maybe X did work, but maybe something else was at work too, or instead (passage of time? Some other factor?) or maybe an impartial observer wouldn't be able to document what I as a parent am perceiving?Alternative treatments thrive on the personal narrative. They offer testimonies of hope. But they don't get to enter the realm of \"medicine\" without a certain level of research base, and that research has to support the intervention!On Friday my LEND class had the opportunity to sink our teeth into some alternative treatments, in the form of presentations by fellow students. We were each assigned a non-standard intervention on which to speak for 10 minutes. Here was the first half of the lineup (the second half will be presented on the 26th):Full inclusionSensory integration therapyFacilitated communicationWilbarger brushing protocolChelationSecretinInteresting list, huh?Here are the objectives for the assignment:Become familiar with the claims of several non-standard interventions commonly used with children who have neurodevelopmental disabilities.Learn what questions to ask in order to evaluate these claims.The presentations are to address:What exactly is the claim made by this intervention?  For whom is it intended?Is the claim consistent with current knowledge, i.e., does the rationale for its claimed effectiveness make sense in terms of already existing scientific knowledge?What is the evidence base for this intervention?Have results been described in peer-reviewed journals, or only the lay press?Are there any known risks for using this therapy?Have alternative hypotheses been considered?Are there position statements regarding this therapy, issued by any professional organizations?  Does your professional organization have a position statement on it?  Are there conflicts of interest for those evaluating the claims?Are personal attacks being made against those who question the claims?How widely used is the intervention?How much does it cost in time, energy, and money, for families?What is the attraction for families to try this therapy?One of the presentations included a factoid claiming that up to 74% of families try alternative options for treating children with autism. Given how few truly evidence-based options there are, I'm actually surprised the number isn't higher -- I suppose it also depends on what you class as \"alternative.\" In just the list above, we've done two: brushing and sensory integration. The brushing was a total bust... and I learned from the presentation that it really wasn't indicated for Joy in the first place, since it's aimed at sensory defensiveness and Joy is a sensory seeker, pretty much across the board. The sensory integration, however, is an ongoing part of our journey.Anyway. Just as there are heirarchies in evidence quality, I'd say there's a hierarchy in the respectability of the interventions we saw presented. Sensory integration has wide acceptance in the profession of occupational therapy, and makes a certain amount of scientific sense, though the evidence base is not particularly  strong (yet?). It was a interesting exercise for the two students, both OTs in training, who got assigned that topic, to examine it in terms of an \"alternative\" intervention. The Wilbarger brushing protocol, which aims to alleviate sensory defensiveness, involves a pattern of stroking the person's body with a surgical brush every two hours, done with just the right pressure and just the right pattern.  The OT student who presented on the brushing protocol has one of the protocol's inventors as a professor!  Brushing relies on sensory integration for a theoretical background, but is a little further down the \"makes sense\" chain and is unfortunately susceptible to the allegation that if it didn't work, the practitioner (which ends up being parents) must not have done it right.On the even-less-well-supported end were secretin, chelation, and facilitated communication (FC). FC is a method whereby a person who is unable to communicate verbally or type by themselves is assisted by a facilitator who helps support their hand as they point or type. The speech therapists presenting on FC were in the opposite boat as the OTs presenting on sensory integration: their profession is highly critical of FC and has formal statements cautioning about its use.  There are multiple studies discrediting FC, apparently quite an easy discredit to achieve: you show an object to the person but not to the facilitator, and then see if the person can \"tell\" you what they saw. In far too many cases, they simply can't. Unless the facilitator sees it too. Meanwhile, secretin (a hormone involved in digestion) was at one point claimed to ameliorate autism in up to 80% of patients. There are now upwards of 30 studies failing to show any benefits, though die-hard secretin proponents have criticisms of every such study.Chelation is not just more weakly supported by science as an autism treatment, it has been implicated in at least one treatment death as well.  It works for its intended purpose, which involves pulling heavy metals out of the body in cases of heavy metal poisoning.  The hypothesis behind its use for autism is that autism is a heavy-metal poisoning issue, with the culprit being the ethyl-mercury found in thimerosal, formerly used as a preservative in childhood vaccines.  However, this hypothesis has been powerfully discredited both by research and by the fact that thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines beginning in the early 2000s -- and the autism rate has not dropped.  (Again, the proponents do not accept this discrediting, often viewing it through conspiracy-theory lenses.)The full-inclusion topic was a little surprising to me, and I'm still not entirely clear on it. If I understood correctly, the \"alternative\" version of full inclusion argues that if you have properly-trained teachers, children with special needs ought to be able to be productively mainstreamed without a separate curriculum or extra teachers.  Since I didn't get a clearer picture than that, I'm not going to expound further.I was struck by the tone of the presentations, very matter-of-fact and respectful (and not in the sense of one of my favorite skeptical blogs, Respectful Insolence!)  All of the presenters so far were practitioners in training, no family members yet.  And practitioners have to walk the tightrope of not pushing families away, not alienating people who might otherwise hide the fact that they're trying alternatives -- which leaves the practitioner without important knowledge as they try to offer the family the best from their own fields.I'm still finding that balance for myself.  I guess my tendency is to be a little more Judge-y McJudgerson... it's frustrating to see people being (as I see it) taken in and wasting time & money & energy on things that may range from futile to dangerous, and then (sometimes) giving other families pressure and grief for choosing NOT to try. I guess I'll have to make some choices, bloggy and otherwise.  Next choice will be how to comport myself when I present on the 26th, with two other trainees, on the gluten-free / casein-free (GFCF) diet for autism.  Also up that day: hippotherapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and more!

{"date": "Thursday, November 19, 2009", "body": "\nDental issues and autism spectrum issues are a touchy combination.When I put \"dentist\" into the search box in my Google Reader, searching the autism-related blogs that I regularly follow, I get over 100 hits.  Some are nightmare-ish.  Many tell tales of hard-won gains, works in progress, dentist experiences that have -- over time -- become productive and tolerable.I've not written about Joy & the dentist before, partly because our challenges are significantly less than some.  Her sensory needs generally swing sensory-SEEKING, so we don't have that incredible mountain of sensory defensiveness to climb.  She generally lets us brush her teeth pretty well twice a day with a battery-powered toothbrush, and does a bit of brushing herself after we're done.Even so, she doesn't like going to the dentist.  Who does, really?  Well, Rose maybe.  She loves our dentist.  But I digress.  Upshot is, dental visits with Joy are not easy.But.The pediatric dental clinic where we take our girls is simply awesome.They help us troubleshoot.  Last visit, they came up with the suggestion of using a lead-apron as a weighted blanket to help Joy feel \"hugged\" during the cleaning.  It worked well, I was all primed to ask for it this time around... and when we walked into the exam room, the apron was already lying on the table waiting for us.They speak softly and smilingly and encouragingly to Joy.  I think they really like her!  They don't remind us or hold it over our head that she has bitten and broken dental mirrors in the past!  This visit I had randomly snagged one of Joy's Grabber XT chewies to help keep her centered and entertained; the hygienist immediately noticed and suggested that we have Joy use the chewy to help keep her mouth open -- they'll clean while she chomps the chewy.They sing to her, both the hygienist and the dentist.  It's an amazingly calming strategy.They're open to suggestions.  When Rose had a filling done, I discovered that the rooms they use for fillings have video screens.  This visit I realized that the regular exam rooms don't have that feature -- and I asked if we could have a video room for Joy's next regular cleaning.  They were entirely cool with that.  I bet they'll have it written down and I won't even have to ask when we go back in May.The dentist was fine working without the bright overhead dental-light, when it became clear that Joy wasn't going to tolerate it.Thank you so much, wonderful pediatric dentist and staff!  Worth your weight in gold fillings!=======UPDATE: Here's an opportunity for dentists who need to learn to provide service to patients with autism... a free webinar, Fri. Dec. 4 from 10-11 EST, \"Patients with Autism: Awareness, Communication and Legal Strategies\".  From the Michigan Oral Health Coalition.  I don't know what's up with the \"legal strategies\" bit.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2009", "body": "\nHome then to the laden table;Ham and goose and pints of beer,Whisky handed 'round in tumblers,Christmas comes but once a year!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -- Christmas in CarrickEinmal ist keinmal.  What happens but once might as well not have happened at all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -- German saying, quoted in The Unbearable Lightness of Being We decorated our Christmas tree last week, at Rose's insistence.  Our older daughter has been the nudge for quite a bit of the Christmas preparation that we've done so far, including a gingerbread house (from a kit) that she decorated almost entirely by herself.I wrote about Joy and our tree last time the holiday rolled around.  We trimmed our little fake tree without her assistance in 2008.  My reasoning for doing it that way: I was afraid that she would be confused by being first allowed to touch and decorate the tree, and then having it be off limits for the rest of the season.  We were not at a point last year where she could be trusted not to stim on the branches, or grab the ornaments, or knock the thing over altogether -- though I did have hopes for Christmas 2009!  So the tree went up on the stereo cabinet, substantially out of reach, trimmed with non-shatter ornaments just in case.Well, here we are approaching Christmas 2009.  And Joy is just as perseverative when it comes to ribbons and stringy-things (though not her hair right now, thank goodness!) and perhaps even more mischievous about deliberately getting into things she knows are \"no.\"So the tree is up high again, once more decorated with non-hazardous trimmings.  This year I felt differently about Joy's participation, though.  It's not fair to shut her out from this activity that Rose enjoys so much, and that is such a holiday tradition... surely there could be a way to modify the activity such that it could be at least somewhat successful for her, and not too confusing?Rose and I unpacked the little tree in my bedroom, put on the lights (colored ones this year), and hauled out the ornaments.  I enlisted her help in choosing six ornaments for her sister to do.  They had to be not too heavy, with big enough loops on the holders to be not too challenging to put on -- and the ornaments couldn't be too stimmy-stringy themselves.We found six that fit the bill, and then carried the tree out to the living room, where Joy (supported by her barista) helped put on those six ornaments.  She wasn't in a great mood and didn't really \"get\" it, I think.  But she at least cooperated.  And then the tree went back into the bedroom with me & Rose, and we trimmed it all up the rest of the way, and then carried it directly to its display perch on the stereo cabinet.  Joy is tall enough to reach the lower branches now, a bit of a concern.  I've only caught her in one stealthy reach for the tree, though, and all it took was me saying her name in the \"stern voice\" to get her to back away.One iteration of putting on a few ornaments.When other than on holidays do we ask of Joy that she learn things in ONE annual iteration?At Halloween, for example, her WonderWoman daycare lady Lynda does a great job of setting up a trick-or-treat practice at the daycare.  But it, too, is a one-time shot, and some years it falls on a day we're not there.  So Joy gets maybe one practice, then one shot going out to knock on doors and beg for candy in costume.  And then it's a whole year before we require it of her again.Talk about confusing!Easter baskets?  Once a year.Birthday presents?  Once a year.Trimming the tree?  Once a year.Yet, how does Joy learn routines?  Repetition, repetition, repetition.She's gotten very good at getting into and out of her seat in the car, and helping to close the car door.  We do that daily.She has learned to use fork and spoon, and is making progress at drinking from an open cup.  Meals come three times a day, with two snacks.She is learning to turn noisy-toys on so that she can use them.  We enabled this with a full-court press, communicating to her entire school team and autism-therapy team that toy-turning-on was a priority.  It didn't take her long under those conditions to get the hang of it.Einmal ist keinmal.  If you're only going to do something once with Joy, perhaps you almost may as well not bother.  One iteration is not enough to stick.It's been different with Rose, of course.  We've seen a steady progression from one year to the next of these once-annual rituals.  At Thanksgiving she's gone from stirring the pumpkin pie filling, to dumping in the measured ingredients, to learning to crack eggs, to (this year) actually learning to crimp the edges of the homemade crust!On the other hand, Rose hasn't learned it all in one shot either.  It does take at least the annual repetition.For Joy, maybe we need to think about it as a different timeline, a different number of repeats.Of course, I don't really believe that einmal ist keinmal in a philosophical sense.  Just look at what we're about to celebrate, the singular, holy miracle of God-with-us, Emanuel.  Once and for all...Then again, I think we need the annual celebration too.  We need to remind ourselves anew, experience the wonder once more and yet once more, coming back to the story again and again.I still don't have a sense of how to communicate that meaning of Christmas to my younger daughter.But I do think that perhaps next year, I might figure out how to set up a practice-tree elsewhere in the house that is Joy's alone, with ornaments selected just for her, that she can hang again and again.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/Sx5A7jkz-wI/AAAAAAAAAZc/jtLGXQj5D2g/s1600-h/XmasTree09.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comes-but-once-year.html", "title": "\nChristmas Comes but Once a Year\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 7, 2009", "body": "\nSo the semester is now underway, Leadership Trainee-hood and all.My plan is to blog at least once a week on something I've encountered in my MCH-LEND studies.  I figure this will be good for a couple of things -- it will help me distill my thoughts, and will (ideally) let my readers in on some of the benefits of the program.So this week's installment has to do with a brown-bag I attended and a video that JoyDad & I watched.The brown-bag was a report on the Natural Supports Project, an initiative aimed at finding ways for young people -- middle & high school-age -- \"to participate more fully and naturally in school, work, and community activities.\"  While they commented that people who hear \"natural supports\" tend to think of wooden beams or cotton underwear (!), what the project means by natural supports is people.  As in, the people who are around you already, who are naturally a part of your life (i.e. not hired to be there).  The project offered mini-grants throughout the state to schools who created groups where young people, both with disabilities and without, focused on sharing activities and making space for real relationships to blossom.  There are some lovely video clips on the site showing some of the results.  I think for me the most powerful moment of the brownbag was when one of the presenters was describing the focus groups that the project staff held afterwards, interviewing participants about what worked and what didn't.  When participants were asked about what were the barriers to making these groups work well, NOT ONE of them said, \"Well, it would have worked if Sally/Sammy weren't so darn limited.\"  Nobody blamed the disabilities, or the kids who had them!  Wow.Well, I had met both of the presenters prior to the brownbag, and so I went up to talk to them afterwards, and ended up going home with an additional resource that they had plugged during the presentation -- a one-hour documentary on DVD called Including Samuel, by photojournalist Dan Habib.  Habib has two sons, a typically-developing pre-teen and a elementary-schooler with cerebral palsy.  His family's journey so far, and their commitment to include their son in all aspects of life as fully as possible, twines together in the film with the stories of four other families, plus teachers and principals and disability rights activists.  Not everybody in the film has had good inclusion experiences in school-based settings -- \"Inclusion is an easy thing to do poorly,\" one school administrator points out -- but the central message is that full inclusion is something that we, as a society, need to learn to do right.I found myself writing down quote after quote from the video.  Here are a few of them: \"Constantly worrying about Samuel's future isn't the best way to be his parents.\" (Samuel's mom)  -- I hadn't thought about it like that before, but she's right.  So many worries, but when they get too dominant, that's no way to make a life. \"I can't limit him.  Everybody else in life is going to limit him.  I can't do that.\" (Mother of another featured child in the video, a young lad with autism) \"All kids -- with the right supports, the right teaching methods, the right technology, can learn the general education curriculum.\" (This one was either from a teacher or an administrator.)  I'm still chewing on the implications of this.  A beautiful and radical statement.  I want it to be true. \"If we want something smooth and easy, then we're in the wrong business.\"  (A principal) \"The baby boomers aging, they ain't gonna call it disability, they gonna call it 'old,' but they a$$es gonna need a ramp!\"  (Disability activist Keith Jones, on assistive technology) \"Is there any place in society where inclusion already exists, full-blown? and the answer is yes.  It exists within a lot of families.\"  (A principal) \"He will teach a lot of people.  Which is good, because the world has a lot to learn.\"  (Dan Habib, Samuel's father)There's a local screening of the show coming up soon, with a chance to meet the filmmaker, but JoyDad's got a gig that night.  I highly recommend it to my classmates, though!  For those not around here, I bet you can get it on Netflix, or check the list of PBS broadcasts -- it might be on TV in your market this fall.Update 9/11: So this afternoon I came home to a phone message from the school district on my answering machine -- plugging the local showing of Including Samuel & meet-the-filmmaker later this month!  This was a blast phone message that went out to all the school families, something that I generally associate with very important happenings like registration in August.  Wowza!Update 9/12: From the comments: Barbara just alerted me to another post on Including Samuel.  If you'd be willing to host a viewing party of the film for 10 or more attendees, bop on over by Ellen and her blog To the Max before September 20 and leave a comment about inclusion for a chance to win the DVD plus party-hosting materials!  Or just go peruse the post & comments -- lots of perspectives and food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/naturalsupports/index.php", "http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/naturalsupports/video.php", "http://www.includingsamuel.com/", "http://www.includingsamuel.com/television/", "http://lovethatmax.blogspot.com/2009/09/including-kids-with-special-needs-in.html"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/09/world-has-lot-to-learn.html", "title": "\nThe World Has a Lot to Learn\n"},

The first year, we bought a house in pieces-parts.  Took a while to get it properly constructed, and then Rose wanted it to perfectly match the picture in the instructions.  Which meant that mama did all the icing, and Rose would put on the candies.Second year, we got smart and bought a pre-constructed house kit.  Rose actually started piping some of the icing herself, on the less-challenging bits.This year, she designed and piped the whole thing (except for the door which she asked me to do).Well, there was quite a bit of icing left, which got me thinking.  What if I made a smaller house with graham crackers so Joy could do some decorating?Joy wasn't thrilled with the sit-down work, but did a pretty good job of poking some M&Ms at the icing blobs.  Letting go of the candy was a tough part.  But she didn't much seem to mind letting the candies become part of the house, as long as she got to eat a few!Then today -- since einmal ist keinmal -- we did another one.  Rose did the icing blobs...and Joy poked on the candies again, with some guidance.I was delighted at how Joy seemed to realize this time that she needed to let the candy go so it would stick!Then, for a bit more Christmas practice, I set her up to help me stir the peppernut dough:I think we've got some good Christmas practices going here.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SzGDjP4hWoI/AAAAAAAAAaU/2olt-sRbxec/s1600-h/xmas09-ginger.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SzGETBxpndI/AAAAAAAAAac/7-H7SDxvjGk/s1600-h/xmas09-graham1.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SzGE-0x28rI/AAAAAAAAAak/1bhDUsIHHcw/s1600-h/xmas09-rosehands.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SzGFRD6Ps8I/AAAAAAAAAas/5u5S_ucKQmQ/s1600-h/xmas09-joycandy.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SzIDXgMxBgI/AAAAAAAAAa8/2bfV0QOegjo/s1600-h/xmas09-graham3.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/SzGFik4OczI/AAAAAAAAAa0/XH1bYUmIi80/s1600-h/xmas09-joystir.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2009/12/practicing-christmas.html", "title": "\nPracticing Christmas\n"},

Among the novels I took from the pile was Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, by Gregory Maguire.  I had read his Wicked and felt rather take-it-or-leave-it (I haven't seen the musical, how culturally out-of-touch I am sometimes!), but was willing to give him another chance.Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister was ever-so-much-more compelling!First off, I was a sucker for Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring when I read it a couple years ago, set in the city and household of the painter Vermeer in 17th-century Holland.  Confessions places its retelling of the Cinderella story in that milieu and time-frame (well, not Vermeer's house, but definitely the Holland of Vermeer and Rembrandt), such that the household details felt familiar.  So too did the exploration of women as artistic subjects, and as apprentice artists themselves.Maguire goes in deep on the themes of ugliness and beauty and art; on perception and reality and the places where perception fails.  His retelling of the Cinderella story is full of surprises and yet makes perfect sense as to how HIS version might have been twisted into the fairy tale we know today (as if he weren't the one doing the twisting!)So why does this rate an Elvis Sighting?Well, it's the older (ugly) stepsister Ruth.  Most of the book is told from the perspective of the younger (ugly) stepsister Iris, who is clever and thoughtful but pinched and plain in physical appearance.  The older stepsister, when first described, is \"a solid thing, already more than adult size, but simple.  A pendulum of spit swings out and makes a tassel.  Iris reaches and wipes Ruth's mouth.\"Ruth doesn't talk.  Ruth perseverates on a little toy given her by the ethereally-lovely girl who will one day be her (beautiful) stepsister.  \"Is she a changeling?\" the exquisite Clara/Cinderella asks.The word \"autism\" would have been a complete anachronism to 17th-century Holland, and Maguire doesn't make any such diagnosis.  But I heard spectrum echoes.  (Is that perception on my part, or a place where perception fails?)Ruth is essential to the plot.And I must confess... that I can't say any more, because I simply cannot spoiler this book.

Every fall we take a trip to a nearby farm with a pumpkin patch and corn maze and petting zoo, together with the family that gave us the Joy! book.  It's been a delight to look back over the photos across the years and remind ourselves how our girls have grown!This year we had a special guest, my younger brother (Uncle Schnirelmann) who was visiting from out of state for the weekend.The first incident of note at this year's visit was the temporary wristband, to mark that you'd paid your entrance fee.  Last year when we tried to put the wristband on Joy, she wailed and fought and tried to chew it off until we gave in.  This year?  Wore it with zero complaint.  I think it may have something to do with the other bracelet she wears...Once we got inside, Joy wasn't too much interested in the petting zoo, or the pumpkins.  Like Kayla over at Opposite Kids, Joy found the stimmies more interesting than the main attractions -- she preferred to play with bits of straw or cornstalk from the ground rather than petting animals or noticing pumpkins.She did really well with the children's corn maze, though (which featured one obvious main path through):Rose and her friend enjoyed the corn maze as well:The absolute best thing about the pumpkin patch trip, though, was Uncle Schnirelmann.  He and Joy invented a game whereby she would run to him, and he would grab her by the arms and hoist her all the way up his 6-foot-tall frame, to rest her knees on his chest and laugh into each other's faces.  They did this all over the farm...... even in the pumpkin patch itself (much better than scouting for those pesky pumpkins, in a rather picked-over section of the field anyway).We've yet to carve the pumpkins we brought home, but Rose did successfully engineer getting Joy to make a choice among the options that she drew:Joy's hand landed on the one at the lower right, with the eyelashes.  The cutest of the bunch, to be sure, but the most challenging to carve!  I'll post jack-o-lantern pics once we have them.UPDATE: OK, I only just noticed: there's something at least slightly similar in Joy's body position playing the jump-up game with Uncle Schnirelmann, and mine in the sidebar photo leaping off the bridge.

She sure can dash back and forth through the living room, though!I continue to marvel at Joy's physical strength.  As I mentioned in my very first Elvis Sightings post, she has been a powerhouse from the get-go.  Her baby book contains a notation at the ripe old age of two weeks, amazed at how dang strong she was.  At two weeks!One of her favorite \"heavy-work\" games right now is a jumping game, one she requests by coming over and taking both your hands and beginning to bounce.  She wants you to support her jumps by lifting her hands with yours, so that she gets more air with each jump.  If you get a good rhythym going, all forty pounds of her are soon flying high with every leap, coming down with a satisfying \"boom\" on the carpet that must feel so good as it shocks through her frame.She can even run and jump wearing weights!  Her previous OT acquired ankle weights for her and made a weighted vest out of a floaty swim vest, replacing the removable floaty-foam blocks with door hinges (just the right size to fit in the pockets!) and heavy little beanbags.  I don't know how much weight it is, but it's enough to make her notice -- and help her regulate, and focus, and lots of good stuff.  But especially right after she puts it on, when she's still in run-and-jump mode, you should see how she motors, even with all that weight.It brings an image to my mind...I can imagine my girl, grown tall with her hair gone brown like mine did and in a pony-tail, wearing an adult-size weighted vest and ankle weights, jumping up and down beside the track in preparation for her race.  Then she takes the weights off and joins the other runners in the starting blocks.  \"On your mark, get set, GO!\" (oh, and haven't we practiced those words, over and over...)  And Joy takes off, running like the wind.Maybe someday we'll train together, and then she'll leave me in the dust.Me, I don't run like the wind.  Jog slow, like old pony.  But I'm still working on my Couch to 5K training, and can now jog 25 minutes without stopping, at an 11-minute-mile pace.  I've got my eye on a 5K in April that I might actually win!  Yes, you heard that right.  It's called the Poker Run.  How I might win is, they deal you three cards at the start of the race.  Then when you finish, you get two more.  The best hand of 5-card stud \"wins\" the race, no matter the time!Oh, and the race benefits Special Olympics.Whether Joy eventually runs Special Olympics or with the neurotypicals or all on her own, I'll be cheering her every step of the way.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/12/like-wind.html", "title": "\nLike the Wind\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 21, 2008", "body": "\nI should probably call this post \"A Single Goal: or, More Cosmic Convergence.\"Way back in August, Barbara wrote a post at TherExtras that criticized the hodgepodge that often results when too many experts are trying to accomplish too many things with a child:What I don\u2019t commonly see - or have not seen most of 30 years \u2013 are concentrated efforts to learn one skill at a time. I don\u2019t hear or read families that do this. I\u2019ve never seen an IEP that said \u201cthis school year Aloysius will be potty trained\u201d or \u201cEsperanza will learn to feed herself\u201d \u2013 not at the preschool level, not at the kindergarten level, not at the elementary level. How many high school students in special education do you estimate I\u2019ve met who cannot do either toileting or feed themselves without assistance? As I told Barbara at the time, Joy has a standard multi-faceted IEP, chock full of various goal areas for her therapists to address with her.But even before the school year started, I had a conversation with Joy's school-district team leader.  Unprompted, she told me that she had a thought for a single overarching goal for Joy this year, IEP complexity notwithstanding.  That concept was: imitation.Though it was a different angle than the single movement-oriented and task-oriented kind of goal that Barbara presented, there was power in that single simple-yet-not-so-simple idea of imitation.  It has been a useful touchstone throughout the semester so far.So then yesterday morning I once again had the chance to hang out with the incomparable Mama Mara.  We got to talking about our respective blogs and I was musing on some of the posts I'd been meaning to do, and mentioned the single-goal thing.

We almost got to a seizure-free month as April became May, but then had a whopping 7-seizure day to end that happy string.  Then we almost made it through August, but not quite.We almost could have counted September, because the last big seizure that actually interrupted her day was August 31.  But then we heard her seizing in her crib after she went to sleep for the night on September 11.This time, though, it's really official.We baked cupcakes this morning, to take to daycare tomorrow.  (When did cake-mixes boxes stop including instructions for how many strokes to beat by hand?)  Rose cracked the eggs and laid out the cupcake holders in the tins, and Joy did a bit of stirring.I should note that we're quite sure Joy continues to have ongoing subclinical seizures pretty much all the time.  This doesn't mean the seizures have gone away, by any means.Still, it is absolutely fantastic to have had an entire month in which her days have not been interrupted by the big blue-lipper kind of seizure.  Actually, that's been more like a month and a half, since the September 11 one was in her sleep.Woohoo!  Anyone for two months?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2008/10/break-out-fizzy-juice.html", "title": "\nBreak Out the Fizzy Juice!\n"},

It was time to move the medication -- still well within its \"good till\" date -- into the medicine cabinet and not carry it around everywhere.Those days may yet return.

I am back to being able to slow-jog a full 5K.  Emphasis on the slow.JoyDad is running too.  I think the last time we were both doing the running thing was back during my fire-eating, bridge-jumping grad-school days.  Except that now we have to tag-team.  Can't leave the sleeping kids alone in the house and all.Hey, maybe these ARE my fire-eating, bridge-jumping grad-school days again. Y'think?One week from today, Rose goes back to school -- as a second grader.  Woo hoo!Tomorrow, I go to my first day of orientation for my leadership training program.  Woo hoo times two!It took me three tries to pass the Emergency Procedures and Infection Control test that followed the pre-orientation online training module I took this weekend.  I am quite certain that I will never need to know that Security personnel, and not the fire department, are responsible for fire-watch when the sprinkler systems go offline in the university health-care buildings.  But now you know too.  Just in case.Speaking of sprinkler systems -- we're working with Joy on drinking from an open cup.  She likes to put her hand into it to play with the water, and even when she's using it properly, she doesn't always pay enough attention to get the cup put back safely down.  She did great the other day at snack with her barista, though, who commented afterward, \"That was some impressive drinking -- and I mean that in a non-undergraduate sort of way!\"With fall-like weather and school coming on, I sorted clothes for the girls this weekend.  Joy has grown into her sister's old 5Ts.  There's a particularly cute dress I pulled out for her... checked the tag... yep, 5T, good deal... and then I saw the label name.  SPEECHLESS GIRLS.  Must have been made for her!Except that Rose wore the dress in her day.  And on the speech front, my girls are like matter and anti-matter.Except that I had them on the same tire-swing last night.  And it didn't cause a universe-ending, matter/anti-matter collision.  I swung 'em high, totally whipped that swing in circles.  The grins were immense.Both my ladies continue to be loving the Food Network Channel.  Joy's favorite thing about it lately appears to be the logo-bubble image on the lower right of the screen.

{"date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2009", "body": "\nIn my LEND studies this year I've heard quite a bit about the history of how, particularly in the United States, people with cognitive issues have been labelled and treated.\"Changeling\" was one term, referring to the folklore idea that the human-baby must have been stolen away by supernatural creatures and replaced by one of their goblin-babies.\"Mental defective\" was another brutal term, in use within the past century.  With IQ tests, we began to categorize people into levels of defect: an IQ of 50-69 got you labelled a \"moron\", 20-49 was \"imbecile,\" below 20 was \"idiot.\"Then came the term \"mental retardation,\" intended to be more clinical and less pejorative, and less-pejorative categories of mental retardation as well (based on IQ and still in use today): mild, moderate, severe, profound.Mental retardation, alas, has morphed into the casually-used yet incredibly cruel \"R-word,\" and a new stew of terminology has been brewing: cognitive issues, intellectual difference, cognitive disability, intellectual disability.  Until I started with the LEND course, I'd not been aware how much momentum the term \"intellectual disability\" has been gathering, but it's quite clearly the what's-next terminology.  The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) has become the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD).  (Even though the URL http://www.aamr.org still works rather than re-directing...)And now it looks like the U.S. government has the prospect of officially catching up. On Thursday Nov. 19 in the U.S. Senate, Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Michael Enzi (R-WY) introduced \"Rosa's Law\", modeled after recently-passed legislation in Maryland.  According to a news release from the Autism Society of America,this legislation would substitute the outdated, stigmatizing terms \u201cmental retardation\u201d and \u201cmentally retarded\u201d with the terms \u201cintellectual disability\u201d and \u201cindividual with an intellectual disability\u201d in federal health, education and labor policy statutes.I like it.  I think it's a good direction.I have to wonder, though, what's the next \"R-word\" that will stem from the term \"intellectual disabilities.\"  It's discouraging to see perfectly good words turn into pejoratives.  \"Bus\", for example, a mode of transportation.  \"Short,\" which might be used to describe a story or a stack of pancakes.  Put them together with a taunting tone to the voice, and \"She rides the short bus\" turns into yet one more episode of pain in our children's world.It also strikes me that here I am talking about intellectual disability as if it applied to Joy... but what does that really mean?  Certainly she'd not score very impressively on an IQ test at this point.  But there's an awful lot that IQ tests don't capture, and autism and IQ tests have a particularly problematic relationship, something that I really probably ought to do some more reading about.  Just for starters, there are so many stories of people with autism who were written off... and then eventually tapped in to a workable means of communication and began to share their amazing minds with the world.  Is the relationship of difference to disability something other with autism than it is with other conditions?In Friday's LEND seminar, we had a lecture about autism and genetics, in which one of the introductory slides on co-morbidities quoted a rate that 50-75% of autistic children have intellectual disability.  Joy's umbrella condition, the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), has a classic triad of symptoms - nevus sebaceous, seizures, and intellectual disability - and her diagnosis was based on that triad. Ah, so much we don't know...But at least we can work on choosing the right, neutral/helpful-as-possible words to convey the best of what we think we know.=========This blog will now go on a brief Thanksgiving vacation.

{"date": "Saturday, May 9, 2009", "body": "\nPer usual, my reading list has been heavy on the fiction lately, and all from the library.  I don't hear the siren-song of autism-book addiction quite the way some of my blog-friends do!  Every once in a while, though, I do get seduced into picking up an autism-related book.  And then I learn interesting things.  And then I have to do a book report, 'cause I report out on everything else autism-related around here...Anyway.  The recent read was What About Me? Growing Up with a Developmentally Disabled Sibling, by Bryna Siegel and Stuart Silverstein.  Siegel is a developmental psychologist (and imaginary BFF of Mama Mara) who has written a number of books on autism; Silverstein is a pediatrician and the older brother of a sibling with autism.  So even though it's not directly billed as being about sibs with autism, that seems to be the jumping-off point.So I found myself first gulping and eventually chuckling my way through the second chapter, about the research on sibs of developmentally disabled kids.  I had no idea that we (and Rose) were so much behind the 8-ball.  Consider:Research suggests that having a handicapped sibling is consistently more difficult for older sisters (p.28)Overall, girls tend to be more often negatively affected than boys (p.29)Adjustment can be more difficult for same-sex sibs (p.30)Sibs closer in age to the disabled sib tend to experience more distress (p.30)It helps to have a larger family - more sibs to share the experience/load (p.31)Add to that the research that families who planned their children carefully (me, plan? ME?) tend to feel a greater sense of unfairness when a child turns up with a disability, and that younger couples are often better able to cope than older couples (40-cough isn't OLD, is it?), and that authoritarian parents tend to have an easier time providing the sense of structure that a disabled child (especially with autism) may need... Well, we're just a mess waiting to happen, I guess.  At least we're not single-parenting (\"Without doubt, the most difficult situation to cope with is parenting a disabled child as a single parent\") -- my hat is off to my blogfriends who ARE.Except that, I actually think we're doing OK.  So far anyway.Rose seems like an exceptionally healthy kiddo.I did pick up some interesting things to watch out for.  The fundamental question, I think, is whether we're [un-necessarily] requiring things of Rose that we wouldn't require if Joy didn't have autism.  We'll need to be careful about asking her to do too much Joy-care; right now it sometimes takes the form of \"watch your sister for a minute while I go put the laundry in, OK?\"  Definitely something to keep to a minimum.  The other one I catch myself on is a little more insidious.  It has to do with the fact that Joy is likely to do damage to Rose's stuff that gets left unattended in the open.  So if Rose leaves a bunch of markers and her artwork all over the kitchen table and walks away, Joy is likely to grab the markers and crumple the paper.  Should Rose have put the project away?  Well, yeah.  But most kids don't get such intense natural consequences for that kind of omission.  We need to be sure we're sympathizing appropriately for all the wreckage, rather than solely reinforcing the lesson of, \"Well, that's what happens when you leave your stuff where Joy can get it.\"I also liked some of the general strategies that the book offered: Things like using humor to reframe sticky situations with Joy, giving Rose alone-time with parents, and being sure to give Rose her fair share of praise for accomplishments (seeing as how Joy gets such lavish praise for little things like putting on her own bib or saying even a single word).The book also made an interesting comparison with the adult-children-of-alcoholics situation.  The comparison has kind of an uncomfortable feeling about it, and as the authors point out, Twelve-Stepping obviously does not apply! but I did find myself nodding at a couple of the points.  Both neurotypical sibs and COAs find themselves in situations of high responsibility, having to give up the right to be childlike at an early age, placing their own needs second, being unwilling to bring friends home to play, keeping a lot of bad feelings inside... very interesting.Next up: Horizon (The Sharing Knife, Book 4) by Lois McMaster Bujold.

Which took place this morning.In the spirit of the Many post, perhaps I should have mentioned that between the run and the walk versions of the event, there were almost 20,000 participants registered.  And I went alone, though I was technically part of a team from the university library system.  One consequence of Joy's full therapy schedule is that I generally can't bring family along to cheer when I race, so this was a solo event in a sea of many.To get that many runners onto a course, you can't start everybody all at once.  The top-flight runners get to start first, and then everyone else gets assigned to a different clump of runners depending on your pace.  I was in the 36th wave out of 44, which meant that since they were trying to start one wave per minute, my wave started over ten minutes after the race had already been won.But the neatest thing happened as I lined up with my fellow potential-slow-pokes.  I ended up standing next to another mom, just about my age, who was running her first 8k race.  And she just happened to have a little daughter with special needs.  Like epilepsy.  And a tendency to slip away and escape.  And communication issues.  And a high pain tolerance.We chattered non-stop while we moved slowly up to the starting line.  And then we ran together and kept each other going, surely faster than either of us would have been alone.  We had each (optimistically) guessed that we'd make an 11-minute-mile pace, which is what got us assigned to the same wave.  I ended up being just a little slower in the last half-mile where she was able to pull ahead -- but she was waiting for me at the finish line.  We'd both run the entire way.My pace per mile was 10:20.  Woo hooooo!I hadn't thought that blogging about an 8k race would be about special-needs mamas helping one another out.

You wouldn't expect it with her, because she eats a lot of fruits and vegetables, but there it was.  We had her on a low dose of Miralax for something like a year, which helped.  And then at some point earlier this year, the situation had gone TOO far in the opposite direction, and Joy was objecting strenuously to the ensuing messy clean-ups, and so we stopped the Miralax.Things have gradually crept toward constipation again, skipping days and such, if you know what I mean.But since spring brought warmer weather, we have discovered the absolute fool-proof, totally natural, works-every-time way to induce the desired effect.Go out and play in the water.I'm serious.  Every single time Joy goes out to splash in puddles in the street, or cavort in the inflatable pool, or run through the sprinkler, or even (as this morning) dance in the rain on the deck -- shstuff happens. With the backyard play, I've gotten so that I just take the diaper bag out with me and change her right there in the (nice private fenced) yard.  Because of course the water play is so much fun, Joy totally hates to have it interrupted to go inside and change.It's almost too bad that this super constipation-problem-solver is so extremely natural.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2010", "body": "\nIt matters how you choose to tell a story.I grew up with a historian for a father and an English teacher for a mother, so I could hardly get away without picking up on this!  I've been particularly aware of seeing this in action over the past couple of years as I worked on two self-publishing projects with my father.  One project was organizing my mother's autobiographical writings -- how she chose to tell her story.  The other was my father's biography of his parents and family.  With the biography, I was privileged to see some of the selection process at work: how he organized details to support the themes he'd identified in his parents' lives, which stories he opted to present and which he considered presenting but decided not to include after all. Of course, in blogging about our experiences with Joy, I'm doing that all the time.  Choosing what is important enough to tell, and might inform or entertain or make you think or all of the above, and what's on my mind about Joy that I might appropriately process here, and what have I learned that I might usefully share with you, and what is the truth of our journey as I see it?  (The latter of which may sound odd coming from behind a pseudonym, but that too is one reality of my particular mommy-blogging enterprise.)I'm thinking about all this in context of a powerful post last week from the amazing Jess who writes of her beautiful daughter Brooke at a diary of a mom.  And in fact, the title of the post was \"Context.\"  She writes of a birthday party where her daughter made some tremendous strides forward, but also sat apart from the group, with her differences written all over her face.  The real story of the party, as Jess felt and experienced it, was the context and backdrop of difference.  How hard it is, and will continue to be.  Among several potential real stories, the hard story was the real one that day.It resonates.  (Just read the comments on the post if there were any doubt!)And yet.It makes me think to ask: What is the real story with Joy?We can choose how we story-tell on a blog -- but to what extent do we get to choose what is the real story?We've had some radically-conflicting storylines to choose from here lately.  Is the real story that Joy is getting more independent with the steps in her potty routine, and happily sitting much longer in the mornings (up to 15 minutes!)?  Or is the real story that she hasn't actually produced on the pot for three weeks, and that she likes to splash the handwash-water and lick the liquid soap and drop things into the toilet?Is the real story that she continues to imitate words, and play peek-games, and generally be more interactive?  Or is it the upswing in aggressive behaviors that are causing her to lash out with hair-pulling and hitting at the least bit of frustration, catching peers and adults alike in her wrath, mere weeks before she starts kindergarten?There are absolutely moments when it feels as if the real story is all about  disability and difference and struggle and heartache.But I personally feel a strong need to choose for a real story of hope, and progress on her own terms and at her own pace, and shining eyes and giggles and playful beeps on her sister's nose.  If I let myself inhabit the darker story too much, too consistently, too often -- I'm afraid I won't be the person I want to be.  Nor will I be the mother she needs me to be.  What do you think?  To what extent do we get an authentic say in the choice of the real story?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/context/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/context/"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/07/real-story.html", "title": "\nThe Real Story\n"},

I wrote about it at the end of 2008 in terms of high pain-tolerance.  She used to pick up a whole handful of splinters without batting an eye, and back in '08 would let me dig them back out with minimal reaction.  (By the time of the \"handful of splinters\" post in 2010, she was starting to object to such operations somewhat, though still not reacting obviously when the splinters went in.)\n\nThings are changing on the pain-reactions front, though.  Now when Joy gets a splinter, she grabs for me to show me right away.  She cries more readily at pain, does a much better job of indicating where the \"owie\" is, and wants an adult to rub it / kiss it / make it better.\n\nThere's been a change in how Joy reacts to Rose's pain, as well.\n\nTime was, Rose would burst out into tears, and Joy would have \"inappropriate\" reactions that would be difficult to process with everyone involved.  Joy might try to swat Rose, or burst out laughing, neither of which were reactions that felt particularly supportive to her sister!\n\nBut earlier this week, we had three occasions in short succession on which Rose began to weep, and Joy responded by crying real tears as well.\n\nRachel Cohen-Rottenburg has been doing some wonderful work about empathy, founding the site Autism and Empathy and fighting the good fight against those who maintain that a lack of empathy is inherently a part of autism.  I haven't been able to give the site the attention it deserves, nor the level of thoughtful comment, but I've been following along as I can.  And I had to think of Rachel's work in context of what I'm seeing in these interactions between Rose and Joy.\n\n\"It hurts me too.\"\n\nThe sad occasion this week which caused Rose to weep so frequently was the passing of our bunny Ellie.  Ellie has been our final remaining house-bunny since the death of her partner Phoebert a year ago January.  Ellie was only a year or two younger than Phoebert, definitely an elderly bunny, and we had decided against getting her a new companion because we were ready to try a pet-free home.  (Claiming back the space, the time spent on weekly box-and-enclosure cleaning, the food-and-litter expenses, etc.)  \n\nWe actually thought we were going to lose Ellie 6 weeks ago, when she stopped eating her bunny-chow... but she was still willing to eat greens, and so we went with a hospice-style approach where we gave her all the greens she liked as long as it made her happy in her final days... and she perked back up!  But she was definitely in decline, and things went so fast this past Sunday it became clear that this was really it.  So Ellie and I made one final trip to the vet on Monday.\n\nRose & Joy both got to pet Ellie's remains.  We had a burial in the back yard.\n\nI'm less worried this time around about what Joy does or doesn't understand.  She probably \"gets\" quite a lot more than we're tempted to think she does.  I've been more concerned about Rose, who has been reading The Giver by Lois Lowry in school -- it's a dystopian novel about a would-be perfect society, in which one of the mechanisms for keeping things perfect is \"releasing\" imperfect infants and the infirm elderly by means of lethal injection.  I was steeling myself for the conversation that connected Ellie's final injection to The Giver, and maybe even to Joy?!  But I don't think the connection was made... which is something of a relief.  Rose is growing up fast, but maybe it doesn't need to be that fast.\n\nJoyDad and I have had rabbits in our home since 1994.  Ellie's departure is the end of an era.\n\nGood-bye, Ellie-bun.

(Temple was amazed too -- as she said at the conference talk, \"Claire Danes became me in a way that was really weird!\")\n\nJoy wandered in and out of the room as we watched, but Rose was engaged with the movie all the way.\n\nShe wondered whether Joy sees the world in any of the picture-flashes that portrayed Temple's thinking, or the superimposed architectural designs.\n\nIn the scene where Temple's mother is told of the autism diagnosis and advised to put her daughter in an institution, Rose asked questions and then made the connection with the Where's Molly? story we saw on TV a year ago.\n\nShe was distressed by the way Temple's classmates treated her, and shared that she'd seen kids make fun of Joy at school a couple of times.  But she allowed as how she gets teased from time to time herself.  I pointed out that when Temple was in school, and even when I was in school, kids with developmental disabilities simply didn't get to go to the same schools that typically-developing kids attended, if they even got to go to school at all.\n\nRose thought about that.  \"It's so lucky...\" she said...\nand I expected her to go on to say how lucky Joy is that she gets to go to school with everyone else...\n\n\"...for Joy's class that they get to know her and have her in school with them!\"\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2011/11/lucky.html", "title": "\nLucky\n"},

{"date": "Friday, May 21, 2010", "body": "\nRose has been growing out her hair for quite a while, other than a trim or two.  She had planned to let it grow out enough to cut a 10-inch-long donation to Locks of Love, but it was starting to be a hassle to comb and otherwise care for, and she wanted it out of her face.So she asked me to cut it short.Came out pretty cute, if I do say so myself, though that perhaps has more to do with the wearer of the hair than with my scissoring skills.  The 6+ inches of hair that came off was not wasted -- she had heard in her 2nd-grade class that there was an organization collecting hair to make into booms to soak up oil from beaches (the Gulf spill will surely be soiling beaches soon, alas).  I did some poking around and found out that the salon where I usually go is sending their hair-clippings to A Matter of Trust this month.  When I went for a cut this week, I took Rose's clippings as well, along with some fur that she'd pulled out of our indignant shedding rabbit's hindquarters.JoyDad got a cut there too earlier this week, which leaves just one of us.Longtime readers will remember the hair-pulling, hair-cutting drama last spring.  The April 2009 shearing looked like this:Guess what happens when you let a buzzcut grow out for a whole year?It turns into the most lovely regular feathery layers you've ever seen.I just can't stand to cut it yet, even though it's starting to get long enough that Joy puts it into her mouth sometimes, and it's also becoming a hassle to comb after bath.I'll never manage layers like that again, unless we bring back the buzzcut.  Which is not on the agenda right now, even if all the cool/beautiful women have tried it!Maybe when the weather gets warmer, I'll figure out a new hairstyle for Joy, somewhere in between the shearing extremes.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.locksoflove.org/index.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S_ZtZ8kMJsI/AAAAAAAAAgw/yqSOVL-6qnQ/s1600/haircutRosebefore.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S_Ztrzh_QTI/AAAAAAAAAg4/vUpUd-y-qQY/s1600/haircutRose.jpg", "http://www.matteroftrust.org/programs/hairmatsinfo.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S_ac1ncdjFI/AAAAAAAAAhA/4C0jLI8p9lU/s1600/haircutJoymama.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S_adiCAZSzI/AAAAAAAAAhI/o_Bc9ATHXIM/s1600/buzzcut.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S_ad0hDNq9I/AAAAAAAAAhQ/cGD4m3203Ak/s1600/haircutJoy.jpg"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/05/spring-shearing.html", "title": "\nSpring Shearing\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 18, 2010", "body": "\nOn Monday I mentioned that we've been hearing many vocalizations from Joy.  I thought you might like to hear about some of the things she's had to say lately.JoyDad told me about an interaction at snacktime earlier this week.  Joy was drinking juice (from an open cup, yeah!) using both hands to lift the cup.  JoyDad was doling out the pretzel sticks a few at a time.  At one point he offered sticks while she had the cup in the air with both hands.  \"Joy, do you want more?\"  He said you could just see the wheels turning as she thought about making the \"more\" sign but realized both hands were already occupied.  And then she looked right at him and spoke.Mo!Another lovely vocalization that has come and gone over the years has been \"ma-ma\".  Last time I posted about it was about a year ago.  Well, it's back, and it's the two-syllable word, not even the babbly \"ma-ma-ma\" that was coming out last time.  At least for today, even if it's just for today, we're getting \"ma-ma\"!By the way, that \"just for today\" post I just linked to?  It focused on the signing of the word \"more\" -- which was an occasional, some-time thing back in February 09.  These days, it's the most solid sign in her repertoire, over-generalized to mean \"I want\" as well as \"more.\"  How very far she has come!Then there was the imitation last night, when our church fellowship group met for a cookout.  Joy was exploring and rolling around in the lovely large yard, I was talking to a couple of other moms, and Rose was playing with a group of older kids halfway across the yard.  Suddenly from one of the older boys in the faraway group comes an audible, \"Aw, CRAP!\"  And what do we hear from Joy?  A sweet little echo, \"caa\"!  That was the one and only thing she chose to imitate from the other kids all evening.And finally last night, late home from the cookout and getting ready for bed.  Joy sat on the toilet a little bit, without success, and then after bath we went to her room to get her into diapers and jammies.  As I was assembling the materials, she loudly announced, Kee!What in the world was \"kee,\" I wondered, looking around.  It was a new sound, an unfamiliar vocalization.  I couldn't find anything to attach it to.And then she \"kee\"-ed all over the carpet.  Must have been holding it in for a while, it was a major stream.Oh, yes.  This girl's got things to tell us.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OfGA-_Rf2-s/S8s1pMW6QZI/AAAAAAAAAe4/inKOPFGWz-8/s1600/more.gif"], "link": "http://elvis-sightings.blogspot.com/2010/04/some-things-to-say.html", "title": "\nSome Things To Say\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "body": "\nLots of busy, so far this summer.\n\nRose decided that she rather liked the sidewalk-chalk activities from our trip to the Capitol the other week.  Since we haven't taken the opportunity to do any more political work downtown since then, she brought the sidewalk chalk to our own neighborhood, creating a collaborative mural all over the driveway apron that we share with a couple other homes.\n\nShe didn't just draw it all herself, though.  No, she invited the neighborhood in, with chalked-invitations all the way up the street:\n\n\nShe drew blank boxes for others to fill in, drew a snowman for others to add features to, solicited responses to little jokes.  Then she left chalk out to see what would happen... and people came!  We saw several adults stop and add their doodles on their way down to the restaurant or local grocery.  There aren't many children in our neighborhood, but we got enthusaistic participation from several of the kids nearby.\n\n\nJoy, meanwhile, continues to busily request our involvement in little interactive games too -- such as peek-a-boo.\n\n\nLike the new cut?  I get better at the boyish cut every time I do it, though Joy isn't really fond of getting it done and makes the activity a challenge.  I pretty much had to do it, though, and here's why:\n\n\nAgain.  Dangit.\n\nYes, she's been busy once again, stimmy-pulling out her own hair, mostly along the line of her nevus-scar.\n\nI didn't want to take it all the way down to a bald-buzz this time.  But I may have to yet.  She's still working on trying to pull the stubby little hairs that she's got left.\n\nAt least it's summer.

Joy responded with many splashes and stomps and giggles, and helpfully refraining from actually\u00a0falling down.\n\n\n\nThen something seemed to catch her attention. \u00a0She looked, leaned to the side, took another looong look.\n\n\n\n\"Joy, what do you see?\" asked Mama.\n\n\n\nThe response grew out of Brown Bear and our stomping-splashes, and just about took my breath away.\n\nI see bird -- stomp, stomp, stomp!\nSix words, gentle readers. \u00a0Six in a row, one more even than our long-lost Ring Around the Rosy line, in an original combination.\n\nShe was working other spoken-combos this weekend, too. \u00a0She says them slowly, with great emphasis, almost with a period after each word.\n\nI.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 25, 2010", "body": "\nI'd like to share another snippet of the conversation with Joy's excellent primary care doctor, from the appointment at which we reversed course on the surgery.After I had recounted several aspects of the wonderful new developmental stuff that we've been seeing with Joy, he asked me a question.  I don't remember his exact words, but the sense was: Why do you think this is happening?  What's the cause, do you suppose?  To what can we attribute this?My answer was along the lines of: well, we don't really know.  We haven't really tried anything new.  Maybe it has something to do with springtime.  Maybe we've just finally had the seizures under control long enough.  Also all the good work we've been doing with intensive therapy -- and, of course, she's growing up!He affirmed my assessment of the situation.(Interesting to think that it if it had been \"neurotypical\" Rose who'd had a huge developmental spurt, nobody probably would have even thought to ask the question...)Now just think how different that assessment might have been if we had decided in, say, February to start Joy on the GFCF diet.  Or hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  Or any one of the therapies from the \"alternative intervention assignment\" we did in LEND seminar.We might then consider Joy living proof of the miracle powers of whatever-therapy, even though all the gains would have happened anyway.This thought isn't original with me.  I've cribbed it from Viktoria at Conductive Upbringing, who recently told such a story about India, a lovely young lady who has cerebral palsy.  Recently and unexpectedly, with no new therapy to attribute it to, India suddenly grabbed and slurped an entire glass of pink-milk through a straw, where previously she'd demonstrated no willingness or ability to drink so much, so unassisted.Viktoria tells this story in a well-documented, evidence-based, thoughtful post about the hyping of stem-cell therapy as a cure for cerebral palsy.  In previous posts she took on hyperbaric oxygen therapy (yes, the purveyors of HBOT would have you believe that it works wonders for CP as well as autism), and magnetic therapy.Fortunately, since India (like Joy) was not receiving any such therapy at the time, we can celebrate the amazing powers of human development.
