{"date": " March 13, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)  Strategic Plan  for Autism Spectrum Disorder Research has now been published.  It\u2019s a very broad reaching document which is good for a strategic plan.  Characteristic of the document is the unfinished nature of the research goals.  That is also good in a strategic plan.  In all events, the specific goals will be dictated by discussions of a different purpose and much greater depth.   The IACC leans somewhat heavily on the  Autism and the Environment: Challenges and Opportunities for Research, Workshop Proceedings 2008 , Institute of Medicine of the National Academies for their environmental goals.  Inexplicably they also manage to mischaracterise the results and purpose of the workshop.  The IOM workshop made no recommendations.   What they tried to do was tackle the \u2018environmental\u2019 angle with the broadest brush possible and with anyone who could have a stake in the issue.  The range of research possibilities discussed was enormous.  Those are loosely collected together in Appendix A.  These workshop proceedings are definitely worth a read just to get a feel for the size of the problem and some of the ways that research is developing.    The IOM invited many parent organisations to participate, giving the lead to the three prominent anti-vaccination organisations, the National Autism Association, Safeminds and Generation Rescue.    So the usual players were represented; Sallie Bernard, Mark Blaxill, Kelli Ann Davis, Lynn Redwood, Robert Krakow.  Though there were several representatives of Autism Speaks, the perspective of the parent \u2018advocates\u2019 was given by Laura Bono of NAA.   Now the IOM workshop organisers bent over backwards with this crew.   Not once did they object to the silliest statement or the most specious argument and Laura Bono\u2019s perspective had plenty of both.  A brief summary of her points is as follows: $ \u201cDeclare autism a national health emergency under the Public Health Act and treat it with urgency.\u201d.  The one thing anti-vaxxers do well is Science by fiat and/or assertion.   There is no evidence for an epidemic, but that counts for little against the need for autism to be a medical condition that is by definition not genetic and treatable (by their methods). $ \u201cAutism is both economically and emotionally devastating to the children and their families. Many families are on the brink of bankruptcy as they struggle to get insurance and the medical attention their children need. Murder/suicides of parents and their autistic children are on the rise.\u201d   Apart from bankruptcy chasing expensive and unproven CAM therapies, I doubt there\u2019s a grain of truth in the rest of it. $ Laura then chides the CDC for \u2018credibility \u2018problems in failing to declare an epidemic then quotes Julie Geberding, Director CDC\u2019s explanation for it: \u201cOur estimates are becoming better and more consistent, though we can\u2019t tell yet if there is a true increase in ASDs [autism spectrum disorders] or if the changes are the result of our better studies.\u201d  This is then called a denial which is unacceptable because it thwarts research into environmental factors.  Why should it? $ \u201cAutism is an environmentally triggered problem.  If it is environmental, then it is treatable and preventable.  It is not hopeless and lifelong.  It is hopeful, with a possible cure.\u201d  Again it\u2019s science by assertion but also a really good example of wishful thinking. $ \u201cRecent clinical investigations have identified numerous comorbid disease states in children with autism. These include immune system abnormalities; inflammatory bowel disease; oxidative stress; disordered urine and serum chemistries, including elevated porphyrins; methylation disturbances; increased body burdens of metals, including mercury and lead; chronic viral, fungal, and bacterial infections; and microglial activation in the brain.\u201d  This is certainly what is treated biomedically and very often all these comorbidities occur inside the one child reading treatment accounts, which isn\u2019t a good fit for the healthy looking shiny haired children posing on the back cover of Laura\u2019s presentation. $ \u201cThe research paradigm needs to shift from autistic children are genetically defective to autistic children are sick and treatable. We should only grant money to genetic vulnerability and epidemiology studies that have a clear environmental hypothesis.\u201d  That\u2019s clear enough.  If you are genetically defective you can\u2019t be treated or so this false dichotomy is saying.   That narrow thinking carries on to dictating a narrow funding rationale based on no evidence whatsoever. $ \u201cThere is a growing body of evidence implicating vaccine overload, mercury and aluminum from vaccines. Thousands of parents agree with this research. They watch their children regress after being vaccinated.\u201d  Again this is science by anecdote.  There is no evidence corroborated by carefully documented case histories, which is surprising when these anti-vaxxers point to this as a major plank in their rationale. $ \u201cRegardless of controversy surrounding any theory, we must research and produce successful antioxidant, methylation, and blood-brain barrier chelation treatments, as well as immune system, detoxification, and inflammation interventions.\u201d  Note the anti-science attitude reflected in the call to produce the remedy well ahead of any good theoretical grounds for doing so.  Also note that it is rather heavily implied that chelation is not effective given the lack of a blood-brain barrier chelation treatment.  So why do they continue doing it? $ \u201cThe guiding principles should be to pursue research and treatments that will impact the most lives as quickly as possible and follow clues provided by treatments currently working in children. Such an agenda would best be served by a translational research protocol where clinicians who care for children with autism advise research into the most promising areas of intervention.\u201d   So the guiding lights are to be a bunch of DAN doctors directing the agenda. $ \u201cIt is imperative that the working group proceed with urgency and follow the truth wherever it leads.\u201d  Yes but it\u2019s only if it fits our definition of truth. Well no one laughed not even when Laura specifically exhorted the workshop to use provoked urine samples for heavy metals testing, a species of fraud.  But because no one laughed or raised the least protest at the amount of anti-science on display, the advocacy groups became essentially token participants and not taken seriously.   They could have taken advantage of this phenomenal opportunity to look at the research currently on offer particularly the prospective style initiatives where a specific group is tracked basically before anything happens.   Not all of them will cover environmental factors but some include them.  The National Children\u2019s Study certainly does.  The US is also involved in the Norwegian ABC study, which tracks 100,000 women from early pregnancy taking all kinds of samples on the way.   This includes addressing things like vaccine history as they arise.   This is exciting research with the best possible chance for turning up meaningful data including valid biomarkers for autism. So what, if any of their wish list made it into the IACC strategic plan?  In very general terms, some will but not the narrow concerns of NAA and associated organisations.  As the plan states: \u201cA clear need exists to advance understanding of the many phenotypes of ASD, including studies that link genotype to phenotype, investigations of natural and treated history, analyses of genetic interaction with environmental exposures, and studies of co-occurring medical conditions. \u201c There is a need to look with a very broad brush because we don\u2019t know enough at present to narrow the exploratory field prematurely. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://iacc.hhs.gov/reports/2009/iacc-strategic-plan-for-autism-spectrum-disorder-research-jan26.shtml", "http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11946&page=293"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2009/03/iacc-strategic-plan-and-environment.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t IACC Strategic Plan and Environment\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " October 13, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   On this day of Thanksgiving in Canada, one would think that most people would reflect on what\u2019s right with their world, an opportunity to be an optimist if only for a day.  For some, this is never going to happen.  No matter how much it would be in their interests to  join in the celebrations, if the good things do not precisely match their specifications then there is nothing in it for them to be thankful about.   Such a dog in the manger attitude matters not at all, unless you claim to be seen as an \u2018autism advocate\u2019, in which case it matters a great deal.  Harold Doherty claims to be an advocate for autism in Canada, but take a look at  his reaction   to  Michelle Dawson\u2019s success  in her Canadian Human Rights Tribunal case against Canada Post.   His blog post covers all the tried and true strategies of dishonest folk everywhere; quote mining, lies, defamation and an appeal to the readers worst instincts, though the attempt at the latter is so juvenile, the persuasion value is probably nil. It must be noted that everything Harold writes should be seen through the filter of his personal agenda, which is that if the family, for whatever reason, decides that their offspring is too much of a burden, then the State should provide care.  Basically it\u2019s a return to institutionalisation.  Naturally any attempts to understand autistic people or refer to aspects of autism that may be positive or even neutral are to be undermined at the first opportunity in case some official takes note and might think that institutionalisation may be highly inappropriate for autistics, simply because they are autistic.  That an autism advocate has such an attitude is passing strange but this is Canada, where as Michelle Dawson  has remarked  with considerable accuracy: \u201c\u201cAutism advocacy\u201d is the widespread effort to make the world as free of autism \u2014 that is, of autistic people \u2014 as possible. \u201c Quote Mining Interestingly, Harold\u2019s quotes cover those aspects that mitigate Canada Post\u2019s actions or highlight the disability factor.  Do read them, What is entirely absent are those aspects of the case that are so important to parents who know, not merely fear, that their offspring are going to face that same sort of discrimination in the workplace.  That the Tribunal recognised the following is pure gold to worried parents: \u201cthe Tribunal finds it disturbing for the future of autistic people that they be seen because of their condition to pose a threat to the safety of others and some form of nuisance in the workplace. An employer has a duty to ensure not only that all employees work in a safe environment but also that ill perceptions about an employee's condition due to poor or inadequate information about his disability lead other employees to have negative and ill-founded perceptions about him.\u201d What sort of an advocate is this? Lies and Let\u2019s do a spot of defamation Harold Doherty does not like Dr Laurent Mottron and he frequently and probably erroneously attributes an anti-ABA position to him.   In order to bring his name into disrepute, Harold is not as careful as he ought to be.   Though \u2018care\u2019 may be insinuating that Harold is simply careless rather than adopting the age old tactic that if you sling enough mud, some of it will stick eventually.  Be that as it may, Harold once again gets the facts wrong: \u201cThe expert evidence was provided solely by a Dr. M called as a witness by Ms. Dawson. Dr. M. was qualified as a credible expert witness by the Tribunal despite his close ties to Ms. Dawson:pertaining to Ms.Dawson\u2019s condition.\u201d Ms Dawson didn\u2019t call any witnesses and Dr M, otherwise known as Dr Laurent Mottron was there in his capacity as a well known and highly regarded researcher, in other words, as an expert on autism.  Insinuating that his credibility could be compromised by his working relationship with Ms Dawson is Harold\u2019s little stab at defamation.   Note, it looks like Harold has cleaned up this post somewhat.  The original accused Michelle of having covered up her role in Auton.  That\u2019s the real deal in legally liable defamation. What sort of an advocate is this? Juvenile Dementia The majority of the post is devoted to taking pot shots at Dr Mottron.  Most of this is incredibly juvenile and in the form of references to the \u2018mysterious Dr M\u2019.   This is surprising because  Dr Mottron\u2019s testimony  to the Tribunal is incredibly informative about autism (see pages 24 to 29).  What parent wouldn\u2019t want to know about this information.  It\u2019s not as if there is such a pile of it to be found.  Harold\u2019s reaction is to harp on yet again about the statement made by Dr Mottron and Michelle that to search for a cure is nonsensical.  This is hardly controversial no matter how Harold likes to spin it.  We have no way of curing a brain configuration laid out in the first trimester of gestation, which is what a cure necessarily entails.   It cannot be done, not now and not for the forseeable future. What sort of an advocate is this.? \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2008/10/mysterious-dr-m-notion-of-curing-autism.html", "http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/search/files/t1053_3405chrt41.pdf", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=201", "http://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/search/files/t1053_3405chrt41.pdf"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/10/what-sort-of-advocate-is-this.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t What sort of an advocate is this?\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " November 11, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Note: PoMo or Post Modernism hangs on the belief that all truth is relative, which may make some sense in the literary criticism field but reaches comic status when applied to Science, (see Gross and Levitt\u2019s \u2018Higher Superstitions\u2019). David Kirby and fellow conspiracy theorist, Mark Blaxill gave a briefing on vaccines and autism to Congress.   True to form, Kirby\u2019s briefing reflects an absolute commitment to projecting an image and as for the facts, well let\u2019s not get too worried about those.  Many bloggers and writers have noted Kirby\u2019s departure from accepted standards of journalism, even though he apparently is keen on the status if not the responsibility.  He remains a PR flack it seems, which is his background, judging by the contents of his presentation.  I thought it would be worthwhile to see how many distortions, misrepresentations and fabrications  of the facts about vaccines Kirby could deliver in under an hour, to support the earnest if not terrible sincere image of \u201cI want to save the vaccine program, not destroy it. \u201d  Et tu Brutus? The following points are presented in chronological order noting that some points represent well known canards of the anti-vaccination movement.  Where possible, I have linked to the necessary corrective. \u25a0 This is a national emergency.  We now have hundreds of thousands of children with autism in this country, and the majority of people in this country are under 18 years of age.  Canard # 1: The autism epidemic.  There must be one so that autism can be a medical problem rather than a behavioral one.  This has been debunked so many times.  Orac does a pretty good corrective with the help of Dr Paul Shattuck.  Not surprisingly, Dr Shattuck was promptly labelled a Pharm Shill - but they got the wrong Merck.  Drat - they\u2019re all over the place!  http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/04/well_that_didnt_take_long_the.php#more  \u25a0 It is estimated that the cost of care, education and housing for a person with autism runs up to 2 to 3 million dollars per person, and we have at least 250,000 people with autism in this country, so we are already up to the 700 billion, 750 billion dollar mark, coming at us in the future. This is not so much a canard as a distortion of the autism spectrum and the omission of reference to the actual costs of caring for any person over an average lifespan.  Figures like this are based on a 100% institutionalisation rate, which is ridiculous, but it probably sells well in the middle of a financial crisis and do note the many references to the financial crisis in this briefing.  \u25a0 But the vaccine program is in deep trouble. There is tremendous distrust among parents today and they don\u2019t feel like they are being leveled with. There are some who\u2019ve been bamboozled by the green our vaccines publicity misinformation campaign, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s just a tad dishonest to accuse the vast majority of parents - like about 90 - 95% who give all the vaccines, of being as gullible as the tiny minority?  The autistic community has had enough of this tactic as well.  As for greening the vaccines, there\u2019s a lovely line from science blogger Dr Mark Crislip: \u201cGreen our vaccines? The only green you will see by getting rid of vaccines or decreasing their use is the grass growing on the graves of children needlessly killed by preventable infections.\u201d http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=186 \u25a0 And I think where we are heading in terms of science and medicine, is identifying those children who have certain genetic susceptibilities so that they cannot necessarily handle the rather crowded vaccine schedule we have today.  Probably 99% of the children can handle it just fine. But what about those 1% who have a certain genetic susceptibility to vaccine ingredients and other environmental toxins? Canard # 2  There is a subgroup of children who are \u2018susceptible\u2019 to well, anything  - the vaccines, the number of vaccines, the \u2018toxins\u2019 in the vaccines or the preservative.  The fact that all of these are quite different aetiologies and there is no evidence for any of it doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone.  And this is a \u2018briefing\u2019.    Canard #3 Epidemiological studies are not sensitive enough to pick up vulnerable subgroups.  The implication above is that the subgroup is too small to be picked up by epidemiological studies but not too small to jeopardise the Autism Omnibus Proceedings.  That is a nonsense.  Epidemiological studies have picked up correlations as rare as 1:38000 and 1;100000.   Given the huge sample sizes,  the statistical power of the studies finding no link between vaccines and autism was plenty to find very small subgroups if they existed, a point described very well in Dr Paul Offit\u2019s \u201cAutism\u2019s False Prophets\u201d. Canard #4 The vaccine schedule is too crowded.  You know you aren\u2019t dealing with rational people when they make this claim or talk about \u2018toxin\u2019 in vaccines, because the quantity of what they\u2019re talking about in the vaccine is absolutely dwarfed by factors of tens to hundreds to millions of the substance already present in the infant to be vaccinated.  Take the antigen load in vaccines. The entire infant schedule has been measured in the low hundreds.  The infant is bombarded with millions of antigens all day every day, but somehow the vaccine schedule with its paltry load is too much?    They talk about aluminium in vaccines, either not knowing or choosing to forget that the levels of aluminium are a hundred times that already in the infant and too small to be a noticeable addition.  The reason for that is simple enough.  Aluminium is one of the commonest elements on earth.  Ditto for formaldehyde.   The trace level left over from manufacture is overshadowed thousand fold by what the infant already has.  Heck we make the stuff as a byproduct of some metabolic processes. Dr Mark Crislip, bless him, nails the 'too many too soon'  here : http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289  \u25a0 We need to look for genetic susceptibilities. Are people born with certain vulnerabilities? Maybe immune problems, autoimmune problems, or mitochondrial dysfunction. What about metal metabolism? Some people are able to excrete and metabolize heavy metals much better than others.  So, is there a certain small subset of the population that is particularly at risk for vaccine injury that might lead to autism and other problems? It seems that anti-vaxxers have adopted a pattern of assuming that untested hypotheses are central to their case such as here with vaccines and \u2018susceptible\u2019 groups.  This was also one of Healy\u2019s motherhood statements.   According to a very recent survey of the experts who manage such susceptible groups, the experts are practically unanimous in endorsing the vaccination schedule, as is for the most part, and see no reasons for delaying it.   That much Healy at least should have been aware of.   See Barshop and Summar:  Attitudes regarding vaccination among practitioners of clinical biochemical genetics.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18816884  The conclusion to this paper is worth noting: \u201cIn summary, it is clear that the general opinion held by practitioners in the field of Clinical Biochemical Genetics favors the full schedule of vaccination for their patients. The overwhelming majority also feel that the benefits of the current schedule outweigh the risks to individuals with undiagnosed metabolic disease. Most have never observed any significant adverse event which was attributed to a vaccine reaction. Some respondents have seen the association once or seldom in their careers, but none felt it to be frequent. The fact that there were few encountered events of long-term deterioration due to a disease for which vaccination is available probably simply reflects the low incidence of those diseases, due to the effectiveness of vaccination practices. A panoply of questions remain, however, and there is a great need for more data.\u201d \u25a0 Then there is the Maloney Bill, and I really hope you\u2019ll take a look at it and consider cosponsoring it. That would fund a study of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations of children. Dr. Julie Gerberding has said that this study can and should be done, and I would just say that if this study was done and done properly, and there was absolutely no difference in outcomes between vaccinated children and unvaccinated children, it would shut me up.  Now there Kirby is indulging in one or two fibs.  While the likes of Healy could say that such a study \u2018can and should be done\u2019, I can\u2019t see Geberding saying any such thing or at least meaning what Kirby is disingenuously suggesting here given his and other anti-vaxxers legendary propensities to fabricate statements by Geberding.    Kirby is quite outrageous in  misquoting  Geberding particularly in relation to Geberding\u2019s remarks about the limitations of the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) data.    See Epiwonk\u2019s careful deconstruction of Kirby\u2019s shenanigans here: http://epiwonk.com/?p=79. The legion of problems a comparative study between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations has been comprehensively discussed here, http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=154,  including the ethics.  The author also flatly disagrees that such a study would be either necessary or effective.  What, after all would such a study be looking at with respect to vaccines.  Kirby is careful not to specify. Secondarily, it is doubtful on past record that Kirby would be satisfied with the results of such a study.  When the CDDS Calidornia showed that autism rates were not dropping he shifted the goal posts, though he had sais he would abandon the hypothesis that autism was caused by TCVs.  Comparisons of autism in those who got thimerosal and those that didn\u2019t, those that got MMR and those that didn\u2019t and with those on different vaccine schedules haven\u2019t satisfied him or any other ant-vaxxer.  For Kirby it\u2019s just another ploy to keep the money flowing and for the rest - it\u2019s always been about how wrong vaccines are, how unnatural.  No answer will satisfy them. \u25a0 We\u2019re seeing extremely high levels in autism among children of immigrants, children born in the United States. For example, the Somalis in Minnesota, and I\u2019ll be looking at this more in the near future. Their rate of autism is going through the roof. And there is virtually no autism, or very little autism reported in Somalia.  Perhaps Kirby is the sole public relations flack that doesn\u2019t know that Somalia has no government.  Who, in that miserable land would be keeping track of autism rates?  Maybe that explains his singular lack of success in journalism. \u25a0 And yes, there is a big debate, still, about whether autism is truly a genetic disorder, or is there an environmental component? People who argue that autism is genetic say that it\u2019s always been with us at this rate. Now, you cannot have a genetic epidemic, so the way to explain the increasing numbers, they say, is through better diagnosis and better reporting. Canard #5 The environmental component must be some exotic chemical in the environment.  Some have cynically suggested that introduced chemicals have the singular advantage that someone may be sued about their introduction.  Nevertheless, Kirby does not seem to have considered that among identical twins where rates are discordant, the environmental chemical exposures would be very similar, identical even in utero.  \u201cEnvironment\u2019 covers a lot of ground, including epigenetic factors. There follows a laundry list of metabolic states the autism as disease model likes to trot out, namely neuroinflammation, low glutathione levels and oxidative stress.  Kirby does not mention androgen pathways, which is infamous Geier castration therapy territory and therefore far too much the hot potato for a Congressional briefing.  However, the theories of metabolic idiosyncracies supposedly associated with autism were laid before the Special Masters hearing the Autism Omnibus Proceedings and there were demolished soundly by some of the finest specialists around.    The transcripts are available from:  http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/omnibus-autism-proceeding. \u25a0 He [Burbacher] gave half the monkeys injected ethylmercury, replicating the vaccine schedule; and he gave the other half ingested methylmercury in the form found in fish. And what he found was, even though the ethylmercury cleared from the blood more readily and did not cross to the brain quite as much, the ethylmercury that did get into the brain immediately started converting to inorganic mercury. Rather surprisingly he admits to ethylmercury clearing the body much faster, though he does not state just how huge the different rates of clearance are, days for ethylmercury against months for methyl mercury.  Nevertheless, there is no one in the antivax camp who will acknowledge that Burbacher did not attempt to differentiate the actual contributions of either added doses of ethyl or methyl mercury to brain inorganic mercury, he just ground the brains up and assumed that what they had been given was unadulterated organic mercury but he had no way of bring certain of that.   See BC \u2018s take on this: http://bartholomewcubbins.blogspot.com/2007/01/bc-on-autism-revisiting-burbacher-2005.html \u25a0 \u201cHannah\u2019s autism was caused by a vaccine-induced trigger of her underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.\u201d This line from Kirby is pure fabrication.  The government conceded no such thing.  Stephen Novella  has the definitive rebuttal of this: http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=203 Canard #6  Mitochondrial disorders are a significant factor in a significant number of cases of autism aetiology and the method is disruption of mitochondrial DNA through exposure to toxic chemicals.  This position has been adopted so quickly in certain quarters that it is relatively common to hear that \u201cI\u2019m going to check my kid for \u2018mito\u2019\u201d, regardless of the difficulty of doing so, legitimately that is, or the enormous differences in clinical presentation between autism and a mitochondrial disorder severe enough to lead to encephalopathy.    Prometheus has a comprehensive overview of the subject at: http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=149,    \u25a0 Kirby quoting Dr Bernadine Healy: \u201cOfficials have been too quick to dismiss the hypothesis as 'irrational,' without sufficient studies of causation, without studying the population that got sick.\u201d  \u201cYou can\u2019t rely solely on epidemiology to solve a physiological mystery; we have to look at the kids. And then she said, and I think we should all take this to heart, \u201cNever turn your back on any scientific hypothesis because you are afraid of what it might show.\u201d Canard #7 The powers that be, that is, CDC, FDA, AAP, WHO and the IOM are afraid to look at vaccines and autism for fear of what they might find.  This is a peculiar statement by Healy, not corroborated by a single supporting syllable, and is quite possibly the most foolhardy motherhood statement this lady has yet made in a long career of making similarly stupid statements about a variety of topics.   Fortunately, upon enquiry, the IOM were quite willing to offer the salutary corrective to Healy\u2019s nonsense.  See: http://autism-myths.org/2008/11/the-iom-are-afraid-to-look-at-susceptibility-groups/  There are undoubtedly many more myths, distortions of facts, fabrications I\u2019ve missed in Kirby\u2019s one hour long presentation to the US Congress.   He did not apparently come away unscathed.  One senator\u2019s aide managed to pull him up on at least one occasion.  However, as one can see, it takes quite a bit to dispel the whole of it and Kirby no doubt relies on not many having sufficient information to be able to assess the magnitude of his mythology.   Is this man a dastardly cur, with no respect for data and no moral compass?  Perhaps, but I think it far more likely that he\u2019s simply entirely self-serving and with a marked tendency to regard truth as entirely relative.  In other words, he\u2019s his own PR flack and a bona fide Po Mo enthusiast. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/11/david-kirby-pr-flack-and-pomo.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t David Kirby, PR Flack and PoMo Enthusiast\n\t                       \n                          "},

She always fought for the betterment of people, and not the detriment. More than that, she was a woman who deeply touched those around her everywhere she went.  And she was the most wonderful wife and mother that anyone could have asked for.  We shall leave the blog existing as it stands as a memory to the hard work and dedication Alyric put in for a cause she truly believed in.

{"date": " August 01, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   25 July 2008 Dr D Walker Dean Faculty of Health Sciences Queen's University, 18 Barrie Street, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6  Dear Dr Walker Researchers pulling back the veil on adult autism is the remarkably misleading title of an article published in the Vancouver Sun on July 20 and prominently featuring Dr Deborah Elliot of Queens University. I attach a copy of the article's text for your reference. This article purports to be all about research outcomes in adult autism. In reality it is a series of unsupported ugly statements promoting the worst stereotypes of autism to be found anywhere. Some were contributed by Dr Elliot herself, among which:  \u201cThey may be able to get an advanced degree, but once employed they can't interact with their co-workers in a normal way. There's no normal coffee chit-chat, Elliott explains. They sometimes ask embarrassing questions and easily lose their tempers.\u201d The sheer superficiality of this statement leaves me breathless. However, my real concern is that future employers and others who may relate to my offspring will have read this unbalanced piece and her life will be that much harder. For the record, lots of people make embarrassing statements and lose their temper. They have no label. Further, there is a good case to be made about the abnormalities of 'normal coffee chit chat' given the frequency of backbiting, character assassination and any number of pathological outcomes  \u201cBut they often don't come to the attention of mental health experts until they're reprimanded at work for making an inappropriate comment, or charged with harassing or stalking.\u201d.  Dr Elliot is claiming a serious confound for adult autism, namely harassing and stalking behaviours, which has no research support anywhere. Again, my chief concern is for the future of my offspring who will have to deal with these manufactured prejudices. It appears that the author of this piece has used Dr Elliot and by extension Queens University to give credence to the most sensationalist and thoroughly unsupported statements. It does not appear that Dr Elliot read the finished article. Otherwise, how could an academic with any reputation condone the following glib offering? \u201cOr the office clerk who beat up a woman on his way to the bus stop one morning for the simple reason she was in his way. He was obsessed with not walking on the cracks between the tiles on the sidewalk. \u201c This suggests rather strongly that adult autistics are likely to beat up any mere stranger for no apparent reason. Simply to leave such a statement in an article is to peddle prejudice. How does anyone know the reliability of this account? The journalist is no guide. She has taken as her source, Karen Rodman of FAAAS (original title: Families of Adults Afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome). FAAAS is simply a hate site, replete with innuendo, anecdote from dubious sources, liberally mixed with the glue of garden variety spite. Dr Elliot could have taken some care not to be seen in the same article or at least, not to endorse some of their more extreme positions. This article likes to portray violence as a feature of the autistic profile and it is a common enough gambit among budding but unscrupulous researchers and journalists. I refer you to some real research on the subject - Murrie, Warren, Kristiansson, & Dietz, 2002 and Barry-Walsh & Mullen, 2004. There is no connection whatsoever between violence and autism above what is to be found in the general population.  Imagine my surprise to see the following profile of Dr Elliot as a research participant for The South Eastern Ontario Community \u2013 University Research Alliance in Intellectual Disabilities. \u201cHer interests include advocacy for vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities, the homeless and people with severe and persistent mental illnesses \u201c The hypocrisy is self evident.  I and my autistic offspring, indeed the entire autistic community would take it as a great favour if Queen's University and the research consortium would withdraw its support for this article's gross mischaracterisation of a very complex condition and notify the paper of such. The editor's details are as follows: Patricia Graham Editor in Chief, Vancouver Sun Address: #1 - 200 Granville Street, Vancouver BC V6C 3N3, Canada Phone: 604-605-2318 Fax: 604-605-2668  This article and Dr Elliot's participation in it are in direct violation of Queen's University's own policy statement on harassment and discrimination, a fine irony given Dr Elliot's assertion that harassment is such a feature of autism.

{"date": " January 03, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The National Research Council, 2001 review of developments in autism research titled \u201cEducating Children with Autism\u201d noted the following: \u201cAlthough several of these literatures [developmental, neurological, behavioral, epidemiological] appear to be internally well integrated, there is remarkably little integration across literatures. For example, the information from the literature describing characteristics of children with autistic spectrum disorders is often not linked to treatment programs. Likewise, the developmental literature, which is descriptive in nature, has only rarely been integrated into individual intervention practice research, which tends to be behaviorally oriented\u201d Since 2001 there has been nothing in the literature to suggest that the intervention research community has taken a cooperative turn and adorned their efforts with results from areas in psychology other than their own.  Factionalism remains rife and for good reason.  Not one of the interventions on offer to educate autistic children has a sound theoretical and conceptual framework based on replicable scientific experimentation such that the results remain undisputed by the research community as a whole.   Most (more likely all) are essentially based on some plausible concept that started as somebody\u2019s bright idea and never developed empirical legs further.   That applies to applied behavioral analytic approaches as much as any other.  Professor John Mill\u2019s scholarly tome,  \u201cControl  - A History of Behavioral Psychology\u201d carefully elaborates the scientific pretensions of the field [1].   In short, as far as research directions in autism are concerned, there are PhD theses aplenty in simply examining the lack of empirical foundation of any of the interventions currently on offer.  I propose that there is a far more urgent necessity to address a practice in the field that is currently used in practically all interventions no matter the label, has an enormous potential to inflict damage considering the very young ages at which intervention is now targeted and is based on no empirical foundation whatsoever.  It is practically axiomatic in the field of special education and foundational in behavior analytic approaches that all teaching tasks are broken down into discrete steps, at least initially, and carefully delivered to the student in a highly controlled step-wise manner.  In behavior analytic terms this allows for controlled reinforcement at each step of the process.  The justification for this is that autistic students have a problem with over-selectivity, that is, they focus on details at the expense of the larger picture and irrelevant details at that.    However, the literature, such as it is, does not support that position at all and there is data, both research and anecdotal that suggest the universality of this approach is not warranted.  Most studies on stimulus over-selectivity have found some people with autism who have not responded overselectively (and yet have all/most of the above features of autism). It has also been found that many people without disabilities show evidence of overselective responding but none of the features of autism (e.g., Koegel & Wilhelm, 1973 [2]; Lovaas & Schreibman, 1971[3]).  Over-selectivity is not a consistent feature of autism.  Anecdotally, it appears that autistic children can and do learn very well in the absence of intervention as the following parental accounts relate, thus negating an often used rationale of interventions that autistic children (all of them) cannot learn at all without such careful scaffolding. \u201cEvery single thing she knows, she learned from ABA. This is fact. Except for the things that seem to be her gifts. She spelled words with refrigerator magnets long before ABA therapy. She plays the piano almost in spite of ABA therapy. She taught herself to read without the use of ABA therapy. Adding and subtracting. She was obsessed with numbers and sequences of numbers before ABA.\u201d [4] \u201cBetween 18 months and 2 years old Jaden started doing some pretty amazing things. Like just about every kid his age, he had one of those foam alphabets that fit inside a foam frame. One day on a whim Debi took the frame away and left him with just a jumbled pile of letters. Jaden proceeded to put the letters in order just as fast as we would do it the very first time.\u201d [5] A second research effort suggests that rather than being limited to a detail oriented approach to learning it may well be that autistics have the option of using a top down as well as a bottom up approach.  On perception tasks involving categorization, Soulieres et al 2007 [6], concluded that the influence of categories may be optional in autistics, while being mandatory in non-autistics. The evidence behind what appears to be a very sensible approach to learning in autistic individuals is not what it should be and there are plentiful indicators that the appearance of sense could be misleading.  I would like to see some real dollars spent on this one area.  It really is time that \u2018evidence-based\u2019 had some basis in fact.   Consider that it is generally recognized that pattern recognition is a relative strength for autistic spectrum folks and that the piecemeal dissemination of material effectively deprives those folks of access to sufficient material to access the pattern.  Ideally, it would be of considerable benefit if research could identify for the child whether or not their learning style is congruent with a step by step approach before that approach is implemented.

{"date": " October 19, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   MacFabe et al\u2019s paper  \u201cNeurobiological effects of intraventricular propionic acid in rats: Possible role of short chain fatty acids on the pathogenesis and characteristics of autism spectrum disorders\u201d concluded the following:         \u201cWe propose that some types of autism may be partial forms of genetically inherited or acquired disorders involving altered PPA metabolism. Thus, intraventricular administration of PPA in rats may provide a means to model some aspects of human ASD in rats.\u201d         The form of this research is peculiar.     The paper cites 190 references.    Not one refers to any data with the actual levels of PPA in stool, urine, serum or CSF in autistic children.    Instead, the research moves immediately to the deaths of 74 rats and a sophisticated appraisal of their demise.    Naturally the exercise involves the gainful employment of a number of psychologists and the acquisition of considerable expertise in histochemistry, brain imaging and other useful techniques.    One might speculate that the reason for this omission \u2013 an actual and factual basis for the research, might be that a negative or ambivalent result could seriously undermine the rationale of the experiment in the minds of potential funders.           The authors lean heavily on the heterogeneous nature of autism pointing to the all-purpose \u2018some children with ASD\u2019 without in any way specifying the characteristics of the sub-group to which their thesis might be relevant.    In politics this would be called plausible deniability.       In this paper it takes the form of assembling a pastiche of vague resemblances between propionic acidemia and some aspects of ASDs with blurring of the obvious differences especially at points that are crucial to the authors\u2019 thesis.             The most obvious example is the descriptor of ASD as a movement disorder citing an opinion piece which uses gait as the measure of dysfunctional movement.    In those affected with inborn errors of PPA metabolism the movement disorder takes a very defined, involuntary and severe form  \u2013  choreoathetosis , which in no way is equivalent to the ataxia of gait movement in ASD.         I refer the reader to  Leary and Hill 1996  for the definitive description of ataxia as it affects folks on the autistic spectrum. In the same vein, gastrointestinal disturbances among the autistic population are quite cavalierly equated with the severe vomiting evident among those with propionic acidemia, which has hitherto, not been mentioned as being relevant to the ASD population.       Neither are autistics or any subgroup thereof known to have such a complete loss of appetite as to require feeding tubes, a clinical feature of propionic acidemia.         The list of symptoms  associated with errors of propionic acid metabolism is as follows:    Seizures        Reduced      muscle tone   Impaired      immune system   Skin rash   Hearing      loss   Hair      loss   Mental      retardation   Vomiting        High blood ammonia level  Acidosis        Propionic      acidemia      It takes more than a little academic spandex to see autism in this list.    The logical conclusion of such an equivalence would be that all persons with propionic acidemia would be classified as autistic and the most severely autistic at that.    The literature makes no mention of autism in relation to this population.    The second pillar of the experimental effort is the use of the behaviour of rats, injected with propionic acid directly into the brain as proof of the link between autism and inborn errors of propionic acid metabolism.     The flaws in this argument are legion.    The exposure limit for humans to propionic acid, a  chemical labelled corrosive, is 10 PPM.     This is set to guard against damage to skin and mucosal tissue.    It was not set for the \u2018direct injection into the brain\u2019 scenario.    The low dose the rat got in each injection was around this level and the high dose around five times that level.     Most of the paper and its conclusions dwell on the response of the rat to these injections, with much made of the inflammatory response, the seizures and so on.    Inject a rat with a corrosive substance, directly into the brain, at a level known to cause damage to human skin and what else could one expect?                There are two cogent reasons to reject the author\u2019s interpretation of the observable movement of the mice following PPA injection.    Firstly, who is to say that the movements observed are not characteristic of choreoathetosis in rats?    No compelling reason is given.    Secondly,  the cerebral organization of rats and men differs markedly  and not just in size.     The authors noted that cell densities are greater in autistic populations but failed to mention that the organizing structure, the mini-column varies from  species to species.    Given the differing structural arrangements, the validity of  rat  models for complex multi-factorial    behaviours such as social interactions or even the presumably less complex \u2018movement behaviour\u2019 is highly questionable.    The model is extremely weak and as such, the authors have made the basic error of attempting to validate a hypothesis through the use of a very poor analogue, a logical impossibility.      In point of fact, what these authors have attempted to do points to a wider concern in certain sections of brain research.            I have no quarrel with animal studies per se.    The 2007 Nobel Prize for Medicine was given to  Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies for their pioneering development of knockout gene technology.    That technology led to the development of over 500 different rodent models of various disorders having a genetic basis.    The expected and indeed valid utility of these models lies in being able to assess the physiological effects of genetic manipulation.    But this is not what MacFabe and any number of others are doing.    They have conceived the entirely invalid notion of assuming an etiology, that is, assuming the genetic aberration and then using some aspect of animal behaviour to validate their notions.      This seems to get the method exactly backwards \u2013 using the behaviour to finger the gene(s) and using behaviour from animal populations that, cognitively at any rate, we have little in common.     Cohen  sums up the problems of this approach as follow:         \u201cTo speak of \"drug cravings\" in animal addicts made physiologically dependent on drugs, to speak of animals forced to drink alcohol as \"being high,\" to consider an \"opponent-process theory of acquired motivation\" as having anything to do with the etiology of drug addiction, to refer to monkeys taught learned helplessness as being \"depressed,\" to conclude that primates undergoing deprivation are \"schizophrenic,\" and to label animals traumatized in laboratories as \"neurotic,\" is to disdain epistemology, indulge in self-serving fantasy, demean proper scientific exploration, obfuscate the significance of empirical facts, and manipulate, mislead, and delude everyone.\u201d                 What applies to other \u2018isms\u2019 of psychology applies equally well to autism.       Principles of model validation in this area require three things apparently; face validity \u2013 does it look like what the model stands for, construct validity \u2013 a common etiology really and predictive validity, which is self explanatory.    MacFabe\u2019s work fails on all three counts.     There is no particular reason to believe that the results of this work are anything other than what would be expected from propionic acidemic rats and no particular reason to believe that the movements, seizures or brain abnormalities of these mice resemble autism.              However, this work was published and will henceforth bear the title \u2018peer reviewed\u2019.      It might be only this branch of the research community, but I get the strong impression that there is a gentleman\u2019s agreement among the members: I won\u2019t spit on your research if you don\u2019t spit on mine.    There is no peer review.    There is no chance that this paper could float on the  Dead Sea , the holes are so large.    As such it is poised to do a lot of damage, to autistic children and by extension to their families.    That is to be expected from bad Science, the inevitable result of nothing much in the way of ethics, like reasonable grounds for a host of assumptions.            The treatment of propionic acidemia usually involves large doses of carnitine in an attempt to clear the buildup of toxic metabolites.    Carnitine is also used in the diet industry because it raises the metabolic rate.    A common side effect is sleep disturbance and for a sizeable number of already sleep disturbed spectrumites, this would not be a good thing.    What chance that parents won\u2019t jump on this research and immediately start treatment?    Other forms of damage include the waste of material resources, which could be better spent elsewhere and future time and resources wasted on refuting speculative hypotheses.            Spot the Leech.         I think we can expect a large number of research initiatives like this one.    Many will want to hitch their research wagon to the rising autism funding star.    This paper, a dead loss in many respects, redeems itself slightly by having in one place a large number of the characteristics to be expected in research paradigms grafted haphazardly on to autism.         The research is judged      \u2018preliminary\u2019.    True, and there it      will remain but in the meantime this is a general disclaimer to shield the      authors from any and all repercussions. In much the same vein as      [1], the hypothesis will be so general that there is no data the      experiment can produce that could falsify it.    In the same vein as [1]      and [2], the target population will be defined as a subgroup of the      autistic population, any subgroup of the autistic population, which will      remain undefined. The number of weasel word      statements (may, possibly, could be associated with) will outstrip the      number of definitive statements by a considerable margin.     Occasionally the authors slip and a      possibility becomes transformed into a definite at the stroke of a pen.   Non sequitur conclusions will be      plentiful.     In this paper, one      example takes the form that some autistics have seizures as do those with      propionic acidemia, therefore they are related or could be.    What remains missing is the link.    Selective citation -      debatable interpretations will be strengthened by the omission of      reference data, which could suggest a more reasonable alternative.    Of, the many examples in this paper, the      conflation of \u2018gastro-intestinal disturbances\u2019 between the PPA crowd and      the autism crowd without in any way pointing out the vast differences in      the details is a notable example. References are bountiful      but many (most) are not particularly relevant to the actual hypothesis and      some will not be mentioned in the body of the text at all.     A perusal of this paper\u2019s references      reveals that many citations are not referenced in the actual text. Last but not least, there will be great emphasis placed on the future benefits to be derived from this research and if the research is an animal model methodology, equal emphasis on the undeniable fact that this research could not possibly be done on humans. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://psychology.uwo.ca/pdfs/autism/MacFabe%20etal07.pdf", "http://www.wemove.org/choreoathetosis/", "http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ518048&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&accno=EJ518048", "http://www.newbornscreening.info/Parents/organicaciddisorders/PA.html#1", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/seizures.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/muscle_weakness.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/immune_deficiency.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/rash.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/hearing_loss.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/hair_loss.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/mental_retardation.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/vomiting.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/acidosis.htm", "http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/p/propionic_academia/intro.htm", "http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/englishhtml/p6643.htm", "http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/5/935", "http://www.chai-online.org/en/campaigns/alternatives/campaigns_alt_cohen_i.htm"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2007/10/macfabe-et-als-paper-neurobiological.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Ethics: Nil - Science: Bad - Outcomes: Poor\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " June 20, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Every now and then I level some criticism in the general direction of  ABA  as a method of enhancing the well-being of autistic children.     And generally the motivation to do so comes from what I consider quite fraudulent claims made by  ABA  proponents that they are, \u2018scientific\u2019 in either principle or method (they claim both), effective for everyone and/or more effective than any other teaching method out there.     None of those claims stand up to scrutiny and yet they are all of them commonly cited.     That  ABA  therapists readily claim them is quite congruent with the aspirations of that field.    That those claims are broadcast with what appears to be autistic support is a bit more worrisome.     I really believe that autistic self-advocates have to be very careful about what they are seen to be endorsing.     \u201c Behavior Therapy for Children with ASD\u201d by Zosia Zaks  contains most of those fraudulent claims thereby authenticating methods which really should be overhauled and preventing the development of teaching methods, which might, for a change, start out with autistic perceptions and learning styles as a foundation.     It\u2019s the latter point I worry about most.    ABA, because of its non-scientific methods and narrow base just is not capable of incorporating new material into the repertoire, especially material that is not a good fit for the standard reinforceable step-wise approach of shaping, chaining and so on.             For the record I\u2019m no expert when it comes to  ABA , which got me thinking about what constitutes being an expert in any field really.     Among my rambling cogitation, I came to the conclusion that an essential element is that the subject is one\u2019s life\u2019s work.    Unless the person lives breathes and works in that area, I doubt that they could develop the necessary depth of approach to the subject matter to be a reliable expert.    Not, mind you that this necessarily confers truth value to their ruminations.     There are experts in phrenology and homeopathy, for example.    I also don\u2019t believe that an academic qualification necessarily confers all that much gloss to the expertise.    It might and in some fields may even be considered necessary but it is not in my opinion always a necessity for expertise.      History has too many exceptions.    Michael Faraday comes to mind.         Looking around the myriad  Hub bloggers  it appears we have just two \u2018experts\u2019 in  ABA , Janna Hoskins and Interverbal, both with the necessary immersion.    This is or was their life\u2019s work.    They really know about this stuff.    Not that there aren\u2019t a number of gifted amateurs out there.    There are; it\u2019s just that  ABA  isn\u2019t their life\u2019s work.    I also think that knowing a good deal about behaviorism in general and ABA in particular is something of a necessity if you\u2019re into autism advocacy and it doesn\u2019t much matter which PDD label applies to you and yours either.         And back to the claims made in this paper in the order in which they appear. The best thing about ABA is that it works with everyone\" This statement was made not by a professional, but a parent, and one rather prone to overstatement.  However, that does not absolve the author of this paper of the responsibility for allowing such a nonsensical claim to pass unchallenged.  The one thing that is known about ABA is that it does not work with everyone.  Every study ever done has a sizeable minority of children for whom this intervention did precisely nothing in any domain; language living skills or IQ.   There are very few (I think the number remains at 1) scientific studies of the effectiveness of ABA.  Smith Groen Wynn 2000,  a properly randomised controlled study of ABA had 2/13 children who made it to mainstream classes without an aide but showed no improvement on any other measure.    Not only does this intervention not work for everyone but it also does not work for everything.    Sallows and Graupner's  study had a minority of children who appeared to regress entirely.  The most famous study of the ineffectiveness of ABA was  Smith et al 1997.    An archival study, he looked at a group of children whose IQs were judged too low for them to be a part of the original Lovaas study.  The results after two years of intensive therapy  were disheartening.    Yet, a number of professionals cite ABA as the method of choice for those with severe cognitive challenges.  The evidence says otherwise.    \u201cApplied      Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a scientific discipline that seeks to      understand and improve behavior using data and scientific methods.\u201d                     I got motivated into having a closer look at  ABA  partly because the therapeutic aspects of intervention for autism were dominated by this bit of psychology and by an Ipsos Reid poll conducted in  Canada  for FEATBC.     That poll insisted repeatedly that  ABA  was \u2018scientific\u2019, so naturally the intervention was steeped in the scientific method.     Skeptical me said \u2013 really?    And six months later having waded though swathes of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis and the Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behavior and the writings of a number of behaviorist luminaries, I  concluded, in a few thousand words,  that  the trouble with a therapy framed around a na\u00efve inductivism operating in a form of Jamesian Pragmatism is that it\u2019s a long way from what a scientist would recognise as the scientific method.    This was one very weird form of Science bearing at best only a very superficial likeness and really quite removed in its experimental set up from the scientific method.      Now, I am not an expert in this, but  Professor John A Mills,  formerly of the  University  of  Saskatchewan  is and he said quite a few things about the pretensions of behaviorism among which:         \u201cLogically, one can detect four flaws in the reasoning of behavior modifiers.    First, they tend to confuse mere associative with causal relationships.    Second, they are guilty of the inductive fallacy.    Third, they fail to distinguish between necessary and sufficient causes.    Fourth, they make the error of denying the antecedent.\u201d [p 170]                In my view, behaviorism does for psychology what Aristotle did for Science \u2013 gets you the four element model of the universe - based on careful observation.    The more I read about this psychological oddity behaviorism, the more fascinating it got.     Far from the promised evidence- based, steeped in science intervention, the empirical basis, such as it is rests on limited animal studies and the philosophical basis of the rationale for extending the animal studies to humans rests on trendy atheism, circa 1950.     Jack Michael, the behaviorist noted for resurrecting \u2018Verbal Behavior\u2019 following Chomsky\u2019s devastating critique  admitted quite openly  that the principles of operant conditioning were never tested on animals more sophisticated than one species of rat and one species of pigeon.         \u201cFirst, the vigorous applied approach called behavior modification developed without the benefit of any appreciable laboratory research with humans. At the beginning (the late fifties and early sixties), it was a direct attempt to use operant, animal-laboratory methods and concepts to alter socially important human behavior. The relevance of these concepts to human behavior was taken for granted by the behavior modifiers, as it was in Skinner's    Science and Human Behavior (1953),\u201d         In 1950 and in most Humanities department since, to be a Deist, and to espouse those values was deemed simply incompatible with intelligent discourse.    The intelligentsia were atheists.     Mankind operated in the same evolutionary manner as other species and inconvenient attributes such as altruism or creativity would be explained eventually.      There was no such thing as personal responsibility because that implied free will and that belonged to an antiquated religious past.    In this climate, behaviourism looked perfectly at home and its offspring,  ABA  wouldn\u2019t have raised an eyebrow.    I wonder how many therapists tell their clients that doing  ABA  Monday to Friday and synagogue/church on Saturday/Sunday is a contradiction in terms?         \u201c If      the behavior under investigation is hurting the person, hurting others, or      is in some way ineffective, behaviorists encourage, model, teach, and      provide incentives for new more adaptive behaviors.\u201d         In other words, practically any behavior can be deemed worthy of changing and since behaviorists do not think that the person is important, merely the environment their reasons for a behavior happening are restricted a priori (and therefore unscientifically) to a fixed and fairly short laundry list.     For a behaviorist what people do is  usually to get something, avoid something, gain attention or escape from something.    So paying attention to the attributes of the actual person in front of them doesn\u2019t happen and because of that they are more than capable of replacing adaptive behaviours with others deemed more socially acceptable but in reality more obstructive to the autistic person\u2019s ability to learn.     Diminishing a person\u2019s capacity to cope with their environment surely undermines their learning.    Take gaze avoidance, long known to be quite important in improving cognitive processing of auditory data in children.    What do  ABA  therapists do with that?\u2013 insist on eye contact as the first step in \u2018learning how to learn\u2019 and call upon a species of group think, \u2018social validity\u2019 as the rationale for doing so.            \u201c ABA  has the greatest      research base so far\u201d.         Yes, but the quality is terrible.    500 or so single subject research studies don\u2019t amount to much since they fail to control for so many variables.     My take on this as  I\u2019ve written elsewhere  is that the results from interventions depend entirely on the attributes of the child, not the intervention.    When the results suggest otherwise, it\u2019s a pretty clear indication that group assignment wasn\u2019t random.              \u201c[O      Ivar Lovaas] ..was one of the first professionals to suggest that autistic      children could learn and should not be routinely insitutionalised.\u201d           OK, this article has now descended into dishonesty on a scale not usually offered to parents by other than snake oil salesmen.     Have these behaviorists not read  Kanner?     Is there any indication whatsoever that these children somehow cannot learn?     Of all the lies proffered to parents, this is one of the most destructive and these are supposed \u2018therapists\u2019.    They need immediate remediation.     As for re-writing the  history of Ivar Lovaas\u2019,  his reasons for treating autistic children had nothing to do with altruism and everything to do with his language research.      Rick and Pam went straight back to the institution when Lovaas had finished with them.         \u201c He      wrote a pivotal 1987 report claiming that roughly 40% of the children in      one of his programs ( 9 out of 19) became \u201cindistinguishable from their      peers\u201d         Victoria Shea wrote an  equally pivotal paper  debunking that claim.     She took the time to read McEachin\u2019s PhD thesis and lo and behold, only one child scored in the normal range on all the tests.    No one took any data from their teachers, though their input is frequently claimed.    This reminds me of Jane Gross\u2019s  article  on autistic childrens\u2019 troubles in school post treatment.    While the parents called them \u2018recovered\u2019 apart from some trifling social problems, it was readily apparent that their peers thought quite otherwise.         \u201c      the question is not about the ethics of  ABA ,      but about the ethics of some professionals who provide  ABA  services\u201d         When an appeal to ethics or efficacy rests not on the therapy but on the therapist, one should be very skeptical.      It seems to me that  ABA  proponents are far too ready to blame all the failures (both ethics and efficacy) on the therapist and all the successes on the therapy.     The ethical confound of behavioral intervention is that the method has no foundation, scientific or otherwise and therefore unproven methods are being used on very small children.     The neat trick is that in riding roughshod over hyperlexic preferences and/or artificially manipulating the error rate for someone who learns only by making every mistake in the book (it\u2019s a kind of learning by learning where the boundaries are) - if that leads to damage, diminished capacity for learning or whatever, the therapy is never to blame \u2013 it\u2019s the therapist.     Is that the dream therapeutic environment or what?     It works! \u2013 thank the Goddess for the therapy!    It doesn\u2019t work! \u2013 it\u2019s the therapist!      Aversives are also unethical but that is only one part of the ethical challenges of  ABA  and not the major one in my view.            \u201c  ABA  therapists use a      variety of teaching strategies, including prompting, cueing, modeling,      shaping and chaining...... Yet many people think the only  ABA  teaching method      is Discrete Trial Training or DTT for short.\u201d         Except for modeling, I thought that the rest were very much a part of DTT.    Nobody ever questions that DTT, the foundational platform for  ABA  is really the Skinner box in action for humans.     The minimalist environment is not there to save the client from unnecessary distraction.     It\u2019s there to prevent the client from exhibiting any behaviour but the one under the set stimulus control \u2013 the \u2018lawful\u2019 behaviour.     But parents and beginning therapists will be told that this is the key to learning for ASD children.     The  ABA  industry did try to cloak this learning environment in scientific garb by maintaining that ASD children had a particular problem with \u2018stimulus over-selectivity\u2019.     That gave them a rationale for breaking things down into very small steps, which had the bonus that each tiny step could be reinforced.    This manoeuvre is called shaping and there\u2019s a bit of chaining in there as well usually.     You can get a pigeon to do a figure of eight with these methods.    Should you get human children to do the same?  There is no evidence that overselectivity  is the case for ASD children and some that it definitely is not the case.    You don\u2019t have to be ASD to have a problem with this.      So, since there\u2019s no empirical basis for these methods why are they used at all?    Good question and the possible answer I can come up with is that psychology having left behaviorism to history\u2019s wastebasket didn\u2019t have a problem leaving ASD children in the same wastebasket.    There was even a bonus.     Psychology, even now, is considered a social science and the hallmark of the social sciences is the \u2018schools of thought phenomenon\u2019.      In that schema several competing paradigms can happily coexist, each with their own theory, arcane language, praxis and adherents.    Behaviorists still inhabit a chapter of the Psychological Society and still have to be accommodated professionally.    So they were left the hard cases \u2013 the mentally ill and the developmentally delayed.    Through the sixties and seventies, their work with the mentally ill, though heavily criticized, was allowed to continue.    What brought that branch of behavior modification to a halt was not the criticism but the closure of large institutions.     For those who fondly believe that the APA or the APS are going to make a real effort to reform the Judge Rotenburg Centre in line with its own policies, I would point to the history, which says that is unlikely to happen though the appearance of an attempt may occur if they can be embarrassed into it.            Some      critics say the use of drills and rewards makes children in  ABA  programs      robotic.....The problem may also be due to a lack of skills      generalization.\u201d         Logically, or so it seems to me, if the learning is so artificial that it makes no sense whatsoever, then nothing has been learnt at all that is in any way useful.     So learning is equivalent to generalization or lack of generalization indicates that nothing has been learnt.      Once again, when this question arises, we have the ready explanation that this is a therapist \u2018gone bad\u2019.         \u201c    basic skills of imitating, attending,      learning how to learn and liking learning\u201d         With the greatest respect for Dr Kristina Chew, this is  ABA  basic speak.     How does one assess \u2018learning how to learn\u2019 or \u2018liking learning\u2019 for that matter?    Who says and where is the evidence that autistic children learn or can learn well through imitation?     Could a child who does learn readily in this way be considered autistic at all?    Because a typically developing child learns this way should we assume that this is a missing developmental step and supplying the lacking skill will remediate the problem?     Perhaps it is a very inefficient way for autistic children to learn.    One thing that all current interventions have in common \u2013 none are based on what we know of the perceptual styles of autistic children, including their manner of \u2018attending\u2019. In fact the  NRC report of 2001  was highly critical of the \u2018ne\u2019er the twain shall meet\u2019 gulf between research and intervention.          Dian      Keller.....\u201dshe is in the fourth grade at a regular school with no pull      outs.... very verbal, happy and healthy.\u201d         I draw attention to this because the phenomenon is pervasive.    It\u2019s not lying, exactly \u2013 just stretching the truth in what the parent believes is a good cause would be my guess.    The \u2018no pull outs\u2019 and \u2018happy and healthy\u2019 state of her daughter doesn\u2019t quite gel with her earlier statement    \u201cwhose now 10 year old daughter sees ABA professionals weekly in addition to follow-up therapy at home.\u201d    This isn\u2019t all that blatant compared to say Kit Weintraub efforts in that direction, but it doesn\u2019t persuade me that she\u2019s quite as healthy as advertised.          \u201cWhere      a non-invasive desensitization program procedure could open up a wealth of      choices.....The child\u2019s world is larger; he has fewer things to be      stressed about and more things to enjoy\u201d.         Earlier I broached the idea that aversives were for me at least, not the core ethical issue with  ABA .    I think it\u2019s the lack of an acceptable empirical foundation for its practices that I find unethical and more unethical to subject a small child to \u2018desensitization\u2019 procedures of dubious and unproven efficacy in the name of \u2018choices\u2019 but not the child\u2019s choices, obviously.     Where exactly is the evidence that  ABA  offers \u2018desensitisation\u2019?     I had thought that  ABA  poured scorn and vitriol on desensitization procedures employed under the aegis of occupational therapists.    What if it\u2019s merely training a small child to ignore discomfort for your benefit?     In which case, what have you taught the child apart from expecting the child to learn in less than ideal conditions.    Maybe the take home message indelibly etched on that child\u2019s mind     is that they don\u2019t matter and that external appearance but not the reality is of prime importance.    Realistically, this child now has a lot more to be stressed about and fewer things he will be able to enjoy because there is no proof that a few M & Ms can overcome any degree of tactile defensiveness.    The other lesson in this is teaching not just the child but also the parents very poor problem solving strategies.    Seems like the waste of a teachable moment to me.    Here the child learns only that people are shallow.    They are but he or she could also learn to approach \u2018appropriate\u2019 clothing systematically.    One can never learn too much about the necessity for camouflage.    However, it does not have to be uncomfortable camouflage.             \u201cCertain      ABA techniques such as modeling, visual schedules and step by step skill      acquisition are particularly useful, since autistic children tend to be      weak in executive functioning areas like planning, organization and      problem solving and strong in visual learning.\u201d         Quite possibly none of that list is accurate except the last point about visual learning and that would not be universal.      Fred Volkmar wrote  a really good review  of what\u2019s happening in autism and he made the point that the attribution of deficits to autism like those above tend to be based on very little data.      Claims like these need to be checked.     The  chapter on Learning in Autism  available online would be good checking source as well as anything that  Dr Morton Ann Gernsbacher  has on her site.    It is also noteworthy that  ABA  is incapable of generating any of that list.    That style of research doesn\u2019t fit their paradigm.    Professor Mills characterized it as \u2018corrosively constricted\u2019.         The last point made was that  ABA  has evolved and learnt new child-focused ways of doing things.    If by evolved, they mean co-opting the parental handbook and borrowing freely from TEACCH, Floortime and NET to fit in with standard speech language pathology praxis, then they have indeed evolved but it\u2019s a Lamarckian rather than Darwinian form of evolution.     What they have done is effectively obliterated opportunities for operant conditioning to occur and I think that is a very good thing.     I\u2019m with Deci and Ryan \u2013 rewards can seriously mess with learning, albeit only to a point.    Lisa Jo Rudy of autismabout.com made a comment that the good therapists are very much alike in how they do things regardless of the label on the lapel and that\u2019s a comfort.     The other source of comfort is \u201cThe Myth of the First Three Years\u2019, which should be required reading for those expounding the short \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 drivel.    Brains are malleable and stay that way for far longer than folks are implying.    Interestingly the kinds of things for which a window of opportunity may exist are vision and grammar (up to puberty).        In the scheme of things, autistic advocates could make a push for just one thing intervention wise \u2013 \u2018evidence please\u2019.    That applies to every intervention out there not just  ABA  and we should be a lot more insistent about it than we have been.    This and that \u2018treatment\u2019 \u2122 are usually nothing more than commodified common sense that someone thinks they can sell at a premium.     So the only way to prod them into doing what might be some good is to be highly critical of their foundations and insistent that they do incorporate what is known.      \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismdigest.com/past_issues/JanFebDigest2008.htm", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10934569", "http://www.asatonline.org/pdf/Sallows-Graupner2005.pdf", "http://aaidd.allenpress.com/aamronline/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1352%2F0895-8017%281997%29102%3C0238:IBTFPW%3E2.0.CO%3B2", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10934569", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Control-Behavioral-Psychology-John-Mills/dp/0814756123", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1348108", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1965.html", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/library_kanner_1965.html", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1297900", "http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/4/349", "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/health/26autism.html?_r=1&oref=slogin", "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/health/26autism.html?_r=1&oref=slogin", "http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309072697", "http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/neuroimg/publications/AutismReviewJCCPJan04.pdf", "http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf", "http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/MGcover.html"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/06/review-behavior-therapy-for-children.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Review:  Behavior Therapy for Children with ASD\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " December 23, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Courtesy of the local library, I now have temporary copy of Jenny McCarthy\u2019s \u201cMother Warriors\u201d.   I have also read Paul Offit\u2019s \u201cAutism\u2019s False Prophets\u2019, which is quite a different book and of a quality several orders of magnitude above this attempt at down home intimacy on behalf of McCarthy. I thought I\u2019d review this book to answer one question.  Based on the contents, would it influence the reader to look favourably at the Petitioners case at the Autism Omnibus Proceedings (AOP)? After all, that vaccines cause autism is the central thesis of this book and the AOP. Perhaps unusually, the review should start with the introduction by Dr Jay Gordon, paediatrician and Evan McCarthy\u2019s physician.   In the same earthy tones that characterise the bulk of this book, Dr Gordon makes a series of quite remarkable statements.   No doubt they are meant to be provocative, which serves many purposes, obscuring the absurdity of the actual statement being one of them.  There is a deliberate lack of editing in this book, I think, again to keep that provocative edge as a substitute for a more robust foundation. 1. Introduction, Dr Jay Gordon. If there are \u201cA\u201d to \u201cD\u201d list celebrities in Hollywood, I think it likely that there are parallel hierarchies among the professions serving them.  Dr Gordon is unlikely to be among the first tier of paediatricians, judging from the Introduction.  He makes the following assertions: 1. \u201cThe AAP and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are filled with doctors who not only don\u2019t believe the ideas in this book  but actively ridicule them and spend a lot of money trying to disprove the causes and treatments so well presented when Jenny McCarthy and others in the cure-autism community speak and write\u201d. OK, so mainstream science has not adopted the vaccines cause autism thesis.  And his point would be?   Why should they, when the evidence from a great many sources, says there is no link.   Note that the AAP wouldn\u2019t have spent money on this since they aren\u2019t a research body and the body who would be spending the money, The National Institutes of Health isn\u2019t even mentioned.   Did he write this in a hurry?  The \u2018actively ridiculing\u2019 is a nice touch, gets the sympathy going but again, not something that the mainstream really does at all.  There is no need. 2. \u201cVaccines can cause autism\u201d It\u2019s a nice stand alone sentence there on the page, suitably dramatic and completely meaningless. 3. \u201cThe official position of the American Academy of Pediatrics may be the same as my personal position, but they are far too involved with the pharmaceutical industry to actually do anything but pay lip service to an open discussion.\u201d So the reason for the lack of belief among the mainstream or at least the AAP is that they\u2019re all Pharma Shills.  Does he really believe that crude overgeneralisation?   I would think not, it\u2019s simply there to bolster the true believers in the vaccines cause autism who would be quite lost without this central plank in their anti-vaccination platform. 4. \u201cYes, most vaccines have less mercury, but wait until the evidence against aluminum in vaccines becomes common knowledge.  The body of research regarding aluminum\u2019s harm to human cells already contains hundreds of articles.  The most damning conclusions were recently published by Dr Robert Sears, a very well known and well respected pediatrician and the son and partner of Dr William Sears, long regarded as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Pediatrician\u201d. Aluminum is the new thimerosal apparently.   To bolster the drama of this \u2018toxin\u2019 we have Dr Robert Sears with all the second hand glory bestowed on him by his illustrious father.  He\u2019s going to need a lot of that glory for his \u2018published\u2019 work concludes basically that people on dialysis and very premature babies can develop aluminum toxicity.   As for \u2018published\u2019, this is not the stuff of peer review, since it\u2019s from his own book.  You can find it on whale-to though.  The central point and one that is rather carefully avoided by Gordon and others promoting the toxin gambit is that the dose in the vaccine is absolutely minuscule compared to what is already there in the infant because of what the infant is exposed to in the ordinary course of living, especially if your infant drinks water.   There are some comprehensive references to this topic.  Orac of the Science Blogs, gives an overview  here .  The Children\u2019s Hospital Philadelphia gives an overview  here  and a physician blogger weighs in  here .  The latter is important because she refers to peer reviewed research which came to the following conclusion regarding aluminium and vaccines: \u201cThe authors calculate that when a similar adjuvant dose is given to an adult human, this will result in a rise of 0.04ng/ml over a baseline normal value of 5ng/ml - which would be completely undetectable but for the extremely sensitive methods of detection used for the 26Al isotope. If we\u2019re talking about a ~3kg baby (about the same weight as the rabbits), the 6% rise in blood aluminum values would translate into a rise of 0.3ng/ml (i.e, the babies would have 5.3ng/ml aluminum levels instead of 5.0). Not exactly something to write home about, especially when you consider that the same dose of aluminum in the rabbit given it intravenously, saw a whopping 2000% rise in its blood aluminum concentration (an increase of 600ng/ml). (Edited to add: Even if the rise is in absolute terms, i.e 2ng/ml per vaccine, no baby would reach anything resembling toxic blood levels even if several vaccines were administered simultaneously).\u201d It\u2019s that sort of thing that Gordon goes out of his way not to mention and for a representative of the medical profession, that\u2019 s misleading enough to qualify as reprehensible though perhaps congruent with a \u201cD\u201d list pediatrician status. Chapter 1: Opening The Can of Worms. Overview: Jenny\u2019s traumatic appearance on Oprah describing in seven minutes\u2019s Evan\u2019s first brush with convulsions, his subsequent cardiac arrest with the second and his initial diagnosis of epilepsy followed by the diagnosis of autism.  She told the neurologist: \u201cMy son is trapped inside this label call autism and I\u2019m gonna get him out\u201d.   But, she\u2019s really there on Oprah to be the \u2018voice of those amazing women; who\u2019ve been silenced by their doctors, and called stupid and ignorant.  Jenny is ready with the truth and here it is: \u201cWe vaccinated our baby and SOMETHING happened.  SOMETHING happened.  Why won\u2019t anyone believe us?\u201d That\u2019s followed by these two memorable lines: When Oprah read a statement from the CDC stating that the science showed no link between vaccines and autism, Jenny replies: \u201c\u201cWho needs science when I\u2019m witnessing it everyday in my own home?  I watched it happen.\u201d  I replied with all the love I could muster in my heart.  \u201cEvan is my science.\u201d\u201c Somehow this is unlikely to convince the AOP.   Chapter 2: Imagine Overview: Something of a non sequitur but Jenny comes up with a child having fallen and hurt himself on the stairs as visible damage that is analogous to having developed autism following vaccination.  There\u2019s this line. \u201cThe doctor just keeps shaking his head and denies that stairs could ever harm a child.\u201d This analogy doesn\u2019t work at all well.  I doubt it would convince anyone of an autism vaccine link, including the AOP. The rest is also a plug for Jenny being the first to get the truth out about vaccines and autism and kudos to Oprah for making it happen.  I would think there would be a number who might dispute this version of events. Chapter 3: I\u2019m not Crazy Overview - interview on 20/20 for her book Louder than Words.  Jenny relates that she spoke extensively about vaccines but that didn\u2019t make it to air, only her talk about \u2018the diet\u2019 and recovery.    On the way to the airport, a woman thanks her profusely for her autism work, which she thinks makes a nice demographic change from \u2018nice boobs\u2019.   The tone becomes distinctively evangelical with this line, which is something of a theme for the entire book: \u201cI believe in manifestations, and I believe that the collective energy of all the women who had been waiting for someone to speak for them had manifested me as the one to do it.\u201d Chapter4: Diane Sawyer Rocks. Overview: her interview on Good Morning America for the book Louder than Words.  Her theme here is as follows: \u201c As we talked about how the medical community doesn\u2019t understand that children with autism are actually physically sick and how pediatricians across the country have no idea how to fix them, I started to realise that this was something I needed to pursue a little harder in the press\u201d \u201cAs I was talking to Diane, I decided I had to go kick some ass in the pediatrician world as soon as I left the show.\u201d Apparently pediatricians don\u2019t necessarily buy into the leaky gut, inflammation, yeast overgrowth and constipation as being unique to ASD kids, so now it\u2019s a war - Jenny versus the pediatricians.   So far there is nothing the AOP would find of interest. Chapter 5: Stan the Man Overview: Jenny is joined on her press tour by Stan Kurtz, Warrior Dad who has succeeded in recovering his son.  The aim with Stan\u2019s help is to have someone from the AAP attend a DAN conference to meet the DAN doctors and scientists who can teach the AAP a thing or two.  As Jenny puts it to the AAP : \u201cThe problem is that one in ninety-four boys has autism and most of them have chronic illnesses such as leaky gut, candida, constipation, metals toxicity, viral infections, PANDAS, bad bacteria and measles stuck in the gut, inflammation of the brain, and almost every pediatrician in this country does not know how to treat these kids or even know these symptoms are associated with autism because the American Academy of Pediatrics does not have anything in their medical journal or whatever it is that teaches doctors how to treat the children\u201d. I solemnly swear that this is a direct quote from page 33 of the book.    Only a U of Goo graduate could produce this and proof if any is further required that this book did not suffer overly from editorial overview. Chapter 6: Nothing Can Stop Me, Not Even Barbara Walters Overview: Interview with Barbara Walters on \u201cThe View\u201d and trouble in paradise when Barbara is informed by a helpful someone from ABC before the show that Jenny\u2019s treatment can\u2019t work.  Summoned to Barbara Walter\u2019s dressing room before the show, Jenny relates that with rage and fury Barbara screamed: \u201c No that\u2019s not what I said MOST doctors do NOT agree with anything you\u2019re saying.  Isn\u2019t that true?\u201d And that\u2019s what Barbara wanted her to admit on the show.  But, Jenny, \u201cscared, shocked and hurt\u201d by this viciousness, knows she can\u2019t back down because \u201cso many mothers were counting  on me.  I was really sacred. [possibly a typo]\u201d   In the interview, she sticks to her chakras and gets around the problem by agreeing that autism can\u2019t be cured but you can get recovery just like you could if you\u2019d been run over by a bus! Chapter 7: Home Sweet Home As the title says - back home to Evan and probably the most sensible line in the book: \u201c If the child could speak, he or she would say, Just because I stopped talking, Mom, doesn\u2019t mean you should stop.  Keep talking to me.  I like hearing your voice.\u201d\u201c Chapter 8: The Magnitude of Pain A chapter for communal outpourings of shared pain and the venue is the TACA picnic, followed by readings from the fan mail.   She concludes with: \u201c People need to realise that it\u2019s not just genetics.   Genetics go from one generation to the next.  This is an epidemic that has taken over on such a massive scale that it pains me to no end that they think it\u2019s one gene that\u2019s causing this.\u201d One gene Jenny?  Where has that ever been stated? What follows is the Jenny theory of susceptibility: \u201cIf a child is born with an infection that no one can see and we vaccinate them while their immune system cannot sufficiently fight the toxins or viruses being injected, that child is going to get into trouble.\u201d And so much for modern perinatal medicine that there could be so many unknowable infections among the newborn serious enough to interfere with vaccination. Chapter 9: Speaking of the Devil The opening line: \u201cThe AAP agreed to come to the DAN ! Conference!  Hooray!  Then again maybe not.\u201d They did send someone \u201cwith a big smile and sweet eyes\u201d but she turned out to be unsatisfactory. \u201cIn a nutshell she was telling us that if it\u2019s not in their medical journal or their new tool kit they give to pediatricians, then nothing can be done.  She told us to write a note to the AAP explaining our findings and she apologized that she couldn\u2019t stay for the rest of the conference.\u201d How shabby of them, says Jenny for not sitting down with the leading experts on healing autism.   Oddly enough, from this and previous chapters, given what Jenny has revealed about her knowledge of pediatric training and practice, having a pediatrician like Dr Jay Gordon is beginning to make a kind of sense. The AAP pediatrician : \u201cwent on to tell us to say in the letter that these conditions are comorbid with autism, not that these conditions cause autism......I sat there puzzled because once I had fixed Evan\u2019s comorbid conditions, the autism healed.  So she was asking us to cleverly disguise what we believe by saying that these conditions have nothing to do with the cause of autism.  Essentially she asked us to lie.  These comorbid conditions clearly stem from vaccines and God forbid we say that comorbid conditions cause autism, because that would be a direct link to vaccines.\u201d This is an unusually clear statement of belief from Jenny, even though it\u2019s weakened somewhat by having the pediatrician dictate what DAN practitioners might want to write in their very own letter to the AAP, which I think we can discount as not particularly credible.  A lot of Jenny statements fall into this class. Chapter !0: At This Moment in Time, The American Academy of Pediatrics Sucks. This one and a half page chapter informs the reader that nothing came of the AAP involvement in the DAN conference and serves as the introduction to Part 2 of the book - the mother warrior stories Jenny has selected on the grounds that if the AAP and CDC aren\u2019t listening, then listen to the mothers. Part 2: Strength in Numbers The mother warrior vignettes have certain commonalities.   The mothers are sincere in that they firmly believe that they are doing the right thing by their children.  Unfortunately they occasionally resort to the absurd to bolster that belief particularly in very odd portrayals of the medical profession\u2019s beliefs and practices.  Equally interesting is the use of medical authority, particularly of family members to legitimise various statements.    More often than not the outcome is not enhanced legitimacy but one family member looking extremely foolish.   Many of the vignettes appear to be unreliable accounts simply because the author could not be either rational or consistent in what she wrote.  Some editing, even of a folksy book like this one, would have been a very good idea. I think that this section of the book is best reviewed overall to assess what the various authors deem to be recovery from autism, since this would contribute to Petitioner\u2019s arguments before the AOP. Chapter 11: Michelle Woods: Mother Warrior to Kevin. Michelle attributes Kevin\u2019s problems to the following: \u201cKevin had so much good development in the beginning and then he lost so much of it.  He got really sick really fast and as soon as he started getting sick with all of his autoimmune stuff, that\u2019s when he lost his developmental milestones.\u201d Alas, she goes on to write the following, neither of which are credible: \u201cHere\u2019s a kid who was talking when he was just a few months old\u201d. This statement also does not fit at all well with her assertion that Kevin\u2019s regression started at six months, which leaves no time at all for even really early talking. \u201cHe had eczema all over his body, he started to bleed internally.   He was anemic and the pediatrician said maybe it was too much milk.\u201d Right there I think you could reasonably assume that what this person claims might have at most a tenuous link with reality.  This is such an insult to the training, the intelligence, the ethics even of pediatricians.  Incidentally, bleeding associated with lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is extremely rare, though that is where Kevin\u2019s bleeding is coming from according to Michelle. Treatment for Kevin of the biomedical variety started with Dr Krigsman and the GFCF diet, which didn\u2019t work for Kevin, followed by Dr James Neubrander and methyl B12 injections, which Michelle regards as miraculous.    Miraculous seems to be an accurate descriptor.   Within 24 hours of the first shot Kevin is behaving as follows: \u201c He\u2019s not pushing anybody, he\u2019s not screaming, he\u2019s sitting down, he\u2019s doing his work. He\u2019s happy, he\u2019s laughing, he\u2019s making jokes.\u201d One would think that B12 functions as a drug for mood disorders rather than the vitamin that it really is.  Drugs for mood disorders, however, typically take weeks to have an effect.  Further treatments added were hyperbaric oxygen and 6 mercaptopurine.  Note that Kevin also follows a behavioural program (variety not specified).   Michelle relates that Kevin was enrolled in a mainstream kindergarten at age 5 without an autism diagnosis and with only problems with speech. Chapter 12: Canaries in the Coal Mine A favourite among the biomedical interventionists is the analogy between canaries and their sensitivity to toxins such as carbon monoxide in coal mines and autistic children and their perceived enhanced susceptibility to environmental toxins.  Jenny summarises the concept and the attitude: \u201cThese children are trying so hard to show us how to live in a cleaner world.    I believe these kids are here for a reason: to teach us to eat better, clean up the air, and get rid of toxins because they can\u2019t survive.\u201d Chapter 13: Amazing Maisie Problems for Maisie began with her MMR and varicella vaccines given shortly after her first birthday.  She started losing words.  At the next check-up Melanie questioned the advisability of more shots, which was brushed off and Maisie got the next round.  Soon after this she started hand flapping and other repetitive behaviours. Her treatment consisted of the GFCF, diet vitamin supplements and \u201cmany, many hours of behavioral therapy\u201d.  Other treatments are not specified.   There is some inconsistency in Melanie\u2019s account.    \u201cThe first week on the GFCF diet, Maisie started talking\u201d   Is followed a paragraph later by; \u201c Maisie was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at age 2.  Five months later, we had started her on the GFCF diet.  She had learned more than fifty words by then\u201d Maisie was declared \u2018undiagnosed\u2019 at age four except for some residual speech problems, later resolved through an extra year of speech therapy. Chapter 14: Lisa Ackerman: Mother Warrior to Jeff Jeff\u2019s problems began with the MMR and varicella shots when he was on antibiotics for his sixth ear infection.  He gradually lost his words and developed toe walking, a fascination for spinning objects, rashes, diarrhea, an insensitivity to cold and pain but an intolerance for loose threads or labels in his clothes.  Treatment began with the GFCF diet.  Lisa relates that Jeff would only eat Burger King nuggets, so she got the special boxes and bags from Burger King, substituted the GFCF version and Jeff went along with it.   Lisa makes a rather interesting comment on how she views the fit of biomed among other therapies: \u201cABA made a huge difference in helping Jeff.   But he had so many health issues that we had to keep pounding dirt with biomedical treatments while also trusting ABA to do its thing.\u201d  They also began chelation therapy, eventually with glutathione and hyperbaric oxygen.  Other devices they used were an augmentative speech device and a FM auditory trainer hearing aid, which helped tremendously with Jeff\u2019s super sensitive hearing.   He later required medication for colitis and oesophageal reflux.  L carnitine and valtrex were also added to the treatment regime.   Jeff is not recovered, but is in mainstream classes with an aide.   Lisa Ackerman is the founder of Talk About Curing Autism (TACA).  Chapter 15 Siblings Lisa\u2019s chapter reminded Jenny that siblings rarely get talked about even though they often bear the brunt of parental focus elsewhere, having to eat their favourite foods out of sight of those on diets or may feel too embarassed to have their friends over at particular ages.   Jenny\u2019s advice is to:  \u201c Nurture them, respect them and listen to them\u201d. This does not at all mean that having autistic siblings is a bad thing as Kev points out at  http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1727 Chapter 16: What a \u2018Trip\u2019 Jenny relates how in the absence of defining physical characteristics to give a hint, autistic behaviours can look like bad behaviour and bad parenting.  She encounters an entire airport waiting room glowing with disapproval over a ten year old flapping, screaming and running in circles despite the mother\u2019s best efforts to distract him. Having admonished her waiting room neighbour she then goes online to see if there\u2019s anything inspirational about raising a special needs child.  She finds \u201cWelcome to Holland\u201d a well known piece by Emily Perl Kingsley.  The narrative analogy to raising a disabled child is planning a trip to Italy and arriving in Holland instead.   If, however, you mourn the loss of Italy continuously, you will miss the beauty of Holland which wasn\u2019t what you expected but has its own charms. Chapter 17: Becky Behnan: Mother Warrior to Jack - You\u2019re never too old. As the subtitle suggests, Becky is the mother of a thirty year old autistic son.  Back in 1979 there were few resources for autism and few doctor who could recognise it.  Becky managed to find the forerunner of DAN, one Dr William Phi lpott through a referral from Bernie Rimland.  Dr Philpott was working on curing schizophrenia, but childhood schizophrenia was an equally common name for autism back then.  The methods were quite unorthodox - ozone therapy, amino acids treatment for candida and removal of wheat from the diet, but not unlike the modern DAN protocol.  Becky relates that she went tp see Lovaas at UCLA: \u201cLovaas had gone on to tell me that my marriage was going to fail, and that it was going to ruin my other son and the best thing I could do for the whole family was to put Jack in an institution.\u201d The threat of the institution was constant.  Jack also got a primitive kind of behaviour therapy, which consisted of hold downs, the first of which lasted 8 hours designed to have him pay attention to the therapist. Jack is reasonably independent today but too naive Becky thinks to live alone. Chapter 18: My Autism Whisperer This is Jim Carrey\u2019s moving tribute to the beauty of their relationship and the beauty of Jenny\u2019s heart as revealed by her struggles to overcome Evan\u2019s autism.  Doubtless this is one of the book\u2019s selling points. Chapter 19: Katie Wright: Mother Warrior to Christian Katie Wright is the daughter of Bob and Suzanne Wright the founders of Autism Speaks (AS).   Unlike AS, Katie firmly believes that Christian\u2019s autism was caused by vaccines.  She is on the board of NAA and Safe Minds, two rabidly anti-vaccination organisations.   She seems to be an intellectual feather duster judging by her opening lines: \u201c We tried everything: traditional therapies, ABA, speech, OT, everything.  We even tried the heavy pharmaceuticals and we were warned over and over again, not to do the diet, that it was very dangerous.\u201d Now, what exactly could possibly be dangerous about an exclusion diet?    The heavy duty pharmaceuticals don\u2019t rate the skull and crossbones, but a paltry diet does?   The absurdity is breathtaking.  She follows it up however by trying it anyway - on a child that apparently eats only yoghurt and succeeds in two days.  If that narrative doesn\u2019t hang well for you, there is always the following: \u201cI felt horrible because I had wasted so much time traveling all over the country trying antianxiety and anticonvulsant drugs on my child when I should have tried just changing his diet.\u201d I get the gist of what she actually means here but it is not clear. Things improve for Christian when Katie discovers the Specific Carbohydrate Diet through the referral of a Generation Rescue angel whom she contacts at three in the morning.   Apart from chelation there is no specific mention of any other DAN therapy and the rest of the chapter is devoted to the perfidy of AS and their scientists in particular. AS does not rubber stamp the biomedial agenda and Katie laments that: \u201c My parents, unfortunately, can\u2019t control who\u2019s on the board.  They don\u2019t have the power to bring in scientists who believe in the gut-brain connection so the board at Autism Speaks would be balanced.   It\u2019s in the contract that the scientists have the power.  It\u2019s been very frustrating.  I have urged a number of biomedical doctors to submit grants, and they were all rejected.  Arrgh!  And the reason they were rejected was apparently they didn\u2019t meet the criteria.  I knew they were bullshitting me.  This was political.  They didn\u2019t want to fund this stuff.\u201d There is no indication whether or not Christian is recovered.  I suspect not as he is referred to as \u201cseverely affected by autism.\u201d Chapter 20; The Power of Believing This id a very short chapter admonishing the faithful that you have to believe that you can heal your child, you have to believe that biomedical treatments will work and that there is no room for second guessing. Chapter 21: Samantha Gray: Warrior Mother to Zack. Samantha\u2019s story is poignant in that one month after her son was diagnosed with autism, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Typical of this brave lady, she went out to buy as many flash cards as she could find so that she could do something with Zach through the trials of chemotherapy.    However, she like the many before her has some problems with keeping the data straight.  We are told that Zach\u2019s problems started at eighteen months with increased tantrums and projectile vomiting, which Samantha thinks might be due to the Vitamin D milk Zach is on.  She makes special note that her internist husband does not want to stop the milk because it\u2019s good for Zach.  Now, this is strange coming from an internist.   We have an 18 month old on Vitamin D, which is a fat soluble vitamin and this is good?  Fat soluble vitamins are potentially extremely toxic and considering that Samantha also tells us Zach drinks a gallon of milk the dose seems to be uncontrolled and potentially high, for an 18 month old.    As is usual for the authors of this book, when confronted with abnormal stools of very abnormal quantity and projectile vomiting, the pediatrician elects to do nothing.  But we do not hear of her physician husband pursuing this either, so something in this narrative is decidedly off. Zach\u2019s treatment starts shortly after Samantha discovers Dr Andrew Wakefield.  As she puts it: \u201cI printed out Dr Wakefield\u2019s research and I was excited because it had real doctor material in it.\u201d Somehow, she managed to miss the bit where the research is retracted by the Lancet and dubbed a hoax by the scientific community. Initially, Zach was treated with the GFCG diet, enzymes, colostrum and vitamins and treatment continued with chelation among other things under the guidance of a DAN doctor.  Zach is considered recovered and attends mainstream pre school.   Samantha has not received any complaints from his teacher. Chapter 22 God Help Us Apparently we need the help because Dr David Tayloe joined Jenny on Larry King Live and in the commercial break told Jenny that many parents don\u2019t bring their kids in for wellness visits so the pediatrician has no choice but to play catch up with their vaccines, much to Jenny\u2019s consternation that sick children are being vaccinated.  But then what would he know?  He\u2019s only President of the AAP. Chapter 23: Stan Kurtz: Warrior Dad of Ethan If you thought the range of altie treatments was extensive to date, prepare to be amazed.  Stan Kurtz has done his homework. Ethan appeared to present as the typical autistic toddler - oblivious to others and that\u2019s what sent him for a diagnosis.  Stan doesn\u2019t mention vaccines specifically as preceding the diagnosis.   He also had \u201ccandida, 21 food hypersensitivities, low Krebs cycle and energy functioning, possible mitochondrial problems, eight metabolic abnormalities, high levels of uranium in his hair, low excretion of mercury, high levels of copper, and low levels of zinc.  Physically he had sensory issues, low awareness of pain, low muscle tone, severe ankle pronation, dark puffy eyes, red cheeks, distended belly, pale and dry skin, pronounced right-sided muscle weakness, sensitivity to light, little eye contact, obsessive and perseverative behaviors, and what appeared to be mini seizures.\u201d To combat that he started the GFCF diet followed by the Specific Carbohydrate Diet to combat high levels of chlostridia.  His supplements included Vitamin C, cod liver oil, zinc, L carnitine, CoQ10, B5, DMG, Super Nu-thera, an amino acid complex, probiotics and Epsom salts baths.  He was also on antifungals for the candida.  Then they started valtrex for the virus infection Stan assumed that Ethan had.  Apparently Stan's method of finding which treatments are required is to ask the experts at DAN conferences, which is where Stan found that autistic children were being treated for viral problems with valtrex.  By way of justification Stan relates that there have been two cases of late onset autism at ages 14 and 31 following herpes simplex encephalopathies.  Stan goes on to document the herxheimer reaction Ethan has to the valtrex lasting 21 days whereupon it seems that the reaction as well as most of the autism symptoms subsided.  Ethan is now in mainstream school without an aide.  He continues yhe diet, supplements and hyperbaric oxygen as well as OT for fine muscle coordination problems. Chapter 24: Committing As the name implies this short chapter is about committing to the biomedical treatment regimes through Jenny\u2019s sister JoJo who has many of the same issues. Chapter 25 Branson\u2019s Miracle Brnason\u2019s \u201cslide into hell\u201d began three months after his vaccines given the day after his first birthday.  Why there is so frequently a three month delay no one explains.  At fifteen months he lost his ability to point, imitate, his speech. His sense of balance, eye contact and his pain receptors.  He had diarrhea for six months and scratched himself until he bled.  But Coral imagined herself in a field in Scotland in the same mindframe as Mel Gibson in Braveheart and vowed to fight this \u201cinvisible dragon\u201d.    In Coral\u2019s words: \u201cMy son has gastrointestinal issues, leaky gut (where the yeast has eaten holes through the entire length of his intestines), massive heavy metals poisoning, systemic yeast, fungus, eczema, high oxalates, severe food allergies and a virus and bacteria problem.\u201d For that Brnason takes between forty and eighty supplements a day, a strict GFCG diet, cold laser treatment, applied Kinesiology and has his head reset weekly with Cranialsacral Therapy.  After two years Brnason is no longer considered autistic. Chapter 26: Barbara Walters is Not so Scary After All Jenny relates that as the guest on Larry King Live, Barbara tells of the resentment she had growing up with a mentally retarded sister who she suspects was autistic.  Jenny realises that talking of recovering autistic children may have been personally very painful and perfectly explains the hostility Jenny encountered. Chapter 27: Gina Tembenis: Mother Warrior to Elias This is a sad story.  Elias developed a severe seizure disorder after his vaccinations at four months, which progressed and ultimately killed him at far too young an age.  This resonates with Jenny\u2019s history of Ethan going into cardiac arrest also following a seizure. Chapter 28 Guardian Angel This is devoted to a particularly bad seizure episode Evan has triggered by the memory of Elias.  The trauma on all parties is just huge.  I may have no time and less respect for this D list wannabe celeb but in this I take my hat off to her. Chapter 29 Collective Awakening This is the final call to arms chapter, which lays out the McCarthy line: \u2022 Our children are our science. \u2022 Government agencies and paramedical organisations become corrupt eventually, it\u2019s inevitable. \u2022 Medicines are deemed safe then pulled off the market. \u2022 Are we to believe that all 36 vaccines are safe and have no side effects, that one size fits all or that all children are born with a perfect immune system? \u2022 It\u2019s time to ditch the vaccine schedule and GREEN the vaccines. Chapter 30 A Mother Warrior Is..... \u201cA mother who hears there is no hope for her child and instead of retreating and mourning, breaks down walls. Weaves her way through obstacles, follows her intuition even when people tell her she is crazy.  She is a mother who believes in hope.\u201d  Conclusion This book is science by assertion.  There is no external support anywhere for any statement made.  As such it wouldn\u2019t be of use in the AOP.  The anecdotes fail to impress.  Recovery seems to happen, but there always seems to be a residual something there.  This may be a case of diagnosed at two and no longer fit the criteria two years later.  Two is a very young age to be diagnosed and four or even five is too young an age to declare them undiagnosed.   All of the children are on behavioral programs though sometimes the reference is indirect.  I think when Stan Kurtz refers to 900 hours of therapy the inference is more logically behavioral than biomed..  Interestingly two warriors regard biomed as the necessary precursor to ABA - referring to it as making the child \u201cavailable for learning\u201d.    If the child has lots of physical problems, that is not unreasonable, though I and others would dispute the manner of resolving the physical, especially in the case of Valtrex.  It seems the more damage a therapy can do, the more likely that adverse side effects are attributed to some kind of herxheimer effect.  This is nothing more than child abuse of a particularly nasty sort.  The anecdotes may not be all that reliable given the difficulty various authors had with keeping their stories straight.   In which case these would not help the AOP. This is a very poorly written book which is unedited and it shows.  Caveat lector. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9 ", "http://www.chop.edu/consumer/jsp/division/generic.jsp?id=88655", "http://mainstreamparenting.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/so-whats-the-deal-with-aluminum-in-vaccines-anyway-part-ii/"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/12/review-jenny-mcarthys-mother-warriors.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Review: Jenny McCarthy's Mother Warriors\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " September 18, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   In the light of writing those compositions we were, universally, I think, afflicted with in elementary school \u2013 \u201cWhat I did on my holidays\u201d.         In this case, while changing hemispheres, we took advantage of the route and had a little look at  California , which is a remarkable state with lots of features, among which:         San Francisco :    a metropolis of sophistication and it\u2019s really beautiful as well.    We were there on July 4 and it was delightful to see all the hampers and deck chairs traveling to some scenic spot to make the most of the day.    It was also surprisingly cool.          Autism Diva: On the way to the  Sierra  Nevada  we dropped in to see the Diva.    In case you don\u2019t know \u2013 she\u2019s really pretty!    And while that\u2019s important for some she\u2019s really bright too!    I can\u2019t say we solved the problems in the universe in a couple of hours and I don\u2019t think we really tried but it was a nice chat and I would have liked to be there longer except for one little thing__         Central California  \u2013 home to orange trees \u2013 lots of them and temperatures of around 45o Centigrade.    Not too surprising that the hottest place on earth,  Death Valley , isn\u2019t too far away.      I don\u2019t like the heat that much    - and I grew up with temperatures like this.    It\u2019s no fit place for humans in Summer.         Sierra Nevada \u2013 or  Grand   Sequoia    National Park :    Totally awesome.     The majesty of the trees and the setting takes some beating.         Los Angeles : - Had to go there \u2013 have a family of movie buffs etc.    It\u2019s composed of equal parts tacky,  California  beautiful and run down.    Burbank  is all business.    We met that typical  US  social indicator there \u2013 poor service.    And they do it really well \u2013 appear to be really helpful just short of actually doing anything.    It\u2019s a quiet rebellion I think and the capitalists should take note \u2013 pay peanuts \u2013 get monkeys.         Big Sur :    advertised as the most beautiful coastline in the world, and for once the advertising is right on the money.    I should add that the driver on this expedition did a remarkable job of handling a yank tank and the processions of palaces on wheels.          Silicon Valley :    Continuous suburbia for forty miles in any direction.    Looks brisk and purposeful.         And that\u2019s about it until we hit destination - the capital of the second largest nation in the world    -  Ottawa ,  Ontario .    I have a theory about designated capitals \u2013 they usually end up on real estate that nobody especially covets.    Canberra  is usually described as a waste of a perfectly good sheep station and it could have been plonked on beautiful  Twofold   Bay .    Brasilia  is in the middle of the Cerrado, which is quasi monsoonal and the altitude is trying.    Ottawa  has some swamp-like features and the humidity in Summer would give  Singapore  serious competition.    That said, it\u2019s gorgeous \u2013 green, spacious, can walk everywhere (where we are at any rate).    I don\u2019t care too much for the grand metropolis, so this is perfect.    The people are really hospitable with an interesting quirk.    I thought I was suffering from a fairly common phenomenon \u2013 we do things different back home and different always translates in the mind erroneously as better.    But no, others have noted that  Ottawa  seems to prize incompetence and overly values petty rules and regulations and that is surprising for a well educated population, where the pay rates as I understand it don\u2019t sink to the menial as they do in the  US .     I\u2019m wondering if the lack of capacity might have something to do with an undue emphasis on the interpersonal, so much so, that the essential \u2013 actually being able to do whatever is required has been swept to the margins.    It\u2019s somewhat baffling to be confronted with so much amiable idiocy and no one seems to have cottoned on to the fact that saying \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 is better and less harmful in the long run.    It saves having to undo the erroneous advice as well as actually getting the thing done.    I also think that this has some bearing on the pitiful state of autistic inclusiveness in decision making processes.    If the interpersonal is pre-eminent, then what autistics have to offer becomes devalued in this society \u2013 to the detriment of that society in fairly obvious ways.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2007/09/california-dreaming.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t California Dreaming\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " January 23, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Dr Nancy Murphy    Chair    Executive Committee    Council on Children with Disabilities    American  Academy of Pediatrics              Dear Dr Murphy         I am writing about some concerns I have with the Academy's position statement on the management of children with autism spectrum diagnoses (copy attached).    I have thought long and hard about voicing this position.     Obviously the Academy and your Committee mean well and I would not like this to be taken as mere quibbling.     My concerns are I think justified in the light of what happened when the New York State Department of Health Guidelines endorsed a particular form of management on less than adequate grounds. Subsequently, the report was quoted by all and sundry to the great detriment of developments in the field.    The Academy's paper is similarly flawed and if the inaccuracies in it are properly dealt with perhaps it will not be used as ammunition to mandate one form of treatment for all autistic children, a prospect that parents of children like mine can only view with misgiving.         Yours sincerely.... A Sad Day for the Academy   Myers and Johnson\u2019s \u2018Management of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders\u2019 [1] published under the aegis of the  American   Academy  of Paediatrics, seeks to give guidance to paediatricians in the role of primary care physician for ASD children and their families.    The aim is thus lofty and the article timely, given the increased attention being paid to ASD research and treatment in many countries.     The article is not as useful as it could have been.    Myers and Johnson have painted a somewhat rosy picture of the management process as a professional partnership between the paediatrician on one hand and the professional behavior analyst on the other with something of a glib nod to the contribution of other strategies and other specialties.      In so doing, Myers and Johnson have gone to considerable pains to smooth out the many wrinkles in the literature concerning ASD management, putting this article out of sync with at least two recent major reviews.      Noted autism researcher Fred Volkmar conducted a thorough review of the field in 2004 [2] and observed that autism research is almost characterized by bold assumptions based on scanty supporting data.    Among its many conclusions, the National Research Council, 2001 report \u201cEducating Children with Autism\u201d) (NRC) [3] pointed to the perennial problem of the fragmented nature of management of autistic spectrum disorder in the following terms.            \u201cAlthough several of these literatures [developmental, neurological, behavioral, epidemiological] appear to be internally well integrated, there is remarkably little integration across literatures. For example, the information from the literature describing characteristics of children with autistic spectrum disorders is often not linked to treatment programs. Likewise, the developmental literature, which is descriptive in nature, has only rarely been integrated into individual intervention practice research, which tends to be behaviorally oriented\u201d         The paper by Myers and Johnson perpetuates this miserable state of affairs, without there being the least necessity for it.    Paediatricians, one would think, can manage to integrate incomplete data of variable reliability quite well and in the interests of accuracy should have been given the opportunity.      There are several instances in this paper, where accuracy has been sidelined in favour of the maintenance of an illusion of progressive uniformity.            Starting with the commentary on the effectiveness of various therapies, one wonders how it was that the authors came to the conclusion that Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) was the only game in town when the NRC came to the far more nuanced conclusion that, given the heterogeneous nature of the ASD spectrum, not one therapy was appropriate for everyone or at every stage of development.    It is not as if the authors had access to more and more compelling research than the NRC.            The history of the effectiveness of  ABA  and associated techniques exemplifies the self-correcting nature of good Science.    As with a great many advances, the initial  ABA  study, Lovaas 1987 held out great promise.    Of an admittedly small sample, 47% emerged as best outcome, that is, mainstream educational placement and normal IQ after 2 years intensive treatment.     But, contrary to popular legend this group was not \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d according to Shea\u2019s analysis [4] (not referenced by Myers and Johnson), of McEachin\u2019s PhD thesis, which documented the results of numerous tests conducted in the follow up study [5].    Lovaas 1987 wasn\u2019t a truly scientific study since the samples were not randomly assigned to control and experimental groups and subsequently there were dark mutterings of stacking the deck or populating the experimental group with children likely to do well.    There have been many attempts since to \u2018replicate\u2019 Lovaas, none entirely successful.    Though there is no doubt that some children do well in  ABA , the 47% best outcome remains elusive.    The one and only scientific study, Smith Groen Wynn 2000, \u2013 randomised assignment and controlled, produced a mere 13% best outcome with no differences on language acquisition and social parameters between experimental and control groups[6].    One attempted replication, Sallows and Graupner 2005 turned up with the control group outperforming the experimental group, which suggests that the type of intervention may be a random factor [7].      A small review of Eaves and Ho, which I note is also not among the references concluded that the actual intervention may not be related to the outcome, which seems counter intuitive but is supported by a very recent study done in the UK.      Howlin et al 2007, also found no difference in outcomes between an intensive  ABA  program and nursery provision (basically a mix of services).    This study is significant but is not among the references.     The general conclusion of the science, such as it is, is not that  ABA  per se is so effective or that it is indisputably more effective than anything else out there.    Even behaviour analysts are pointing to the \u2018bi-modal\u2019 distribution of results, which really says that all the good results usually belong to a handful of participants and it literally is the \u2018luck of the draw\u2019 (if one was used at all) which children went where. Science, in the long run generally gets it right.              Some of the citations used as part of the evidence base are not quite accurate.     Reference is made to Birnbrauer and Leach 1996 but not to their ten-year follow up (Birnbrauer Leach 2006) [8], which advised that the gains initially reported in their experimental group did not last.    Howard et al\u2019s study is referenced but without mentioning what one behaviorist [9] referred to as serious methodological flaws such that:         \u201cUtilizing a pretest-posttest nonequivalent groups design, the Howard, Sparkman, Cohen, Green, and Stanislaw (2005) study failed to demonstrate the superiority of early intensive behavioral treatment over that provided by special day classes in public schools\u201d         Incidentally, in the Howard et al study, there were two children whose behaviour deteriorated so badly that they were withdrawn from the experimental group and the reason given was their very young age \u2013 2, the age at which the AAP is recommending intensive therapy.            By taking a circumscribed view of the field the authors have managed to overlook some factors in the management of ASD that others regard as central.    Sensory hypersensitivities are dismissed as not always relevant to ASD, though Dr Temple Grandin, scientist and autistic has spent years at numerous conferences and in her writings emphasising the overwhelming relationship between what looks to be mal-adaptive behaviour and the effects of the sensory environment.    Dr   Stephen    Shore , autistic and musicologist has done the same.    Strange in this day and age but it does not appear that the authors consulted with anyone on the autistic spectrum even though there is no lack of candidates ready, willing and able to shed a bit of light on the management of ASD, which for them is exceedingly relevant to their lives.    There is also no dearth of reference points to the very significant differences between tantrum throwing and meltdowns due to sensory overload.    The sole mention of it in this paper is to a conflation of occupational therapy and the failure of sensory integration therapy.            This conflation has the unfortunate consequence of falsely equating efficacy of sensory integration therapy with the efficacy of occupational therapy in general and the portrayal of occupational therapy as not terribly important in the scheme of things therapeutic.    The fact that sensory integration therapy speaks more of hope rather than achievement in no way reflects on the real and utterly necessary intervention of trained occupational therapists in competently addressing the many manifestations of apraxia in ASD folk.     I leave it to the colleges of occupational therapists to protest the misrepresentation of their importance in intervention.     I would like to draw the attention of the AAP to the academic credentials of the average BCBA certified behaviour analyst.     A thorough grounding in anatomy, physiology, kinesiology and child development theory does not appear to be among them.    None is actually mandatory though behaviour therapists routinely undertake the tasks more usually reserved for speech language therapists and occupational therapists with other populations.     This is a serious issue and if the authors wish to recommend  ABA  therapy without qualification, how do they get around the very visible lack of an evidence base for  ABA  intervention where apraxia is a significant problem?      The lack of any grounding in the life sciences is also of concern in other aspects of behavioural intervention.         Also buried in the paper, this time with the pop psychology of Relationship Development Intervention, is a method of intervening with the parents rather than the children, Responsive Teaching with a note that there is little scientific evidence of efficacy.    This is actually not true.    Randomised controlled trials (RCT) in autism research are a rarity.    Hence the RCT of an intervention targeted at parents by Aldred et al is all the more valuable, [10] demonstrating the efficacy of this approach.    So many of the behaviours exhibited that parent wish their children wouldn\u2019t are simply the products of frustration born of poor communication.       Training parents to be more aware of the communicative efforts of their children surely has to be one of the best tools in the intervention arsenal to increase effective communication and decrease maladaptive behaviours regardless of whatever other interventions are used.            The authors refer frequently to the necessity of a functional behavioural assessment to guide the treatment of aberrant behaviours, a very sensible approach on the face of it.    But this assessment is to be conducted under the behaviourist stricture that behaviour is usually to get something, avoid something, gain attention or escape from something.    The authors point approvingly to the rigorous empirical nature of behavioural assessment.    I would suggest that paediatricians resist the testimonials and peruse the results of such assessments to be found in the literature, ranging from the comical to the banal.    Tang et al conducted 43 30-minute observations to conclude that a child\u2019s \u2018stereotypical\u2019 ear covering happened only when another child was screaming. [11]      O\u2019Reilly of  University   College ,  Dublin  concluded that the self injurious behaviour of a developmentally disabled youngster (ear poking), which only ever happened during attacks of otitis media was probably related to escape from ambient noise. [12]       The reliance on a fixed range of external factors as the major determinants of behaviour together with ignorance of matters biological can be a recipe for tragedy.    The staff of the Judge Rotenburg Centre, a bastion of unreconstructed behaviourism, interpreted the refusal of a non-verbal student to eat as an indication of bad behaviour.    As the article in Mother Jones [13] stated:         \u201c Linda refused to eat.    Linda could not speak, and the staff treated her actions as misbehaviors. Between 3:52 p.m. and 8 p.m .,  staffers punished her with 13 spatula spankings, 29 finger pinches, 14 muscle squeezes, and 5 forced  inhalings  of ammonia. It turned out that Linda had a perforated stomach. She died on the operating table at 1:45 a.m.\u201d         There can be a more complicated aetiology for a great many behaviours that do not fit well into the behaviourist canon.         Myers and Johnson\u2019s article purports to give paediatricians at least a starting body of references in the management of ASDs.    Even  CAM  rates a mention because of the pervasive use of such therapies with ASD children.    If the authors\u2019 purpose was primarily educational, why is there not one word or reference to the growing and important literature dealing with autistic perception or learning?    The omission points directly to the complaint of the NRC.    Interventions are not linked to the broad research literature and they should be.     What point is there in teaching eye contact if for that particular autistic child the face is such an intimidating landscape that he or she can look at you or understand what you are saying, but not both simultaneously? [14]      Surely paediatricians might take some interest in the research pointing out that as many as one third of autistic children may be falsely labelled mentally retarded and it all depends on what test is used. [15].      This branch of research is not yet extensive, but there are some very good basic references that could be suggested to interested AAP members.       \u201cAutistic Learning\u201d a book chapter and comprehensive review of research which should inform the helping professions more widely, is available online at:         http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf         \u2018Management of Children with Autism Spectrum\u2019  is not as useful in guiding the management of ASD as it could have been, because it seems that a commitment to \u2018evidence-based\u2019 is something of a rhetorical device.     Michele Dawson, researcher and autistic herself, remarked in a recent interview that:         \"Accurate information is always good for autistic people. It might not be good for advocates, it might not be good for lawyers, it might not be good for lobby groups, it might not be good for various vested interests, it might not even be good for researchers, it might not be good for funding bodies, but it is always good for autistic people.\"         I daresay that it would also be good for paediatricians.

{"date": " June 23, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   How many times has the claim 50% (or close to) \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d been beamed across the ether in pride of place in every call to parents and governments to support  ABA  as the intervention of choice with autistic children?    How many know that the claim is misleading at best and probably better characterized as reprehensible?    Everybody knows of Lovaas\u2019 famous 1987 study that the claim springs from and the follow-up study from McEachin in 1993 that enshrined the claim in marble.     This was based on McEachin\u2019s PhD thesis and according to  Victoria Shea  who took the time to read the thesis, the reality is somewhat different.    Make that a lot different.     Shea\u2019s article highlights a number of interesting things about the original 1987 study and the follow-up that I wasn\u2019t aware of, among which:         \u00b7          The \u20181987\u2019 study was really conducted from 1970 to 1984 and not published until 1987.    Seven of the 19 experimental subjects were referred to the UCLA Young Autism Project between 1970 and 1974.      The follow-up study took place between 1984 and 1985 and was not published until 1993.    \u00b7          One of the \u2018best outcome\u2019 students went into special education and was no longer considered \u2018normal functioning\u2019.    True, another of the experimental kids was mainstreamed after the sixth grade but as Shea remarked , attributing that to what happened in pre-school might be stretching things quite a bit.    \u00b7          The individual data for the  Vineland  and PIC is usually ignored, but here is the crux of the \u2018indistinguishable from peers\u2019 claim.    Quoting Shea: \u201c there was only one \u2018best outcome\u2019 youngster who had all tests in the normal range.\u201d    Eight had at least one score in the clinically significant range and most had more than one.    \u00b7          Apparently as part of the \u2018indistinguishable from peer\u2019 claim, they used a Clinical Rating Scale, never before seen in psychology and apparently not since either.      The scale was administered on the basis of a 20 minute interview by a psychology graduate student; no blinding, no careful probing but also no evidence of reliability or validity for the scale in the first place.       \u00b7          No measures of the opinions of teachers or peers were ever reported.    So the claims of Lovaas that teachers found the \u2018best outcome\u2019 children indistinguishable from peers or by McEachin that teachers and peers did not see the \u2018best outcome children as having unusual problems or being different are way beyond the data.       \u00b7          Shea also reports some curious remarks of Lovaas on the possibility of reproducing the 47% \u201c indistinguishable from peers\u201d result.    It\u2019s a sort of sliding scale.    At the top, if the intervention is administered precisely as the original  YAP  and by UCLA clinically    trained therapists, then 47% should be reached.    If the training was provided to the therapists at UCLA but through a workshop setting, then Lovaas envisaged a 20% success rate.    At the bottom of the scale, providing training to therapists at just any old workshop and the possibility of success according to Lovaas \u201cwould be less than 10%\u201d.       I wonder what Lovaas made of the Sallows and Graupner study results, which reversed this order in practice?    \u201cLess is Beautiful\u201d sums it up.         So there it is.    Behaviourists are definitely a glass half full kind of people.    There is no study on the face of the earth, which cannot be reported in the most optimistic terms.            Caveat lector !

Oh well - my favourite quote is \" I love deadlines - I particularly like the whooshing noise they make as they go by\"     Dear Senator Eggleton and Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology - Enquiry into Autism         I have been following the deliberations of your committee with a great deal of interest.    The focus on such a relatively neglected area with the united resources of the range of world-class expertise available in  Canada  is, I think, an historic event.    The developments here will almost certainly be followed around the world.     In a parallel process, the introduction of Bill C 304 seeking to amend the Charter to mandate one treatment option for autism as medically necessary is also of interest.    This controversial Bill is probably dead in the water for political reasons, mainly the setting of an unwieldy precedent in specifying a particular condition and a particular treatment in the Charter.    However, the manifold reasons for rejecting this Bill say quite a lot about the current state of play in autism treatment and research and those reasons should also inform future directions.             The primary reason for rejecting Applied Behavioural Analysis ( ABA  or sometimes IBI) as a medically necessary treatment modality for autistic spectrum folk is that, prima facie, it is inappropriate for the majority of the spectrum.    I note that Mr Murphy\u2019s wording of the Bill specifies autistic spectrum rather than autistic disorder.      A full three quarters of the spectrum have no cognitive disability. [1]     So for 75% of the broad spectrum, it would be difficult to justify the use of a technique, which prides itself on teaching concepts and processes in tiny incremental steps, with this clientele.    To illustrate, Professor Richard Borcherds of  Cambridge   University , winner of the Field Medal for Mathematics and Dr Vernon Smith Nobel Prize winner for Economics are both denizens of the spectrum.     This cognitive deprivation curriculum is manifestly not the technique for the entire spectrum.     These two represent an extreme to be sure, but it needs to be said, the continuous portrayal of the opposite picture of profound disability and mental retardation also represents an extreme as the true face of autism.    Like the rest of humanity, the \u2018truth\u2019 is somewhere in the middle.    Whether this method should be used for the remaining 25% is a separate and debatable question.         The second reason for rejecting this Bill is that the technique is in the class of \u2018not proven\u2019.    ABA  is essentially based on operant conditioning.    It is yet to be proven that operant conditioning really works as an educational tool in any non-trivial sense with rather complicated organisms such as humans.     It\u2019s hard enough to apply it to less complicated animals under very controlled conditions.[2]    I note that there seems to be some consensus among the committee and the professions that a web-based resource should be made available that specifies the evidence base of the various treatments for autism.     Dr Bryson in her appearance before the Committee referred to operant conditioning as scientific fact and that is the assumption of a great many behavioural psychologists.     Assumption, however, is not fact and it would be much appreciated if Dr Bryson could point to the references in mainstream psychology journals that attest to the validity of this conceptual framework.     Surely if this field enjoys widespread acceptance, then there will be ample support for it beyond the sheltered workshop of the behaviourist academy.     The problem appears to be that behaviorism as conceived in the analytical sense is something of an odd duck.    Unlike all the Sciences and the majority of schools of thought in psychology, behaviour analysis has no theories, which is very helpful in avoiding having to pay the falsificationist piper but does not inspire confidence [3].    I refer the reader to Noam Chomsky\u2019s famous review of \u2018Verbal Behavior\u2019 for the definitive critique of operant conditioning as applied to a complex human behaviour - language.    It has never been improved on, or really answered.    Alarmingly, though Verbal Behaviour (VB) programs are sprouting like mushrooms, Mark Sundberg, a well known figure in  ABA  circles said the following at a 2005 Behaviourist symposium.[4]         \u201cThere is much more research that needs to occur before it could be said that the necessary and sufficient empirical supports exist .\u201d         The proliferation of VB programs points to the need for ABA/VB practitioners to have some kind of credentialing.    It seems that practitioners in their VB programs have taken the roles usually assigned to speech language pathologists.    Do they have the appropriate academic background and training for this?     Similarly, aspects of  ABA  programs target the acquisition of fine and gross motor skills for various tasks.    Do  ABA  practitioners have the necessary occupational therapy and physiotherapy backgrounds to deliver these therapies competently?     The Committee has heard of one autistic who remained non verbal to middle age when it was recognised that a physical problem was a large factor in his lack of language acquisition.         A third reason for rejecting the mandatory use of  ABA  as a therapy is that the Canadian Government could find itself in the unusual position for a secular democracy, of prosetylising religious dogma.     Fundamental to behaviour analysis is the idea that the external environment, either the current one or the evolutionary one is responsible for what people do.    What are not relevant are things like  creativity, self determination, personal responsibility, free will, volition, judgement ,    - all the attributes that make humans agents of their own destiny.      These beliefs are articles of faith rather than Science and it\u2019s easy to see why they are necessary to the concept of behaviour analysis.    The major criticism Chomsky made about behaviourism was the lack of precision in definitions, a criticism levelled as recently as 2003 [5].    Terms such as stimulus, response and reinforcer meant whatever you wanted them to mean.    Add that to the post hoc attribution of significance to events under analysis and the possibility that people could behave on a whim has to be rejected or your \u2018scientific\u2019 analysis becomes so much wishful thinking.     Like all materialist philosophies, there seems to be an impetus to lop off the human bits that sit uneasily within the framework rather than adjust the framework to the inconvenience of a human liking for autonomy.            The fourth reason for rejecting this therapy is that on balance the results are a poor match for the claims made for it and for around forty hours a week at a cost of up to $60,000 a year, parents have the right to expect a lot.    The trouble with a therapy framed around a na\u00efve inductivism operating in a form of Jamesian Pragmatism is that it\u2019s a long way from what a scientist would recognise as the scientific method.[6]     Not surprisingly, when confronted with the scientific method the claims made for this therapy have usually fizzled.      Every enthusiastic  ABA  proponent points unerringly to the classic 1987 Lovaas study, showing an incredible 47% success as measured by gains in IQ and survival in mainstream classes.    The critiques of this study are many and the most comprehensive of them was a product out of  British Columbia  [7].    I refer the reader particularly to the questionable use of IQ as an outcome measure and the sex ratios of the experimental and control groups.    This was not a true scientific study because the children were not randomly assigned to each group.    There have been just a few studies like the Lovaas study, which had control groups, but only one that followed the scientific method in that there was random assignment of children to the experimental and control groups and the evaluators were truly blind to that placement.[8]    The results were not so impressive.    13% had as good an outcome as Lovaas\u2019 successes, but there were no differences on measures of  language, socioemotional functioning or adaptive functioning.     Is this even above what a placebo such as 40 hours worth of one on one play therapy would do?    Possibly not.             Dr Marianne Ofner testified before the Committee that the Sallows and Graupner study was a \u2018replication\u2019 of the 1987 Lovaas study [9].    That claim is outrageous and incidentally, the main reason for this missive.     In its primary aim, to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was indeed possible to get the same results that Lovaas did, Sallows et al failed and spectacularly so.    Their experimental group was outperformed by the control group 2:1.      When that sort of thing happens the usual interpretation is that  ABA  has nothing to do with the outcomes since less therapy and less professionally supervised therapy has vastly better results.     I\u2019m sure the Canadian government would be delighted to cut back on the number of hours required and the qualifications and experience of the therapists.    Less is more and we can save a bundle!    I doubt the parents would be so happy.     There is another Canadian study, which came to the same conclusion. [10] The therapy does not seem to be the relevant factor.            The final reason for not mandating this therapy is that it is not possible to ignore the very negative effects found with a sizeable minority of children.    Looking at the Sallows and Graupner study, there were some children whose progress over four years seemed to be entirely backwards.    It is therefore the untested hypothesis that  ABA  can be harmful.     Those children may have regressed anyway, but that is an assumption.         The only constant in autism intervention, as is borne out for  ABA  and a motley collection of less reputable therapies, is the absolute disjunction between the actual results versus the claims made for the intervention.    The reason, as is the case for any other field of research, is I think an a priori assumption     - this should work, this ought to work and just to make sure we get a chance to do it, let\u2019s also throw in the terrible cost to society of not giving intervention X a chance before the child turns 4 or 5 or 6.     This is not an ethical way of doing things and not an efficient or cost-saving method of doing things either.     There has to be a better way and surely it cannot be controversial to get the evidence before implementing the therapy.     Autistic children cannot continue to be the research fodder for successive waves of academics and therapists.     They are also not the designated recipients for one therapy.         There are other promising avenues out there.    Aldred et al showed the excellent results that can be obtained from manipulating environmental variables, in this case the parent not the autistic child and no operant conditioning required.[12]    It is apparent that autism research has recently joined the cognitive revolution, about forty years behind everybody else but better late than never.     Mottron et al of the  University  of  Montreal  are probably the first to objectively look at what autism is, what makes it tick without reflexively trying to stamp it out.[13] Surely if there are to be interventions they should be based on what Mottron et al have turned up.    Sallows and Graupner may not have been able to replicate Lovaas but they used the vast amount of data they acquired to try to find out what factors in the child led to what outcomes.    This is the natural starting position \u2013 what is autism, before deciding what should be done about it.            Brigitte Harrisson testified before your Committee that  ABA  could be good if it was adjusted to an autistic way of thinking \u201cif there was a national will to do so.\u201d     For this to happen there would have to be some sort of gathering together of therapy providers and the sorts of researchers who know something about autistic thinking, including those who know all about autistic thinking without needing a translator    - autistic adults.    It is fortunate that  Canada  has such ready access to the ideal candidate.    Ms Michelle Dawson is the person I would like to see on any group making decisions about future directions in autism funding and research.    With due deference to Dr Szatmari and Dr Fombonne, it\u2019s likely across the very    broad array of sub-specialities    constituting autism research , Ms Dawson knows more about the current state of play than any single person anywhere in the world.     She is herself a researcher and I note that she is principal author of a paper titled \u201c The level and nature of autistic intelligence\u201d  to be published in  Psychological Science .      No doubt some of the researchers you have heard from would be ecstatic to have their work published in such a prestigious journal.    Knowledge aside, I trust her objectivity.    In the internecine squabbles that characterise the redoubts and battlefields among the various fiefdoms in psychology, it would be positively advantageous to have someone there who would impartially temper the enthusiasms of a Marianne Ofner,    or confront the touters of psychological \u2018instruments\u2019 of dubious validity.      Above all it is absolutely necessary that there be as little translation of the autistic perspective as possible.    Ms Kathleen Seidel of  www.neurodiversity.com  described this problem as follows:         \u201cI think that one major roadblock that many NT educators and service providers have to get past, is the fact that they tend to be \"people people\" by nature. Many go into the business out of a desire to do good and use their skills productively and connect with others in a way that has meaning to them. When \"people people\" find themselves in an interaction with someone who isn't the same kind of \"people person,\" the default response is to wonder what that person's problem is. Such a default response, if not acknowledged as such and examined critically, is a source of disrespect.\u201d         I suppose I am being rather forward writing to a Senate Committee, which is not of my Senate.    I will, however, have a ringside seat in  Ottawa  to further developments a little later in the year and for a number of years.    This issue transcends both political and national boundaries.    To paraphrase  Lincoln , the world will note what you do here.         Yours sincerely              1. Morton Ann Gernsbacher, Michelle Dawson, and H.

{"date": " October 04, 2006", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Martijn Dekker famously commented that the internet was for the autistic community, what sign language was for the deaf. At long last, here was a method of communication ideally suited to a disparate population with a preference for the written word as the means. Here, what they had to say could emerge, whole and undistorted, exactly as the author intended, an unheralded and intoxicating experience. But, inevitably, benign tools can be bent to other ends and the same platform that supports groups intent on reaching out to each other in positive explorations of commonality and difference, also supports groups whose purposes are less positive and in some cases, wholly negative. The cyber village of common interests made possible by the internet, is in many ways quite similar to the mediaeval village of the original witch hunts and neither the motives for nor the methods of witch hunting have changed substantially. The victims of yore were generally the most vulnerable of their social grouping, the elderly, the solitary and the strange. In the odd instance when that wasn\u2019t strictly the case, they were certainly more vulnerable than the perpetrators. The victims in this modern version of an old drama are also the most vulnerable of their society, bearing as they do the stigmata of difference, a diagnostic label of the psychiatrist\u2019s bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM IV). The particular label of interest to me in examining the modern witch-hunt is Asperger\u2019s Syndrome (AS). AS make particularly good victims and there seems to be no shortage of villages in cyberspace devoted to informing the general public about the insidious perfidy of this particular group. The scale of perfidy depicted varies widely, but for the purposes of this essay will be confined only to those groups that show the signs of the true witch-hunter: fear mongering and sensationalism, an over-investment in caricatures and no supporting data. Fear mongering is universal among witch-hunters. From Maxine Aston\u2019s portrayal of the AS as the  default perpetrator of domestic violence  to Sheila Jennings Linehan\u2019s portrayal of AS as the  default perpetrator of child abuse  and Kathy Marshack\u2019s  FAQ on Asperger\u2019s Syndrome,  the picture is one of fear and loathing on behalf of the poor innocents whose lives have been contaminated by this evil presence. Linehan, along with her colleagues from ASpar is a leading proponent of the AS parent equals hazard to children school of witch hunting. The Ann Coulter of anti-Aspergers activism, her  evidence  for this springs from the divorce courts, anecdotes of sparkling generality from her cohorts or articles which don\u2019t mention child abuse at all. The article that Linehan cites as  seminal , that is, pivotal to her thesis, is discussed in detail later. What is notable about Linehan is her total avoidance of the abundant evidence that would effectively contradict her sweeping assertions \u2013 the websites of a large number of autistic parents. Objectification of AS is elevated to an art form by these practitioner\u2019s of witch-huntery.  Maxine Aston\u2019s Asperger\u2019s Syndrome in the Counsellor\u2019s Room  shows how it can be done. First, his behaviour is expressly designed to make you uncomfortable. Next, the problems in the relationship can be situated in one of two places, the AS or his personality and the primary objective of the counsellor is to sort out which is which. So, although he may have walked in as a tax-paying member of Homo sapiens, he is now a \u2018problem\u2019 to be dealt with, not a live human at all in a live relationship with another human being. The partner\u2019s contributions don\u2019t rate a mention apparently. She could be Attila the Hen with half of the DSMIV 301 category under her belt, but that doesn\u2019t matter, when he can be reduced to a \u2018label\u2019 and the logical repository of all the problems in the relationship. A stroll through Dr Marshack\u2019s website leaves much the same impression. This is a relationship between an affliction and a candidate for beatification. The hallmark of this group is to create a caricature and none do it better than the  FAAAS  website. There you will find a veritable rogue\u2019s gallery of miscreants all bearing the witches\u2019 caul \u2013 \u2018flat affect\u2019. According to this site, AS all talk in monotones and since their emotions aren\u2019t clearly visible on their faces, the assumption is that they don\u2019t have any. Worse, there are a large number of people, Aston and Marshack among them, who treat this \u2018flat affect\u2019 as a blank canvas on which any interpretation of the (non-existent) non-verbal language can be made. Neither seems to be aware that an inability to read non-verbal signals indicates an equal inability to use this form of communication. Aston\u2019s interpretation is that all AS lack empathy. This is contrary to  emerging research , which notes very sensibly that there is a world of difference between the method of accessing another\u2019s feelings and the ability to empathise once that state is known. Dr Marshack\u2019s interpretation is worthy of a Victorian maiden complete with fainting couch. Prominent on her site is a  sample book chapter  from an anthology of stories she has compiled showcasing the plight of the spouse in relationships with an AS partner. This is a sample of the text: \u201cI have lived with this man for two decades and have become accustomed to this unfeeling style, so did not skip a beat in responding to him. He always needs my help in understanding these simple things. Still speaking slowly so as not to create pain, I said, \u201cGrant, I need your help. I cannot get up. I want you to get up out of bed and come help me stand up so that I can get to the bathroom.\u201d \u201cNow?!\u201d he said, with great incredulity. \u201cYes, Grant. I need you to get up and help me. I cannot move. I am in great pain. I fell to the floor because I have a pinched nerve in my back. You must help me get up.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI was wondering what you were doing on the floor.\u201d Contrast that with this. the Apperistion of Sarah good did most greviously torment me by presing my breath almost out of my body and also she did immediatly afflect my child by pinceing of it that I could hardly hold it and my husband seing of it took hold of the Child but it cried out and twisted so dreadfully by reson of the torture that the Apperishtion of Sarah good did afflect it with all tha it gott out of its fathers armes to: Marshack\u2019s overblown rhetoric is equivalent to this sworn testimony from the Salem witch trials. The language of the second may be archaic, but both the lack of evidence for any real wrong doing combined with appeals to emotion to cover the lack of anything concrete are identical. The problem with caricatures is of course that in order to sustain them you need evidence of one sort or another. One can only assume that it\u2019s the complete absence of real data rather than the art of the anecdote that provokes the sensationalism of the claims of this merry band. Aston is really in a class of her own on this one. Consider this opener in bold and italics from the  article cited by Linehan  as \u2018seminal\u2019. \u201cThe possibility of an adult with Asperger's syndrome should be considered when there is conflict and domestic violence in a family, say counsellor Maxine Aston and children's services manager Ruth Forrester\u201d That\u2019s clear enough \u2013 if there\u2019s domestic violence - look for AS because that\u2019s a reliable source of violence. It\u2019s also a ridiculous assertion. In the UK, there are roughly 6.5 million incidents of domestic violence annually and using vastly inflated numbers, I figured there were around 300, 000 autistics and close cousins (not quite autistic) capable of being in a position to inflict domestic violence. Obviously, there just aren\u2019t enough autistics to go around. Nevertheless, the conclusion to be drawn is unmistakeable. Most AS folks are violently dangerous. Statements such as \u201cAny serious strategy to assist families must start with the principle of protecting children from significant harm, as well as the unacceptability of violence and intimidation\u201d .make that very clear, if by some chance you missed the opening salvo. There is no evidence given for this at all. None. Just a short telephone call away from Ms Aston, a resident of Coventry, is Cambridge University and Professor Simon Baron Cohen, Director of CLASS (the Cambridge Lifespan Asperger Syndrome Service). According to the good Professor [1], his data shows that the number of AS in intimate relations who are violent is \u2018a small minority\u2019. Unlike Aston, he also warned that his sample is \u2018clinical\u2019 so the real prevalence is likely to be less than his data show. In other words, when it comes to violence on the domestic front, AS folks are no more violent than the general run of humanity, which is not what Aston would have you believe. Aston\u2019s article is incomparable for other reasons. Two out of three of her references are bogus. Aston cites the National Autistic Society UK as having supported certain research (paragraph 3). This is cited to give credence to the notion that this is a serious article, whose contents an organisation like the NAS approves. The NAS have stated categorically that they have no record of having supported any such research. They also characterised the entire article as \u2018biased, one-sided and misleading\u2019 [2]. The tragedy is that a number of British social workers have this as their introduction to Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. If that\u2019s not bad enough she also quotes the guru of all things Asperger\u2019s,  Dr Tony Attwood . Attwood1 describes a spectrum of Asperger's behaviour, from the passive to the arrogant and aggressive, and it is likely to be the latter who perpetrate domestic violence. This is a complete fabrication. The words \u2018arrogant and aggressive\u2019 do not appear anywhere in the cited book. Nor could any reading of the actual reference be construed to read what she attributes to him. Page 169 says something quite different: \u201c although the actual incidence of violent offences is remarkably low\u201d Deliberately misquoting an expert in the field is one thing, but Aston has done something more. Attwood\u2019s words as quoted by Aston imply that psychology has found a 1:1 correlation between arrogance and aggression. If psychology had done so, it would be front-page news. Psychologists of Attwood\u2019s calibre do not make such statements. The final interesting feature of Aston\u2019s article is her unique method of referencing. The reference to the NAS is to the whole website and her reference to Attwood is the entire book, no pages cited. Is there any way that the reader can access the (admittedly fictitious) citations? Community Care magazine apparently found this acceptable. A reputable journal, one would hope, would not, but one could be wrong. In the rush to jump on the bandwagon of this relatively undiscovered gold mine of possible academic glory replete with books, articles, speaking engagements and the whole panoply of \u2018discovery\u2019, even reputable journals, anxious to be ahead of the trends, can be blinded by the magic words \u2018Asperger\u2019s Syndrome\u2019. That is the only comprehensible explanation for why the Chronicle of Higher Education saw fit to print the  inaccurate and misleading musings  of an academic with an education in English literature, who thought she had sufficient know how to diagnose her former colleagues with the Syndrome based on a cursory glance at the DSMIV. To be successful, witch hunts both ancient and modern, need something in addition to appeals to emotion in place of hard data. In order to render the victims exempt from the usual ethical considerations, evidence for one\u2019s assertions for example, it is necessary to reduce the human element. That is, position them as not quite human, an object. Witch hunters of yore believed that the witch was under the control of the Devil and therefore no longer human like themselves. This modern variety resorts to the argument that AS can\u2019t help what they do because they aren\u2019t aware of the negative sequelae to their actions or inaction. This content free statement, made both by Brenda Wall and Kathy Marshack serves very well to distance AS from humanity by casting them as unaware objects. An unaware object is like a loose cannon. You never know what they\u2019re going to do next. Without this crucial step, there is no salve for the conscience for the nasty consequences the witch hunters are about to inflict. Burning at the stake could be rationalised under the idea that saving a person\u2019s immortal soul and protecting the souls of the vulnerable took precedence over any suffering inflicted. Casting AS as the automatic perpetrator of all kinds of child and spousal abuse can be rationalised again as protection of the vulnerable and again it does not matter what damage is inflicted. The victims of witch hunts both old and new are faced with the same dilemma \u2013 proving a negative. Because of the association -satanic or psychiatric, they must prove that they are NOT hell bent on wreaking violence, abuse, black magic or whatever negativity they are judged, a priori, to be prone to. It cannot be done. It is the oldest of logical fallacies that underpins prejudice of all kinds. AS folk are but the latest in a long line of suitable victims. [1] Personal communication.

{"date": " September 21, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Harold Doherty, autism advocate and advocate by profession put the following comment on the post - \" the New McCarthy-ism \". \"Tsk, tsk.  How  DARE , Jenny McCarthy express her opinions and how  DARE  Oprah allow her a platform on which to do so! The  AUDACITY  of a parent who doesn\u2019t recite the  ND  Manual expressing their opinons about their child\u2019s autism condition. Tsk, tsk.\" There's something a little off here.  The comment is a poor match for the contents of the post, almost as if  any post, no matter the contents, will do as a platform for the gospel according to Doherty:  ND  - bad, whining  - good.  Not mind you that I know what ND means precisely but that's OK; Harold doesn't either.   I should ask the man for a definition. The point is that Harold routinely objects to any comment that could remotely confer a touch of  the positive to autism, not even an 'it's not all bad' sort of positivity.    Why is that? Look at this laudatory post: \"The Abernathy's did all they could to help their son overcome his severe autism but finally the disruption in the lives of family members and the violence that Colin inflicted on his mother, the bruises and bite marks, were too much. Colin's mother made the gut wrenching decision to give up her son to the care of the state. As the article indicates it was the right decision for all, including Colin, who benefited from the care and attention he was able to receive. This is a story that all who truly want to understand the realities of severe autism should read. The Arizona Republic, and reporter John Faherty, deserve full credit for telling a story that will not be told by Dr. Gupta and CNN or featured in a Hollywood movie. The Abernathy family - Teresa, Jim, Connor and Erin, all deserve credit for their courage in telling their story, and Colin's story, to the world.\" Now Harold has many times emphasised that he is dealing with 'severe' autism and that he's fighting in New Brunswick for residential facilities for autistic youths and adults.  And, as so noted in the post above, giving up your autistic child for the sake of the family is a courageous thing to do.  Therefore, there will be no looking askance at the families who do so.  I quite agree.  I wonder how much elder abuse, abuse of autistic children or abuse of any dependent really could be avoided if folks woke up to the fact that people are entirely variable in their capacity to deal with things.   For many children, they will face a lifetime of abuse, neglect and God knows what all by staying with the family.   On the other hand, the evidence is stacked up knee deep that institutionalisation is seriously harmful for sentient creatures.   Kanner said as much.  Inmates are also many times more vulnerable to abuse of all kinds.   See Amanda's very informative   blog   for chapter and verse on exactly what institutions get up to. One can see Harold's difficulty.   We got rid of institutions because of the terrible effects they had on people and because the abuses were so endemic that they could no longer be swept under the rug.  However, nothing was put in place to support alternatives and crazily enough, there are some who actively try not to implement alternatives that are supposed to be available.  See  Amanda's  blog  for how difficult it has been for her to access what must be the most economical option - supported independence.  Now how do you go about reversing the de-institutionalisation trend,when your heart's desire is to reinstitutionalise? Pretty much as Harold seems to be doing.   On no account can you admit to there being anything positive at all about autism.  To get round the mountain of bad press about institutions, you need another mountain of bad press about 'severe autism' and it's horrible effects on family life, health and finances.  No wonder the ND ers are persona non grata in Dohertyville. Also, 'severe' and therefore 'able to be institutionalised' will be in the eye of the beholder.  We know about this one courtesy of the Judge Rotenburg Centre.   It took no time at all before painful electrical shocks were used for behaviours that were not 'severe'  by any reasonable yardstick. I wouldn't mind too much that Harold is campaigning to have his child locked away at some point if I could be sure that his efforts could be confined to his own backyard.   But that 'bad press' he's so keen on combined with the very slippery definition of 'severe' that some of these folks employ and I can see this coming to haunt the wider autistic community.  Also, the old adage about catching more flies with honey than vinegar comes to mind.   If folks think that there are possibilities, they tend to be more inclined to supply the resources.  The drive to label kids as autistic rather than retarded tends to support that. Of course Harold is having a bet each way - lots of ABA without which your child is practically guaranteed life in an institution but just in case it doesn't work..... \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=628", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2007/09/advocate_21.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t The Advocate\n\t                       \n                          "},

My view on this is very similar to abfh - every person on the planet is abled or disabled but some are more aesthetically abled or disabled than others.  That is, the concept is heavily conflated with the fact that humans are not simply social but they're heirarchical with it, which leads to a pecking order mentality when it comes to ability and/or disability.  This is the linear view of humanity and one I think is terribly truncated.  The correct representation of humanity is as a multi-faceted gem (1).  The more facets there are, the more it sparkles, which is what evolutionary theory concludes  also. Unfortunately, the holders of the keys to representation, psychologists and others of their ilk are probably more heirarchical than most.  It is no accident that these folks are heavily invested in 'normal' and providing therapies to assist the afflicted in attaining the nearest approximation to normal that they can in the fond belief that therein lies the road to happiness.   Alas, in purposefully dimming large swathes of those facets the whole gem shines less brightly, gathering the dullness of a synthetic conformity. Anyone who has anything much to do with under-appreciated elements of society know this rather well because one of the unexpected bonuses of this position is a restored vision of the true sparkling nature of humanity.  Some people call it joy. 1.

{"date": " May 08, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   What does it mean to be a representative of the autistic spectrum and who qualifies seem to be some of the perennial questions in autism advocacy.     When someone speaks from the perspective of a spectrumite, should we take note and if so how much?    The issue has moved further into the orbit of my conscious focus since the Canadian Senate hearings but it was always lurking somewhat in the background.     Thomas McKean has some fairly definite views on the subject and I\u2019d like to borrow one of his lines because this I can agree with:         \u201cThere needs to be accountability\u2026., because representing the autism community as a person with autism is one serious responsibility.\u201d [1]         Just so.    The person who raises their hand and waves the diagnostic banner is by implication, a representative of the spectrum, and like other \u2018representatives\u2019 is subject to a largely unwritten code of conduct.     If, by analogy, an elite athlete is representing their country at an international venue, their actions are not judged solely on their sporting prowess.     Should they find themselves in an acrimonious exchange with the local citizenry at the pub or in the parking lot, they may well find themselves on the first available plane home because they are not representing merely themselves, they are also acting as representatives of their country.    Similarly, I think we have the right to expect that those with \u2018credentials\u2019 who speak on autism issues will not bring the spectrum into disrepute.     They should have a care, because they are in effect representing more than themselves.            Disrepute is rather broad and practically anything can be made to fit, but there are some situations where it could be said that the transgression is clear.    I should add that in re-reading the material on this, I found it quite reassuring to find that spectrumites are just as muddle-headed, irrational, driven by agendas and prone to having their intellect trumped by their emotions as any other specimen of the human race. [2]     Heading the list of the irrational is this blog commentary following the publication of Amy Harmon\u2019s article, \u201c How About Not 'Curing' Us, Some Autistics Are Pleading\u201d , which caused something of a ruckus, particularly among some parents of the autism community.[3]    The blogger made quite a few opening remarks about Michelle Dawson: [4]         She claims to speak for      autistic people across the spectrum Even if she has Aspergers ,      this doesn\u2019t qualify her equate all forms of autism with her own life      experience. She claims most cases of autism      resolve into unique quirkiness that should trouble no one. She has no concern for parents      facing the possibility of having a 40 year old toddler. She speaks as if she knows more      than they do about their children.         Those opinions were then followed by the fiction that Ms Dawson\u2019s comments in the article painted a rosier picture than the reality and the usual response from some sections of the autism community like ASAT, that is, appeals to every emotional red herring in the book.         Assertions1 to 4 are not backed by anything the author read in either Amy Harmon\u2019s article or any other of Ms Dawson\u2019s articles including the Misbehaviour of Behaviourists.    Assertion 5 is merely illogical and the comment is as I said, a fiction.     Michelle\u2019s contribution to the article were miniscule really and insufficient to paint any kind of picture, rosy or otherwise.    So, how could the author get this so wrong and she a card carrying member of the spectrum?     I suspect that she hadn\u2019t read the article or any other of Ms Dawson\u2019s articles and was relying on the testimony of the folks at the Wampum blog.     This seems reasonable as she calmed down quite a bit after she had done some reading and became quite conciliatory though this was marred somewhat by her final offering \u2013 some of the finest social reasoning I\u2019ve ever read.    The folks at Wampum should be proud. [5]              \u201cWhen it comes to framing a message that wins the support and cooperation of others, anything that doesn\u2019t have that as its foundation [the goal of self sufficiency] won\u2019t register with people.\u201d         She\u2019s probably right about that but Lord, it was just as much dancing around the issues that had been raised by introducing others that hadn\u2019t, which is not a tactic that I usually associate with the spectrum, but there it was.     The important thing here \u2013 she made a host of unsupported and unjustified assertions \u2013 not a representative to be proud of.         The first point that she made    - that Ms Dawson claims to speak for autistic people across the spectrum needs addressing.    Many people have made that assertion about \u2018autistics\u2019 usually when said autistics are spouting words they do not like.      For Thomas McKean, the point is central.    Only those with the proper diagnosis at the proper age can speak for the spectrum.    As far as I know, Michelle has never claimed to be speaking for anyone but herself and as far as I can work out, Mr McKean is wrong.    It simply isn\u2019t possible for anyone, spectrumite or not, to be able to make a valid claim to speak for the spectrum.     In an interview I saw recently with Roy Richard Grinker, author of Unstrange Minds, he made the point that there is not \u2018Autism\u2019 but \u2018Autisms\u2019.[6]    Therefore, Thomas or Michelle or anybody really can speak only for their bit of the spectrum and their own experience of it.    That doesn\u2019t mean that their view is unimportant, but as happens with similar issues, there are limits and these limits are well understood.    Going back to our representation analogy, if the Prime Minister gives a rousing speech on this wide brown land of ours, he speaks as a citizen and would be expected to know far more about it, on many levels that a visitor. He speaks with authority.    If Thomas McKean gives a rousing speech on autism, he speaks with authority also, but not with absolute authority.    It is well understood that there are limits because the group just like the citizens of a country are heterogeneous.     No one expects the Prime Minister or Thomas McKean to be representative on all points or to speak for all parties, unless you have a grievance and then you get the specious argument that Michelle or someone else cannot speak for the spectrum.    Well duh! is appropriate here.         Why have autistics speak at all?    I think it\u2019s important, crucial even.    There is apparently an autism conference circuit, which promotes autistic speaking though as some have pointed out \u2013 this can degenerate to the level of \u2018self-narrating zoo exhibits\u2019 to quote Jim Sinclair.     Obviously there are a lot of people who want to hear the story from the inside track but the frame for that story and its overall message may not be what spectrum residents wish it were.            There are roughly two ways of looking at autism, which dictate what kind of message is delivered from the autism pulpit.    The first is that autism is a devastating disease, just like cancer for which a cure must be found.    Any condition that takes such a toll on everyone involved in terms of finances, health and happiness should be prevented at all costs.    Naturally the proponents of the \u2018Cure for Autism\u201d want to hear a message that supports their endeavours.    Enter Marty Murphy.     She\u2019s your gal.      Her \u201cMy Name is Autism\u201d piece is a kind of free form poetry version of the Autism Speaks video \u2018Autism Every Day\u2019 and makes the same points \u2013 all in support of the basic thesis that autism is so terrible that eradication would be a mercy for all concerned. [7]    The interesting point about Marty\u2019s forays into public speaking is her representation of herself.    Her co-author of \u2018My Name is Autism\u2019 is an Omri Fiman, a young non verbal autistic male.    But not really, because Omri Fiman is really Marty Murphy, a middle-aged verbal autistic female.     Stranger still, \u2018My Name is Autism\u2019 is practically a verbatim plagiarisation of a piece written years earlier by a non-autistic mother. [8]    As far as I know, Ms Murphy is still a highly regarded speaker on the autism circuit in the wilds of  Illinois  and neighbouring states and an upstanding member of her local autism chapter.    What is bothersome is the uneasy feeling that here might be an extreme example of an Uncle Tom Autie (UTA).     There is always a proportion of any population for whom self-immolation is attractive and just as Uncle Tom made the perfect apologist for the natural order of things pre-civil war, that is, slaves good when subservient, Marty Murphy apparently enjoys portraying herself as a festering \u2018thief in the night\u2019 and a whole lot besides.     There could well be shades of S & M in the mix but I don\u2019t understand this very well.     I do know that I find people who are into advanced masochism, complemented by the quite amateurish subterfuges of Ms Murphy, embarrassing.    I also dislike laying the blame for this fiasco on the local autism chapter for deliberately selecting the most suggestible and gullible autistic they could find and using that person as a public relations device.    That would suggest that autistics are dumb little innocents who cannot take responsibility for their own actions, not a position that I am keen to champion.    But then, I\u2019m not in the pro-cure crowd.         The thing with remaining at arms length with the cure factions of autism advocacy is for me a conviction that autism is not a defective but otherwise normal person wearing autism like a medieval chastity belt while the parents search frantically for the key.     Autism is a different way of being if recent studies in perception and neurological configuration are anything to go by.     That does not mean that autism cannot be disabling and terribly disabling.    Many conditions that are not autism can be equally disabling.    However, no one uses the worst manifestations of those non-autistic conditions to say that this is the reality for people, all the people, who are not autistic.    And no one asserts that the disability is all that there is to the person either.    Somehow the likes of Autism Speaks manage this without a hitch for autistic folks.    God knows why.    There are it seems quite a few autistic self-advocates who buy into the rhetoric.    Thomas Mc Kean comes to mind. [1]    He is very much pro cure according to his private email to 67 luminaries of the autism conference circuit even though that position is somewhat qualified by being targeted to the \u2018more severely affected\u2019.     The first point for Mr McKean and others of that ilk to consider is that primarily, if autism is a defective state of normal, then they have nothing to say that is of value.      Far better to have a non -defective speak on their behalf.    It would be ethical to consult with them on treatment options but that would be a form of noblesse oblige and other than that, what they would have to say would be pretty meaningless.            The second point to consider is that buying into the rhetoric is neither here nor there, if you are merely a parent, but if you are speaking as a representative of the spectrum, you had better be able to support that rhetoric no matter where you found it or from whom you heard it.    To illustrate, Mr McKean\u2019s private email to the 67 autism circuit luminaries contained a number of sweeping statements concerning those who say \u2018ABA is wrong\u2019 and those who apparently don\u2019t want to see autistic children medicated, using the line that anti-epileptics are necessary and that clonidine is useful.    There are no references for what exactly was written or said or the people involved and that is certainly transgressing the boundaries of proper representation. [9]     It is not therefore possible to judge the veracity or otherwise of Mr McKean\u2019s assertions.     The reference to anti-epileptics doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.    Those opposing medication of autistics are generally talking about anti-psychotics.    Perhaps Mr McKean has never heard of APANA and is unaware of permanent side effects of anti-psychotics such as tardive dyskinesia. [10]      He may not be aware that the usefulness of clonidine is limited by its side effects, which include sedation and fatigue.         In a similar fashion, Jason Oldford appeared before the Canadian Senate. [11] Part of his testimony included this line:    \u201c Just think of how many children will not be in group homes or institutions.    Think of how many children will be able to contribute to society if they get this treatment.\u201d.    He, himself, did not get this treatment and he\u2019s not in an institution and as far as I know not even Gina Green has gone so far as to claim that  ABA  is sufficiently miraculous to keep autistics out of group homes and institutions.     It is necessary to have a care and a little more scepticism in some of these advocates wouldn\u2019t come amiss.     I know, or think I know what drives some of this advocacy \u2013 a desire to do anything at all to mitigate the distress of parents, even as Brigitte Harrison noted in her testimony to the Canadian Senate, conducting sessions on \u201cmourning, on post-diagnosis shock\u201d. [11]    Has the Federation quebecoise de l\u2019autisme considered that they\u2019re essentially asking a person to mourn her own existence?    And they say that autistics have a problem with empathy.    Thomas McKean, Jason Oldford, Brigitte Harrisson and Natasha from the Wampum blog would run rings around the great majority of socially wired folks in the empathy stakes.         Their empathetic abilities, however, do not give them carte blanche to spout nonsense, even when that comes from a seemingly respectable source.    Seemingly respectable sources may not always be truthful.      Kit Weintraub was \u2018the voice from the trenches\u2019 following the publication of the \u2018Misbehaviour of Behaviourists\u2019. [12]    She was very ready to tell the world how effective  ABA  was for her two children.    Though more successful with her son than her daughter, she still reported that her daughter was a \u2018happy ten year old\u2019.    Fast forward 2.5 years and the story has changed. [13]          \u201c I have two kids with autism, one, a girl, twelve, who is extremely self-injurious. We have run a very high quality  ABA  program for her for years, but could never get rid of the self-injurious behaviors. Only on risperdal are they reduced, and we have seen her gain close to 100 lbs on the medication. We have had all sorts of behavioral experts come in and try to extinguish the behavior with positive behavioral interventions, unfortunately, they did not work.\u201d         Harold Doherty sees himself as a proper sort of autism advocate, but even he is not always reliable and in this instance downright misleading.      Listening to Harold, one would think that Laurent Mottron was a pychiatrist dabbler around the fringes of autism research, since this is how he refers to him: [14]         \u201cPsychiatrist Laurent Mottron an alleged autism expert who publishes reports on dozens of autism cases a year, almost all involving high functioning autistics and Asperger's Persons, almost none involving the low functioning autistic persons who require such expensive intensive residential care and treatment as adults.\u201d         Note the \u2018publishes reports\u2019 rather than the peer reviewed research that it really is and I\u2019d love to know how he assessed the function level of the research participants or how that stacks up against other researchers.     Knowing Harold, I doubt that he did any assessment at all, which rather nicely illustrates the necessity for paying attention to how arguments are framed and what supports them.         We need representatives from the autistic community speaking out quite desperately.    There aren\u2019t nearly enough out there to put the lie to the epidemic of mad stereotyping so de rigeur these days.    There is an equal need for responsibility and accountability as Thomas McKean rightly points out.     Second-rate or unverified second-hand is not nearly good enough.             1. Thomas McKean\u2019s notorious email to autism conference folk may be found here:   http://www.thomasamckean.com/articles/speaking.htm         2. It is just as dangerous to advocacy to assume that logic and rationality are hallmarks of the spectrum.    That stereotyping is reminiscent of the \u2018noble savage\u2019 view of primitive peoples circa 1900s and we all know what happened to them.    3.

{"date": " June 13, 2006", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   In 2004,  Ipsos Reid  Canada ran a poll on behalf of Families for Early Autism Treatment, British Columbia (FEAT BC). [1] The poll asked ordinary Canadians two questions: 1. \u201cWhether or not they believe that children who suffer from autism should be covered by their provincial healthcare program to receive an Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI but more commonly known as Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), which has been scientifically proven to effectively treat autism.\u201d 2. After being read a statement including the results of the Auton case and this statement: \u201cIt is estimated that IBI, a scientifically proven effective treatment for children, which costs a family approximately $60,000 a year, would save taxpayers 1-2 Million dollars over the lifetime of an autistic child\u201d, Canadians were asked their opinion on: \u201ceven though not obliged to cover the cost of IBI, the provincial government should do so anyway\u201d.  Twice in this poll ABA is given the \u2018scientifically proven\u2019 seal of approval. The question is, does ABA deserve this frequently cited accolade? Should Science even appear in the same sentence to lend an air of verisimilitude to the proceedings? Certainly, behaviorist literature is sprinkled with \u2018science\u2019 or \u2018scientific in every second paragraph, somewhat reminiscent of the significance given to the presence of \u2018democratic\u2019 in a country\u2019s title. The belief of some of the greatest minds of the 20th Century is that Radical Behaviourism (hereafter behaviourism) [2], the wellspring of ABA, is a suspect enterprise and not close kin to Science as most folk think of it. Experimental does not equate automatically to \u2018scientific\u2019. The belief of a number of others working in the field of autism intervention strategies is that it is also not proven to be especially effective. Behaviourism likes to style itself as \u2018scientific\u2019 for much the same reason that anyone claims to be scientific: people will regard your work as the result of objective methods based on sound theoretical principles and will assume that work to have the same reliability and replicability that is usual in scientific endeavours. What\u2019s true in these theories is not new and what is new in these theories is not true. - Hans Eysenck [3]. Eysenck levelled this charge at Freudian psychoanalysis. The charge could have been levelled with equal accuracy at behaviourism. There is no doubt that behaviour is influenced by the environment, but problems arise with the inference that this influence can be codified into a system, a science even, and those problems multiply exponentially when such a system is applied to complex human behaviour. Behaviourism owes its existence to  BF Skinner   who developed its principles (I use the term very lightly here) and its working vocabulary. Skinner\u2019s work with rats and pigeons formed the basis for the stimulus \u2013 response \u2013 reinforcer unit of basic behavioural analysis. It was axiomatic for this generation of behaviorists that the basic principles of animal experimentation could be applied across species and to any variety of human complex behaviour. Skinner recognised that if these principles could be applied to complex human behaviour, they would have to explain that most human of all complex activities: language. His classic text, Verbal Behaviour gave a blueprint for this application. Here, Skinner noted  that : the basic processes and relations which give verbal behavior its special characteristics are now fairly well understood ... the results have been surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behavior without serious modification - Skinner 1957   as quoted by Chomsky This bold claim did not go unchallenged.  Noam Chomsky  on behalf of linguists everywhere and other grateful humans delivered a scathing critique not only of the book but also on the methods of behaviourism in general. He pointed out in great detail the lack of precision in Skinner\u2019s basic definitions of stimulus, response and reinforcer. While conceding that the laboratory definitions may have had some specificity when restricted to animal experimentation in Skinner boxes (the epitome of a controlled environment), Chomsky made it clear that in the world of complex behaviour such as language, it is far from easy to match up the response to the stimulus in a way that could meaningfully be interpreted as prediction or control, regardless of Skinner\u2019s definition of verbal behaviour, which is quite explicit. The verbal operant as defined by Skinner is a class of responses of identifiable form functionally related to one or more controlling variables. The basic problem, is identifying what controls what. For example, the \u2018stimulus\u2019 chair might elicit the response, \u2018chair\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019 or \u2018square\u2019 or \u2018my mother-in-law\u2019 because she owns one just like it. The \u2018lawful\u2019 relationship only becomes apparent after the event or as behaviorists like to say, the controlling stimulus is inferred post hoc. By way of example, \u2018red\u2019 as a response indicates that it is under the control of \u2018redness\u2019. This has to be a unique variety of empiricism bearing no resemblance to its scientific counterpart. \"It is on the whole an inappropriate methodology in developing improved cognitive images of complex, unstable systems with changing parameters and cumulative structures, where rare events are significant. Humans are a supreme example of systems of this kind\"  K. E. Boulding ( 1984) Likewise, reinforcement has a reasonably precise definition in the extreme minimalist environment of the Skinner box. Stimuli, which are reinforcing, increase the frequency of a response. However, in usage with \u2018verbal behaviour\u2019 or other complex human behaviours, the term loses every bit of specificity, becoming a series of synonyms for like, need, want and so on; and this is how it is used in behaviourist experimentation, which is puzzling considering that the reinforcer is pivotal to behavioural analysis. Nevertheless, in one experiment, the reinforcers are  \u201cempirically identified food reinforcers  (candy for  Jimmy and chips for Rob )\u201d.  In  another   \u201cEdible items that had been previously established as reinforcers were presented to the child after approximately every third correct mand\u201d . There is no data provided on the capacity of these reinforcers to do their job, that is, to increase the frequency of a desired response.  Howard et al   seemingly forgot that behaviourism is supposed to be a scientific enterprise and elected for the politically correct route. In their experiment, \u201cChildren were taught to select their own reinforcers, record their own performances and sequence their learning activities as appropriate for each child\u201d. The behaviour analyst has a major problem with the inner man and the notion that innate factors, which are unobservable have an impact on behaviour. They claim the feat of allowing private behaviour but not what folk psychology, that is, most of us, see as the mind. Most ignore it altogether. As Skinner  stated : \"The practice of looking inside the organism for an explanation of behavior has tended to obscure the variables which are immediately available for a scientific analysis.\"   With that in mind, examine the schematic representations of functional units of analysis, in  Murray Sidman 's  paper on equivalence relations.  Note that half of the behaviour going on is of unknown origin. It simply is. The assumptions of behaviour analysis are twofold: innate factors are of less significance than environmental factors and that behaviour that can be seen but is unexamined is of no significance either in itself or its effect on the target behaviour. Neither is supported by data of any kind and neither enhance the credibility of behaviourist claims to be able to either scientifically predict or control behaviour. Both encourage the experimenter to fit the data to predetermined outcomes and ignore any that are discordant. This is not how the scientific method works, but appears to be very common in behaviourist experimentation. \"Men dare not avow, even to their own hearts, the doubts which they entertain on such subjects. They make a merit of implicit faith; and disguise to themselves their real infidelity, by the strongest asseverations and the most positive bigotry.\" -   David Hume  In  Clark and Green 2004 , there are only two experimental subjects. The method informs us that the subjects are profoundly retarded, yet one of them proceeds to perform a match to sample of two sets of stimuli without a mistake. This tour de force requires no explanation since none is given, though an independent observer might question the entire foundation of the experiment, which concerned researching effective ABA teaching methods, based on that datum.  Murphy et al  have a complicated experimental set-up designed to showcase the possibilities of combining Skinnerian applied behavioural analysis with Relational Frame Theory (RFT). The three experiments are designed as methodological replications with minor variations. Notably, two of three participants have a lot of difficulty performing one section, reverse derived manding. The first study subject managed the task without problem, but not the second or the third, though some explanation was attempted to explain the third\u2019s performance in terms of comorbid ADHD. No mention was made of the second subject\u2019s difficulties with this task or more importantly, why this section was dropped in its entirety from Experiments 2 and 3. This is not quibbling. Reliable demonstration of reverse derived functions supposedly supports the concept of mutual entailment, a pillar of RFT. However, these peccadillos fade into insignificance compared to  Sallows and Graupner\u2019s  efforts. Their experiment was designed as a replication of the classic 1987 Lovaas ABA, which demonstrated a 48% recovery rate from autism (based on survival in mainstream classes and IQ in the normal range). Essentially, the experiment didn\u2019t work as intended. The control group outperformed the experimental group 2:1 in terms of achieving \u2018recovery\u2019 on Lovaas criteria. So, the authors, with no explanation, combined the results of both groups and the data was interpreted de novo as the differences between \u2018rapid\u2019 and \u2018moderate\u2019 learners and what factors might be the correlates for the two. While this interpretation of the research data is both extremely interesting and of considerable value, there is no explanation given for why this experiment failed in its primary aim and so spectacularly. The data suggest that behaviourism and its techniques have little to do with \u2018recovery\u2019. Indeed the hypothesised correlates of certain characteristics with rapid or moderate learning rates may suggest even more strongly that these characteristics are the major determinants of progress independent of any intervention. There is an inherent deficit in ethics here with ABA programs, that bears further examination and this will be addressed later. The other non-scientific feature of Sallows and Graupner\u2019s work is the disappearance without trace, or explanation, of the second control group. It appears in  earlier reports  of the work but not in the final report. Chomsky\u2019s  other argument against behaviourist claims to adequately explain and describe language was the obvious disparity between the time required for a history of reinforcement to develop a repertoire of language and what happens in real time, a phenomenon known as \u2018poverty of stimulus\u2019. If a repertoire in one\u2019s language depends on the history of reinforcement in that language, then most people might be able to manage a declarative sentence in that language in their lifetime, Shakespeare would be out of the question. This notion is particularly questionable in small children whose rapid rate of language acquisition in a remarkably short time tends to rule out behaviourist explanations. Behaviourism has of course moved on since Skinner and has attempted to answer Chomsky\u2019s poverty of stimulus critique by postulating shortcuts to learning through theories of equivalence relations and later through RFT. However it doesn\u2019t mean that the approach has become any more scientific. All three of the main theories are adaptable to any outcome, thus making any empirical evidence to the contrary unlikely : -   Clayton & Haye  (1999) as quoted by Sidman. This criticism was levelled at equivalence relations. The concept arose when in Murray Sidman\u2019s 1971 study, a developmentally disabled subject who had learned to match spoken words to pictures and spoken words to printed words, spontaneously matched printed words to pictures in the absence of training to do so.   Sidman   saw a way to explain both rapid language acquisition and the \u2018emergent\u2019 or novel nature of most of it. From this ah ha! erlebnis sprang a new wing of radical behaviorist experiments of language acquisition. In all the enthusiasm, no one seemed inclined to acknowledge that this phenomenon is hardly new, it goes back to  Harlow\u2019s  1949 learning set theory, and is not particularly behaviorist, even though it has been commandeered as such. Tacking on the behaviourist accoutrements of stimulus, response and reinforcer doesn\u2019t seem to have developed the concept very far. Sidman, 2001 acknowledges that thirty years after the initial study, it is still not known, in behaviorist terms, where equivalence relations are formed, though he is optimistic about it. But then, the behaviorist\u2019s capacity to satisfactorily explain \u2018verbal behaviour\u2019 is still in the foetal stages and after 50 years gestation, may yet be stillborn. According to  Leigland : Perhaps a direct analysis [of verbal behavior] is beyond our reach, in part because it may be beyond the ethical bounds of human experimentation, in part a casualty of myriad embedded interactions, non-linear dynamics, and massive complexity. This opinion was bolstered by the participants at a  behaviorist symposium  in 2005. Sautter et al said:  Skinner\u2019s framework has not yet fully impacted the experimental literature , followed by Sundberg:  There is much more research that needs to occur before it could be said that the necessary and sufficient empirical supports exist . Both are, however, optimistic. Gina Green , a major advocate for ABA as the \u2018scientifically proven\u2019 treatment regime for autistic children is rather fond of pointing to the 50 years of research supporting behaviorism. There is certainly 50 years worth but the jury is still out on exactly what it supports.  The latest development in behaviourist lore,  RFT , attempts to broaden the scope of equivalence relations to create multiple relational frames, of which equivalence is only one example. Others are described by a specific feature such as co-ordination, opposition, comparison and so on. According to the authors, language is merely the art of framing things relationally, an interesting concept. RFT is in the main, a  controversial topic  in behaviourist circles, mostly for its willingness to discard large amounts of Skinnerian received wisdom, such as Skinner\u2019s definition of verbal behaviour and not least for the  messianic fervour  of its architects.  Jose Burgos   related:  I found the concepts, logic, and justification of RFT to be unintelligible and when not, incoherent, misguided, trivial and sterile . And as is now a commonplace with behaviourist propositions, RFT is not yet empirically justified, but the authors of the concept are optimistic. When sets of functional analyses exist within a behavioral domain, broader generalizations can be made to explain complex forms of behavior. These generalizations are theories, but they are analytic abstractive, not hypothetico-deductive: \u201cAnalytic abstractive theories are simply organized sets of behavioral principles that are used to help predict and influence behaviors in a given response domain.\u201d  \u2013  Hayes & Berens 2004.   Theory in behaviourism is fundamentally different to the concept that the scientific community recognises. Apparently, Skinner was quite happy that this new \u2018science\u2019 would progress more rapidly unhampered by the manufacture of coherent hypothetico-deductive theoretical concepts. Behaviourism could thrive by adhering to inductive strategies tied to the purely functional description of what is occurring - a monument to Pragmatism. Science operates by other means, for other purposes and under other philosophical constraints Science seeks to explain phenomena, to answer why to the best of our knowledge this or that is so. Behaviourism, as  Zuriff  clarifies does something different. SIB [Skinner Inspired Behaviour] explains events by showing that they instantiate behavioural principles. These principles, in turn, are explained as derived from more fundamental principles. Ultimately, explanation reaches its bedrock in the form of primitive principles such as the law of operant conditioning with no further explanations forthcoming. Only a behaviourist or a na\u00efve inductivist could call this Science. Mathematically, the probability of a generalisation from a finite number of observations over time being \u2018true\u2019 is zero (the inductivist fallacy)[4]. Intuitively, if one looks at the generalisations from elastic data generated from imprecise definitions in the behaviourist\u2019s arsenal, the probability of any of it being \u2018true\u2019 is also zero. Science proceeds from explanatory theories, which predict testable hypotheses automatically as a function of the logical coherence of the theory. Behaviourism proceeds from a purely Pragmatic position - it\u2019s true if it works.  Burgos  says \u2013  Under Jamesian Pragmatism, anything goes, even nonsense, as long as it is useful to someone.   This philosophical difference more than any other factor underlines the non-scientific nature of behaviourism. Pragmatism says that inconsistencies in experimental data can be safely ignored if they add nothing useful to the experimental outcome. Science says that inconsistencies in experimental data point to incoherence in the explanatory theory and as a matter of logic, may never be ignored. \"Behaviorism is indeed a kind of flat-earth view of the mind.\"   Arthur Koestler Behaviourism has a unique view of the person. Behaviourists claim to acknowledge private, covert behaviour with the caveat that it is controlled by the current environment or a previous one all the way back to Cromagnon man. Man is a mere marionette on the strings of his reinforcement history. As Skinner  said :  To man qua man, we readily say good riddance . The things to be got rid of include creativity, self determination, personal responsibility, free will, volition, judgement, anything in fact that characterises man as an agent of his own destiny. Here\u2019s the Skinnerian view of some of this list from the architect himself: On self : -  The self is a repertoire of behaviour appropriate to a given set of contingencies. - Self knowledge is of social origin. It is only when a person\u2018s private world becomes important to others that it is made important to him. On feeling:  -  I miss you could almost be thought of as a metaphor based on target practice, equivalent to \u201cMy behaviour with respect to you as a person cannot reach its mark\u201d, or \u201c I look for you and fail to find you\u201d. On will   \u2013  Like \u201cidea\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d is used almost interchangeably with behaviour. On the mind:  -  Mental life and the world in which it is lived are inventions. They have been invented on the analogy of external behaviour occurring under external contingencies. On ethics:   Ethos and mores refer to the customary practices of a group. Behaviourists have objected to a very common perception that they view the human as the blank slate, the veritable tabula rasa, infinitely malleable, just waiting for the history of reinforcement to etch a path. In the light of the above, I don\u2019t see how they can avoid the charge. A number of behaviorists have intimated that it is perfectly possible to use behaviorist principles of analysis and leave the philosophical view outlined above strictly alone. This stratagem is not realistic. Your 3 or 4 term contingency analytic unit has enough trouble with post hoc attribution of stimulus control not to mention observable behaviour, which remains unexamined, compounded with a 'technical' vocabulary of less precision than standard English. Admitting that the subject of the analysis could have sufficient autonomy to behave on a whim would render any claims to behavioural prediction and control simply deus ex machina. This philosophy has specific consequences for autistic children. If ethics are merely a social product, it follows that it is perfectly acceptable to change the individual to accommodate the society. Further, this primacy of the social imperative has I would think, several negatively reinforcing consequences for autistic individuals arguably the archetype of autonomy. The definitive review of ethics or lack thereof in behaviourism can be found  here .  Behaviorism is not Science, has never been Science and does not look as if it will make the grade at some point in the foreseeable future. It remains a proposition short of a paradigm.  If, however, I treat every training goal as a \"conditioning process,\" then I am no longer open to other possibilities, as to either what is going on or what needs to be done .  Hild  - on dog training. The second half of Mr Wright\u2019s claim embedded in the Ipsos Reid Poll was that ABA was \u2018proven\u2019 to be effective. Behaviorists will claim that indeed it is and point the reader firmly in the direction of the 1987 landmark study conducted by  Ivar Lovaas , which found that after a minimum two years intensive ABA, 9/19 children were \u2018best outcome\u2019 in that their IQ was normal and they were surviving in mainstream classes. This study has never been replicated. Some studies come close to Lovaas\u2019 findings but most do not. All of them, including the Lovaas study, have major shortcomings and these have been exhaustively documented elsewhere. The best  critique  of the Lovaas study was conducted by the Centre for Health Services and Policy Research of the British Columbia Office of Health Technology Assessment (no small irony there).  Herbert et al  have compiled a comprehensive review of all interventions for autism. I plan to make only a few points here. It is incredibly difficult to test for effectiveness of an autism intervention and no surprise that only one,  Smith, Groen & Wynn, 2000  [5], qualifies as scientific, in that this one had truly random assignment to experimental and control groups. The results were not nearly as impressive as Lovaas. Two of fifteen met the Lovaas criteria for \u2018best outcome\u2019 (13%). There were no statistically differences between the experimental and control groups on language, socioemotional functioning or adaptive functioning. There are factors in studies of this type, which compromise the claims of any intervention, notably the use of IQ as an outcome measure. As noted  here : The lack of validity of using IQ scores with children with autism has been noted in several research studies (Lincoln, Allen, Kilman, 1995; Lord & Schopler, 1989; Lord, Schopler, & Revecki, 1982). These studies indicated that, while IQ scores for a speaking autistic child were likely to remain in the same range, the converse for a nonverbal child was not true. In fact, in one study, 50% of the nonverbal autistic 3-year-olds showed increases of more than 30 points when reassessed 5 to 8 years later. Most of these effectiveness studies are conducted starting with a non-verbal child and ending with a child in the process of developing language. IQ gains could be pure serendipity. The problem appears to be in the realm of accurately assessing intelligence in non-verbal autistic children. The charge was levelled at Lovaas by  Schopler  that he specially selected his experimental group on the basis that the older group were echolaic and therefore showing good signs of a capacity to develop language and likely to have good outcomes overall.  Universally, there is a problem with treatment integrity. No one thinks it important to document accurately exactly what people are doing.  Sallows and Graupner  apparently used an array of techniques, some not usually associated with ABA, though they claim to be assessing the effectiveness of ABA. Their study, as has been mentioned earlier, is the best evidence to date that it really may not matter what the intervention is, since \u2018less\u2019 and \u2018less professional supervision\u2019 seem to have vastly better outcomes. A significant confound of these studies is that small variations in initial factors can have large effects over time. This is a particular problem with the  Howard et al   study. There are statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in some factors, notably non-verbal intelligence between the experimental group and the AP control group, which the researchers reduced to non-significance by combining means for both control groups, an interesting statistical manoevre. However, for this factor and many others, small initial differences can lead to very large differences over time and \u2018control\u2019 becomes meaningless because it assumes that the magnitude of the difference does not change over time. The major obstacle in these studies seems to be in matching control groups to experimental groups in terms of an equal starting position. On occasion, the obvious differences appear to be too much in favour of the experimental group. The classic example is the gender ratio of the Lovaas study. It is well known, and was then, that autism in females seems to be a more severe syndrome on average with less favourable outcomes. Lovaas had a ratio of boys to girls of 5.3:1 in the experimental group and 1.4:1 in control group 1. Other factors can also be very different between the control and experimental groups.  Howard et al   went to considerable trouble to document the educational attainment levels of the parents in both groups. They neglected the same criteria in their therapists. The experimental group had undergraduate and some post-graduate psychology students as therapists. The control group therapists were described as classroom aides, whatever that means. When behaviorists laud the effectiveness of their techniques, they seem touched with curiously selective vision \u2013 they only look at the \u2018good\u2019 data. No one ever points to the significant minority of children out there in ABA-land who are not only not succeeding but getting worse. Behaviourists may like to claim that these children would regress anyway, but that doesn\u2019t really let them off the hook. The as yet untested hypothesis is that for some children ABA is harmful and on that basis alone Ipsos Reid had no business encouraging Canadians to think that Governments should sanction this particular intervention for all children. Table 2 in  Sallows and Graupner\u2019s study  represents the progress over time with IQ and other factors. Taking a look at the worst achievers, is there something in the ABA handbook that says it is acceptable to continue the same strategy year after year on the same downward spiral?  Birnbrauer and Leach\u2019s   small and problem-plagued study is frequently cited showing the IQ gains made by 4 of the participants. No one mentions that the other 5 in the experimental group actually lost IQ points. When things aren\u2019t going well there seems to be no consideration that something other than ABA should be tried. Within ABA there is such an air that this is the one true way that  research from another camp  in psychology however trailblazing, can be safely ignored. This is ethics violation at its worst. The research results for ABA\u2019s effectiveness as a treatment for autistic children are all over the map, which shoots down the pretensions of the discipline to scientific rigour. It doesn\u2019t work all that well and certainly not for all autistic children. It\u2019s an ideology, just another fashion in intellect in the Humanities and as balkanised as any other faculty in that area. Given the view of the person that this intervention is based on, I feel that it should come with a warning label \u2013  Keep away from small children .[6]. End Notes and Book References 1. Unsurprisingly, 85% of the 1000 respondents agreed with the Poll statements. Ask any section of a Western democracy if the government should pay to cover the costs of treating those poor suffering children and the answer will be yes, particularly if the respondent has the haziest idea of autism and no clue what an ABA program looks like. People trust their government implicitly to save a buck wherever possible. Given their trusting nature one would have to question why the affirmative response rate didn\u2019t approach 100%. Not all Canadians   warmly welcomed this poll, especially autistic Canadians such as Michelle Dawson. Ms Dawson had an email exchange with Mr David Wright, Vice President of Ipsos Reid Canada, and set up a Quick Topic forum to discuss the issue. Mr Wright didn\u2019t understand what the fuss was about. After all, he was on the side of the angels and all those poor suffering autistic children. He began to gather some inkling apparently, one year later when a random search for Ipsos Reid on Google turned up the Quick Topic forum. Much of that discussion centred round the use of this \u2018scientifically proven\u2019 ABA treatment to prevent effeminate boys turning into homosexuals. Now while it is perfectly acceptable these days to have autistic children in ABA programs, it is absolutely not OK to attempt to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation using the same methods. Suspecting, no doubt that he\u2019d been slipped a Mickey Finn by the poor suffering parents of FEAT BC, Mr Wright elected to utter threats of dire legal action to the softer target, Ms Dawson, and the Quick Topic forum was subsequently closed down. Closing down a fairly innocuous discussion, censorship in other words, to protect your company\u2019s image is certainly not cricket, but the real problem is the dissemination of more misinformation to 1000 innocent Canadians. Incidentally, I like to work with the paper copy of documents so in total innocence, I have a copy in PDF of the original Quick Topic forum discussion. Send me an email if you would like a copy. [2] There are a great many varieties of behaviourism. The one under examination in this essay is Radical Behaviourism because it underpins behavioural analysis and therefore underpins ABA interventions in autistic children. The 20th Century thinkers that come to mind include Ayn Rand, Noam Chomsky, Arthur Koestler and the philosopher A J Ayre.  [3] Eysenck, H,  Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire,   Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England ; New York, N.Y., U.S.A : Viking, 1985  p 34.  [4] Chalmers, A.F,  What is this thing called science? ,  St. Lucia, Qld. : University of Queensland, 1999.  p  [5] I don\u2019t have access to Smith, Groen & Wynn but I think I\u2019m justified in using Dr Gernsbacher\u2019s review. She is the President of the APA after all. [6] I know of a number of reasonable parents who are really enthusiastic about this intervention, which says something I think about how little is really known about learning and how resilient most children are. It is also about where behaviourism is headed these days \u2013 into oblivion as ABA therapists use a hodgepodge of techniques and pay lip service to the tenets of the field. Now if we could persuade them to ditch the cognitive deprivation approach in favour of autistic learning styles as indicated by current research, all would be well. What they would lose on the merry go-round of pseudoscientific authority, they would win on the swings of ethics as well as efficacy. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2505", "http://www.bfskinner.org/index.asp", "http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm", "http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm", "http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/eischens.html", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/articles/2004/jaba-37-04-0503.pdf", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/articles/2005/jaba-38-04-0445.pdf", "http://www.ctfeat.org/ABAvEclectic.pdf", "http://www.cog.jhu.edu/faculty/smolensky/050.326-626/Foundations%20Readings%20PDFs/Skinner-1953-ScienceAndHumanBehavior.pdf", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/articles/2000/jeab-74-01-0127.pdf", "http://localhost:3032/613bc57f5dbed256f6315a131a0729e4/image4.jpg?size=640", "http://rucus.ru.ac.za/%7Eurban/docs/baloney.html", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/articles/2004/jaba-37-04-0503.pdf", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/articles/2005/jaba-38-04-0445.pdf", "http://www.ctfeat.org/AmericanJournalMentalRetardationNov2005.pdf", "http://www.wiautism.com/pdf/ReplicatingLovaas1999.pdf", "http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/articles/2000/jeab-74-01-0127.pdf", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/articles/2000/jeab-74-01-0127.pdf", "http://www.garfielSd.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980JC93300001.pdf", "http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org/BAT/BAT23.pdf", "http://www.abainternational.org/convention/program/events/383.htm", "http://www.abainternational.org/convention/program/events/383.htm", "http://www.benjamins.nl/jbp/series/P&C/12-1/art/0009a.pdf", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/articles/2004/jeab-81-02-0189.pdf", "http://www.ijpsy.com/ver_archivo.php?volumen=4&numero=2&articulo=88&lang=EN", "http://behavior.org/journals_BP/2004/12Burgos.pdf", "http://www.ijpsy.com/ver_archivo.php?volumen=4&numero=2&articulo=88&lang=EN", "http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jeab/articles/2005/jeab-83-03-0315.pdf", "http://behavior.org/journals_BP/2004/12Burgos.pdf", "http://www.autcom.org/approaches.html", "http://www.sntp.net/behaviorism/ayn_rand_skinner.htm", "http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3814/is_200101/ai_n8937289", "http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3814/is_200101/ai_n8937289", "http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3814/is_200101/ai_n8937289", "http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3814/is_200101/ai_n8937289", "http://www.sntp.net/behaviorism/ayn_rand_skinner.htm", "http://www.sentex.net/%7Enexus23/naa_aba.html", "http://www3.sympatico.ca/tsuro/_articles/behaviorism.html", "http://www.ctfeat.org/Lovaas87.htm", "http://www.chspr.ubc.ca/files/publications/2000/bco00-01T_autism3.pdf", "http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/autism.html", "http://floortime.org/downloads/behavioral_treatment_autism.pdf", "http://icdl.com/ICDLguidelines/p8%2831%29.pdf", "http://www.autismwebsite.com/arri/v013/page6.pdf", "http://www.ctfeat.org/AmericanJournalMentalRetardationNov2005.pdf", "http://www.ctfeat.org/ABAvEclectic.pdf", "http://www.ctfeat.org/ABAvEclectic.pdf", "http://www.ctfeat.org/AmericanJournalMentalRetardationNov2005.pdf", "http://207.21.243.44/feat/research3.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=16453071&dopt=Abstract", "http://www.sentex.net/%7Enexus23/naa_ipso.html"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2006/06/teetering-on-tabula-rasa-in-draft.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Teetering on the Tabula Rasa (in draft)\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " March 02, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Dear Bishop Kammerer         I note that the Women\u2019s Division is hosting a conference on June 6 \u20137 2007 to address the issue of mercury poisoning through vaccines and that the Division has voted $5000 towards this project.    I would imagine that the impetus for this educational effort comes from Reverend Lisa Sykes through her experience with her son\u2019s autism, which she attributes to mercury in vaccines.     It appears from your website that this issue is being framed as the traditional David versus Goliath, with the United Methodist Women\u2019s Division firmly in the role of protecting the weak and the vulnerable from the machinations of powerful interests.    Appearances can be deceptive.       Reverend Sykes is a fervent proponent of the \u201cLupron Protocol\u201d, a means of treating autism in children by blocking the synthesis of steroid hormones, a form of chemical castration [1].     This theory is the invention of Dr Mark Geier and his son Mr David Geier, who have taken out a patent on the Protocol [2].    Reverend Sykes plays a prominent role as a member of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the Protocol [3].    My purpose is not primarily to debunk this theory, but to point out that the deconstruction of this piece of pseudoscience necessarily casts the behaviour of Reverend Sykes in a very poor light.     Her conduct in this enterprise appears to be incompatible with her calling.    I should emphasise that I am not impugning her motives.    With no doubt the best of intentions, Reverend Sykes has spent considerable time touting this treatment at \u2018alternative\u2019 autism conferences and other venues.[4]       Her faith in this remedy is such that she enrolled her son as one of the first patients for this novel treatment protocol.     Her faith in the matter, however, is not informed by anything called scientific research or mainstream medical opinion.             The \u201cLupron Protocol\u2019 rests squarely on three unsupported assumptions; that autism is a species of mercury poisoning through the past use of thimerosal preservative in vaccines and that mercury is trapped in the body by forming sheets with testosterone.    Following from these assumptions, removing the mercury from the body    (chelation) does not work because the high testosterone in autistic children (hyper-androgenicity and assumption three) effectively prevents its being removed, particularly from the brain.      But, by lowering the level of testosterone through chemical castration (Lupron injections), chelation can do its job. There is no sound peer reviewed evidence that mercury in thimerosal at the levels given in vaccinations has ever harmed anyone or caused autism. A recent Daubert hearing at which Dr Mark Geier was the expert witness noted that:         It is also significant in the review of his methodology that Dr. Geier could not point to a single study that conclusively determined that any amount of mercury could cause the specific neurological disorder of autism. [5]         The  Institute  of  Medicine  of the  American   Academy  of Sciences in their 2004 comprehensive review stated that there is no evidence of any link between autism and the mercury preservative thimerosal in vaccines [6].      The second pillar of this protocol, namely the claim of the Geiers that testosterone traps mercury in sheets, is fraudulent [7].    The reference they give refers to the preparation of a pure crystal for the purposes of crystallography.    It has never been demonstrated that this reaction occurs in the body at 37 degrees Celsius, though it may occur if you first dissolve your autistic child in hot benzene.    The third assertion that autistic children are inclined to hyperandrogenicity is at this point, an unsupported hypothesis.    There is no cited evidence that they are and good evidence that they do not have higher testosterone levels than do other prepubescent children.    A recent study from the National Institutes of Health concludes that:         Levels of adrenal hormones were not impressively different between the autism/ASD and control groups.     This suggests that earlier sexual maturation is not the explanation for our results  [8].         Given the shaky foundations for this Protocol, wise counsel would have questioned the immediate use of a powerful chemical castration drug, Lupron, on children, based on what is at best, a flimsy hypothesis.     It is apparent that Reverend Sykes in her zealous pursuit of treatment for her son has been able to ignore far too many signs of dishonesty and blatant deception.             The most obvious of those and of greatest concern ethically is the composition of the IRB overseeing the Lupron Protocol [9].      This IRB is composed of three members of the Geier family, a business associate, a dental hygienist, a lawyer and the Reverend Lisa Sykes, whose son is one of the research subjects.     The guidelines set down for an IRB are explicit:         Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members [10]          Contrary to those guidelines, there is no member with the requisite expertise in Biochemistry, Paediatrics or Endocrinology, the three fields that should be represented in hormone research in children.    The rules covering the composition and function of IRBs, are there to impartially guide research and safeguard the human participants.     That these rules have been flouted is obvious in that only two members of this IRB are eligible to vote to approve the research, the dental hygienist and the lawyer, and then only if they are clear of conflicts of interest.    The others are barred because of their being family members, research participants or having a vested financial interest in the outcome.     Reverend Sykes should be asked to explain her presence on an IRB, which, as constructed, cannot fulfil its legal and ethical obligations to its young experimental subjects.            There is a second irregularity with this IRB.      Dr Mark and Mr David Geier published the preliminary results of their Protocol in an article in Hormone Research [11]. The article cites their IRB as having approved the research.    However, it appears that the IRB was only established in March 2006 and the research that it was supposed to oversee took place between November 2004 and November 2005.             There are many irregularities in the administration of the Lupron Protocol, which could not have occurred if the IRB was a duly qualified body.    The sole use of Lupron in children that is approved by the  US  regulator is for the rare condition of central precocious puberty.      The insert for Lupron states that the diagnosis should include the following          2. Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed prior to initiation of therapy:    \u2022 Confirmation of diagnosis by a pubertal response to a GnRH stimulation test. The sensitivity and methodology of this assay must be understood [12]         The pre-testing of autistic children for the Protocol as carried out by the Geiers and meticulously documented by Kathleen Seidel [13] runs to between $ 7,000 to $10,000 and includes some esoteric genetic tests, which are currently experimental.       It does not include a GnHR stimulation test.     The test, which is crucial to the diagnosis of central precocious puberty and for the monitoring of treatment [14] is missing from the testing array of these autistic children.    Incidentally, the usual work-up for central precocious puberty, which does include a GnHR stimulation test cost around $650 in 1999 [15].          As already stated, Lupron\u2019s sole FDA approved use in children is for treating central precocious puberty.    But, Dr Geier has \u2018branched out\u2019 as he put it and in his own words urged health insurance companies to pay for Lupron because it is also used to treat serial sex offenders.in the criminal justice system.    Here is Dr Geier at the  U.S. Autism and Asperger Association  (USAAA) conference . [16]          what we\u2019re trying to do is get rid of their aggressive behavior so the parents can keep them, because the state keeps saying they\u2019re going to take them away. Now here, we\u2019re not on new ground. The state does this a lot, and in fact, knock on wood, so far, I\u2019ve gotten every health plan \u2014 we\u2019ve got about eighty kids \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten every health plan to pay for the Lupron. While on the fourteen-year old it was interesting. They said, \u201cwe can\u2019t pay for the Lupron, he doesn\u2019t have precocious puberty, he\u2019s fourteen.\u201d And I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t write he has precocious puberty, I wrote he has hyperandrogenemia, high testosterone.\u201d And they said, \u201cwe never do that.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh really? Don\u2019t you have any eighteen to twenty year olds that the court orders \u2014\u201d \u201cOh yeah, once a month.\u201d         Autistic children can be treated as sex offenders apparently.    The branching out has also included major changes to the Lupron protocol that is recommended by the manufacturer.     Some of these children are getting twice the recommended Lupron depot shots (given every 14 days instead of 28 days), plus daily sub-cutaneous Lupron shots plus Androcur, an androgen antagonist not FDA approved for children, because it has been largely replaced by Lupron..    But none of this is recommended for children nor could ever be recommended for children in any country, which has a functional child protection service.     I would urge you very strongly to find a paediatric endocrinologist in your area and get his opinion on the \u2018Lupron Protocol\u2019 as practiced by the Geiers. [17].    You would have to add that none of the autistic children undergoing this drastic treatment has a diagnosis of central precocious puberty or hyper-androgenicity.     The test that is crucial to that diagnosis, the GnRH stimulation test, has not been done.            Reverend Sykes has also acted in an editorial capacity for Dr and Mr Geier, who expressed their gratitude on page 5 of  Early Downward Trends in Neurodevelopmental Disorders Following Removal of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines .  [18]     That article consists of two parts.    The second part is practically a verbatim plagiarisation of the draft manuscript by Verstraeten et al, titled  Risk of neurologic and renal impairment associated with thimerosal-containing vaccines , which is in the public domain on the Safeminds website. [19]      No special expertise is required to spot the gross similarities.    Worse, Reverend Sykes is very familiar with the contents of the Verstraeten manuscript having cited it in her own work as an autism advocate.    [20]          The link between autism and mercury in vaccines has been promoted by Dr Mark Geier and his son David in six articles based on the contents of two government databases, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database maintained by the CDC and the California Department of Disability Services (CDDS) database.    Reverend Sykes and other zealots of a similar persuasion choose to ignore the warnings issued by the CDDS and the CDC about the limitations of these databases.    The  American   Academy  of Paediatrics wrote an article outlining in considerable detail the ways in which Dr and Mr Geier have misused the VAERS. [21]      For a scholarly article it is just barely polite.    The Geier\u2019s interpretation of the CDDS data has been similarly exposed as a species of statistical malfeasance.    [22]     The organisers of the June event should be aware that the CDDS data, if interpreted correctly, continues to refute the notion that there is a link between autism and mercury in vaccines.    Though mercury has been removed from the standard childhood vaccine regime for many years, the number of 3-5 year olds with autism continues to increase. [23]         In the ordinary course of events, I would have been loath to become involved in criticising a parent for her attempts to do the best by her child, even when I would have disagreed vehemently with her conclusions.    That was certainly the case up to the point when Reverend Sykes started championing the Lupron Protocol and extolling the Geiers as bona fide researchers in the field of autism.      There are two basic reasons why this is unacceptable.     Primarily, a Christian minister is engaging in behaviour, which is potentially harmful to children, in direct violation of her sworn promise to look after the vulnerable.     Professor Simon Baron Cohen of  Cambridge   University  assessed the risks as follows.            I am aware that the Geiers are citing our work to justify their treatments involving lowering testosterone levels in autism. I have never advocated for this treatment, and indeed am opposed to such treatments on two grounds: ethical (manipulating hormones affects many systems in the body and mind, many of which do not stand in need of \u2018treatment\u2019) and safety (such treatments may carry risks, many of which are unquantified).[24]         Secondly it appears that this leader of a Christian community is perfectly capable of any amount of moral relativism in pursuit of a personal goal.          Of minor importance, the Reverend Sykes is disseminating, quite unconsciously along with her proselytizing of the Lupron Protocol, the notion that to be Christian is to be credulous.    I look to the governance of the  Uniting   Methodist   Church  to bring one of its own back into the fold.

This is the method for preparing a mercury chloride compound of testosterone for crystallography, which combines equimolar amounts of testosterone and mercury chloride in hot benzene, not something that happens at body temperature.         8.                    The biochemical rationale that the Geiers use for their theory of hyperandrogenicity    is that ASD children with low glutathione do not convert DHEA to DHEA-S and since alternate pathways are blocked, they convert their steroid precursors mostly into testosterone.     The NIH study    Elevated Levels Of Growth-Related Hormones In Autism And Autism Spectrum Disorder,  J. L. Mills, M. L. Hediger, C. A. Molloy, G. P. Chrousos, P. Manning-Courtney, K. F. Yu, M. Brasington, L. J. England,    casts considerable doubt on this hypothesis [http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/Cofred/Public/Aca/WebSec.cfm?confid=238&webid=1245].    The authors found that ASD children are in fact twice as likely as controls to have detectable DHEA-S.     The innocent explanation for not producing DHEA-S is simply the prepubescent status of children.              9.

{"date": " March 19, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t           Alf, like the Naiads Harold Doherty refers to, is a mythical creature.    Alf was born initially as a fundraising slogan on a coffee cup or some such on autistics.org and there he remained until a rookie reporter for the Times wrote a  rousing if hastily researched piece  on autistic advocacy citing Aspies for Freedom and the \u2018Autistic Liberation Front\u2019 (Alf).    Harold found the article.      The thing is, Alf, properly speaking doesn\u2019t exist.     The article, however, sparked one of those tangential forays familiar to spectrumites everywhere and  Alf became flesh  so to speak as a joke too good to pass up.    [1] As is fitting with the lofty aims of the enterprise (think Che Guevara), Alf was conceived in the superhero mould.     The fact that few of the participants had access to suitable costumes was brushed aside as mere quibbling.    The result is, I think, impressive thanks to the Photoshop expertise of the resident legal eagle on Autadvo, Anne.         I don\u2019t see Alf as a nymph in reverse drag.      He\u2019s a stocky character, balding, a slight paunch and a belligerent attitude.     He\u2019s not the sort who would bother with vocals on the Med.    Far more likely, one would think, that if the occasion were sufficiently provocative, Alf would stride up in his workingman\u2019s boots and deliver a kick where it might do the most good.    This lot  comes under the heading of serious provocation:         \u201c Those who oppose any effort to treat, educate or heaven forbid change an autistic child for the better.    Do not listen to the siren\u2019s call\u201d.    Or\u2026..         \u201c Parents who seek to help their OWN children, not the ND\u2019ers themselves but their own children, through attempts at cures are vilified by the ND movement.[2] And\u2026.         \u201c They [the sirens] will not help teach him/her to speak and read and brush his/her teeth.\u201d         It\u2019s hard to know where to start.    \u201cCure\u201d is something that implies that there was a biological something to be got over.     We don\u2019t as yet have a biological anything that points to the aetiology of autism and therefore an unequivocal path of intervention.    We do know that there are a lot of autistic children who were apparently \u2018cured\u2019 with a variety of different treatments including biomedical interventions, chelation and  ABA .    Who to believe?     I think no one, at this point in time.    Anyone promising \u2018cure\u2019 had better take note of  this article , which points out that these kids are as autistic as they ever were, which begs the question \u2013 are middle-schoolers more perceptive than ABA therapists, chelationists and peddlers of biomedical nostrums?         I think there is a case to be made that taking the \u2018medically necessary\u2019 path to clamouring for funding for interventions for autism may have been tremendously short sighted.     It\u2019s just too easy to shoot holes in the argument and that\u2019s without getting into the demonisation of the entire spectrum to up the pity factor as far as possible, which has some interesting consequences - like wrecking your child\u2019s future in advance, so why did they bother in the first place.         The argument for \u2018treatment\u2019 is better than cure but again, no one that I know of is against treatment per se.    The whys and the wherefores however, might be up for debate.     Though why that should incense Harold is mystifying.    Surely if he\u2019s pushing the position that his ABA should be mandatory, note, not optional, then he\u2019s going to get a debate, like it or not.    Best to start here with the things that Harold is convinced that some people don\u2019t want autistics to learn, like to speak, to read and brush their teeth.    It a pretty good list on the whole because it covers most of the situations, where to put it bluntly  ABA  would be in my view, not necessarily  the  optimal method for achieving one\u2019s goals.          Dr Morton Ann Gernsbacher of the  University   of  Wisconsin  has this  wonderful little article  laying out beautifully the difference between speech and language.    There is one.     Just because you can\u2019t say it, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t know it.    Speech is merely the physical manifestation of language.    While it may be the most convenient form of communication, it is not the only means by any stretch of the imagination and for those who have difficulty in the production of speech, it may well be that it is a form of apraxia - the mind is willing but the muscle is weak.    No amount of M&Ms will remedy this situation.     What one hopes for is a therapist with enough know how to recognise that situation and how to remedy it.     If this is an otherwise normal kid, the therapist would most likely be a speech language pathologist.    If this is an autistic kid, the therapist could be an  ABA  trained therapist.    The interesting thing about  ABA  therapists is that their academic background does not qualify them for a Bachelors or Masters in Science. There\u2019s not enough Anatomy, Physiology, Neuroscience etc in their academics so they are awarded Degrees and    Masters in Arts [3].    This is a serious issue and what, I wonder, are    FEATBC and assorted affiliates about in mandating a therapy as \u2018medically necessary\u2019 when the therapists have such a dearth of biological    knowledge.         The other consideration with language remediation is the proliferation of Verbal Behaviour (VB) programs.    The application of behaviour analysis principles to the acquisition of language has no empirical support in the literature as Mark Sundberg pointed out as recently as 2005.     The manufactured jargon of it was tackled rather nicely by Noam Chomsky in 1959.    Here\u2019s what he had to say about the mand in light of behaviour analytic logic:         \u201ca speaker will not respond properly to the mand Your money or your life (38) unless he has a past history of being killed.\u201d         Why a rational human being would choose  ABA  to remedy a deficit in speech is lost on me.    The basis of  ABA  is not nearly as sound as its practitioners make out, but I\u2019m not about to repeat myself here.    On a brighter note, consider  this from jypsy  as a sterling example of how to tackle problems in communication.    It\u2019s a beaut and one I hope gives lots of parents encouragement to find many ways of communicating with their autistic children.           \u201cWith the consistent and enthusiastic support of Alex\u2019s teacher assistant and parents, Alex entered Grade 1 at Gulf Shore in September 1993, with the ability to use all of the following means of communication\u2014sign language, gestures, Canon Communicator, picture communication symbols, infrequent vocalizations and an immerging ability to print words\u201d    The second skill that Harold insists that folks don\u2019t want autistics to learn is how to read.     His irony meter must be broken.    I\u2019m hyperlexic myself and this idiosyncrasy is apparently as common as dirt on the spectrum.     Not mind you that the level of reading skill is at the same level of comprehension.    No, it is not but I suspect that too much is made of the disparity to protect those normal folks out there.    Hyperlexia aside, which is nothing more than an enhanced ability to spot patterns, there are many issues here.     What do you do with spectrumites for whom language is a foreign language?     One might argue that breaking language tasks down into small bits might be of benefit, but there are two problems with this approach.    Primarily, there is no evidence whatsoever that this is the case for autistics, and I might add somewhat forcefully that  ABA  is never going to contribute to the answer.    Secondly, breaking things down into small bits is emphatically, the opposite of how a hyperlexic can learn.    If deciphering patterns is a common gift of the spectrum, then spectrumites need access to enough bits of information to detect the inherent pattern.    That much must be obvious and it should be equally obvious that assuming that the bit by bit approach has merit may lead to an awful lot of damage, given the ages at which this intervention is used.         This bit by bit approach to tasks is I think an artefact.    The Skinner box for training rats and pigeons and the minimalist environments for training humans that  ABA  therapists use are one and the same.    Pigeons are taught to perform a figure of 8 pattern by careful shaping of a series of approximations to the desired behaviour with copious amounts of reinforcement at each step.    It is an assumption of gargantuan proportions that humans benefit from a similar regime and not simply for performance of a single task but for learning in general.    Where is the evidence?        The third factor in Harold\u2019s list of things that some folks would not like autistics to learn is cleaning their teeth.    This skill one could postulate as the exemplar of a whole range of similar skills and the sort of thing for which  ABA  might truly be useful just so long as there are no confounding biological factors including sensory hypersensitivity.     It is fact that contrary to the testimony of autistics,  ABA  takes no account of the effects of sensory issues such as the effect of the brush and the level of mintiness in the toothpaste as well as its texture (is this more or less burning to an autistic sensibility?).    Sensory issues aside, I have it on good authority that for performance of a task, breaking things down into a sequence would be very beneficial [4].     The point here is that breaking things down into the component parts of a task might be important if the task has a motor component and apraxia is an issue.    Otherwise, who knows?    It should be clear by now that I don\u2019t have much of an opinion of  ABA  and the argument that we should not be against it because that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got is pretty empty.    The folks using this tactic tend to assume that the therapy is harmless.    That is probably not true according to the current literature. The problem I have with  ABA  is mostly around the concept of reinforcement.    No matter what the therapy or procedure that  ABA  therapists adopt from elsewhere, and they have co-opted just about everything in the parents handbook, they always import reinforcement.     Because that\u2019s what makes it \u2018work\u2019.    Most of their undergraduate career is spent learning to construct increasingly sophisticated schedules of reinforcement.     The literature  says that rewards (reinforcement) can seriously undermine learning \u2013 it\u2019s called the \u201cOverjustification Effect\u201d and applies to adults as well as children.    When you reward performance extrinsically, you remove the intrinsic reward \u2013 the kick you get from the sense of accomplishment.    Now consider the average  ABA  program \u2013 and the kid is in there 8 hours every day.    What chance that his learning has been seriously derailed by an unrelenting regime of rewards?      The answer is that we don\u2019t know with certainty, but there\u2019s certainly a risk there especially apparently if the rewards and this includes the whole range of food reinforcers, do nothing to improve the perception of competence on behalf of the learner or are perceived by the learner as controlling, which includes all of the reinforcers in the behaviourist arsenal.     That\u2019s one sort of harm.[5]         There are others, particularly of the sort that are generally unavoidable when therapy is used as a substitute for education.      Note, the therapy may be utterly necessary, but the necessity does not mitigate the effects, though a lot of parents like to put a gloss on it.    A couple of my  favourite glossy bits  are as follows.    This is a parent\u2019s view of  ABA : \u201ca structured setting in which a trained professional can work with Jason on staged but natural terms that makes sense to him and that he can generalise to other places and times.\u201d     Nope, this is not an artificial situation, if we get to call it natural, but then so are schools.    \u2018There are, however, some grand assumptions and inconsistencies in that short sentence.       From the same parent: \u201cJason also spends about thirty minutes of the two-hour session leading the activities by selecting what he wants to do most.\u201d     The parent earlier informed us that the activities are selected by the therapist, which is just fine but this then becomes a really lousy example of promoting self-actualisation.       Harold talks about changing \u2018an autistic child for the better\u2019, a prospect that concerns me not at all, since it\u2019s practically impossible to change anybody, though it would be interesting to speculate what exactly he means by that.       This sort of rationale reminds me of Douglas Adams line: \u201c If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat  \u201c -    ditto for autistic child.    What is it about the child that should be changed?     Is there some measure of \u2018normal\u2019 available for comparison, because let\u2019s face it    - \u201cnormal isn\u2019t necessarily wonderful\u201d [6].    Here\u2019s a normal mother, a perfectly nice and loving parent I might add t alking about her clever autistic daughter .            \u201cEvery single thing she knows, she learned from  ABA . This is fact. Except for the things that seem to be her gifts. She spelled words with refrigerator magnets long before  ABA  therapy. She plays the piano almost in spite of  ABA  therapy. She taught herself to read without the use of  ABA  therapy. Adding and subtracting. She was obsessed with numbers and sequences of numbers before  ABA .\u201d         Her critical thinking skills may be normal but I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to learn them.        What is truly baffling about this paragraph is the complete disregard for a lot of learning \u2013Why?    And the substitution of  ABA    - for what?    The question needs to be asked.    Why couldn\u2019t the therapist or the parent latch on to the ways this kid has so obviously demonstrated learning \u2013 real learning, no facsimile and use that tried and true method to have the child learn whatever else they think the child needs to learn?    After all, it obviously works.    Strange, but this isn\u2019t a singular phenomenon.    Michelle wrote a great piece on the above and  added the testimony of a Canadian MP .    Same thing, a clever child learnt all sorts of things but take a look at what this bloke considers the acme of learning goals?       \u201cHe's now one of the most amazing kids -- he will look you in the eye and he will understand you when you ask him to do something.\u201d    Imagine the outcry there would be if this philosophy was applied to the educational system.    Autistic kids get a different standard and there are, I suspect, one large and a multitude of little reasons for that.    The major reason is that what the autistic child does not do and what Mr Lake referred to specifically is \u2018look you in the eye\u2019.    In other words there is no automatic emotional response or acknowledgement of the parent in a way that the parent would interpret as such.     Every  ABA  program out there starts with the teaching of eye contact on the principle that joint attention and compliance, both signalled by eye contact, are the keys to learning.     They may very well be, for a typically developing child, but we have it on very good authority that this may not at all be the case for autistic children, far from it.    It is becoming quite clear that autistic perception is a different breed of normal and that by and large it is super sensitive.    The face is apparently such a busy landscape that paying attention to both it and doing anything else simultaneously may be impossible.    Pushing for this sign of normal may be the worst thing you could do, no matter that it fulfils an emotional need of the parents.     One could conclude that the towering edifice of  ABA  therapy is built on a total lack of empathy.    Empathy is, after all, the ability to imagine things from someone else\u2019s perspective.     So there it is.     I am not ant-ABA, which smacks of blind opinion with nothing much in the way of foundation, so much as very critical of it.    Something that completely escapes the zealots and idealogues like Harold, is that things don\u2019t change unless there\u2019s a concerted push.    So a therapy like  ABA , which doesn\u2019t have an empirical leg to stand on, is propped up and continues to be propped up by parents traumatised into overlooking its gross deficiencies for lack of an alternative.     At least that\u2019s what they\u2019re led to believe.    Though it needs a fair amount of drastic surgery to make it a better fit for autistic learning and sensibilities, it has some things going for it, like structure and single therapists rather than processions of them, making the environment more predictable.     It would be better if the structure imported what we know of the learning and perceptual styles of autistics and ABA is not well suited to learning from other professional areas \u2013 too insular by far and they aren\u2019t scientific so they\u2019ve always got that internal handicap.     It makes the parents feel that they are doing something.    It\u2019s great for the kids that the parents now have \u2018expectations\u2019, whereas before it was mostly worry.       As for the \u2018canard\u2019 of doing nothing, I\u2019m fairly amazed that Harold threw that one into the ether.    But that\u2019s a lawyer for you.    If you don\u2019t have the facts, play the person.    It usually obfuscates the issues for a while.     But this is not a court of law with a memory span limited to the case in question.      Not at all a good strategy as we know from experience, with a great tendency to backfire.             End Notes         1. Poor Harold.    I doubt that he\u2019s capable of understanding that lots of folks  might find the concept of a liberation front, with all the sequelae of power plays, prosetylising, slogans and propaganda, faintly ridiculous.    But then he hasn\u2019t had the benefit of DKM\u2019s wisdom.     Here\u2019s David K March on a very similar concept \u2013 Aspergia.    \u201c From what I can see, this \"Aspergia\" thing has a 350-degree     blind-spot. It's self-absorbed, self-indulgent, and reckless in its potential effects for those of us who have no choice but to function in NT society. I don't want to be \"represented\" by these people any more than I want to be \"represented\" by Dr. Skulldug Fraudulini, Psy.D.\u201d         Frankly, if there were such a thing as an Autism Liberation Front, it\u2019s not likely that I\u2019d be among the membership. Editorial note:  The link to the pic of the ALF was removed temporarily until I checked that it would be OK to provide a link.  It is in the public domain.         2. There is no person alive who could be said to be an ND\u2019er, unless you happen to believe in multiple personalities, which I don\u2019t.     A single person cannot be neurodiverse.         3.    This is worth a post all on its own.    I was thunderstruck, appalled, amazed and a whole lot of other adverbs to find just how unqualified  ABA  personnel are to deliver any kind of therapy involving biological attributes.         4. Amanda Baggs of the blog ballastexistenz said to me once that this was important for her, so I would guess that it is important for a lot of autistic folks though maybe not everyone of them and maybe not for every task.    I\u2019d like to go back in history and unearth Tolman, who made the very important distinction between learning and performance.             5. Consider the reports of parents about their children falling apart without their  ABA  program.    That could quite literally be true.     The thing about etching new pathways in the brain, rewiring, that ABA practitioners like to allude to, is that some paths are rather easily laid and very difficult to eradicate.    This is pure speculation, but I did wonder when I heard some of the reports.    Addiction medicine tells us that addiction, correctly speaking is the etching of the dopaminergic pathways in the reward system of the brain.    Specialists recommend drugs like naltrexone to assist the withdrawal phase.     If, as seems quite plausible, these kids have become addicted to rewards, then perhaps they need medical assistance to get over it.            6.

{"date": " November 04, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The New Journalism \u2018MMR; the unanswered questions\u2019 , Melanie Phillips\u2019 article in support of Dr Andrew Wakefield\u2019s suggested link between autism and the MMR vaccine seems to be a reprise of  Robert Kennedy Jr\u2019s efforts  in establishing the link between mercury and autism.  Never let the facts get in the way of a good story     Phillips is very unhappy with the  Cochrane Collaboration Study :  \u201cVaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children (Review)\u201d, that concluded: \u201cExposure to MMR was unlikely to be associated with Crohn\u2019s Disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis.\u201d Phillips is especially concerned that this will start a feeding frenzy among the piranhas  - those who never believed Wakefield in the first place and states acerbically that   \u201c  These people should start by reading the actual study\u2019 .   Phillips should take her own advice.   One of the pillars of her argument is that  \u201cWakefield never suggested a link between MMR and Crohn\u2019s disease, a disorder of the bowel.  Wakefield reported instead the discovery of an entirely new syndrome, autistic enterocolitis, which produced distressing bowel symptoms along with a number of developmental problems resembling autism \u2013 but which the Cochrane report did not even mention\u201d.     Contrast  this with the following from  Wakefield\u2019s publication  in the Lancet.  Wakefield\u2019s findings showed that   \u201cAll 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration.\u201d    Further, from his endoscopy results  \u201c Four cases showed the \"red halo\" sign around swollen caecal lymphoid follicles, an early endoscopic feature of Crohn's disease .\u201d     It becomes apparent that the term enterocolitis covers a range of enteric pathologies, including Crohn\u2019s disease.    Phillips goes sadly astray in attempting to use a generic term as a specific and calling it a brand new one at that. Phillips then goes on to state unblushingly that the Cochrane study did not find Wakefield\u2019s research unreliable.  True.  They left out all four articles, one because it was a case series, one on the grounds that it had no data and two because they had no comparative data. There was no way to tell if they were unreliable or not.   They certainly were not reliable enough to be included.   However, the bottom fell out of Wakefield\u2019s claims to reliability when it was found by his own  laboratory  that no measles RNA could be detected in any of the biopsy samples from Wakefield\u2019s 12 \u2018autistic enteropathy\u2019 patients.   One could conjecture that Phillips has a taste for linguistic acrobatics.  Her next salvo concludes that while the Cochrane report said that the design and reporting of safety outcomes was \u2018largely inadequate\u2019 this means that the MMR could not be considered safe despite the finding by the Cochrane report of no association between MMR and autism.   Phillips\u2019 line here says it all:    \u201c But that does not mean that it said the vaccine was safe.  It was rather that it didn\u2019t find anything to suggest that it was not\u201d.    Those of us who like to preserve our sanity usually presume that something is safe if we have tried hard but can\u2019t find sound evidence to the contrary rather than take the sure route to paranoia through adopting Phillips\u2019 position. Apparently studies like the Cochrane review are too crude to pick up the small minority of children who for whatever reason are going to be susceptible to regressive autism through exposure to the MMR, a valid point if you ignore the  Finnish study .     Phillips appeals to the clinical evidence \u201c obtained not just by Wakefield and his associates but by others\u201d.    Phillip\u2019s is saying very clearly that Wakefield\u2019s clinical findings have been replicated.   This is highly significant, the very crux of the matter.   So, where are the references?  What clinical findings are we talking about here?   If there is reliable evidence, apparently replicated, that enterocolitis, autism and the MMR are linked then why is Wakefield the subject of a medical board enquiry?  Shouldn\u2019t they be giving him a medal instead?    Strangely the Institute of Medicine, cited by Phillips, does not seem to be aware of these highly significant, indeed, crucial findings.    The National Health Service UK, also in ignorance of this critical data, has compiled a  veritable encyclopaedia  of every paper ever written on the subject of the MMR vaccine including Wakefield and the disreputable Geier\u2019s VAERS study.   Reminiscent of the autism=mercury poisoning cabal, Phillips castigates the Government for refusing to carry out large scale clinical trials to prove once and for all that there is no link between the MMR and autism with enterocolitis.  One wonders how large the scale must be to qualify as \u2018once and for all\u2019 since Phillips is essentially implying that there is no clinical data available, which is untrue and incidentally, inconsistent with her later assertion of the appropriate venue for examining this clinical evidence.   Phillip\u2019s penultimate thrust is to compare apples and oranges in the \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 market.  Apparently, the upfront disclosure of having once advised a pharmaceutical company's legal team is on a par with Wakefield concealing that some of his original study patients were about to embark on a class action against the manufacturers of the MMR, not to mention his patent application for a \u2018safer\u2019 single dose vaccine regime.  This is, quite frankly, dishonest. Finally some mention should be made about Phillips\u2019 rather peculiar notions of examining the clinical evidence.    According to Phillips, \u201c Hopes of examining the existing clinical evidence were pinned on the legal case being brought by the parents claiming compensation on behalf of children damaged by the vaccine\u201d .    One would hope that the validity or otherwise of the clinical evidence would have been settled long before the lawyers enter the fray.   Questions of this type are tried in the court of scientific peer review, not in courts of justice where, obviously, expertise is absent.  In addition, Phillips treats parental evidence as sacrosanct, whereas in the real world, it is freely admitted that recall bias is endemic in these situations.    The ultimate appeals to emotion do nothing to bolster Phillips\u2019 arguments.   It is possible for parents to be both honest in what they believe to be the case, that is, Joey declined within two weeks of the MMR jab, and to be dead wrong.   Public anxiety would not be relieved overnight by a change to single dose vaccinations.

{"date": " September 14, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Letter to the Editor of the Chronicle of Higher Education concerning their article : The Nutty Professor: http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i04/04b00701.htm  Dear Editor I read with dismay the opinion of Dr Mikita Brottman concerning the unseemly presence of eccentrics in academia.  She refers specifically to Asperger's Syndrome.  While the intolerant will always be among us, I find it disturbing that a journal such as the Chronicle of Higher Education would lend editorial space to an article with such basic flaws as errors of inductive reasoning, research quality for which a freshman would be roundly condemned and pronouncements that the author is totally unqualified to render. Taking the research quality first, Brottman seems to think that Asperger's Syndrome is a character disorder and then goes on to perpetuate that misrepresentation by talking as if those with Asperger's Syndrome have definable personality traits.  Dr Brottman is categorically wrong.  Asperger's Syndrome has nothing to say about the personality at all, which should be obvious in the most cursory examination of the literature.  I refer you to Dr Tony Attwood for the expert's view: http://www.tonyattwood.com.au/.    Prima Donnas and the miserly, two variants in the human landscape are around to be sure, but there is nothing in the literature that says that these are more common in the Asperger's population than in the general run of humanity.  It is quite amazing that Brottman should make such a logically fallacious argument.  Just because two former colleagues had what she interprets as personality problems, and it should be noted that we have only Brottman's version of events here, does not mean that those same foibles belong to Asperger's as a class, a classic error of inductive reasoning.  That the Chronicles failed to edit that out is indeed 'peddling prejudice'. That leads to the third flaw in Brottman's article - her assumption that the two colleagues who made such an impression on her for their lack of collegiality could have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.  Dr Brottman is entirely unqualified to make such pronouncements, and given her limitations should not have been allowed to do so. Finally, the only positive that I can find in Dr Brottman's article is perhaps the partial answer to a puzzle.  For some time now, there has been growing concern about declining standards in the university, particularly in the Humanities.  Where this miasma of mediocrity is coming from, no one could say with any certainty.  I think it would be reasonable to say that one of the vectors is Dr Brottman and other assorted like minds.  Brottman acknowledges that the gifted can be eccentric and also concedes that they may be wonderful 'on paper and in the classroom'.  One would think that this is precisely the best job description for an academic.  Yet for Brottman, the subjective 'collegiality' must be elevated to a position of pre-eminence, given that the average can never compete with genius on any other variable.   And academe is the correct abode for the best minds in the business.  To aim for anything less is to encourage a creeping conformity to social norms that are actually antithetical to the aims of higher education, namely inspiration of the finest minds, by the finest minds.   Brottman confesses that if she were in a position to hire someone who from her perspective is an oddball, she would not.  Let us hope for the sake of the academy, that she never is put in such a position. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2005/09/peddling-prejudice.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Peddling Prejudice\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " October 10, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   The  Chronicle  of Higher Education has a certain credibility since by virtue of the title alone, it is intimately associated in the minds of readers with the rarefied atmosphere of centres of advanced learning.  By default, the reader will take it for granted that what the Chronicle publishes adheres to rigorously enforced academic standards.  In brief, the Chronicle trades in trust. What then is to be done when it becomes apparent that the Chronicle has slipped from its lofty perch to go trawling in the gutters of tabloid journalism.    \u201cNutty Professors ,\u201d penned by Dr Mikita Brottman and published by the Chronicle is an article, which follows no recognisable standards, academic or otherwise.  The flaws are numerous, obvious and basic.   It is not the content of this article,  distasteful though that may be , which is at issue here, but the fact that a supposedly reputable journal could usher into print an article replete with standards of research below deplorable, simple logical fallacies of breath-taking magnitude and the willingness of the author to transgress all the boundaries by making pronouncements she is totally unqualified to make.   The latter point is the one that should have sounded the alarm to a competent editorial board that all was not well with this article.  Brottman invokes Asperger\u2019s Syndrome as a suitable label for two past colleagues who failed her \u2018collegiality\u2019 test and are therefore good examples of the Nutty Professors, so disruptive to the tranquil life of academia and the subject of this article.  Brottman is an instructor of language, literature, and culture at the Maryland Institute College of Art, with no qualifications whatsoever as a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist with the requisite expertise in the diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.   Having been alerted by this anomaly, the editorial staff should have had no difficulty detecting the faulty thinking employed by Brottman.   According to Brottman, flaws such as undue frugality or undue insistence on rights and entitlements can be attributed to a class of people by virtue of a label.   This is a classic example of errors of inductive reasoning.  That this cannot be true, as these flaws are common to the vast run of humanity, was missed entirely by the editors of the Chronicle.   The most egregious of the errors committed by Brottman has to do with her description of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome as a \u2018character disorder\u2019.  Neither the  DSM IV , the psychiatrist\u2019s Bible of mental disorders, or its European counterpoint the  ICD 10 , recognise any such entity as a \u2018character disorder\u2019.    There are personality disorders, but Asperger\u2019s is not a personality disorder as the most cursory examination of the DSM IV reveals.  No doubt Brottman felt the need to miscast Asperger\u2019s in this way so that she could then talk knowledgeably of the (non-existent) personality traits associated with the Syndrome.   Asperger\u2019s Syndrome has nothing to say about the personality traits of the individual.  This is a rather fine example of one distortion being used to prop up another.     On publication of this article, representations were made to the President of the Maryland Institute College of Art, who took refuge in citations of \u2018academic freedom\u2019.    The local Tallahassee newspaper, which ran the article, also cited alternate viewpoints, when representations were made to them.  The Chronicle said nothing at all.   Neither argument makes any sense, since the spreading of false information is not what either academic freedom or the freedom to have a differing opinion is about.   Opinions stem from well-reasoned arguments after all and academic freedom does not include the freedom to peddle prejudicial nonsense. This article and by extension, Mikita Brottman, are exemplars of the  current malaise of preposterism  in the academy.   Preposterism, a term invented by Jacques Barzun is characterised in Susan Haack\u2019s words by: \u201ca rising tide of irrationalism, a widespread and increasingly articulate loss of confidence in the very possibility of honest inquiry, scientific or otherwise\u2026...The sham inquirer tries to make a case for the truth of a proposition his commitment to which is already evidence- and argument-proof. The fake inquirer tries to make a case for some proposition advancing which he thinks will enhance his own reputation, but to the truth-value of which he is indifferent.\u201d Brottman\u2019s article is a fine example of the latter, since the distortions of fact that Brottman employs argue a true indifference to their truth value.  And the motive for that indifference is not very far away.  Brottman has a book to sell and writing an article, which might be considered controversial but dignified is one way to enhance the author\u2019s reputation and drum up interest in the author\u2019s work.  Consequently, the truth value or otherwise of what Brottman actually wrote, was not terribly important, presenting a facsimile of a plausible argument sufficient to raise interest, was.   The  Chronicle\u2019s  motive for publication of this sub-standard piece was probably its controversial value.   Commercially, it makes sense as a means of drumming up reader interest and hopefully increased revenues from subscriptions.   Therefore the incentive to look too closely at its rationale was never present.   Even the protests that were raised in letters to the Editor (none published) were in one sense good, since there is no such thing as bad publicity if advertising is the purpose of the exercise.  But that is not what sustains selling the Chronicle to subscription readers.  Publishing interesting pieces is one half of the equation.  Having academics regard those articles with respect is the other.   Trust is the tradeable commodity.   Publishing too many Brottmans undermines that trust in the long run because it gives aid and comfort to the termites in the academy walls, the fake enquirers and their pseudo-scholarship.

{"date": " March 26, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t           There\u2019s a problem on Harold Doherty\u2019s blog.    It\u2019s just about impossible to carry on a civilized conversation with anyone without Harold stepping in and ruining the reciprocal nature of it.     Case in point, Harold  had a post on the myth of excluding  very low IQ children from the Lovaas 1987 study.    I chip in with the fact that the myth isn\u2019t a myth.    Trouble is, I remember what I read really well, just not where I read it, so I can\u2019t cite the reference.     Harold dives in, and not just with a \u2018please cite the reference\u2019.    Fortunately,  Michelle blogs about it  as a form of holiday from her Tribunal case, which is harrowing and giving her sleepless nights no doubt.    So, I refer Harold to her blog for the proper references    - and nothing happens.    Harold won\u2019t allow the post.    OK, it does wreck the reciprocal nature of information exchange, but it\u2019s not that big an obstacle, a hillock really, since I can blog about it on my own site.    But, you must admit it\u2019s annoying, especially when the matter is quite a bit more serious.            In the same post on Harold\u2019s blog, I also made a reference to    the Sallows and Graupner study  demonstrating the random effect of the intervention ( ABA ) on the outcomes \u2013 a very important point.    That interpretation of the data is much more in accordance with the facts than citing this study as a replication of Lovaas.    So  some helpful chap (Anonymous) writes a reply  and with hindsight, I\u2019m just not prepared to have yet another post disappear just to keep Harold in the fantasy world to which he has become accustomed.            Here\u2019s what Anonymous had to say: >>>alyric wrote that the paper demonstrates \"that the therapy is not the critical factor in the outcome\". I thought it might be important to recognise that both therapeutic groups DID recieve [sic]  ABA  based intervention. The authors note \"All children received treatment based on the UCLA model\" (Sallows and Graupner, 2005, p. 420). They also note (p 422) that some elements of PRT (R. Koegel and Koegel, 1995) were used while the work of Maurice, Green and Luce (1996) was also drawn on.         True but not relevant, yet. >>>Table 1 indicates mean hours of  ABA  for the two treatment groups to be 38.6 (Clinic-driected) [sic]and 31.67 (Parent-directed). during year one with similar hours for year two of the program.\u201d        Getting warmer, but just a tad misleading there and did not mean to be, I\u2019m sure. The hours for the second year were 36.6 (clinic) and 30.9 (parent).    There\u2019s still a considerable gap.    But, that\u2019s not the only gap.    The supervision regime is markedly different: 6-10 hours per week (clinic) as against 6 hours per month (parent).            >>>>If you look at the data reported prior to combining scores the clinic directed group of rapid learners that met criteria for best outcomes is close to 38% while 60% of the parent directed rapid learners met criteria for best outcomes. All recieved [sic] ABA  intervention.       Exactly and with much less intervention and much less professionally supervised, you have markedly better outcomes.    The difference between 60% and 38% is more than enough to do two things \u2013 bury this as a replication of Lovaas and cast considerable doubt that there is any correlation whatsoever between the intervention and the outcome.    When data looks like this, one tends to think \u201crandom\u201d.    Another thing to keep in mind is that the clinic group also had an advantage on some of the variables that Sallows et al seem to think might be highly correlated with outcome, like IQ.    The clinic group pre-treatment mean IQ was 60.4 compared to 51 for the parent group.    VAB scores and verbal imitation scores were also significantly lower for the parent group compared to the clinic group.    Didn\u2019t do too well with that head start, did they?    >>>>One confound that may be at play that may account for some of the variance is alluded to by the authors when they report that parents \"...were encouraged to to extend the impact of treatment by practicing newly learned material with their child throughout the day...\" (p 420). It begs the question as to if the parents who were more engaged in \"directing\" home based programs were in fact also more inclined to extend therapy hours as they had a more intimate knowledge of programs?        Yes, they did say that on page 420, but they also said the following:         P432 \u2013 \u201cSenior therapists rated parents on the percentage of involvement in their child\u2019s treatment during the first year.    Although the correlation with outcome, r = .32, was not significant.\u201d     That\u2019s a very low level of correlation.         P434 \u2013 \u201cFirst, ratings of parental involvement were weakly correlated to outcome.\u201d         There\u2019s a flat contradiction there and all the more puzzling because they had data to show that there was no correlation between parental involvement and outcome, so why try to use it to explain the good results for the parent group?      But this is how they interpreted the differences in data between the parent and clinic groups:         \u201cParent-directed children, who received 6 hours per month of supervision (usually 3 hours every other week, which is much more than \u201cparent managed\u201d or \u201cworkshop\u201d supervision), did about as well as clinic-directed children, although they received much less supervision.\u201d         I think this is in the class of a \u2018whopper\u2019.    They have such a huge amount of statistical data in this study and here we have 60% good outcomes being considered more or less equal to 38%.             Both the whopper and the contradictory analysis are worth a letter to the American Journal on Mental Retardation asking for an explanation, in the fond hope that there will be an erratum published at least for the whopper.    By nature, I\u2019m a pessimist.         >>>>The primary question the authors attempted to address seems to have been whether a Community based program could achieve similar results to what Lovaas (1987) did (without using aversives) (p419). If you think about it... the entire program, both parent directed and clinic directed service models, were in fact facets of the WEAP community based program... it appears that as such, they are pretty darn close to in fact achieving such outcomes.        Again that\u2019s what they said at the start of the 2005 paper.    However,  way back at the beginning here\u2019s what the title and abstract said:         Replicating Lovaas\u2019 Treatment and Findings: Preliminary Results 1    Glen O. Sallows and Tamlynn D. Graupner    Wisconsin  Young Autism Project         Abstract    Twenty-four autistic children completed the first year of a three-year replication    study of the 1987 research published by Lovaas. Changes in pre-post test    scores showed an average gain of 22 IQ points. Nineteen of the children    matched those in Lovaas\u2019 study. Eight children showed a gain of 45 IQ points,    raising them into the average range. Gains in adaptive/social skills rose to the    low average range. These \u201cbest outcome\u201d children represented 42% of the    matched group. Several factors related to outcome and its prediction are    discussed.         Originally they were out to duplicate Lovaas\u2019 findings and that\u2019s perfectly OK.    What is not OK is to change tracks along the way and not even attempt to address the discrepancies between their initial aim and their final results.    Well, it\u2019s not OK if this were a paper in a scientific journal.    But I\u2019ve said before, behaviour analysis does not use the methods of Science.    I\u2019ve also said that behaviour analysts tend not to learn from other areas in psychological research.    This study demonstrates that apparently they cannot learn from their own research.    Carrying on as if this study is nothing out of the ordinary does nothing to advance understanding; it simply ignores the discordant in favour of maintaining a very shaky status quo.    There is another plausible explanation of the Sallows and Graupner results.    Calling  ABA  simply a random factor is being nice.    The data fits very well into the scenario that  ABA  is fundamentally antithetical to how an autistic can learn and impedes progress.    Therefore, less of it will result in better outcomes, which is what they found.    Are they going to critically examine what they did?    I doubt it.    This is  ABA  and the framework easily handles any empirical data.     I\u2019m not the only one who has noticed this predilection for equivocation in behavior analysis.            Is Behaviorism becoming a Pseudoscience ? , by Jerome C Wakefield (2006) looks at token economies in the mental health system as an alternative to pharmaceutical approaches to managing schizophrenic patients.      Apparently Wong, Midkiff and Wyatt lament that behaviour analytic management is cast aside in favour of pharmaceutical solutions.     Here\u2019s equivocation at its best (or worst).         \u201cBizarre responses, most notably psychotic speech, will at times resist contingency management procedures\u2026.or will spontaneously recover over time\u2026.or when training has ended.\u201d    Has any possible outcome been omitted here?         They go on:         \u201cThese results have been interpreted as showing that clients\u2019 underlying belief systems have remained intact despite behavioral training.\u201d    No kidding!         And \u2013          \u201cHowever, multiform and persistent bizarre verbalizations can be parsimoniously viewed as generalized responses with a long history of intermittent reinforcement.    After being positively and negatively reinforced by different people in various situations over many years, bizarre verbalizations could be overlearned responses that resist contingencies administered in circumscribed therapy sessions over mere weeks or months\u201d.    In other words, no amount of data is enough to disconfirm the behaviorist explanation and as should be really familiar, the therapy would have worked if they had had more time.         Wakefield  points to the seminal and very long term study by Paul and Lentz, much cited in support of behavioural interventions in mental health.    It appears to have the equivalent status to the Lovaas 1987 study.     Uncannily, all the positive outcomes were due, not to reward contingencies, but to a draconian system of punishment \u2013 aversives.    Aggression toward staff was met with 72 hours solitary confinement with manipulation of the environment to make it uncomfortable.     The outcomes in Lovaas were contingent upon aversives as well, something that is rarely mentioned.   Paul wrote a critique of Wakefield's critique , which readers should look at.    It looks to me like really high quality equivocation, but Wakefield did ignore some things, notably, the nature of the population in the study - a very big factor.  This does not however, make up for   lack of parity of reasoning or as  another reviewer  pointed out - the effects of the aversives, which Paul attempts to equivocate his way around. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/03/myths-and-misrepresentations-about-aba.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/03/intake-iq-in-lovaas-1987.html", "http://www.asatonline.org/pdf/Sallows-Graupner2005.pdf", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2007/03/myths-and-misrepresentations-about-aba.html#comment-6621552482164958392", "http://www.wiautism.com/pdf/ReplicatingLovaas1999.pdf", "http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4032/is_200610/ai_n17191391", "http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4032/is_200610/ai_n17191388/pg_4", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=7380758"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2007/03/harolds-hillock-aba-equivocation-and.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Harold\u2019s Hillock: ABA, Equivocation and Other Feints\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " October 13, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Every now and then something you read connects with something you know, provoking a chain of thought that produces something resembling an idea.  So these musings are ideas in their embryonic state \u2013developing but no clue yet as to how they\u2019ll end up. It is said (Frith and Happe, I think) that autistics lack the drive for central coherence - the ability to put facts and experience and feelings, plus a whole lot of non-verbal information together and come up with a \u2018big picture\u2019.  In contrast, autistics are said to be in the words of one luminary, \u2018tyrannised by detail\u2019 \u2013 in other words they can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. Interestingly, this theory flies right in the face of all those autistics, Temple Grandin among them, who have this extraordinary ability to visualise entire systems and if that\u2019s not the big picture then what is?   There are differences in the kinds of \u2018big picture\u2019 here obviously.  One refers to systems and the others, of the kind that Frith and Happe automatically assumed to be universal, have an essential social element.  It should be reasonably clear from Simon Baron Cohen\u2019s work, that those who are exceptionally good at systematising really cannot have a significant deficit in finding the big picture at least as far as systems go.  Yet again, we have proposed universal deficits  - be it central coherence or imagination or even empathy, which on deeper analysis turns out to be only evident in situations calling for social nous.  This is the kind of thing that is often called a lack of common sense, which is somewhat more accurate than a lack of central coherence in that it at least acknowledges that the deficit really does lie in seeing things outside of the common way.  Mesdames Frith and Happe seem to be lending some indirect support for Baron-Cohen\u2019s theories.  It would be interesting to speculate that these researchers and many like them would score exceptionally well as empathisers and less well as systematisers.  And this would have implications regarding just how far such empathisers can really empathise with autistic spectrum folk, given their own social biases as it were.   Those whose theories have unacknowledged assumptions of social primacy may have very little \u2018theory of autistic people\u2019. Not only are these sorts of deficits only deficits by virtue of context or presupposition, there is no acknowledgement that this drive for central coherence is not always a good thing to have.    The old saw goes that some people put two and two together and come up with five.   I suspect that the drive for coherence or the urge to make sense of things can lead to an invention of what\u2019s missing in a picture or a deliberate dismissal of seemingly non-concordant data in order to come up with a comprehensible, but by now erroneous, whole.  The autistic meanwhile, hung up on all these details that don\u2019t fit is never going to have that problem.  They will have other problems to be sure, but not that one.    This drive might also make some people more suggestible.  Witness the extraordinary success of the Nigerian scam for example.  The conman come smooth operator need only hand someone a plausible framework combined with a suitable incentive such as increased wealth or increased attractiveness to the opposite sex.  The mark can then be relied upon to do all the heavy work in making a rosy picture out of very little.  Pesky details offering clues to a different scenario will have been pruned, not by the con artist but by his victim.   We all know charismatic people, most of them upright citizens and we marvel or envy their ready charm and the ease with which they seem to relate to such a broad range of individuals.  Perhaps their talent lies in being able to read people well enough to present them with the framework most suitable for them to fill in the blanks and think, what a lovely person or what a great idea!     Actually charismatic operators even very upright ones could present problems for even relatively socially skilled ASDs because reliant on the details as they are, they aren\u2019t going to accept just any old \u2018fill in the dots\u2019 picture and problems arise when the charismatic person does not get the predicted response of \u2018oh what a lovely person\u2019 or \u2018good idea\u2019! etc.  An asset or a deficit, presenting people with plausible frameworks seems to me to be one tool for getting round the social world that an autistic could make use of, once he or she gets a handle on how prone people are to fill in the blanks by invention so to speak.  They might as well fill in the blanks your way rather than leaving this to blind chance or mere inclination.   I am not suggesting that this framework be untrue to the person.  Faking it never works for an autistic.  But think how lovely it would be if people could be guided into thinking that you are amiable, helpful but shy and really prefer to be left alone and they do! \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2005/10/a-muse-part-1-drive-for-central.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t the A Muse:  Part 1  The Drive for Central Coherence\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " July 16, 2006", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Letter to the powers that be at Hormone Research. See  http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/104/update-a-republished-article  for why. 17 July 2006 Dr Franco Chiarelli Secretary General European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Dear Dr Chiarelli I would like to draw your attention to an article e-published by your organisation\u2019s journal Hormone Research on 5 July 2006, titled A Clinical and Laboratory Evaluation of Methionine Cycle-Transsulfuration and Androgen Pathway Markers in Children with Autistic Disorders, by Dr Mark Geier and Mr David Geier. There are a number of anomalies in this publication, which contravene the guidelines set by your organisation for responsible publication. Firstly and perhaps critically, the study is overseen by a review board with neither the expertise nor the objectivity to assure the well-being of the study\u2019s participants or the integrity of the study results. The  Institutional Review Board  of their Institute for Chronic Illnesses (IRB) is composed of people with either a committed financial stake in the outcome (Dr and Mr Geier), a family member (Anne Geier), business partner of Dr Geier (Dr Young) or the parent of a participant in the study (Lisa Sykes). The supposed expertise in biochemistry is vested in Mr David Geier, who has completed two postgraduate biochemistry subjects at George Washington University. There is no expertise present in the IRB on endocrinology. Somewhat curiously, the IRB oversight appears to be retroactive. The IRB was registered in March 2006, the research described in the article was conducted between November 2004 and November 2005. There is no statement from this IRB concerning the long-term effects of chemical castration (Lupron) on a group of children, both boys and girls, now numbering over 50, who are undergoing the Geier\u2019s \u2018Lupron Protocol\u2019 despite the lack of peer reviewed scientific support for what is at present, merely a hypothesis. No doubt, the article in Hormone Research will be produced as evidence of scientific rigour. Secondly, the journal article states that neither Dr Mark nor Mr David Geier has a conflict of interest in the results of this study. Surely the editors were aware that Dr and Mr Geier have applied for a  patent of the \u2018Lupron Protocol \u2019, which would constitute the ultimate in conflicts of interest. Thirdly, the actual biochemical rationale behind the Lupron Protocol has some elements that are dubious in the extreme. The concept of a testosterone sheet, which traps mercury underlies the Protocol. However, testosterone has only ever been demonstrated to take this form if treated with  hot benzene in the laboratory . Dr and Mr Geier discuss this and other concepts  here . Part 2 of their presentation refers specifically to testosterone sheets. There is no mention made that this is, thus far, a physiological impossibility. Fourthly, the study was apparently conducted in a suburban home, residence of Dr Mark Geier. The Institute for Chronic Illnesses (convenor of the IRB) and the offices of The Genetic Centers of America (study organisation), are all located here at Dr Geier\u2019s home address. Finally, the work of Dr and Mr Geier has not held up to either scientific or ethical scrutiny in the past. I refer you to the  outcome of a recent legal case , where the testimony and research integrity of the Geier\u2019s was found to be less than satisfactory. The Institute of Medicine, the premier medical organisation in the US, has also criticised their work in the IOM 2004 Report,  Vaccines and Autism. I understand the necessity of freedom to pursue an idea and I have no wish to stifle scientific endeavour. However, when the endeavour lacks any real basis in science and appears to be mere scaffolding in order to erect a fa\u00e7ade of scientific respectability in pursuit of legitimising a lucrative protocol, I question why a peer reviewed journal such as Hormone Research would lend its name to the enterprise. The journal has nothing to gain but a tarnished reputation. The future clients of the Geier\u2019s Lupron Protocol have potentially, a lot more to lose. I urge you to read the  extremely thorough critique  of this new direction in autism treatment and its authors, by Ms Kathleen Seidel of  http://www.neurodiversity.com/ .

{"date": " October 25, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Ms Judy Singer and the select coterie [1] of ASpar have provided the parenting world, or at least the autistic parenting world with a  handy little checklist  for the dual purposes of identifying the weaknesses in your autistic parent, or indeed, your own autistic parental lapses, should you be wearing the right label.    Ms Singer\u2019s objective is that this list should serve as a basis for future research into the problems of parenting where the parent has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.   But why stop there? In the spirit of normal isn\u2019t necessarily wonderful, it is apparent that parental frailties are not confined merely to the presence of a label to be found in the DSM IV.   Lapses in child rearing practices are legion among the very population, which although it has never been seen anywhere near the psychiatrist\u2019s bible, can be found described in the alternate register, the DSN-IV  (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 'Normal' Disorders),  published by the Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical. Using the following diagnostic criteria for 666.00 Neurotypic Disorder, the potential impact of \u2018normal\u2019 characteristics on parental praxis can be delineated. A. Qualitative impairment in independent social interaction as manifested by the following: 1) Disorder of empathy marked by inability to separate the feelings of self from others. The child is seen as an emotional extension of the parent [2] and therefore serves as an appropriate mirror for parental emotions and an outlet for fulfilling parental aspirations.  Saturday morning at the local soccer field is a suitable venue to view the manifestation of this phenomenon in the large (2) extreme or abnormal seeking of comfort at times of distress After many years of modelling that in times of trouble, there should be a grand collective of sympathy and group therapy rather than an appraisal of the actual problems, children will get the idea that when things go wrong, it\u2019s not up to them to fix it.  Victimology, courtesy of engineering external loci of control, is rife. . 3) Constant imitation This is the first step in conditioning the child to conform to social norms even where this, rationally, could be considered unwise.  An afternoon at the local mall observing the \u2018hooker look\u2019 as modelled by the pre-teens and the body piercing of their teenage elders is the perfect way to observe imitation in action. 4) Excessive Social Play It has long been the contention of the autistic community, that the only perseveration indulged by neurotypicals is socialising.   A parental over-emphasis on socialising has the unfortunate side effect of denying children the benefits of solitude; the time to be quiet, to think and to dream.   This echoes C.S Lewis\u2019s:[3]  We live, in fact, in a world starved for solitude, silence, and private: and therefore starved for meditation and true friendship 5) Impairments in peer friendship Along with conditioning to imitate mindlessly, the child is also taught to make \u2018suitable\u2019 friends.  This is seen by the parent as crucial if the child is to succeed in life, by attaining the best possible place in the pecking order.   Parents regularly sanction those of their children who attempt friendship with weirdos or anybody deemed different, just in case some of the weirdness rubs off.   A medium sized school or bureaucracy is the ideal spot to observe the natives in their hierarchical habitat. B. Qualitative impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication, and in imaginative activity, as manifested by the following: 1) &2)  blatant overuse of all modes of communication. Modelling their parents, children are taught at an early age to over-communicate, possibly as a means of social obfuscation, where if the recipient can\u2019t read the body language because of all the static, so much the better in the standard power game.  3) excessive imaginative irrelevant activity Parents encourage their children into trivial leisure activities, probably because they themselves can\u2019t see past the Hollywood mentality and the 30-second sound bite style of news programs on television. 4) Abnormalities of speech This is really a failure of parents to stem overly florid verbal displays.  The correct venue to observe this phenomenon is the playground of an all-girls high school, first day back after the term break.  Observers are cautioned to wear noise-cancelling headphones to avoid hearing loss from exposure to squeals in the upper register. 5) Distortion of speech content Here a child is firmly indoctrinated into believing that the packaging is just as important as the contents if not an integral part of the message and with an enormous emphasis on obfuscation of the message to ameliorate any possible disagreement.   Political Correctness is the obvious destination of these linguistic acrobatics.  Taking the \u2018if it sounds good, it must be good\u2019 model just a little further and one ends up in the cloud cuckoo land of postmodernism. 6) Distortion of conversation. On no account must a child get the idea that conversation is about the exchange of ideas.  Conversations, like practically everything else are subordinate to socialising.  The topic under discussion must be inclusive of all participants whether or not they have something to contribute, so the more superficial the topic, the better to allow for everyone to have their say.  It is considered a faux pas to discuss any one issue for longer than five minutes, less if at all possible.  Religion, politics or any issue, which might be considered controversial are out of bounds because someone might get upset at being disagreed with.  Of course, the rationale is that the social fa\u00e7ade must be maintained at all times, and besides, all ideas have equal validity. C. Markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests, as manifested by the following:  1) Obliviousness to details Children will be taught that it\u2019s only the big picture that really matters.  The pesky details can be ignored along with things like accuracy or consistency.  The forest is the thing even if all the trees are infested with termites. 2) Process myopia. Not all parents do this, but I have seen a number insist that how you do something is just as important as the result, which I think must be highly correlated with the desire to conform.   Acting always to be a good member of the herd, children will be taught very early that the way the group does things is the \u2018right\u2019 way to do it.    3) Pre-occupation with status. From about four years of age, children are indoctrinated into having the most popular or socially desirable dolls, action men, games etc, so that when they grow up they can be just as competitive as their parents in terms of houses, cars, jobs, fashion or any other one of the gazillion markers of \u2018success\u2019.   Architectural monstrosities of environmental nihilism, the McMansions, dominating the suburban landscape are superb exemplars of the status game, run riot. Gentle reader, if more than 10% of the above applies to you, get thee to a therapist.  Your offspring is in danger of becoming a lying, passive aggressive, manipulative, emotionally blackmailing, social climbing moron. 1.  It was always assumed that Aspar was an entirely legitimate enterprise of those seeking to gain a better understanding of self in the light of their terrible childhood experiences.    Unearthed during Aspar\u2019s foray into public policy advocacy, was the fact that if your childhood was not particularly dreadful, then your participation in Aspar was not particularly desirable.   A former member wrote: \u201cThe data on children with autistic parents is going to be skewed if you're getting any of it from ASpar.  They have instituted policies barring anyone who is particularly identified with autism, anyone who finds blanket bigoted and extremely rude statements about autistic people offensive, and anyone who finds it hard to gauge social situations from the list. This basically blocks anyone who is autistic and anyone who is NT but cares about autistic people enough to be bothered and say something when these blanket statements are made.  I was on the list near its inception. I have an autistic parent, and I wanted to know what I might appear like to my children if I ever have NT children. My experiences of my (quite compassionate, by the way, more so than most people I've ever met, and extremely faithful to his ethics which include compassion) autistic parent were much more positive than my experiences of my non-autistic parent, and I wanted to be able to share those experiences as well as listen to others', be they positive or negative.\u201d Realistically, the coin of the realm in Aspar is hatred.  Whether it started out that way is a moot point, because it was inevitable that when censorship set in and only the negative gained legitimacy, that negative would be reinforced.   There is a kind of macabre element of competition in the social dance for acceptance especially if the correct answers are strictly limited. 2. Singer\u2019s checklist includes the following, which oddly enough raises the same issue across both lists   \u201cCan the AS parent recognise that the child is a separate entity from themselves?\u201d This checklist is apparently a compilation of the members of Aspar, admittedly a bunch of amateurs with an agenda.  Even so, it is the height of lunacy to assign this characteristic to a group renowned for autonomy \u2013 and isn\u2019t that the basic problem?  This does raise questions about the authenticity of these parents\u2019 diagnoses. 3. C.S.

Below are a few of the comments of parents on Kev Leitch\u2019s  petition  contra the Autism Speaks video, Autism Every Day. Naturally, I signed it. My views on the topic are fairly clear not to say forceful  (here  and  here ). >>>>As a videographer/editor and as a mother- I enjoyed the documentary and think it has great educational value. The general public needs to understand the pain- and it's not pretty. Why would anyone vote for more funding or better trained teachers if everything in the autism world is a-ok? As you say, it may not accurately depict autism for every family, but for the uniformed - it sends a powerful message. I'm sorry if anyone finds this offensive but I certainly was able to relate to a lot of what those mothers had to say. There fears, hopes and dreams.....hit home for me. I can see where some people have complaints with Autism Speaks. This isn't one of them. It is an amazing view that may help people to realize this IS something serious! It left out any treatment options or real hope but it was finally a different view than all the HFA stuff we see. There are a couple of themes running through the commentary. It\u2019s OK to exaggerate (might as well call something on this scale lying). People won\u2019t listen to us, provide needed services etc unless we tug the heart strings pretty strongly so since our hearts are pure - 1. is really OK. So, the fairy tale method of pedagogy is alive and well. Ignore the dragon, smoke, fire etc, they\u2019re only there for theatrical effect \u2013 concentrate on the message \u2013 Folks we need help here. Just wondering if these folks know that this is a very slippery slope and about to become suicidal when Joe Q Public realizes that a) they\u2019ve been exaggerated to (OK - lied to) and b.) the depiction of autism portrayed may, on a bad day, apply to a mere fraction of that 1:166. I digress. The interesting point of this commentary is similar commentary for similar reasons. I thank jypsy and the Diva for the motivation here. On the  Diva\u2019s blog  (comments section) jypsy posted the following: That would be Christine, maker of the \"Emails from Marty\" video...  http://tinyurl.com/e94hp \"This 11 minute video is based on emails written by a 25 year old man with autistic spectrum disorder, describing his life-long struggle of being different. Includes photographs and video of children from all over the world.\"Her thoughts on her video\"this is america- and i can sell any video i produce.putting a disclaimer on the video itself is my choice.putting a disclaimer on the website is my choice.what i do with this video is my choice- and as for my \"credibility\"anyone who knows me knows my motivations.\" Actually, the first Christine cited by the Diva is a different Christine, but the message is eerily similar. In the case of supercon Marty Murphy, it was OK for a verbal autistic to impersonate a non-verbal autistic of the opposite gender because the message \u2013 a kind of free form poetry version of the Autism Every Day video was too good to pass up when it comes to educating the public about autism \u2013 even if this was complete dishonesty. After all, as the first Christine put it \u201canyone who knows me, knows my motivations\u201d. Interestingly, there was a petition to sign contra Marty Murphy\u2019s opus too. Yes \u2013 I signed that. Wade Rankin is a very nice bloke I think, if occasionally misguided. What leads him astray is interestingly, the same sort of thing expressed by the two Christines and assorted parents \u2013 simply \u2013 it\u2019s OK to mess with the truth in a good cause or in it\u2019s usual guise \u2013 the end justifies the means, a very ancient fallacy indeed. However, leaving the ramifications of this fallacy to the philosophers, the point of this post is to examine two very different ways of looking at the world. It\u2019s a sort of balance between the relative importance given to facts and the relative importance given to feelings - and it\u2019s a continuum. It just so happens that there are whole swags of reasonably intelligent folk who give great value to facts even if somebody gets hurt in the process, because they think that this is the best way. Of course, there is a whole other swag of reasonably intelligent folks who think that feelings including the feelings you engender in other people are what really matters because that\u2019s what\u2019s really important for people when you come down to it. This argument is as old as the hills and there is some evidence that the basis is real \u2013 see Simon Baron\u2019 Cohen\u2019s work. This has a whole lot of ramifications - someday I\u2019ll get around to writing \u2018mere masculinity\u2019, a mini opus on why psychologists don\u2019t like traditional masculinity. In a a  \u2018more in sorrow than in anger\u2019 post  on \u2018The absurdity of being taken to task for what one doesn\u2019t say\u2019, Wade writes about some of the Hub\u2019s memorial tributes for Katie McCarron: \u201cThose that used the death to make a point were not alone, though, as many in the press and in various corners of the web tried to connect this senseless act to a \u201clack of services.\u201d Hmm, as I recall there actually was not one single press article at the time that was not all about 'she must have been driven to do it' and not that many Hub tributes that said 'she was a selfish no-good mother who did it because Autism Speaks and Autism Canada led her to believe she could get away with it. Heck, Autism Canada would most probably give her a job if she succeeded.' The problem is, I would think, the relative position Wade takes on \u2018facts\u2019 . Wade wrote earlier on the killing of Katie McCarron that he had refrained from comment \u201c- more from a complete lack of understanding about what could compel someone, who by all accounts was a devoted mother, to take the life of a beloved child.\u201d Hmm, the facts say that Karen McCarron hadn\u2019t parented this child for the past 20 months \u2013just over half the child\u2019s lifetime so there is no evidence that she was devoted and it is doubtful that she considered Katie beloved, since she killed her. Note \u2013 these are just the facts \u2013 not a word said yet about feelings. Now, why would a nice guy like Wade choose not to see what is in very plain sight? Perhaps because there were other things that were in plainer sight to him - like solidarity with the feelings of a fellow parent of an autistic child, who might after all be innocent of murder because she was not in her right mind at the time. That thing called solidarity is all about feelings and with the above three examples, the base hypothesis is that for a great many people, feelings especially those of solidarity come first and everything else second. That this can be demonstrably pathological behaviour in many situations is never really addressed. So, the next time someone suggests to \u2018agree to disagree\u2019 \u2013 diagnostic of the pre-eminent feeler\u2019 \u2013 decline. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/07/bob-wright-is-just-trying-_115317162078737709.html", "http://tinyurl.com/e94hp", "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_injectingsense_archive.html"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2006/07/and-truth-shall-set-you-free.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t And the Truth Shall Set You Free.......\n\t                       \n                          "},

Ye make yourselves like unto whitened sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness Matt. 23:26-27\" Christianity, in this brand new millennium, is beset from all sides.  The atheist sits smugly basking in a sense of superiority, as if intellectual brownie points can be earned through paucity of imagination.  The ultra liberals opine knowingly, blissfully unaware that they\u2019ve thrown the basics out with the bathwater through slavish adherence to the prevailing fashions in academic theology, which have little or no meaningful interface with Christian practice.  Factions of the ultra-conservative, hell bent (literally) on preserving the purity of the faith from a multitude of sinners, employ the ancient fallacy \u2013 the end justifies the means. Look at any right of centre religious website and they will tell you that the real enemies of religion are atheism and the sheep-like fashionistas of liberal theology and other trendy persuasions.  Their sense of direction is faulty.  It is the nature of conservatism to hold on to tradition as the \u2018tried and true\u2019 method of avoiding doing the wrong thing.   But, it\u2019s worth noting that if Christ had adhered to this regimen, there would be no such thing as Christianity and the same argument could be put for other religions if Abraham, Mohammed and Buddha, among others, had been so afflicted.   Adherence to tradition has the unfortunate side affect of reducing the capacity to adapt the tenets of the religion to the times in which we live.  No one and certainly no conservative spouting family values would dream of selling their children into slavery or offering their virgin daughters as potential rape victims to protect the guests in their home.    If these admonitions from the Old Testament, however allegorical, were today taken quite literally, I would think it entirely plausible to surmise that these ultra traditionalists had completely lost the plot and confused the rule of scripture with the spirit or the intent of scripture. It\u2019s this substitution of the rules of Christian living for the spirit of Christian living that is so characteristic of the classic \u2018whitened sepulchre\u2019 and I contend that this phenomenon is to be found most frequently lurking among the denizens of the rabid right rather than the lunatic left.   Of all the candidates for \u2018whitened sepulchres\u2019 masquerading as Christianity in cyberspace, none fit the description better than the  Endeavour Forum , brainchild of Ms Babette Francis, founder, editor in chief and sole representative globe-trotter.  The hallmark of the whitened sepulchre is that everything looks beautiful on the outside.  The inside, however is another matter entirely.  True to the imagery of internal corruption, the resources on the Endeavour Forum are a mixture of bloated statement, half-truth, innuendo, misrepresentation and outright falsehood.   It is said that Satan is the father of all liars, so it behoves all Christians to be very careful with data.  Christians by the nature of the beliefs they hold can and should be held to much stricter standards than other people.  Consequently, when I see the calibre of the resources that the Endeavour Forum uses as part of its program to combat abortion and protect the family, I reflect on a supposedly Christian forum using the tools of the father of all liars in pursuit of its aims.  Prominent on the Endeavour Forum website is the work of  Joel Brind  devoted to warning the wayward that having an elective abortion as opposed to a spontaneous miscarriage incurs an increased risk of acquiring breast cancer \u2013 the ABC link.  That this link is dubious in the extreme is well illustrated by Dr Brind\u2019s own articles.    According to Brind\u2019s meta-analysis of 38 epidemiological studies, the increased relative risk of breast cancer associated with abortion is 30%.  To put that figure in perspective, the actual  real risk  increases from 0.13% (the average risk for any woman) to 0.17% for those who have had an abortion.   But even this meagre figure is misleading since no figure is an absolute.  It is always + or \u2013 something and the 95% confidence intervals suggest that there is no real increased risk at all, a conclusion well supported by the  graphical data  Dr Brind presents and is also the conclusion of  conventional science .  Note the unreliability of the vast majority of these studies as evidenced by the breadth of their 95% confidence intervals.  Also note that to improve the appearance of validity, the graphical scale is logarithmic, not linear.  It\u2019s practically diagnostic of whitened sepulchres to declaim \u2018love the sinner and hate the sin\u2019 and be quite unable to put that into practice. Surely, loving the sinner, but not the sin, does not include scaring them to death based on questionable data.    If moralising from shonky data is one thing; calumny is quite another.   Quoting  Ms Francis: \u201cThe brief warns \u201cAny attempts to legalise gay marriage should be aware of the link between homosexuality and pedophilia, it is of great concern that that there is a disproportionately greater number of homosexuals among pedophiles and an overlap between the gay movement and the movement to make pedophilia acceptable\u201d.  This notion along with quite a few unsavoury notions emanates from an  article  penned by a group of doctors (medical variety).    Whatever their qualifications, their conclusion is extreme and unwarranted by the data.    The argument in favour of homosexuality promoting pedophilia runs like this.  Around twenty five percent of sexually molested children are boys and 90% of pedophiles are men.  With the prevalence of homosexuality at 3% total, it stands to reason that pedophilia in homosexuals runs at 5 \u2013 6 times the average \u2013 mathematical perfection but otherwise nonsense and an indictment on members of the medical profession prostituting their professional standing for an ideology.    There is nothing in anyone\u2019s  literature  that molestation of boys automatically translates as a homosexual orientation.   It has been widely acknowledged that the true pedophile has no sexual orientation of any maturity and that is the fundamental problem. A secondary argument sometimes used to bolster the idea that making pedophilia more acceptable is a goal of the gay movement is that homosexuals prey on teenage boys who are below the age consent.  While relationships of this nature no doubt occur, the question has to be asked \u2013 how many 17 year old male virgins are there anyway?   Conveniently, no mention is made of the sexual precocity and curiosity of adolescent boys and more importantly why this sin is sheeted home to homosexuality alone.   If sex is reprehensible in this age group, then share the guilt fairly among people of all sexual orientations.   A similar line of reasoning, namely that the sin is somehow more reprehensible in the homosexual population than in any other is used by our learned medicos in describing the disease profiles of the homosexual population.   Ms Francis was impressed by this line: \u201canal sex as practiced by most gay men , has a large number of diseases associated with it, \u201cmany of which are rare or even unknown in the heterosexual population\u201d such as: anal cancer, Chalmydia trachomatis, Cryptosporidium, Giardia Lamblia, Herpes Simplex virus, HIV, Human papilloma virus, Isospora belli, Microsporidia, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis, Hepatitis B and C and others\u201d. The qualifications around such a statement, that an honest person would make are notably absent.   Contending that this mix of diseases is somehow uniquely associated with the gay community is laughable.  Take  AIDS .  Contrary to the emphasis of these medicos, AIDS is not necessarily the \u2018gay\u2019 disease.  In sub-Saharan Africa, the birthplace of AIDS and home to the overwhelming majority of sufferers, AIDS is a heterosexual problem and always has been.  More women than men are affected and the rates of mother to child transmission are horrific.  Should we follow the favoured blueprint of these medicos and condemn these mothers out of hand?   Chlamydia trachomatis  is on the rise but no one is terrifically concerned about the prevalence among gays.  The real problem is the  high prevalence  among young adult women.   Celebrating the freedom to be as sexually active as one pleases has the down side of increased risk of Chlamydia infection now leading to the heartbreaking risk of infertility in the future.  Should we corral these young women into some kind of moral purdah, or not permit them to marry? Similarly, when the US government introduced the controversial Hepatitis B vaccine into the infant vaccine schedule, they were not concerned with future sexual orientation (a whopping 3%) so much as future experimentation with IV drug usage, which is where the truly high  prevalence of these diseases  resides.  It is doubtful that anyone would go to the time and expense of developing a  vaccine  against the human papilloma virus for the sake of the gay community.  But they would (and have) to prevent cervical cancer in women and penile cancer in men. Each and every one of the diseases cited is a significant problem for the population at large.  In fact, the practice of anal sex is hardly confined to the homosexual community.  According to the  CDC Report , Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15-44 Years of Age, United States, 2002, 40% of men reported having anal sex with a woman. Therein lies the raison d\u2019\u1ec7tre of the whitened sepulchre.  In some fashion, the selected group must be seen as more sinful than the rest of the human herd.   It is then argued that based on the extra, perceived sinfulness of this group, that special sanctions should be applied, such as a ban on same sex marriage.  Based on the arguments the Endeavour Forum chooses to use, only lesbians should marry since theirs is the lowest rate of STDs and far and away the lowest level of sexual molestation. The impetus for their ideology, or so they say, is to protect the sanctity of marriage.  I am all in favour of strengthening marriage but gay marriage can have nothing to say of influence with respect to non-gay marriage.  How can it?  If the moribund state of modern marriage is to be tackled, then the factors affecting such relationships need addressing such as loyalty and commitment to taking the rough with the smooth, not casting about for a suitable scapegoat.  This is the reason why the Bible has so much to say about whitened sepulchres and, by comparison, so little about sexual orientation.  Whitened sepulchres are fundamentally anti-Christian, seeking as they do to deny that every person is culpable and in need of redemption.   In using such dubious references as those cited here in order to prop up the idea that some groups are especially sinful, these supposed upholders of the moral high ground betray this most basic of Christian beliefs.   As the Bible says in a variety of ways \u2013 \u2018He who is without sin, cast the first stone\u2019. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.endeavourforum.org.au/", "http://www.bcpinstitute.org/brochure.htm", "http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/TableV.asp?group=1a&Year=2001&Gender=FEM&RateType=AgeadjType&TableType=INCI", "http://www.bcpinstitute.org/brochure.htm", "http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_Can_Having_an_Abortion_Cause_or_Contribute_to_Breast_Cancer.asp", "http://www.endeavourforum.org.au/april05-09.htm", "http://catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0095.html", "http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html", "http://www.unaids.org/EN/Geographical+Area/By+Region/sub-saharan+africa.asp", "http://www.cdc.gov/std/Chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/adol.htm", "http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/07/28/66/04072866.pdf", "http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/cancer/mg18624954.500", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/ad/361-370/ad362.htm"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2005/09/diagnosing-whitened-sepulchres.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Diagnosing Whitened Sepulchres\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " May 05, 2006", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   There\u2019s a recurring theme running through the stereotypical portrayal of autism in cyberspace.  Along with \u2018cut off from the world\u2019 and \u2018self-injurious\u2019 there\u2019s very often the dramatic \u2018smearing faeces everywhere\u2019, which conjures up very unpleasant images indeed plus a whole bundle of sympathy for the plight of the poor parent having to clean up this foul mess on a regular basis.   It also leaves the marked impression that there\u2019s no hope for the poor lost soul doing the smearing.   Of course this smearing is abnormally occurring in the older autistic child since typically developing children have been known to do this sort of thing \u2013 before the age of 2.   I never had a reason to question the veracity of this assertion until Mr John Best Jr used it and that gave me pause.  Mr Best is not exactly the shy and retiring type.  Generally he lets you know his views quite forcefully.   He runs a weblog with the title \u2018hatingautism\u2019 after all and it would be reasonable to surmise, so all consuming is his plight in raising his autistic son, that if faeces smearing really had been a major and enduring part of the autistic scenery post infancy, we would have heard about it long ago and rather often.   But no, there it was - this solitary reference \u2013 very un-Best-like.  Now once the seed of doubt is planted, it niggles.   How often do we hear this \u2018faeces smearing\u2019 descriptor of parenting in extremis?   On reflection, but this could very easily be recall bias, it seems that the parents making the call are usually referring to OPKs \u2013 Other People\u2019s Kids.  In which case, this could very well be the very stuff of myth making.  Statements are made with a dramatic flourish \u2013 seems to garner lots of sympathy. So it is repeated endlessly and urban legend here we come!    But, lets not lose sight of the fact that these kids are autistic.   Autistic kids have some rather entrenched sensory sensitivities \u2013 particularly to texture.   You won\u2019t find either lima beans or scungy slimy things including bread and butter pudding in my household.   The unimaginable, to me, is how an autistic kid could stand the sensory insults involved in handling faeces.  Here, my imagination simply quits.    So, is this for real?  Do autistic kids smear faeces as a rule?   Are the perpetrator\u2019s really autistic would be my question.   So, when you hear this descriptor, check to see if this is about their child or an OPK, whose parent might very well have heard it about another OPK and so on.  We get exaggerated to on a regular basis, so I think it\u2019s reasonable to be a little more sceptical.  Of course, if this is really real we\u2019d better know about that too. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2006/05/shit-happens-well-maybe-no_114681307869600908.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t SHIT HAPPENS - well maybe not\n\t                       \n                          "},

Autism parents, and autistic people, and autistic parents each have their anguish \u2014 and triumphs \u2014 to share.\" This comment was made by Mothersvox as a way of explaining the negative tone and emphasis of Autism Speaks\u2019 Autism Everyday video. Mothersvox has it about half right. Yes, the goal is to build solidarity. But how can this be a rational means of building understanding based as it is on an extreme of negative emphasis? Is this the kind of \u2018awareness\u2019 we want the general community to have? Who knows, our kids might want a job and a life some time in the future. Things like Autism Everyday come to be because the main goal of 'autism' societies of every stripe, unless they happen to be run by autistics, has very little to do with swapping notes to help the kids and much more to do with sympathy and emotional support for the plight of the parents. When Sally is asking \u2018What do I do about Joe jnr\u2019s tantrums, meltdowns, violent outbursts\u2019 (insert horrible behaviour here), she is not really seeking advice, she already knows what the options are and all she wants is the collective support of her fellow sufferers, well maybe some advice as well, but that\u2019s not the main aim of the game.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with that in principle. It's a social thing. It's what all social people do in situations where they can have a sense of solidarity or group identity about something. But in practice the emotional bonding and solidarity become the social imperative, overriding all other considerations, including the ostensible reason for the group\u2019s existence. But you won\u2019t find that anywhere in the blurb advertising the aims of the site. To a site, they will claim to represent autism. It will be taken as axiomatic that they are the advocates for their children.  And that is true up to the point where the social imperative takes precedence. That point can be seen in this video, on the ASA\u2019s \u2018Getting the Word Out\u2019 campaign and in virtually all pronouncements emanating from Autism Canada.After that point, it must be blindingly obvious that the interests of autistics, including their children are no longer paramount.

In the short time available the producers nimbly jumped from one \u2018autistic moment\u2019 (borrowing a phrase from Phil Schwartz) to the next. There are tantrums aplenty replete with ear shattering screams, sleepless nights, diaper changing of (looked to be about a 3-4 year old), escapism into traffic etc. Interspersed with the footage was commentary from the parents and the occasional sibling on the trauma of sharing house with an autistic child, threatening sanity, marriage and the family\u2019s financial viability.

Can we get an idea of what they might have to say about being a hybrid affliction/burden and the impact of this on their lives? Should we do a little extrapolation here and speculate on the trauma of living in a hostile environment, which would have to be what these autistic children are living in wouldn\u2019t you say?

{"date": " May 20, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Kathleen is unfailingly polite.  I'm half Irish. Dear Ms Taylor         I note your response to Ms Kathleen Seidel's letter \"A Plaintiff in the Pulpit\", which now appears on the Neurodiversity weblog, with a combination of incredulity mixed with misgivings over the future of a sizeable number of autistic children.     I did not receive any response to my letter of 2 March 2007, which predates Kathleen's (attached for reference) and didn't really expect one since this is not my country, though my argument is basically that Christianity is universal and any action on the part of a recognisably Christian organisation that is fundamentally anti-Christian ought to be confronted.            Your response to Kathleen avoided addressing any of the real concerns that this \"Truth is coming to light\" event raises.    Since you appear to have an aversion to meticulously researched facts, perhaps a more down to earth approach would be better.            You state that the Women's Division is guided by the United Methodist Book of Discipline quoting         \"We encourage wise policies relating to the availability of \u2026.drugs.\"         Wise policies are usually based on something other than the junk science your Lisa Sykes is aiding and abetting.    You should try reading the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report of 2004.    Contrary to the conspiracy theorists, the IOM is the expert panel of the American Academy of Sciences and quite independent of the CDC and FDA.             Your ignorance of this issue is very evident in the following:         \"When pharmaceutical products and vaccines can be produced without mercury, we question why even trace amounts of this known neurotoxin are used.\"            The neurotoxin is there as a preservative - and so much for your vaunted 'support' for global vaccination.    No preservative equals no vaccine in places like sub-Saharan Africa or anywhere else with a lack of reliable refrigeration.    So which preservative has the endorsement of the Women's Division?    Why not try thimerosal.    It's proven to be a very safe preservative at the dosage used with no known side effects including neurological defects.     Toxicity is a matter of dosage.    We live in a world full of toxins including neurotoxins.     Practically anything including water and salt can be toxic if the dose is right.    Mercury is ubiquitous.    Does the Women's Division have a plan to rid the planet of volcanic eruptions so we can avoid one of the main sources of Mercury?    We actually are equipped by our Maker to deal with a whole host of nasties both animate and inanimate.    Sure, we shouldn't overdo that.    But tell me where in anybody's Science it is proven that the mere presence of small amounts of thimerosal is overdoing it?                 \"What is wrong with asking for clean healthy drugs for our children\" you ask.    I presume that this is an endorsement by the United Methodist Women 's Division for clean but not very healthy Lupron for children.     When you dreamed up this idea that there is such a thing as 'mercury poisoning' of children diagnosed with autism, you also tacitly endorsed Rev Sykes lunatic treatment option \u2013 the chemical castration of small children so that all the fictitious excess mercury can be removed by the favourite method of quacks and charlatans - chelation.     Do you have any idea what you are lending support to here?    \"Let the children come to me and do not stop them\" in your concordance seems to be a recipe for the following.         First we inject a depot shot of Lupron every two weeks.    It is a painful shot apparently but we'll give it twice as often as the manufacturer recommends because that seems to work better.    Let's also give the child an injection of Lupron every day, not recommended by anybody, but who needs a paediatrician?    We've got this fake Institutional Review Board, which Rev Sykes is a member of and they rubber stamp every step we make.    Every few days we give the child some DSMA (chelator).    This makes them feel ill and upsets their tummies but they'll get used to it.              So here we have a child both terrorised and made miserable based on no science whatsoever and you say that your mission is to protect children?     The long-term effects of both the castration and the chelation are unknown by the way.            The horrible awful irony of this event you're organising is the spectacle of an expensive conference to render a phantom issue mute while simultaneously supporting real child abuse, which is what chelation and castration amount to.

I don\u2019t know that this blog is about hating autism so much as about disliking autistics intensely. Perhaps you don\u2019t like people much at all and with your moniker, that isn\u2019t too surprising. What twit of an ancestor burdened the tribe with Best as the family appellation? Some person from Mittel Europa with a very poor grasp of English thought that \u2018Best\u2019 would be an admirable anglicisation of Bruinovskowa or some such? Some things are hereditary.

Of course, we can see that your problems don\u2019t end at knowing who\u2019s who. Some of those people sketches are amazingly off the wall. I\u2019m not 100% sure what  Kathleen Seidel\u2019s  religious affiliations are but Wiccan is unlikely to be among them. I\u2019m fairly sure the  Diva  doesn\u2019t reside in a trailer park, which is incongruous considering her occupation, the distribution of tiaras, occasionally crumpled ones. I doubt that you\u2019re in line to get one, even a crumpled one any time soon. What with the costs of postage these days, even Divas have to weigh the costs and benefits closely. As an aside \u2013are there any hidebound rednecks lurking in the forests and mountains of New Hampshire? I don\u2019t mean to insult the non-feral elements in the State but who doesn\u2019t know that David of Finland emulates his compatriot Billy Connolly on all occasions? I suppose that one would actually need a smattering of general knowledge outside of redneck school to know that. What do you have against credentials? Touch of the green-eyed monster there? How does one get to be an alleged surgeon anyway? I\u2019ve heard of alleged culprits in various nefarious enterprises, axe murderers and the like but not in relation to surgeons. Funny that, I thought one of the crusading mercury mafia put  Orac\u2019s  name, photograph and address on the EOH dartboard? Meanwhile back at the misstatements, I must protest the poor treatment meted out to my illustrious colleague Clay. Readers are entitled to know that at considerable risk to life and limb, Clay sallied forth to lay the path of righteousness among the heathen - that is, the EOH mob. And did they listen? Nope, they said good riddance and cast him into the wilderness. My forays into the mercury thickets were more along the lines of guerrilla warfare \u2013 he who fights and runs away etc etc \u2013 not particularly brave but then I have this dominant streak of pragmatism. Some people like to call it a defect but I dunno. And then there\u2019s the treatment of Michelle Dawson, our illustrious leader. Sorry John, but there\u2019s been a palace coup d\u2019etat and Frank got shafted, which is why you don\u2019t see much of him these days. It\u2019s really Michelle who\u2019s the Capo di capi. Just ask \u201cA Mom\u201d. It\u2019s in black and white on  Michelle\u2019s quick topic . Michelle\u2019s the Messiah and we, like sheep, have been led astray, which you must admit John is considerably more inventive not to say entertaining than downgrading our illustrious leader to misguided aspie status. Much baa-ing, references to Monty Python and general hilarity ensued and a good time was had by all (well, nearly all \u2013 \u2018A Mom\u2019 didn\u2019t join in much). But that\u2019s the trouble with militants \u2013 the first casualty seems to be a sense of humour. If I were you John, I\u2019d ditch the disclaimer.

According to Waly et al \"The ethylmercury-containing preservative thimerosal inhibited both IGF-1- and dopamine-stimulated methylation with an IC50 of 1 nM and eliminated MS activity. Our findings outline a novel growth factor signaling pathway that regulates MS activity and thereby modulates methylation reactions, including DNA methylation.

And they\u2019ve been exposed to mercury, and when they have that condition, when they start making their androgens, their testosterone, they get to a point, a branch point, where they\u2019re supposed to make most of their, it\u2019s called DHEA into DHEA-S, but they can\u2019t make DHEA-S because they need glutathione to do that step, so they make it almost all into testosterone.\u201d They also said on the  autismfair media video  (Part 2) that: [Their theoretical model described in Medical Hypotheses] \"predicted that these children would have a low DHEA-S. It predicts that autistics would have a high rate of precocious puberty. In fact we\u2019re beginning to think that it\u2019s close to 100% if you look carefully.  \" So far, this has been plain sailing for the autism as mercury poisoning hypotheses of biological plausibility, but as they say, the truth will out, eventually. Here is the abstract from  IMFAR 2006 , of a study from the National Institutes of Health. \"Elevated Levels of Growth-Related Hormones in Autism andAutism Spectrum Disorder James Louis Mills, Mary L. Hediger, Cynthia A. Molloy,George P. Chrousos, Patricia Manning-Courtney, Kai F. Yu, Mark Brasington, Lucinda J. England, NICHD, National Institutes of Health Background: Autistic children are known to have larger head circumferences; whether they are also taller and heavier is less clear. Little is known about growth-related hormone levels in autistic children.Objectives: To determine whether autistic children were taller, heavier, and have higher levels of growth-related hormones than control children.Methods: Boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autism (n= 71) and age-matched controls(n= 59) had height, weight and head circumference measurements. Blood samples were assayed for IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP3, growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) and for DHEA and DHEAS.  Results: The autism/ASD cases had significantly (p=.03) greater mean head circumferences (z score1.24, SD 1.35) than controls (z-score 0.78, SD 0.93). Cases also had significantly (p=.01)greater weights (z-score 0.91, SD 1.13) than controls (z-score 0.41, SD 1.11). Heights did not differ significantly between groups (p=.65); however, cases had significantly (p=.003) higher bodymass indices (z-score 0.85, SD 1.19) than controls (z-score 0.24, SD 1.17). The case groups levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP3 and GHBP were all significantly higher (p Conclusion: Boys with autism/ASD had significantly higher levels of many growth-related hormones. These findings could help explain the significantly higher head circumferences, weights and BMIs we found. Future studies should examine the potential role of growth-related hormones in the pathophysiology of autism.  Funding: Intramural research program, NICHD, NIH.\" Unlike Waly et al\u2019s kitchen sink hypothesis (i.e. in vitro) that IGF-1 is severely compromised in autistics by virtue of exposure to mercury and other things, it appears that in the real world, autistics seem to be bathing in an abundance of the stuff as evidenced by their head circumference and stature, not a runty dwarf in sight. Dr Mills was kind enough to send me a copy of their presentation; the paper is in preparation. Here are some of their findings re DHEA and DHEA-S. \"More autism/ASD subjects (29/71) than control subjects (14/59) had measurable DHEAS levels, p=0.03  DHEA levels were detected in nearly all subjects. Levels in the autism/ASD group (66.8 ng/dL) did not differ significantly from levels in the control group (61.0 ng/dL), p=0.73  Levels of adrenal hormones were not impressively different between the autism/ASD and control groups.  This suggests that earlier sexual maturation is not the explanation for our results\"  (emphasis mine) Given that these results are based on 71 ASD boys between the ages of 4 and 8, with an aged matched control of 59 there should be a horde of precociously pubescent autistics. In fact, the results would suggest that Geier and Geier, according to their theory of biochemical pathway blockage (due to glutathione depletion) would be better off looking for hyperandrogenicity among the non-autistic population. It should be twice as likely in the non autistic population, given that they aren't producing DHEA-S at the same rate, thereby converting all their androgen steroid precursors into testosterone. That however, would presuppose that the Geier view of the biochemical basis of androgen synthesis is correct. That may be a supposition too far. Mills et al in their presentation have this to say about DHEA-S: \"DHEAS levels are often undetectable between infancy and the start of adrenarche (puberty) Thus, DHEAS may be useful as a marker for the early stages of pubertal development\" It seems to me that Geier & Geier are implying that low or no DHEA-S has rather sinister connotations - indicative of hyperandrogenicity. Whereas the innocent explanation is that these children are simply pre-pubescent and what's wrong with that? Everybody is, at some point on their way to adulthood. The conclusion to be drawn from the Geier's unique view of endocrinology is that biochemistry is fertile ground for running a scam, simply because it's so complicated conceptually and has such complicated language that it's fairly easy to sound as if you know what you're talking about. It also has the advantage of all frontiers in that, since there is a lot of conjecture about how a lot of things work, it's rather harder to prove that it is a scam. There are, however, the odd road signs. General biochemical mechanisms such as the role of glutathione do not lend themselves readily to single outcome issues. If androgen synthesis goes haywire because of glutathione depletion, then other things should go equally haywire, like why is it that autistics do not have frequent episodes of haemolytic anemia, a feature of glutathione depletion. Ditto, for IGF-1 inhibition. It\u2019s one of the growth hormones so one would expect sequelae beyond neurodevelopmental retardation \u2013 stunted growth for instance. But there isn\u2019t, as Mills et al point out. It should be emphasised that Waly et al are not running a scam. Mills et al made it clear that their quantification of growth hormones in autistics was the first ever conducted. Hence, it could be concluded that mercury is unlikely to be a factor in the aetiology of autism. No matter how many environmental nasties there are out there capable of blocking methylation pathways through IGF-1, this growth hormone is curiously unaffected in real autistics in real life. The  glutathione problem  remains, but looks to have been overstated. Firstly the real problem is not dangerously lowered levels, obviously (no haemolytic anaemia), but the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidised glutathione. In autistics this seems to indicate oxidative stress. The reasons for that, however, do not have to have anything to do with heavy metal toxicity. Stress will do it and we know from  cortisol studies  that autistics tend to live in excessively stressful environments. It seems also that the significance of Jill James findings is in some doubt.  The IOM told Bradstreet  that both his and James p values were not mathematically possible and should be recalculated. They might still reach significant values, just not as startling as p Autism One 2006 Conference. Disclaimer: I actually have credentials in Bichemistry. However, it\u2019s so rusty, it\u2019s corroded. I leave this issue to other and more up to snuff biochemists to probe further. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.generationrescue.org/pdf/deth3.pdf", "http://www.progressiveconvergence.com/Published%20Mercury%20and%20Testosterone%20Medical%20Hypothesis1.pdf", "http://www.radioliberty.com/", "http://www.autismmedia.org/media4.html", "http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/Cofred/Public/Aca/WebSec.cfm?confid=238&webid=1245", "http://www.iom.edu/?id=18581", "http://www.nasonline.org/site/DocServer/JAFOS04-BlytheCorbett.pdf?docID=2431#search=%22Cortisol%20stress%20autism%22", "http://www.iom.edu/?id=26925", "http://www.autismone.org/uploads/Geier%20Mark.ppt"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2006/08/tall-tale-and-about-to-topple.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t A Tall Tale - and about to Topple\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " July 10, 2006", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   I fully approve of the protest against the attempted extermination of autistics, hence this brief post. However, I really thought that AFF and the Hub were getting just a tad carried away here considering that nobody has a clue what the \u2018genes for autism\u2019 are so how then is it possible to have a prenatal test for autism that is in any way meaningful? So, to a little reading and here is one of my favourite hub bloggers, abfh (I think that should be lower case). I look at it this way: Somebody has to yap loudly enough to draw attention to what's going on before it's too late. This is not a genteel debate in the quiet halls of academia; it is a war for the survival of our race. The eugenicists have us in their crosshairs, and their fingers are already tightening on the trigger. I particularly liked the bit about this not being a genteel debate in the groves of academe. Indeed. A war for survival it is and the debate had better start now instead of the magic moment when a company rushes their genetic supertest to market. I really thought that it was unlikely that a society would stoop to aborting male embryos so that a female with 75% less chance of developing autism could be selected, but I was wrong. Since it appears that your child is part of your status, just like your Ferrari, then I think it can be taken as read that any manifestation of autism is unacceptable and will be prevented if at all possible.  Low functioning or high functioning doesn't enter into it. Seriously folks, there\u2019s lots and lots of moolah to be made on the back of not just fearful folks traumatised into abortion by worst case scenarios of autism, actually, make that fictional scenarios of autism, if the Autism Speaks video is anything to go by but on the back of society itself. Yep, the autism extermination programs of CAN, DAN, Autism Speaks and practically everybody else in the autism community are going to provide a unique experiment in social Darwinism.   They\u2019re going to, and we, the society, are going to bear the brunt of any major errors in thinking that  this extermination program has. Like first up \u2013 eugenics doesn\u2019t work because selecting for a trait like autism with hopes of improving overall genetic fitness presupposes complete genetic knowledge of what controls the manifestation of autism (what everybody is now frantically looking for) and what happens when you eliminate those genetic properties from the gene pool (what nobody is looking for or even thinking about). It also rests on the gigantic assumption, which is almost certain to be categorically wrong that the genes for autism have no value for the human race \u2013 the message that CAN, DAN, Autism Speaks et al are busily promoting right left and centre. Remember, autism is a tsunami of catastrophic proportions.   Genes that are so persistent in the gene pool are there for a reason.  Take a look at these two real life examples of what happens when traits are selected for without much of a clue what they\u2019re there for, courtesy of the  Greythumb blog . Greythumb points to an article on poultry science, which outlines the group selection effects observed when trying to breed chickens for increased egg production in multiple-hen cage environments. What happened was not increased egg production, but mean chickens. He goes on to draw an appropriate parallel in a similar \u2018experiment\u2019 conducted by the Enron corporation human resource management department. Apparently in an effort to boost productivity, their stock market traders were put through repetitive performance appraisals and the lowest performing 10 \u2013 15% were fired. Again, what happened was not increased productivity, everyone knows what happened to Enron, but a bunch of mean dishonest traders, only too willing to sell their own grandmothers for the sake of an improved bottom line. We know practically nothing about the genetics of autism and even less about autism itself. Yet there are loads of experts ready and willing to jump on a prenatal test as soon as it becomes available. We also know through history, quite apart from the horrors of Nazism, that researchers with vested interests are only too willing to lie about their findings in pursuit of not just big bucks, but also fame. The notorious  Jukes study  should give this modern eugenics movement pause \u2013 but it won\u2019t. I\u2019m betting that it will take the actual results of excluding the myriad factors predisposing a significant risk for autism to jolt people into an awareness of what a lot of us know already \u2013 autism is just a different way of being.   Without it or at least some trait of it, I\u2019m guessing that the offspring may be perfectly amiable social beings with about enough cognitive prowess to rise to middle monkey rank in the pecking order, but no higher. The ultimate question.  Should CAN, DAN  et al read more poultry science? \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7778/779/1600/prenatalprotest.png", "http://www.greythumb.org/blog/index.php?/archives/80-Eugenics-doesnt-work.-Ask-why,-asshole..html", "http://www.wehaitians.com/bad%20seed%20or%20bad%20science.html"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2006/07/unnatural-selection.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Unnatural Selection\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " May 13, 2007", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   14 May 2007         Dr Morton Rawlin    Director of Education    Royal    Australian   College  of General Practitioners    1 Palmerston   Crescent    SOUTH MELBOURNE  VIC 3025              Dear Dr Rawlin    The Sydney Morning Herald of 3 May published an article titled \u2018A Fresh Approach\u2019 describing the Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!) biomedical protocols for treating autism.    The article also served as an infomercial for a conference on DAN! Protocols organized by the Mindd International Forum on Children\u2019s Health (Mindd) to be held in  Sydney  on 18-21 May 2007.     The registration form for the conference prominently displays that attendance counts towards the QA&CPD points Program of RACGP.    I would ask that RACGP reconsider that position.    Perusing the program and the speakers, the thrust of this conference is a focus on marginal theories of autism causation combined with treatment strategies, for which there is little to no evidence and where the treatment could be said to have unacceptable risks associated with it.    Chelation for metal toxicity in the absence of a diagnosis of metal toxicity based on usual criteria and mega-dosing of nutrients to correct for deficiencies identified by highly questionable means come to mind as high risk procedures of unsubstantiated benefit.          I would like to expand briefly on the practices and beliefs of three of the international presenters at this conference, Dr David Quig, Dr Richard Lord and Dr Anju Usman.      I am not familiar with the other presenters, but these three should suffice to illustrate why a reputable organization might wish to distance itself from even the appearance of endorsing the activities of the Mindd.       Dr Quig is Vice President, Scientific Support of Doctor\u2019s Data a mail order laboratory in  St Charles   Illinois . ( USA ).      To plausibly demonstrate a need for detoxification, a lab like Doctor\u2019s Data is necessary.    I refer you to the urine toxic metals screen and the sample lab report on the Doctor\u2019s Data website. [1] It has a few interesting quirks.    Notably, the reference ranges are one standard deviation, not two.    The reference range for mercury is about a third of that cited by other laboratories such as Labcorp, using the same equipment and method.    Putting these together the probability of getting an \u2018elevated\u2019 result from a healthy individual is over 50% with just two tests.    Naturally, the testing is a panel for multiple metals.    Two other factors conspire to practically guarantee an elevated result from the target population, autistic children.    Doctor\u2019s Data accept single urine samples and quantify the results as per gram creatinine.     A recent study in Paediatrics International states \u201ca significant decrease in urinary creatinine was found in the PDD group compared to controls\u201d and recommends \u201cto use other internal or external standards for the quantification of urinary compounds in PDD research.\u201d [2]    This phenomenon is fairly widely known.     It is also a common practice to use a \u2018challenge\u2019 test to demonstrate metal toxicity.    A succimer chelation agent is administered several hours before the urine is collected.    The reference ranges, however, are for unprovoked samples.       Dr Richard Lord is the expert on nutriceuticals.    His lab tests for organic acids on the principle that autism is a collection of inborn errors of metabolism that are just short of producing a full-blown syndrome.    Though he uses phenylketonuria as an example, the implication is that there are deficiencies to be corrected rather than absences and this can be done through nutritional means, though this is clothed in impressive biochemical language, co-factors and the like.    I refer you to his article on the subject, which is informative [3].     This may be the Science of the future, where everybody\u2019s metabolic fingerprint can be identified and drugs, diet or whatever can be tailored to the individual.    It is not the Science of the present and is decidedly experimental when used to dose or overdose autistic children with a variety of vitamins, enzyme cofactors etc.      As with the testing of toxic metals, the reference ranges do not accommodate the low creatinine levels seen in autistic children.    Therefore they are at high risk of receiving megadoses of nutrients based on lab results that are erroneously inflated.      Interestingly, Doctor\u2019s Data warns against using urine samples to test for nutritional metabolites so there\u2019s not a lot of consistency in this field.       Dr Anju Usman is rather well known among DAN practitioners as a firm believer in the benefits of chelation.    I refer you to a presentation she gave on the subject that was recorded on Autism One Radio. [4].    For Dr Usman, apparently the behaviours associated with autism are either symptomatic of mercury or lead toxicity, with the occasional dose of hyperactivity from aluminium toxicity.     Autism presents simply as a challenge to find the best means of \u2018safe\u2019 chelation.       There is no such thing as safe chelation.    The risks of organ damage and the effect on bone mineral density are generally weighed against the real need to lower toxic metal levels and with no expectation that lowering those levels will have any positive effect on the neurological function of the child, since it never has in cases of real metal toxicity.    But this is not the way it happens with these practitioners.    Dr Usman was the DAN practitioner who, according to the Pennsylvania State Medical Board enquiry, was responsible for recommending EDTA chelation of five-year old Abu Bakar Tariq Nadama for alleged high aluminium levels.[5]      She referred him to Dr Roy Kerry, who gave Tariq IV Na-EDTA instead of Ca-EDTA and the boy died of sudden cardiac arrest.         Lately, there\u2019s been a new spin put on the dubious hypothesis that autism is a species of metal toxicity.    A father/son team, Dr Mark and Mr David Geier came up with the bright idea that autistic kids cannot excrete mercury because they have excess testosterone, which binds the mercury in the body.    So, they developed and patented the \u2018Lupron Protocol\u2019, whereby autistic children, girls as well as boys, some as young as four and five are chemically castrated with leuprolide (Lupron) and then chelated.    The biochemical justification for this is bizarre to say the least.    Dr Usman has had at least four patients go through this protocol. [4] according to the proprietor of Autism Media and a client of hers.    I have every faith in the skepticism of the average Australian GP and perhaps these conferences serve to keep our GPs abreast of what\u2019s new in fringe Medicine this year.    There is a crying need for education of primary physicians about autism for many reasons.    Autistic children need protection from indiscriminate experimentation under the guise of novel treatment.    There are issues of diet with many of these children due to sensory hypersensitivities.    Whether these children are more prone to Coeliac than the general population is suspected but to my knowledge, not confirmed, but I could be wrong about that.     There are known problems with autistic children being essentially denied medical treatment because of a combination of communication problems on the part of the child and false beliefs about autistic behaviours on the part of the physician.    Perhaps RACGP would consider liaising with Professor Bruce Tonge of  Monash    University , an expert on Autism, to develop a real course for primary care physicians.         I have copied this letter to Australian Doctor in the fond hope that the journal could do a piece of investigative journalism that counterbalances the uncritical and frankly credulous efforts of the Sydney Morning Herald.

{"date": " August 03, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Sullivan, writing for   LeftBrain/RightBrain has a post  lamenting the poor performance of the Petitioner\u2019s Steering Committee of the Autism Omnibus on behalf of the parents.   Feeling that as the AO was a going concern, the PSC should be doing the best they could for their clients, such as noting as others have done before them that there are cases where compensation has been made where autism was also involved.   OK, it\u2019s not applicable to more than a few maybe, but since they were so willing to extrapolate  Poling, why not these cases? In any event, I\u2019ve been wondering just what the PSC is doing in light of the very short but also damning testimony proffered for Colin Dwyer \u2013 all in one short day.   First up \u2013 Dr Mumper, whose basic testimony has all been seen before, but here\u2019s a few twists.  Led gently into the ring by PSC lawyer, Tom Powers, Mumper was quick to stress that the Dwyers had done everything possible financially to assure Colin\u2019s continued treatment and improvement.   However, the concern for financial strain on the family didn\u2019t go quite so far as assuring that very expensive tests were carried out by an accredited laboratory.  So, the family is out of pocket to the tune of thousands for no gain, because there is no reason to assume the lab knew what they were doing and who would trust results from a non accredited lab?  Why were they sent to a non-accredited lab in the first place?  Second, it suddenly comes to light that urine test results are \u2018provoked\u2019, but the reference ranges are not.    Kathleen has a really thorough post on all this .  So, Mumper is left looking counterfeit and clueless and the Special Masters have noted that the results are worthless. Second, a quick plug for the paper of Young and the Geiers is put up by PSC lawyer Williams, but look at how he did it.  Here, says Williams, is a paper that shows a causal relationship between TCVs and autism.  Directing the Special Masters, he then goes on to advise, that though they may distrust the Geiers, it was really Young\u2019s paper and all the Geiers did was provide \u2018access\u2019.  Kaiser Permanente who own the data may have something to quibble about with the access issue, but the main point is that a PSC lawyer told the Special Masters to just ignore two out of three authors on one paper because there may be a trust issue there!  What are they doing?  Perhaps point three may add some direction. Powers, on all occasions, has emphasised the \u2018dynamic\u2019 nature of the \u2018scientific evidence\u2019 regarding TCVs and autism.  Never mind that Marcel Kinsbourne\u2019s neuroinflammation theory first saw the light of day a few weeks short of the commencement of the AO.   But then these guys are heavily into the \u2018plausibility\u2019 in place of \u2018probability\u2019.   So, as predictably as the sunrise, the PSC is assuring the Special Masters that they cannot possibly come to any conclusion because two very important \u2018expensive\u2019 studies are due to be published in September.  But in any case, says Williams for the PSC, the Special Masters may assume that the studies will support the PSC!  At that point, I wondered if I\u2019d misread Holland\u2019s transcript, but no.   So, who is the PSC representing? Not the parents; some of the lunatic statements on this day of testimony demolish any pretension to being there to serve the parents.  They\u2019re there simply for themselves and as much of that $2.4 billion they can get hold of.   Their tactics have not changed in the least.  It took six years to get the PSC to the table and they complaining all the way that the studies just were not there.   Haven\u2019t got a good theory, go for the newly minted variety produced by a guy noted for 30 appearances in vaccine court and one paper in a medical journal.   String it together with as much speculation as necessary and hold off for as long as possible.  The longer this drags out the more in billable hours, expert fees etc is available.  The real losers in this have always been the parents.  Vaccine court personnel can be irritated by what they hear, but that\u2019s a passing thing.  For the parents, who is going to support their autistic children in the future is no passing phase.  No doubt Powers et al  will have concocted a convincing tale why Vaccine Court will not be that support, in the very likely event that it concludes that autism and vaccines have no association.   As I recall, Powers laid some of the groundwork for that on a recent Autism One program. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1050", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/167/"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/08/autism-omnibus-psc-whose-side-are-they.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Autism Omnibus PSC, Whose side are they on?\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " August 14, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Some blog posts are more important than others.  As any Hub reader knows, there are reams of Facebook style socialising blogs mixed in with more substantive pieces.  I don\u2019t begrudge the need for the social dimension usually, unless I could see that the whole thing might descend into social group think of the calibre of the Autism Speaks message boards.  Given the numerical presence of autistic bloggers on the Hub, that seems to me unlikely, so it\u2019s not really an issue except for some due vigilance to ensure that the actual autistic presence remains very high.   Otherwise very important posts, like the following may be marginalised. Ed of  \u2018Ed\u2019s autism page\u2019  wrote a post by invitation for Christschool\u2019s blog , titled: \u201c In need of Fixing\u201d .    The subject matter \u2013 abuse of people by systems supposedly designed to aid and treat them can really only be adequately addressed by someone on the inside, like Ed or like Amanda or a few experts who know very precisely what goes on, but much more importantly for the likes of you and me who are so insulated by lack of experience, these folks are coming up with cogent arguments about  why these abuses happen.  Not a thing is going to change unless the dynamics become transparent.     For me, Ed\u2019s post raised a large number of points that really made me think about this, and  those points are what  I\u2019d like to focus on.  Naturally, this post is simply to encourage as many folks as possible to read Ed\u2019s post in its entirety and gain their own insights.  So to the points in no particular order: \u2022 The way that we (the public) know that Republicans are behaving inappropriately is because Democrats reported or make sure that it gets reported. The way that we (the public) know this about Democrats is because Republicans make sure of it. Without this competition how would we know? Sounds simple enough, but how often do we note that only in truly equivalent power structures, is oversight actually going to work?  So the first question for any system is the equivalence or lack of among the elements.  I think the conundrum of the  JRC  could be explained quite well if you have a closer look at the supporting structural elements. \u2022 The reason that some violations of public officials who aren't a part of the Republican/Democrat system are hidden from the public for a longer period of time is because those who set regulations and are thought by the public to be enforcing those regulations choose to conveniently ignore or look the other way. They also often knowingly contribute to the problem and are in positions to set and enforce regulations for the very purpose of protecting the violations and the violators within their same (or a similar) branch of government. This is probably the main point and well supported by the many references Ed gives.     ED goes on to elaborate some of the reasons why the regulators are not regulating.  Among which: \u2022 Whether authority comes from parents, teachers, or someone who is granted this authority by the public, what should be responsibility is too often seen as entitlement. Direction and guidance too often becomes unnecessary control and manipulation when regulators don't get regulated. If I have this right, then what gets done is what can be done and that does not have to bear any relationship with what should be done.  What enables the moral vacuum between reasons and actions is that no one is regulating the regulators.  Perhaps a hopelessly naive question, but shouldn\u2019t all this be perfectly well known, since people have done lots and lots of work on systems and the corruption of systems, which strictly speaking, human rights violations by regulators would fall under? \u2022 When every behavior is seen as an emotional response and gets critiqued as unsophisticated, populations of people have their values made obsolete. If on the other hand behavior is seen as the result of a mental or spiritual defect it may become more convenient to dismiss that very same population of people as deserving of being ignored and other more severe types of punishment. Rationalisation 101 and note the two ways to do it.   Ed made a point that really got to me on this aspect of things: \u2022 The understanding of this dynamic begins with the acceptance that the US Mental Health System was never intended to provide for the needs of its consumers. It was designed to meet the needs of the public. It is a type of corrections Department where punishment is the primary method of enforcing behavioral standards. Now we can see the necessity for the rationalisation. \u2022 I've noticed that oppressed groups are often taught that they do not and cannot understand the sophisticated language of their oppressors. I've seen that often when people were taught that something is beyond their capacity for learning they don't put many efforts into finding out whether this is true or not. Sometimes people's liberation is really not as far away as they are taught. Just thinking how much of a step it would be to even begin to question the status quo as delivered by the system.   Also thinking how many never get anywhere near that step. \u2022 I have also noticed that people who are caught up in the oppression of others sometimes have little understanding of what they do and how it is oppressive because their scope of understanding is limited to a realm where oppressed populations are not allowed to express their experience. OK, this was a real eye opener for me, never ever having come close to imagining it.   I keep thinking of the essay \u201cThe Smile\u201d, which I can\u2019t find back.    Is there a single oppressive system of any type which is not maintained by that \u2018limited\u2019 scope of understanding? \u2022 I believe behavior is seen as the cause of (or what needs fixing in regards to) learning disabilities, psychological and psychiatric problems, and certainly many neurological problems as well. I believe that one of the main reasons that autistics are treated more severely within all these classifications (which I have been described having all of them at different times since birth) has a lot to do with how what is all too quickly determined as misbehavior is treated with the worst forms of punishment. In a typical institutional environment, I think autistics are the least adaptable to these harsh environments which can lead to a cycle of gross misunderstandings and the worst kinds of treatment. This total emphasis on punishment as the naturally deserving outcome for institutional residents is more than a bit disturbing.  It is of course, the way the JRC is run, which makes that institution in the scheme of things, just one more institution, albeit with much more formalised punishment regimes.  For the rest, it seems that the same structural elements that defy regulation in other institutions are at work here as well.  There are no equivalencies of oversight, so that never works no matter how many complaints and/or attempts  at regulation are made.  The parents do not want their children back, so they will rationalise anything on the grounds that \u2018you didn\u2019t know Caroline before\u2019.  The fact that Caroline remains essentially unchanged doesn\u2019t count for much.    The regulatory authorities don\u2019t want to upset anything either.    Every time JRC does something outrageous, on top of their endemic torture regimes, that is, the authorities cave.  After all, for them it\u2019s a good deal and reasonably economical.  Matthew Israel is nothing if not a good marketer.    Basically he\u2019s said \u2013 leave your very worst behavioural cases to me and I will look after them for a price you will be able to pay.  And he does.   There\u2019s a reason for using punishment.  It\u2019s cheap because it\u2019s simple and any fool can do it.  Combine with computerised instruction, which doesn\u2019t require teaching qualifications and the whole show can be run by a bunch of high school drop outs.  Profits will flow and everybody benefits, except the clientele.    But as Ed points out, the system is not set up for them. There\u2019s a lot more in Ed\u2019s post that  I haven\u2019t mentioned  and that\u2019s because these are complicated ideas that I\u2019m working my head around. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://eds-autism-blog.blogspot.com/", "http://autisticnation.typepad.com/thinking_in_metaphors/2008/07/the-big-fix.html", "http://www.judgerc.org/"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/08/ed-in-need-of-fixing.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Ed: In Need of Fixing\n\t                       \n                          "},

Unfortunately, I had some illness to cope with and was unable to meet the Friday deadline. My concern in all of research into autism and extending to what is done about it is that very little is known about autism period.  Therefore, interventions have in general little evidence-base since none of them start where understanding of where the autistic person begins.  This is perhaps the only field in the helping professions where this is the case and a sorry state of affairs it is.  The reasons are I think mainly historical. To date, what happened with the developmentally delayed was overseen by a fairly radical form of behaviorism, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) derived from B F Skinner's operant conditioning paradigm.  I should stress that this is an evolutionary dead end as far as mainstream psychology is concerned and any enquiring researcher should read Professor John Mills \"Control: A History of Behavioral Psychology\" as a fairly good description of the fatal flaws in that paradigm.  Suffice it to say, ABA and its research methods, because they have no need in their world to delineate what autism is in order to treat it, have been the reason why so little is known and why interventions have very little in the way of an evidence base.  Behaviorists on their self report will proclaim the effectiveness of their interventions.  However this is little more than anecdote from a biased source given that in forty years there has been exactly one randomised controlled trial of ABA as an intervention, Smith, Groen Wynn, 2000, and the results were marginal to say the least (especially taking the two errata into account).   This problem with the great divide between research and intervention was also noted in the NRC 2001 report. There are multiple reasons, why it is absolutely essential that what is done, educationally and in other ways with the autistic population starts with an evidence base of the ways in which autistics are in learning styles, in perception and so on.  This is what is missing in the field for all practicable purposes and that is an indictment on everyone working in it.  Why is it that according to recent report, most social skills interventions are outright failures?  Well perhaps it's because these are behaviorally based and therefore divorced from any knowledge of where the autistic in this social equation is coming from.   I would ask that the IACC spend more dollars on cognitive psychological investigation of autism.  It's a new field, but not totally devoid of information.  Dawson et al's \"Autistic Learning\", available in pdf from http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf is a decent primer.

Indeed, I cannot think of one instance, including the array of execrable journalism about vaccines and autism that gets it as wrong as the press release of Hensch et al\u2019s  paper in Cell,  titled: \"Experience-Dependent Transfer of Otx2 Homeoprotein into the Visual Cortex Activates Postnatal Plasticity.\" The press release, titled,  Trigger for Learning  waxes lyrical about brain plasticity and learning, extending it to autism with this reference to the lead author Dr Takao Hensch: \u201cDr. Hensch said developmental disorders like autism are a result of impaired timing of these learning \"windows,\" like the one during which children learn to read.\"    Two things are notable about this statement and this paper.  Primarily, the paper is about the development of vision and we have known for quite some time that there is indeed a \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 for the development of vision.  The paper is not about learning and as far as I know, there is certainly no \u2018window\u2019 for reading and neither is there one for learning in general.   With that in mind I asked Dr Hensch if he could verify the article\u2019s depiction of what he said. Dr Hensch replied with: \u201cThank you for your question and interest in our work.  I apologize for any confusion brought about by the media.  What I said was \"disorders such as autism, in which   researchers believe critical periods may be inappropriately accelerated or delayed.\"  I am unaware of any critical period for reading as you point out.\u201d Quite likely Dr Hernsch is referring to the accelerated head growth noted in autistic toddlers.  This is quite some distance from \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 for learning that the press release implies.  It\u2019s a shame in a way because it detracts from the beauty of this work.  Science can be truly wonderful, especially at moments like this where a protein, initially responsible for forming the head of the fetus in very early development is recycled to play an important part in the laying down the connections for processing visual information.  How cool is that? Neural plasticity is not well understood as yet but what we do know of it tends to support the notion that the \u2018window\u2019 of cognitive development is quite wide and that those promoting \u2018early intervention\u2019 on the back of short windows of opportunities for learning are doing so based on no evidence as \u201c The Myth of the First Three Years \u201d makes very clear.  As  Drs Frith and Blakemore pointed out  to a teacher who also hadn\u2019t kept up with her neural development: \u201cSome parts of the cortex, including the frontal cortex, which is responsible for cognitive functions such as planning, decision making and self awareness, continue to develop during the teenage years and into the twenties.\u201d \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cell.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0092867408008398", "http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=19466", "http://www.amazon.com/Myth-First-Three-Years-Understanding/dp/0684851849", "http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6001636"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2008/09/media-spin-and-neural-plasticity.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Media Spin and Neural Plasticity\n\t                       \n                          "},

One EOH member cottoned that Kirby, Olmsted, Shoemaker and a great many others could be similarly subpoenaed and with far greater chances of success that Kathleen Seidel.

Maloney's meeting.   It is not a sweet missive, no indeedy.  The rarity is the inclusion of terms such as 'junk science', misinformation and irrational among others.  It's a wonderful letter, well naturally I would think so, being a polemicist and all.  However, it really is about time the actual meaning of the anti-vax agenda was stated clearly, in effect not allowing someone like Maloney to retreat behind the irrational as a means of being representative. The letter to be found  here  also has a recommendation to read Paul Offit's Autism's False Prophets.  I would hazard a guess that when AoA get round to the rebuttal, Offit will feature prominently.  The other effect of the straight shootimg nature of this letter is that the folks at AoA are dealing with very definite accusation and that's harder to answer than if the missive had been politeness as usual, so conspiracy theorising of collusion between Offit and the AAP seems to be quite likely.

Vaccines save lives. Study after study has shown absolutely no link between vaccines and autism. As pediatricians, teachers, nurses, cl-~ildc are providers and parents across New York State and in your District, we are very aware of the struggles that the families of children with autism face and the challenges that test the children themselves.

All of the research, including the most recent and exhaustive study done by the Columbia University School of Public Health, has proven no link between vaccines and autism. And yet a few people, some of whom are making a great deal of money from the suffering and false hope of frightened parents, continue to beat the drum for this discredited position. Many others offer dangerous and unscientific approaches to \"cures.\" We urge you to stand with us against the forces working to bring irrational fears and \"junk science\" into the world of children's health. As you know, imm~~nizationasre one of our greatest public health victories along with clean water. Childhood diseases that can kill and maim our children are just a plane ride away, and yet the anti-immunization groups continue to push for less and less protection for our children.

You might also be interested in knowing that the measles that was imported into the US came, not from the third world, but from Europe and from Israel: Developed areas that are experiencing significant outbreaks of disease due to weak public health policy. We highly recommend that you read Dr. Paul Offit's recent, very well reviewed book, Autism's False Prophets. We have included a review from The Wall Street Journal and an editorial from the New York Times.

{"date": " January 23, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   I was asked this question recently in connection with Facilitated Communication (FC) and armed with some references, I am going to attempt to answer it.  Primarily the lack of ethics involves the unproven nature of ESP including telepathy.  Secondarily telepathy is being used to caulk the holes in the lack of evidence for independent communication in FC by some participants, generally those of less ability. The James Randi Foundation has a one million dollar cheque ready for anyone who can demonstrate any form of ESP including telepathy.  Notably in the 1990s when Randi first encountered telepathy mixed with FC his first problem as he discovered was to authenticate the authorship of the communication.  This he was unable to do and so the search for telepathy became moot in this context. [ here ] Authorship authentication is what drives belief in telepathy.  Here is one coherent explanation of why the client is expressing the thoughts and feelings of the facilitator; not because the facilitator is the only one communicating but because the client is reading the facilitator\u2019s mind.  This can reach ridiculous levels as demonstrated by the online writings of Mary Ann Harrington.  Not only does she acknowledge that the facilitator can have enormous though subtle influence over the communication; [here ] her thesis is that at a \u2018higher level of consciousness\u2019 the two can form a partnership, which is a different entity to either facilitator or client alone, based on telepathy. Harrington is also a fan of the fairytale school of science.  First, assume that fairytales exist.  In her case she would like research, a great deal of research to be done, not to demonstrate the reality of telepathy but to explore its practical aspects.  As the following list of questions for scientists to pursue suggests, she is firmly of the belief that telepathy exists:[ here ] \u2022 Do our brain wave frequencies entrain during 'thought joining' creating a sympathetic resonance? \u2022 What areas of the brain are being activated during the exchange? Are brain wave patterns altered during interactions? \u2022 Is 'joining' occurring at a subconscious level? Does it assist in tapping into an emanating universal field of knowledge in addition to the knowledge base of the agent? Does adhering to the vibration of the agent help the brain filter material? Does it help the person with severe autism experience typical perceptual reality through the sensory system of the agent? \u2022 Is it possible that two distinct frequencies blended together form a third frequency? (Think of binaural beats or chemical changes) How does this shared frequency affect communicative output? \u2022 Can 'joining' be compared to the synchronization of coupled oscillators? Does this also help to explain group resonance? \u2022 Does the agent serve as a catalyst, providing the stimulus necessary for the individual to access a response? Are his high-speed fleeting thoughts and chaotic flow being entrained by magnetic signals of the agent? Could these radiations produce image or thought receiving experiences by acting on the temporal lobe? \u2022 Do sub-vocalizations enhance the process? \u2022 Is the right brain being stimulated during the connection? Is that why the language used when paired with an agent is often prosaic? \u2022 Does aligning with the rhythm of the agent help the person perform in a synchronized manner? Does it help the individual attune to the frequency of the earth? Do these signals smooth out circadian rhythm? \u2022 Is the pineal gland primarily hyper active in kids with severe autism causing them to let go of ego based consciousness? Is it hypo active in higher functioning individuals resulting in rigid concrete behavior? Might this also be true of the amygdala? Might pineal gland and/or the amygdala be affected by the joining process? \u2022What role if any does the reticular activating system play? But Harrington is not alone in fairytale science.  These bona fide researchers ought to know better.  Konstantareas and Gravelle conducted some research into the relative contributions from the facilitator of physical, emotional and mental support [1].   Crucially they assumed that the communication was authentic.  They found that mental support, that is, the advance knowledge of the mental requirements of the communication task by the facilitator was necessary for successful communication.  As the authors note, performances with mental support were around 100% successful, but without this knowledge, performances bottomed out to near zero.  A skeptic would not be surprised.    All experiments on the independence of the communication found exactly the same thing.     The communication is coming from the facilitator not the client in the majority of tested cases. From what I can see, telepathy looks attractive to some people because it explains the apparent input from the facilitator.  This is not an ethical position to take however when the bigger question, the authenticity of telepathy itself remains unanswered.  There are other reasons why ascribing telepathic abilities to autistic individuals may not be ethical.  Firstly given the experimental history of disconfirming the authenticity of the communication, the field does not need any more controversy.  Secondly, autistics deserve the same standards of science as anyone else.  Harrington shows they are a long way from gaining the minimum.  Thirdly, belief in magical thinking blinds you to other and more realistic possibilities.  Everything I have read points to the unusual degree of rapport that develops between client and facilitator.  Facilitators are in a much better position than most to point out subtle communicative efforts of their non verbal clients, knowledge that would be invaluable to parents of such children everywhere.   Telepathy as the explanation for the rapport is frankly unhelpful as well as unethical. 1.  Facilitated Communication: The Contribution of Physical, Emotional and Mental Support, M.

{"date": " February 02, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Dear Mr Day, I am writing to protest the remarkably inappropriate advertising campaign you have running to apparently raise awareness of autism and how Action for Children charities can help.   I have also seen the series of motherhood statements issued in response to similar protests, all more or less taking the combinatorial line that our intentions are pure and that these are Dan\u2019s own words.  The latter point may have had some validity if it were not for one expert who thought the whole thing smacked of brain washing and didn\u2019t mind saying so.  In fact some of the world\u2019s leading experts have come out publicly criticising this advertisement.  Here\u2019s some of what they had to say: From Dr Mitzi Waltz, I had been hearing for several days about this advert. It has been incredibly distressing for many people with autism and their family member I have now had a look and must say that I share their views. The voiceover distinctly says that his AUTISM was the problem, and implies that a special school is the solution to that problem. You note above that families are struggling to cope, and I agree. As a parent, I have been in their shoes. The answer would not have been to remove my bullied, upset, hurt child to a residential school and then tell him that he needs to be a \"better person.\" The answer would be to provide support to struggling families and children in their own schools and communities, and to advocate for changing the system that seems to feel it is OK for young people with autism to be bullied and excluded. This advertising campaign is disappointing and demeaning (by the way, the advert about the young carer also seems to fit the theme of accepting that children are dumped on, and that providing individual support without advocating for systems change is adequate.) Dr. Mitzi Waltz Lecturer in Autism Studies, University of Birmingham (writing in my personal capacity) From Professor Baron-Cohen  \"Whilst I support any efforts to help children with autism and to alleviate suffering, I hope there will be more thought given to both the language and the imagery we use, to avoid risk of offence. For example, the name of the charity DAN contains the word \"Defeat\", as if autism is a disease like cancer against which we have to wage war. Autism is a complex mix of disability and strength, and whilst we need to work to find imaginative ways to reduce the disabling aspects, we do not wish to \"defeat autism\" since this would also eliminate the positive aspects. The latter include an excellent attention to detail, excellent memory for detail, and the ability to focus for long periods on a narrow topic. These features are not just seen in the high-functioning individuals or those with Asperger Syndrome but are seen right across the autistic spectrum. Sometimes these positive aspects can result in remarkable talents. We need to work to get the balance right, between using treatments for those aspects of autism that need treatment (such as the language difficulties, the epilepsy, the self-injury, the gut issues, or the learning difficulties) and encouraging those aspects of autism that do not need treatment and are special, so that the person can fulfil their potential. An image of a child as a demon in an ad campaign is equally unhelpful if we are to educate the public about autism. These issues, about language and imagery, are important if we take seriously the notion of neurodiversity, and wish to show respect towards those who are neurotypical and neuroatypical.\" Professor Baron-Cohen of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University From Dr Tony Attwood \u201cI am very concerned that the advert gives a message that children with autism and Asperger\u2019s syndrome are dangerous and potentially disturbed. When the child refers to \u201ccorrect errors in my behaviour\u201d this seems to imply \u2018brain washing\u2019 and a sense of guilt for how he behaved. Many of the behaviours I consider as coping mechanisms for the lack of understanding and respect from other people. He refers to reacting when people insult him. Those that insulted him need the treatment.\u201d Dr Tony Attwood, author of \u201cThe Complete Guide To Asperger\u2019s Syndrome\u201d  Many other knowledgeable folk have protested this ill thought out campaign.  It becomes apparent that Action for Children did not consult with anyone in the field before airing this sorry advertisement.  For future endeavours, would you mind doing so? \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2009/02/action-for-childrens-diabolical.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Action for Children's Diabolical Advertising Campaign\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " November 15, 2008", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Please note that Michelle Dawson disagrees with this post.  Her comment is as follows: \"I've posted my opposition to what Alyric has done  here  and here.\" I disagree and for only one reason.  I'm quite sure that when Michelle started working with Mottron and writing advocacy on behalf of innumerable folks everywhere, she had no idea where it would all end up and her own prominence in it.  But, she is that prominent and there it is.  The cost to prominence is to be a front runner.  Therefore the argument that this is going to make her life difficult has less legitimacy than it might.  Actually, I tend to think that it makes life more difficult in the long run to avoid this kind of confrontation and this confrontation has been brewing for a very long time, to the point that autism advocacy here in Canada has been poisoned by it.  Now that's my opinion and goody for me, what a nice safe opinion it is too.  Am I going to be affected by this action?  Nope and because of that dear reader, you must take what Michelle thinks into account first before you do anything at all. The main drag: I wrote this letter (not a very good one) because I've had enough of the advocacy of some so intent on their narrow pursuits that they think that those who contribute in ways not supportive of their agenda can be defamed at will.  That the autistic involved is important and that this importance is being recognised in the broader autistic research community is not actually central to the matter.  What matters is that whole slabs of raw data, namely the perceptions and cognitive characteristics of autistics, cognitive psychological studies all, are being dismissed as 'anti-ABA'. Why?  Because I suspect that this is a major point of unavoidable embarassment for behaviourists who can claim in 40 years of research nothing at all that furthers understanding of autistics, yet they have vast intervention mechanisms in place.  Naturally, if you're FEATBC and are running a major political campaign to have Medicare fund ABA, anything seen to detract in any way has to be marginalised and if at all possible de-legitimised.  Well that has to stop.  I know their agenda and know more thAn enough about how governments fund autism services to be in sympathy with their aims, while not necessarily thinking that this is wonderful for all autistics and all skill sets.  It emphatically is not and there's no evidence to say so. Just look at Medicare funding for autism services in Australia - and that's PT, OT and speech therapy, no where near ABA.  They're talking to the the tune of 20 services per annum, what a joke.    It is however, no joke when autistics are defamed in the name of attempting to sideline enormously important research because it doesn't fit with your plans.  How can anyone claim to represent autistics or have their interests at heart while doing so is simply not possible that I can see.  As such, I'm calling on anyone who cares to write to FEATBC and any politicians you care to protesting their extraordinary activities, highlighting the importance of this research and emphasisng that reasonable people, including legitimate advocates just do not do such things. I write from the outsider perspective, not being Canadian and I think that it would be helpful if folks outside of Canada could let Canadians and their politicians become aware of the disgust in which these advocacy efforts are viewed.   The Medicare for Autism website lists politicians supportive of this initiative and they are the ones who will be most aware of the very negative publicity that FEATBC's activities are likely to generate since politicians always look at the wider picture. 7 November 2008 Dr Sabrina Freeman Executive Director c/- Ms Jean Lewis Board Member Families for Early Autism Intervention of British Columbia (F.E.A.T.B.C.) Suite 425 - 1489 Marine Drive,  West Vancouver, BC, V7T 1B8 Dear Dr Freeman and Ms Lewis I am writing concerning the posting in duplicate of the following to the FEATBC message boards on, Wednesday, October 29, 2008 at  here  and  here . The text is as follows: \u201cThe National, CBC's flagship nightly newscast hosted by Peter Mansbridge, has proven itself completely worthless to anyone who has any respect for truth. Here is the piece of garbage they have recently produced: http://www.cbc.ca/national/blog/special_feature/positively_autistic/ It is important to note that Michelle Dawson is a self-proclaimed \"autistic\" who has never had a formal diagnosis. A newspaper report has revealed that she has supposedly \"self-diagnosed\" herself. Much evidence suggests she is an opportunist who is seeking profit and attention by exploiting public ignorance about autism. Temple Grandin, a real autistic who is NOT against ABA, says: \"The problem is, you talk to parents with a low-functioning kid, who've got a teenager who still goes to the bathroom in his pants and who's biting himself all the time. This guy destroys the house, and he's not typing, no matter what keyboards you make available. His life is miserable.\" Why do people like Michelle Dawson never talk about how miserable these children get without treatment? That's because they want the fame and fortune of Temple Grandin but have nothing to contribute, so they resort to any method imaginable, often at the expense of truly disabled children. Tony\u201d Everybody has an opinion but, the problem is that this posting will place the Medicare for Autism Now campaign in jeopardy if it ever becomes apparent in government circles that a prominent autism advocacy society, which claims to be doing their all for their constituency - autistics, one would assume, blatantly treats one of them to a disgraceful display of overt defamation and disrespect.  No one it seems has considered the effect of such antics on an outsider.  I am an outsider, though reasonably  knowledgeable of the history of the altercation, having followed it from my own country before I arrived in yours.   Your government decision makers are also outsiders.  What is immediately obvious is that a prominent Canadian researcher in autism, Michelle Dawson, who has done as much as anyone to drag psychological research into autism into the cognitive revolution and who selflessly represented herself and therefore all autistics before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT),  is being grossly misrepresented.  Those who seek prominence and profit do not elect to work as unpaid volunteer researchers (for  the many years that the CHRT case was in progress) and neither do they seek no damages following the successful outcome of their CHRT case.  It is also obvious that Ms Dawson\u2019s diagnosis will have been scrutinised most thoroughly by CHRT.   The numerous non sequiturs in this posting would not under any circumstances be put to any other Canadian researcher.  Imagine if Dr Eric Fombonne were to be asked to \u201ctalk about how miserable these people would be without treatment\u201d.   The attitudes expressed represent ignorance combined with base ingratitude.   I am not a Canadian but I know where to find the text of Ms Dawson\u2019s CHRT outcome.  These lines are particularly memorable: \u201cthe Tribunal finds it disturbing for the future of autistic people that they be seen because of their condition to pose a threat to the safety of others and some form of nuisance in the workplace. An employer has a duty to ensure not only that all employees work in a safe environment but also that ill perceptions about an employee's condition due to poor or inadequate information about his disability lead other employees to have negative and ill-founded perceptions about him.\u201d I plan to use those lines in the event of discrimination in the workplace against my ASD offspring.  But those lines, bearing the imprimatur of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, would not exist without the perseverance and hard work of Michelle Dawson.  They can be a resource for anyone, including non-Canadians. I find it extraordinary that an autism advocacy organisation should allow such contempt for what are admirable achievements by anybody using any yardstick.  There are not many Canadian researchers who are listed as principal author for papers published in the prestigious journal Psychological Science, which is where one can find Dawson et al, The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence.   There are not many who contribute to book chapters for sentinel reference texts.  Ms Dawson has done that also with her contribution of Learning in Autism to J. H. Byrne (Series Ed.) & H. Roediger (Vol. Ed.), Learning and memory: A comprehensive reference: Cognitive Psychology.  What country wouldn\u2019t be proud of such a daughter?  What autistic advocacy organisation wouldn\u2019t be proud of such an autistic daughter? The sentiments expressed by the poster and disseminated by supporters of FEATBC do nothing for the reputations of those involved and may do a great deal more harm than foreshadowed given the importance the participants put on persuading governments to do more for autistic children.  That these proponents have disseminated such blatant falsehoods about a prominent and autistic Canadian does nothing to persuade others that their concerns are justified and worthy of serious debate. I look to the governance of FEATBC and Medicare for Autism Now to rectify this situation.

The piece makes for fascinating reading.[ HERE ]  According to the authors the crux of the matter lies at point 3: \u201c3.         To stoke the fires of this controversy, to sell more copies of his book, and to place supporters of his pro-vaccination views in a more favorable and sympathetic light, Offit fictionalized the exchange between Seidel, a supporter of Offit's views, and Plaintiff, one of Offit's sharpest critics.  Offit accomplished this fabrication by creating a made-up \"plea\" by Seidel for Plaintiff to stop promoting a certain autism therapy.  Offit then falsified a \"response\" to this phony \"plea\" by quoting, completely out of context, a message that Plaintiff had posted on a different message board in response to an entirely different topic.\u201d So in the middle of a work of non fiction there is this piece of fiction expressly designed to make JB look really bad.

It\u2019s a very rambly piece and hard to know what they're trying to string together given that though Kathleen is a non party in a hamfisted way there is an attempt to tie in neurodiversity to harassment of Gen rescue\u2019s angels.  But acknowledging that the harassers remain unidentified and then stringing it to unknown neurodiversity proponents is a bit of a stretch, but not for this crew apparently.

{"date": " March 09, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   From the Washington Post Autism and Eye Contact Autistic children and adults are typically reluctant to make and keep eye contact with others -- part of their general lack of social or emotional connection. A new study suggests a basic reason for this: The eye contact overstimulates a part of the brain that processes fear and emotion, and people with autism learn to limit their eye- and face-tracking as a result. Using brain-scanning techniques, researchers also found that another part of the brain typically associated with processing facial information is underactive in autistic men and boys. Made physically uncomfortable by eye contact, the autistic subjects were not able to take in as much visual information about a face as the control subjects. In two studies at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior at the University of Wisconsin, the subjects were placed in a magnetic-resonance-imaging scanner that recorded their brain reactions to photographs of faces expressing a variety of emotions. The autistic group consistently showed greater sensitivity than the control group to brain activity in the amygdala, where emotion generally is registered, and less activity in the fusiform gyrus, where the ability to read another's facial expressions tends to reside. The studies also found that the longer the autistic group made eye contact with the facial images, the greater the electrical activity in the amygdala. The control group experienced no similar reaction. Researcher Richard Davidson said the experiment was the first to use a brain scanner to follow eye tracking by autistic individuals. He said the results indicate that the current practice of training autistic individuals to look directly at the eyes of other people as a form of treatment \"may exacerbate already high levels of anxiety in social situations.\" -- Marc Kaufman DKM, autistic extraordinaire summed it up nicely: \"No shit, Sherlock.

Gross\u2019s article begins with Karen Singer\u2019s autistic son spending recess alone or crying in the bathroom and wondering \"Why am I like this? What's wrong with me? He knew he was doing something wrong as he reached the social crucible of middle school, but he did not know how to fix it.\u201d Gross\u2019s next point is that what is wrong is the reluctance of the autistic child to be \u2018cool\u2019, the propensity for making inappropriate remarks, the \u201cstruggle to read body language or to imagine what other people are thinking. If they learn a joke, they may tell it a dozen times. They are too literal-minded to understand white lies and too rule-bound to understand they should not tattle. They overreact to routine teasing and invite ridicule by carrying their books over their heads or accepting a dare to kiss a girl.\u201d Gross\u2019s final point is that classmates that were once tolerant, aren\u2019t any longer. \u201c\"Kids have very short memories when they're young\u2026\u2026 They are much less forgiving as they get older.\" And the conclusion from all this is that \u201cthe majority of such children become conspicuous in the third grade and are bullied or ostracized by the time they reach middle school.\u201d While the conclusion is the correct one, both the reasoning and the solution are faulty. According to this description, ASD children are bullied and ostracised because their social skills are so poor it is quite understandable that they provoke negative reactions in other children. Naturally, the solution is to offer social skills classes in the belief that with improvement in this area, the ASD child will not attract such negative attention. The problems in this scenario are firstly, that it is always or even primarily the actions of the ASD child that precipitate the negative sequelae \u2013 false assumption. The second is that the other children are acting with corrective intent, if negative consequences \u2013 false attribution. An examination of the nature and extent of the bullying experience among the vast majority of ASD children will, I think put paid to the notion that firstly, the victim deserved it and secondly and much more importantly, that social skills classes can remedy this.  No amount of inappropriate behaviour can possibly justify what really happens to ASD children in schools. Anecdotes range from constant shoving in corridors, held head-down in toilets, locked in cupboards, kicked, punched, beaten unconscious, hanged on the school gate to running the gauntlet in gym changing rooms (practically universal). A favourite appears to be to surround the ASD child with a group of at least four and engage in whatever taunting is most likely to elicit the most satisfactorily terrified response. Note that it is never a one to one engagement here. The odds are always 4 to 1 or worse. Of course in the average school, there are several such groups and very few ASD, so that this \u2018group therapy\u2019 happens several times a week. And if questioned, the response is usually \u2018We were only teasing\u2019. Though the bullying experiences suffered by ASD children can vary quite a bit, there are a few universals. Up front, it is the systematic destruction of an individual to cater to the perceived emotional needs of pre-pubescent and pubescent individuals going through the intensely tumultuous period of adolescence. The autistic child is the \u2018painted bird\u2019 and as such serves as the panacea for bruised egos, failed or faltering relationships, academic woes and the fluctuating self esteem experienced by the ASD\u2019s peers. You see, the ASD does not have to do a thing to attract this kind of unwelcome attention. Blaming the faulty social skills is mere camouflage. They could ignore the child, but it is very apparent that they do not and prefer not to. When the compulsion to conformity and group solidarity is at its height in early adolescence, the inability to connect and therefore to submit to a group identity is a capital crime. The lack of a supportive network of peers is an added bonus. Not only has this person broken the golden rule of \u2018fitting in\u2019 but there isn\u2019t going to be any retribution.  The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in ASD children inspired by their bullying experiences can last a decade. Yet the underlying drive for socialisation of ASD children is rather like insisting that the inmates of Abu Ghraib meet with Lindy England for drinks and chit-chat on a daily basis in the interests of fostering inter-cultural relations. The psychological consequences are likely to be devastating. What does it do to a child\u2019s developing capacity to judge to be told that they should emulate the very people dishing out the most horrible abuse because their peers are \u2018normal\u2019 and they are not? Social skills training is very necessary and will pay dividends in the long term. For this period from middle school through to junior high school, however, their protective capacity is likely to be nil because that\u2019s not the problem. Being \u2018different\u2019 is and kids are extraordinarily sensitive to it. What our ASD kids need is definitely the ability to smile, interact nicely, and carry a big stick. Along with nurturing those social skills it is equally necessary to teach assertiveness and perhaps martial arts. Leaving ASD kids with no defences because it is just too hard, too painful or too foreign a concept to recognise what normal kids are capable of is not the answer.

{"date": " March 09, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   In the  weirdest apologia  yet for the pro abortion camp, Emily Maguire puts up the argument that if the wimpy pro lifers had the strength of their convictions, they would: \u201csay what they really mean. Premeditated, cold-blooded child murder is not a matter for debate. If abortion is equivalent to infanticide, shouldn't the women who have authorised this killing and the doctors who have carried it out be prosecuted and incarcerated?\u201d On which planet has Emily been residing? Is she not aware that a sizeable portion of the community out there from His Holiness, the Pope on down have indeed been yelling, loudly, \u201cThis is murder\u201d? And yes, if they can get abortion made illegal again, the practitioners will certainly have their day in criminal court. Unlike Emily, they don\u2019t see the first trimester foetus as: \u201ca mass of relatively undifferentiated cells that exist as a part of a woman's body.\u201d Neither does anyone else with a memory of very basic high school biology. That undifferentiated mass has a heartbeat at eight weeks. The same mass including the placenta is in no way a part of the maternal body, merely resident for a time. One of life\u2019s fascinating mysteries is why the mother\u2019s immune system does not reject this histological interloper. Legalised abortion exists because in a rare twist of events, the law isn\u2019t a complete ass and recognises that there are many shades of grey in this issue. Is it right to abort a foetus with anencephaly or some other fatal or even merely severely disabling condition? Can anyone say for certain when life starts? If it\u2019s a toss-up between the mother\u2019s health and that of the foetus, who wins? There are a multitude of reasons why abortion is not a black and white issue. But, here comes Emily Maguire with a dare to the fence sitters to put up or shut up. It\u2019s murder or it isn\u2019t. It was Clinton, I think, who said that abortion should be safe, private and rare. A part of this abortion debate revolves around the disquieting realisation that while abortion is now safe because it is legal, and it is seen as a private decision, not one for the courts to decide, it is anything but rare. Figures flying around this country lately have been quoted at 2000 a week. Is this an epidemic of disability, lifestyle choice or default contraceptive choice? So far, reasonable people have tempered their own views in deference to this being private to the person who is primarily affected. They assume and given the abortion figures perhaps wrongly, that abortion is such a difficult decision that there must be good reasons for it. Emily, myopically, chooses to see this as supportive of a pro-abortion stance. Quoting Emily, given that \u201can embryo is not a child. If left alone, it may develop into one\u201d, those temperate folk may very well hop off the fence and start demanding that the embryo be given a chance. Further, those pro-lifers would be only too happy to oblige you in making this a black and white issue.

{"date": " February 22, 2009", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   \u201cWhile large scale studies have not shown a link between vaccines and autism, there are lingering legitimate questions about the safety of vaccines that must be addressed. \u201c So said Autism Speaks  in response to the Autism Omnibus Proceedings decisions by the Special Masters.  Of note, they must have completely ignored the actual decisions to make that statement, as did every anti-vaxxer site masquerading as an autism organisation.  In all cases the Special Masters spoke eloquently and in considerable detail about the lack of a credible link between vaccines and the development of autism in the individual child.  There was nothing large scale about it, so why did AS put in this regrettable performance?   Can they now be aligned with all the other anti-vaxxer sites?   It would appear so given the anti-science displayed by Geraldine Dawson in her bid for a more collaborative approach to immunisation questions.   Her approach to neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation noted in some ASD folk is at decisive odds to the findings of the experts in front of the Omnibus.  She wants to give legitimacy to what amounts to parent pandering by giving undue importance to isolated findings.    What is questionable at this stage is the legitimacy of parent pandering under the guise of collaboration.   It could be well argued that it\u2019s the parents who are entirely responsible for the current fiasco having decided against all professional advice that vaccines are responsible for their children\u2019s autism.  Throwing more money at vaccine safety questions is unlikely to persuade them especially in the oh so likely event that vaccines are exonerated from blame.   If it\u2019s not the answer they wanted they will ask for yet more research and where does it all stop?   Autism Speaks shift to the anti-vax agenda got a rather large push from the daughter of the founder who was rather vocal in her disapproval of Allison Tepper Singer.   Katie Wright is a fervent anti-vaxxer who believes firmly that her son\u2019s autism developed from vaccines.  Autism Speaks founders, Bob and Suzanne Wright\u2019s wish to support their daughter\u2019s beliefs may be more than a little shortsighted if it means the derailing of the agenda of a significant research funder.  Note that Allison Tepper Singer resigned over the vaccine research agenda.  For her it was \u2018we know the world is round\u2019 and it\u2019s time to move to more important questions.  Katie Wright is still in the picture and the picture is less than rosy with her in it.   It may well be that Katie becomes a liability that Autism Speaks can well do without.   There are limits to the scientific veneer Geraldine Dawson can maintain with Katie\u2019s contributions in the background. When Jenny McCarthy wrote her latest,  she included Katie Wright as one of her Mother Warriors.   Thematic through the entire book was a lack of consistency in accounts.   None were more inconsistent than Katie\u2019s.   Here\u2019s her opening line: \u201c We tried everything: traditional therapies, ABA, speech, OT, everything. We even tried the heavy pharmaceuticals and we were warned over and over again, not to do the diet, that it was very dangerous.\u201d Note the monumental absurdity that an exclusion diet is \u2018very dangerous\u2019 and no mention at all of the very real dangers of heavy duty pharmaceuticals.   This is typical Katie Wright, overly florid emotional outpouring untempered by critical thinking skills.  Embarassing it may well be but harmless compared to what she is capable of doing in the way of character assassination, most of it the figment of an overly active imagination.  The best example to date is her latest for AoA.   This is Katie\u2019s reaction to Nancy Minshew and Paul Offit\u2019s response to the Omnibus decisions.   The article  however is extremely short with Offit rating two small paragraphs and Minshew one. Brevity notwithstanding,  Katie makes the most of it.   Offit and Minshew are introduced as \u201cwealthy vaccine profiteer Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Nancy ( all autism vaccine research is \u2018crappola\u2019) Minshew.\u201d who \u201cheld a shockingly angry pity fest. \u201c.  Where the latter comes from is anybody\u2019s guess.  She carries on with \u201cEven when Offit\u2019s side wins, he is still angry, lashing out at grass roots autism organizations\u201d.   Here she names two - AS and NAA interspersed with other material she would like to attribute to Offit including that he\u2019s fuming.  Here\u2019s how she puts it: \u201cIt would be nice if autism orgs (AS, NAA) actually advocated for children with autism!\u201d he fumes. \u201cInstead they are anti-vaccine organizations (because demanding safety studies = heresy!)\u2026and it is high time that these orgs stopped deluding people\u2026\u201d   Reading the original article it\u2019s amazing the difference between the quite restrained tones of what Offit actually said and what Katie wished he said.  No mention in the original of any organisation by name.  Her quote is incomplete and there would have been plenty of room to quote the lot if her inaccurate additions had been omitted.   This does not look especially like someone fuming: \"It would be nice if autism advocacy organizations actually advocated for children with autism,\" Dr. Offit said. \"Instead, they are anti-vaccine organizations, and the fact of the matter is vaccines have nothing to do with autism and it's high time that these organizations stopped deluding people into thinking that vaccines do have something to do with autism and started focusing on the real causes of autism,\" Her next contribution is informative: \u201cWow, is this guy angry, what a freak! Does it infuriate him that AS provides cash grants to communities in need? Or is Offit angry that AS has undertaken a huge campaign to provide insurance re-imbursement for autistic kids? How awful! Maybe Offit is also infuriated by NAA\u2019 s modest research budget investigating how to help sick autistic children as well as their grants to struggling families is need. That is, obviously, really wrong!\u201d Offit goes to being an angry freak.  But he has not mentioned either organisation or a single word about them.  Why then the unsubstantiated vitriol, which continues for another paragraph? Her next foray is against Nancy Minshew: \u201cMinshew re-iterates for the millionth time \u201cI hope this begins an end to the death threats and character assassination against scientists!\u201d This she allies to  : \u201cNaturally Minshew expresses no sympathy or concern for the long suffering Cedillo family or their daughter Michelle, who is so severely physiologically affected.\u201d There is the rather large question of why Minshew would see the need in this article in this situation.   Curiously, Katie asks \u201cwhat character assassination?\u201d one paragraph further.  I think she has perfectly answered her own question.  As for how much the autism community dislikes Nancy Minshew, Katie makes the common mistake of assuming her anti vaccination organisations, which use autism to further their anti-vaccination agenda are more than fringe dwellers of the autism community. Katie concludes that Minshew and Offit are a couple of drama queens because no parent she knows would offer death threats.  The FBI would certainly disagree with this piece of historical revisionism. Katie then goes on to quote Minshew\u2019s comments on death threats in full: \"I also hope this begins to end the death threats and character assassination against scientists and physicians who have tried to convey the science of this to the public.\" What Katie objects to is the nature of the science being conveyed.  As she puts it: \u201cOh, The Science, meaning the science she likes. What about The Science behind the Hannah Polings decision? What about exploring The Science behind the 700% increase in autism over the past decade? What about The Science regarding the dozens toxic adjuvants in infant vaccines? How about researching The Science behind post vaccination regression? Or how about science not paid for by vaccine makers or the CDC?\u201d I suppose this is a fair summary of Katie\u2019s scientific illiteracy.  You don\u2019t get to like some science and not others; it\u2019s not a democracy.  The science behind the Poling decision is what exactly?   The decision was made on certain grounds but were they scientific ones at all?  The science behind the increase in autism says there is no real increase in autism prevalence.  There are no dozens of toxic adjuvants in any vaccine.  Calling for research not done by CDC or vaccine makers is a typical appeal to conspiracy theories. Katie naturally concludes that Minshew and Offit are working overtime to stop further research into vaccines and autism links.   They both feel that too much money has been wasted already and there are other more profitable avenues for research but neither is working actively to prevent such research.  That is in Katie\u2019s head.   Unfortunately there are many such notions and Katie has applied these with a broad and inaccurate brush to two quite respectable practitioners of respectively autism research and vaccine expertise.   AoA censors all criticism directed at it so Katie could be forgiven for thinking that her style is acceptable.  Outside of that protected environment it is not and reflects badly on any organisation with which she is associated.  Bob and Suzanne Wright may regret placing their family loyalty above their duty to protect the reputation of their organisation.   Currently Katie represents nothing more than a liabilty. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/statement_regarding_feb_12_vaccine_court_decision.php", " http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09045/949185-85.stm", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/id-and-nancy.html"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2009/02/katie-wright-autism-speaks-liability.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Katie Wright::  Autism Speak's Liability\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " July 18, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Au courant in Humanities departments is the id\u00e9e fixe that all knowledge is socially constructed, including scientifically generated knowledge. Objectivity, the foundation stone of science and the scientific method cannot really exist either, because that would imply that there was some kind of external truth out there that really is independent of the observer. So, since the very concept of objectivity is threatening to the careers and prestige of thousands in the social sciences, it is vital that the definition of the term be co-opted to mean something quite different. Rather than a concerted effort to exclude factors that ought not to influence the analysis of data, the gold standard being the double blind trial, two luminaries in the critique of sciences field have come up with alternate epistemologies. The first to attempt this was Sandra Harding with her concept of  \u2018strong objectivity\u2019 , a tenet of feminist standpoint theory, which argues that since Science, from its inception, has been the province of dead white males, it is hopelessly corrupted by patriarchal notions. Hence, the only way to cleanse this house of knowledge production is to take the standpoint in all scientific questions of those who have heretofore been excluded from the enterprise. Thus, the wholesale introduction into scientific research of people of colour, of non-Western background and women would lend a truly \u2018objective\u2019 basis to not only the questions Science would ask but the way it would go about answering those questions.  Gross and Levitt  in their aptly named \u2018Higher Superstition\u2019 do a very thorough job of debunking such thinking ( page 130 \u2013 134). Suffice it to say that when asked what feminist standpoint theory had contributed to Science, Harding replied that we now know that PMS is not a disease. Dr Jennifer Keelan of the University of Toronto, boarding the bandwagon of the current furor over the link between autism and mercury preservatives in vaccines, has come up with her own version of objectivity with an article titled Democratic Objectivity: Citizen\u2019s Science and the Immunization-Autism Imaginary. Keelan rests her thesis on the assumption that here are two warring factions with merely different but equally valid perspectives. She writes Democratic Objectivity share many of the normative values that separate science from pseudo-science, such as peer review, independent testing, laboratory modelling, controlled trials and meta-analysis of data. Presumably the reader confronting this issue for the first time will have a better grasp, a more objective view of the subject, if they examine both perspectives and that would be true if these perspectives were equally valid and paid equally serious attention to the scientific principles of peer review, independent testing, laboratory modelling, controlled trials and meta analysis of data. This is demonstrably not the case and something that Keelan is quite well aware of considering the lengths she goes to give the \u2018Citizen\u2019s Science\u2019 a facsimile of credibility. Taking these criteria in order we find the following. Peer review: It is the mechanism of peer review that underpins much of the objectivity of Science. If your peers can find the flaw in your argument, data or methodology and you cannot further justify your case, then one can conclude that Science has advanced and you have not. Therein lies the difference. In Science as distinct from this \u2018democratic\u2019 model, it matters not a whit who the researchers are, apart from their credentials (which indeed may not contribute at all), it matters what the data say. For some reason it appears that in much that passes for research in the soft sciences, peer review is seen as the hallelujah chorus. Thou shalt toe the party line. And the Citizen\u2019s Brigade proves to be a good example of that, even if some of their advocates are real scientists. Consider Professor Boyd Haley of the University of Kentucky. In his  response to the Institute of Medicine  (IOM)  critique  of the Citizen\u2019s Brigade, one would expect the scientific sort of peer review process; an appeal to the data. Professor Haley\u2019s argument, which basically says that the IOM dismissed all the research without justification stands in beautiful contrast to the IOM critique of just that research.  The report  reads: However, the studies by Geier and Geier cited above have serious methodological flaws and their analytic methods were nontransparent, making their results uninterpretable, and therefore noncontributory with respect to causality What could be clearer than that? And this is just the bare bones of the Executive Summary. For the real meat, the reader is directed to the full report, which is free and available to any member of the public who wants to read it. Apart from implying that it must be especially galling for members of the American Association of Pediatricians to have been pipped at the post by parents in discovering the autism epidemic (what epidemic?), he then uses the specious argument that since the Madsen study showed a protective association between thimerosal and autism that there must be some sinister reason why those countries have not re-instated thimerosal as the preservative of choice. Independent Testing, It would be reasonable to say that the problems faced by the Citizen\u2019s Brigade begin and end with a lack of independent testing, judging by the testing organisations cited by the Evidence of Harm list on yahoo and by the rather incredible vested commercial interests of the major proponents. It is a commonplace for the Citizen\u2019s Brigade to cite their offspring\u2019s elevated mercury levels in hair, yet this is  quintessential quackery.  The Geiers make their living out of being \u2018expert\u2019 witnesses in vaccine damage cases, though neither is actually qualified to do so. Dr Boyd Haley is the one-third owner and founder of  Altcorp , which tests for heavy metal toxicity and provides testing material for heavy metal testing. Far more reprehensible is Keelan\u2019s blithe rendering of pure unadulterated snake oil as merely direct marketing of credible alternatives. Thus the chelation regimes touted by the Citizen\u2019s Brigade including the likes of  Rashid Buttar\u2019s  chelation cream are given by Keelan a legitimacy they patently do not deserve. In Buttar\u2019s case it amounts to outright fraud, since it is doubtful that the active ingredient in the cream can be absorbed. Dr James Laidler, was at one time a proponent of the autism=mercury poisoning theory until he looked at the chelation regimes and realised that they were unworkable. His critique of the whole can be read  here. Gross and Levitt argue convincingly that critics of science should know something of the subject they critique, if they wish to be credible. Keelan\u2019s rather obvious ignorance of what constitutes Science and what is outright quackery demonstrates that her whole enterprise lacks legitimacy. Laboratory Modelling Here, the Citizens Brigade have for the first time strayed into legitimate science with Mady Hornig\u2019s  laboratory modelling  of the effects of thimerosal on genetic strains of mice. But Hornig herself admits that this does not prove a link between thimerosal in routine vaccinations and the development of autism and even more damningly she  writes : We have limited ability to explain the interplay of such factors in humans; consider the example of the disparate cognitive outcomes reported in children in the Faroe Islands and the Seychelles after similar prenatal methylmercury exposures. The reasons for this divergence remain unclear. As the  IOM pointed out: Although this model uses thimerosal and is possibly more relevant to the discussion at hand, it assumes that autism is caused by an autoimmune reaction. A previous section discussed the lack of evidence of autoimmune-mediated CNS damage in the brains of patients with autism. In other words, it\u2019s an intriguing study, but is it germane to the argument that thimerosal can cause autism? Controlled Trials One wonders just what Keelan\u2019s background in Science is that she is unaware that there are no controlled studies in support of the Citizen\u2019s Brigade. The  IOM report  is comprehensive: Epidemiological studies examining TCVs and autism, including three controlled observational studies (Hviid et al., 2003; Miller, 2004; Verstraeten et al., 2003) and two uncontrolled observational studies (Madsen et al., 2003; Stehr-Green et al., 2003), consistently provided evidence of no association between TCVs and autism, despite the fact that these studies utilized different methods and examined different populations (in Sweden, Denmark, the United States, and the United Kingdom). Other studies reported findings of an association. These include two ecological studies 4  (Geier and Geier, 2003a, 2004a), three studies using passive reporting data (Geier and Geier, 2003a,b,d) one unpublished study using Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) data (Geier and Geier, 2004b,c), and one unpublished uncontrolled study (Blaxill, 2001). Meta Analysis We already know what Science thinks of the Geier\u2019s meta analyses. The courts have expressed similar sentiments. However, no discussion of this topic could be complete without some description of the meta analysis conducted by Robert F Kennedy Jr. Quoting from Kennedy\u2019s article  Deadly Immunit y: According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, many at the meeting [Simpsonwood} were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry's bottom line. There follows a list of the most appallingly out of context, and misleading quotations in the annals of meta analysis. The truly awful extent of it has been catalogued by Skeptico  here.  Keelan is uncritical of the meta analyses that underlie the conclusion of the Citizen\u2019s Brigade that the \u2018autism epidemic\u2019 is caused by thimerosal containing vaccines. That there is an epidemic is treated by her as a given, a faux pas that would be completely unacceptable in scientific circles. Dr Morton Ann Gernschbacher et. al, have written the definitve rebuttal to the notion of an epidemic of autism -  Three Reasons not to Believe in an Autism Epidemic. There are multiple flaws in Keelan\u2019s article, most stemming from the a priori hypothesis that scientific knowledge can be \u2018democratic\u2019 in the sense that two opposing camps have equally meritorious arguments. Distortions are inevitable in the course of making the data fit the hypothesis, some quite serious as the following shows. While the CDC and the FDA acknowledged that the broad spectrum of symptoms described after mercury poisoning was analogous to autism, This statement is unreferenced, perhaps not surprisingly so, as it is totally false. Never would a reputable organisation lend its name to such arrant nonsense. Far from being a sterling example of democratic objectivity, Keelan\u2019s thesis more closely resembles the social stampede model in pursuit of El Dorado - there\u2019s gold in them thar \u2018ills. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jac.gsu.edu/jac/15.2/Articles/1.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801857074/102-6274944-1600116?v=glance", "http://www.safeminds.org/pressroom/press_releases/2005-07-01-Haley-IOM-Response.pdf", "http://www.iom.edu/news.asp?id=27733", "http://www.nap.edu/books/030909237X/html/", "http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/hair.html", "http://www.altcorp.com/", "http://www.defeatautismyesterday.com/tddmpspro.pdf", "http://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromotion/immu/thimerosal.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15184908&query_hl=3", "http://autismcoach.com/Thimerosal%20Study.htm", "http://www.nap.edu/books/030909237X/html/", "http://www.nap.edu/books/030909237X/html/", "http://www.nap.edu/openbook/030909237X/html/6.html#p2000af8f8960006002", "http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/06/16/thimerosal/index_np.html", "http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/06/lies_damn_lies_.html", "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-06/bpl-trn062905.php"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2005/07/objectively-speaking.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Objectively Speaking\n\t                       \n                          "},
{"date": " August 03, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Among a large number of factoids circulating in cyberspace, the supposed \u2018autism epidemic\u2019 is particularly vexatious. According to the promoters of this factoid, the world is currently, and stealthily, being over-run with autism. Where at one time the prevalence of autism was 2 to 5 per 10, 000, it is now 1 in 166 persons. This is a social disaster, a tsunami of economic woe and something ought to be done about it before the world, or at least the Western world, crumples under the weight of having to support the millions of head banging, incontinent, non verbal, non communicative and profoundly retarded autistics for the rest of their long and expensive institutionalised lives. Right? Not by a country mile. It\u2019s a con, a sham and a fraud of truly magnificent proportions played out by autism organisations of various stripes round the world. The wonder is that people are so credulous as to believe it. As far as I can tell, the touters of the 1:166 statistic lean heavily on total public ignorance of all things autistic except for the movie \u2018Rainman\u2019. Autism is not a monolithic entity. The tripartite autistic spectrum includes autistic disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified and Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. Of importance, three quarters of that spectrum have no cognitive impairment, a point that these organisations fail to mention. The fraud is played out here, in the terminology of the spectrum and in the stereotypy so prevalent in describing autistic disorder itself. Kanner, the first to give a name to a constellation of behaviours he labelled autism was not as pessimistic about the attributes of autism as these doom saying touters of the 1:166. He found plenty of talent is his initial group.  Michelle Dawson  describes the Szatmari et. al.,  follow-up study  of a group of high functioning autistics which found, not unsurprisingly given that talent, that: \"Of the 16 autistics followed-up (ages 17-34; IQ 68-110), seven had university degrees (one was an MBA), and one was a community college graduate. This represents a higher percentage of university graduation than in the typical population. 38. Half of Dr Szatmari\u2019s autistics were completely independent; six required minimal assistance (I would fall into this category); one required \"moderate\" supervision; only one, the youngest, required \"constant\" supervision. Most were working or were students. One was married. None was institutionalized.\" The  prevalence  of autistic disorder according to pre-eminent autism epidemiologist, Dr Eric Fombonne, is around 13 per 10 000.    He also  estimates  that about 40% of those carrying the label autism as distinct from other spectrum diagnoses have severe to profound mental retardation, which reduces the \u2018help, it\u2019s a trajedy\u2019 rhetoric to about what the prevalence of autism was thought to be \u2013 around 2- 5 per 10,000.    Even within that pessimistic scenario, there\u2019s no guarantee that this group will inevitably require institutionalisation.   Intelligence testing for those on the autistic spectrum, especially if the autistic is non-verbal, is abysmal and that\u2019s when it\u2019s not downright  misleading  in terms of predicting outcomes.   As one autistic wit put it \u2013 learning to communicate can have your IQ shoot up one hundred points overnight.  Throw in the fact that there are the likes of Stephen Spielberg and Dan Ackroyd with diagnoses of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, contributing to autistic prevalence and the touters of the 1:166 avalanche of the extremely dysfunctional have a serious credibility problem.  A question arises with this pervasive 1:166 rhetoric. Widely promoted by autism societies and the parents of autistic children, do they not care that in painting the spectrum as a devastating tsunami, a fate worse than death, a pestilence and so forth, the general public is getting a very negative view of the autistic spectrum and one guaranteed to have a deleterious effect on their autistic children\u2019s future? There appear to be a number of factors at play here. Snake oil salesmen, whether of the chelation variety (autism=mercury poisoning) or the Lovaas Applied Behavioural Analysis camp (autism=a collection of unwanted behaviours), have a vested interest in painting the spectrum as black as possible. After all, they are in the business of selling a cure. In this, they are aided and abetted by parents who are easily persuaded that upping the pity factor as far as possible is the only way to prod Governments into funding $60, 000 a year ABA programs or persuading courts that they are entitled to a big payout from the pharmaceutical companies for causing their children\u2019s autism, the latter theory not at all supported by the science. This agenda has had and continues to have some entirely predictable consequences. Parents with \u2018cure\u2019 on their minds will seek at all costs to marginalise the very voices that might be the most useful in helping them understand their autistic children, namely autistic adults. Autistic adults pose problems for cure oriented parents on a number of fronts. Firstly, they aren\u2019t cured and therefore it follows that listening to what they have to say must be a regressive step. There is an element of fear of contamination in this thinking. Secondly their presence, if acknowledged, would also mean acknowledging that there must have been autistic children who progressed without benefit of either chelation or ABA, which doesn\u2019t add to the sales pitch. Additionally, it is harder to maintain the image of impending doom of catastrophic proportion if your electorate, so to speak, is articulate enough to object to your prognostications. The cure at all costs factions have been remarkably consistent in their reaction to outspoken autistic adults. Professor James  Mulick  said of Michelle Dawson: \"These are arguably characteristics of a person with a psychiatric disorder, but that disorder is not autism or even \u201con the spectrum\u201d. This was over the fall out from Dawson\u2019s \u2018 The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists\u2019 . Kit  Weintraub , also chipped in: \"Dawson appears to be so vastly different than most people I know with autism, that she cannot and should not pretend to understand what it's like to be them, much less have the audacity to speak for them.\" Lenny Schafer, editor of the Schafer Autism Report (aka the Lenny Letter), is on a one man  crusade  (SAR 8 April 2005) to have autism maintain its definitional purity: \"Yet, why do some people with Asperger's call themselves \"autistic\"? Is this a dysphemistic attempt to make Asperger's appear to be as serious as autism, or is it just slang?.\" The consensus from these folks is that articulate \u2260 autistic. Now here\u2019s the curious thing. Mr Schafer et al have objected on multiple occasions to the opinions of articulate autistic folk, including those who are autistic spectrum in that they have a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. At the same time he and assorted like minds proclaim the doom statistic - autism affects 1:166 persons, which of course includes all those upstart articulate autistic and Asperger\u2019s folk. Schafer et al cannot have it both ways. Either Asperger\u2019s and articulate adult autistics really are autistic and entitled both to the label and to authentic views on autism or Mr Schafer had better embrace the 1960s definition of autism together with its prevalence, 2 to 5 per 10,000, a far cry from 1:166. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_vic.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=2745389&itool=iconabstr&query_hl=5", "http://www.psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s10/v66s1001.pdf", "http://www.psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s10/v66s1001.pdf", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/imfar.pdf", "http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/sareport/Week-of-Mon-20040412/000217.html", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html", "http://asatonline.org/resources/library/moms_perspective.html"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2005/08/infamous-166.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t The Infamous 166\n\t                       \n                          "},

And true to form, he very nicely advertised this well intentioned website........ New Service For Parents of Autistic Children From Wiley Sherer, Webmaster and Aspie,  AskAnAspie.com . Hi, I'm with Odds & Friends, the Asperger's and High FunctioningAutism Society of the University of Chicago, and we're trying to let peopleknow about a new service that we're offering to parents of children on theautism spectrum. It's called AskAnAspie, and it's a way for neurotypicalparents to ask questions about what it's like to actually be on the spectrumand get answers from a team of University students, all of whom areautistic. You can see our website at  http://www.askanaspie.com/ . If you could pass on our web address to the parents on your email .....and couldn't resist climbing aboard his favourite soapbox. Editor\\'s note: Here is my question: By clinical definition, Asperger Syndrome and Autism are two related,but distinct diagnosis. One can be clinically labeled \"Asperger\\'s\" or\"Autistic\", but not both. Yet, why do some people with Asperger\\'s callthemselves \"autistic\"? Is this a dysphemistic attempt to make Asperger\\'sappear to be as serious as autism, or is it just slang?. This causesconfusion. For example, your mission statement starts out \"The mission ofAskAnAspie is to build a bridge between the Autism and Autisticcommunities.\" How does the same word get split into two differentcommunities? How does one build a bridge between the same place? If thereis a real difference between the two, then why use the same word? Perhapsyou can explain this to those of us in both the neurotypical and theneurotypicalism communities. We like bridges, too. -LS. I'll have a shot at answering those. 1.Asperger's folks call themselves autistic because they share the same deficit/difference - a disconnect from the human race. It was what led both Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner to independently call their patients 'autistic'. 2. Autism Communitries - set up by and for the parents of autistic children with a liberal sprinkling of professionals usually in advisory positions. 3. Autistic Communities - set up by and for autistics.  No need for the professionals, they are the professionals. Reasons for the distinction between 2. and 3. include: a) Marty Murphy b) Sabrina Freeman c) Kit Weintraub d) Gina Green e) Autism Canada f) Autism Society of America g) James Mulick h) Boyd Haley et al.

{"date": " April 11, 2005", "body": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   I noted in the local rag (aka the Sydney Morning Herald) that the pundits are out and about scouting for a more progressive pontifical regime following the death of John Paul II. The late Pope was said to be an \u2018absolutist\u2019. His position was the Veritatis Splendor, the title of his encyclical and compromise with the modern world\u2019s current cultural climate was not part of the agenda. But then, one must be careful with what passes under the progressive banner these days. Standard human rights for ordinary people, like gays and lesbians and getting rid of that vestige of Gnosticism, celibacy in the priesthood seem like a good idea to me. Other forms of the progressive are not so benign. Consider what emerged in the reaction to the conservative Cardinal George Pell\u2019s refusal to allow feminist process theologian, Dr Carol Christ to give a lecture at Santa Sabina College, Catholic Church property. This was followed by a similar refusal from the equally conservative Anglican Archbishop, Dr Peter Jensen. Dr Christ eventually found a podium in the Uniting Church. Senior lecturer in the Humanities at that latter day bastion of the Enlightenment, the University of Western Sydney, Dr Kathleen McPhillips was less than amused by the snub, citing whiffs of Galileo\u2019s ordeal. In her  article  to the Sydney Morning Herald, she wrote: \u201cTheology is immensely broad, with a magnitude of ideas and debates, making a significant contribution to understanding faith in the modern world. Why should this be restricted?\u201d The Church\u2019s stated reason for disallowing the lecture on hallowed ground was \"it would be inappropriate for a talk promoting Goddess worship and pagan spiritualities as an alternative to the basic tenets of the Christian faith\" Dr McPhillips protested that this is a misreading of Dr Christ\u2019s work and the lecture was all about process theology and her latest book \u2018She Who Changes\u2019. Now that is more than a little disingenuous on the part of McPhillips. A perusal of Dr Christ\u2019s website indicates that part of her income is derived from conducting Goddess tours of Crete, a shrine for Goddess worshippers. You can also  discover your inner goddess  with Carol Christ for $12. Dr Christ herself characterises her  beliefs  as \u201cIn Old Europe and Ancient Crete, women were respected for their roles in the discovery of agriculture and for inventing the arts of weaving and pottery making. Men were valued for their contributions to agriculture, to trade, and to the navigation of rivers and seas. Warfare was unknown or rarely practiced.\u201d This is the golden age of the Goddess worshipping Matriarchy, a Neolithic, earth centric, matrifocal idyll of pacific gender equality, which lasted for millennia \u201cuntil disaster struck,  in the form of horse-riding, cattle-rustling, patriarchal, sky-god-worshiping, warlike, Indo-European-speaking nomads who, someplace out in the wilds of central Asia, had gotten completely deranged and lost touch with everything valuable\u201d. Driven underground, the scattered acolytes of the Goddess worshipped the \u2018Old Religion\u2019 in secret for the next 5,000 years or so until the unfettered blossoming of Wiccan tradition [1] and rediscovery of traces of the ancient Goddess in the 20th Century. The problem with this Eden-like utopian vision of the past is that it is sheer fantasy whose production was spurred by the imaginations of those lackeys of the patriarchy, a couple of dead white males. It all started with the wishful thinking of a Swiss German romantic J. J. Bachofen, who first gave pen to the vision of this feminine utopia in an age of innocence in the late 19th Century. In the 1950\u2019s, embellishing on the work of Margaret Murray and others, Gerald Gardner wrote the handbook on Wiccan ritual. It is to Gardner that we owe the Wiccan notions of working \u2018skyclad\u2019 (he was a fan of nudism), the eight festivals of the wheel and wands and other paraphernalia and rituals, some of which were purloined from Freemasonry. The authoritative boost to the assumption that Neolithic = Goddess worship was given by the archaeologist, Marija Gimbutas, a specialist in Neolithic settlements of the Balkans. Her books are an absolute treasure trove of the beautiful depiction of Neolithic art. Unfortunately her interpretative skills were less impressive. For Dr Gimbutas, every artefact uncovered could be classified as part of the Goddess iconography. The argument was the last word in circularity. Here is a Neolithic, hence Goddess worshipping, culture. If the artefact was female, it was a depiction of the Goddess. If it was male it was the son or consort of the Goddess and any of an androgynous nature would be classified by default as female and therefore also part of Goddess iconography. Re-excavations of Catal Huyuk in Turkey, the largest Neolithic settlement yet known, revealed that an astonishing number of these Goddess figurines were found in the midden. The rubbish dump is an unlikely venue for religious observance, which renders dubious the proposition that figurines, even female ones, were necessarily affiliated with Goddess worship. Gimbutas\u2019 enthusiasms have been substantially tempered by a number of researchers. A short introduction can be seen  here . Scholarly rebuttals of the Goddess/Wicca paradigm can be found in the following references: Cynthia Eller\u2019s, The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why an Invented Past Will Not Give Women a Future, Ronald Hutton\u2019s, The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft and Philip G. Davis\u2019, Goddess Unmasked: The Rise of Neopagan Feminist Spirituality. So there never was a golden age of the feminine and what of it? Cosma Shalizi in her wonderful  review  of Ancient Goddesses - The Myths and the Evidence edited by Lucy Goodison and Christine Morris, writes: \u201cThree features make it objectionable. In the first place, it distorts our vision of the past, which is always bad in itself. Second, it isn't even good feminist tactics, since people are perfectly free, like Bachofen, to accept its factual claims, but reject the values, and say that the societies which replaced those which worshipped the Goddess were infinitely superior; a Christian or Muslim fundamentalist could go further and say that She was just Satan in drag. Thirdly, it's simply absurd to proceed as though the way some of our ancestors happened to live a few thousand years ago fixes the way we ought to live now and in the future.\u201d McPhillip may choose to be offended on Dr Christ\u2019s behalf, but it is abundantly clear that Dr Christ, quite apart from advertising myth as fact, supports a theology that is far removed from Christianity and was quite accurately summed as pagan by the Catholic Church hierarchy. She  writes : \u201cimmortality as a focus in religion, removes us from this world which is our true home, and from our moral responsibilities within this world. And if we think of ourselves as being involved in a cosmic process of birth, death and regeneration, I don\u2019t see a problem with all life being finite, including my own.\u201d Exit the Christ, redemption, original sin and any other article of Christian faith. Enter a mythology of stultifying superficiality, the Deity rendered impotent and fashioned in Woman\u2019s own image. At the outset Dr Christ  opines : \u201cI think the picture that almost everyone in our culture has in their minds when they hear the word \u2018God\u2019, is an old man with a long white beard. Now they may quickly said \u201cI didn\u2019t really think God is like that\u201d, but I think that image comes to mind for almost all of us, and it\u2019s very important to shatter that image, and the only way we can shatter that image I believe, is by affirming images of the divine as female.\u201d And of course it is of paramount importance that God is seen as She, because, according to standard feminist theological doctrine, it is an inability to recognise the feminine aspect of the divine that has resulted in the subjugation of the female through the ages. There is no evidence given for this and never a mention of the status of women prior to the advent of the Judaeo/Christian/Islamic traditions, nor the proper reading of the New Testament, which must have been remarkable in its day for daring to say that in the eyes of God, men and women are equal. Note that dualism is to be deplored in every guise except when it comes to the nature of the divine, and here it is a falsity. There is no gender in the divine. Much is made by Dr Christ and others of the  attractiveness of \u2018change\u2019  in process theology. \u201cprocess philosophy is a philosophy that affirms changing lives, and for me that often means \u201clife in the body\u201d \u2026\u2026.And I think that in affirming change is a major departure from much of Western philosophy and theology, and I think it has very important consequences for women, because in Western philosophy, women have been identified with the changing body and the changing body in nature have been viewed as less than the immortal realm of God and the rational mind of men.\u201d Change is seen as synonymous with liberation. The immutability of the divine is interpreted as imposing shackles. In the words of Dr McPhillip, \u201ccreation is a process of constant transformation and is not fixed to eternal laws of truth.\u201d The very notion of an external law is merely symptomatic of the earth dominance paradigm of the rationalist masculine mind. This is not just a very superficial and inaccurate reading of Christianity, since the primary Biblical exhortation is \u2018be ye perfect\u2019 an entirely transformative (emphasis on change) exercise. What process theology is holding out is an appeal to be a part of a vibrant dynamic something. The question is what is the nature of that something? Is it synonymous with \u2018life in the body\u2019 meaning corporeal changes like ageing, the passing seasons or recycling the atoms ? Does it get any deeper than that because if not, it seems that the promise falls short of the reality? It is worthwhile considering the number of other changes that must be made to standard doctrine in order to have our Deity embedded in the process of creativity. As discussed above, immutability has to go. But that\u2019s not all. It is axiomatic that being in the process means a loss of control over the whole proceedings Therefore this Deity is not omnipotent. As part of the process, and controlled by that process, foreknowledge of the outcomes is impossible so omniscience also has to go. The Deity we are now left with is hardly worthy of the title. If there are process theologians in Christian denominations, their predicament must be very similar to the clergy enamoured of libertarian zeal described by C S Lewis in Fern Seed and Elephants [2]. He wrote of the likely effect of these avant garde thinkers on the average church goer. \u201cWhat you offer him he will not recognize as Christianity. If he holds to what he calls Christianity he will leave a church in which it is no longer taught and look for one where it is. If he agrees with your version he will no longer call himself a Christian and no longer come to church. In his crude coarse way, he would respect you much more if you did the same.\u201d Tacked on to the notion that change equals liberation in feminist process theology is the idea that process is the springboard to creativity, but note the form that this takes. Dr Lois Gehr Livezey  writes : \u201ccreativity should be understood not in terms of construction or making (the potter and clay image) but in terms of emergence from a social and bodily matrix to which it is responsive even as it is also unique and something new.\u201d The emergence of \u2018something unique and new\u2019 from a social matrix is not a particularly new idea. In the nascent pseudo-academic field of memetics, Dr Liane Gabora  hypothesised  that creativity has two elements and that \u201c in a sense, culture embodies the best of both worlds; that is, each individual\u2019s depth-first stream of thought is embedded in a highly parallel, relatively breadth-first social matrix which provides a second, outer tier of convergent pressure.\u201d It is not in the nature of social matrices to promote creativity of any variety, quite the opposite. Creativity means something new, that is, different from the norm and difference, because it disturbs the even fabric of the social matrix, is not to be encouraged. The general reaction of any social grouping to the unfamiliar is to enforce the status quo and that means a general bowing to conformity. Why feminists of all persuasions seek a creativity based on the perceived relational superiority of women is both mystifying and disturbing, since the basic assumption is that only men are intrinsically capable of creativity \u2018in terms of construction\u2019. Thematic throughout Dr Christ\u2019s writings, feminist theology and eco-feminism as a whole is the divine crusade to save the planet from the rapine of circa 5000 years of patriarchal dominance and destruction and return it to the nurture of those who can think holistically - females, naturally. The social and relational with intuition (default feminine) is pitted against the individual with reductive rationalism (default masculine). That these settings are necessarily false doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone. It is axiomatic that the intuitive will triumph over the rational because there is some mystical link between women and Nature. The argument goes that women are more nurturing and their more inclusive, experiential and holistic ways of thinking are naturally a huge advantage in understanding ecology. It is, however, a simplistic proposition in the extreme to suppose that inclusive, nurturing holistic and experiential ways can be an adequate substitute for garnering the knowledge of the depth and complexity required to wisely manage a planet-wide ecosystem. It\u2019s advanced chemistry, physics, biology and computer modelling you need to even begin to address the complexities of ecosystems, not an affinity with the earth mother. Gross and Levitt in the aptly title Higher Superstitions view this irrationalism as follows [3]. \u201c The threat of ecotopian enthusiasms is that they will, in fact and in the long road, weaken or eliminate the possibility of ecologically sound social policy, under whatever ideological banner that may materialize. We believe that such an effect must follow from the fervent antiscientism now embraced by radical environmentalists, an antiscientism that, if broadly influential, cannot fail to reduce the chances of success in answering questions and solving problems that are quintessentially scientific.\u201d The fundamental problem of Dr Christ\u2019s ideology and process theology is the offering of what is essentially false coin. It all looks very pretty, but there\u2019s precious little depth to it. Embrace the divinity as She and commit to the Gnostic heresy of advanced navel gazing. Be attuned to this so much more approachable deity, who\u2019s in the process as much as you are and lose the very reason for having truck with a deity in the first place. Become more earth-centric and ecologically sensitive but hold in contempt the know-how required to avoid becoming an ecological menace. Rejoice in being part of the vibrant dynamic, the very epicentre of creativity, and fail to notice that nothing of real change or creativity is happening because the illusion requires far less energy than the real thing. Messrs Pell and Jensen as industrious shepherds no doubt had the best of intentions in shielding their flocks from the newage of Dr Carol Christ. They would have done far better to allow the lecture, insist on a lengthy question and answer session and sent along a few Jesuits. Endnotes and book references 1. The word Wica as originally conceived by Gerald Gardiner meant \u2018wise\u2019 and the witches of legend were nothing more that wise women, not the devil-worshippers of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. The story goes that the world became a dangerous place for these wise women, who were persecuted mercilessly. Nine million of them perished during the \u2018burning times\u2019 of mediaeval and renaissance witch hunting, victim to the evil patriarchy that was threatened by the knowledge and independence of these women. As with other fractoids (fractured facts) of the radical feminist credo, this too is a dud. Witch hunts there were indeed but the numbers executed were between 30,000 and 50, 000. That\u2019s a lot of unnecessary deaths, but there\u2019s no need to blame a hegemonic patriarchy. It turns out that the victims weren\u2019t the strong and independent wise women such as herbalists and midwives. They were the elderly, the solitary and the strange, and 25% of them were men. Their accusers were in most cases, other women. 2. C.S. Lewis, Fern-Seed and Elephants p 105, Collins, Glasgow, 1980. 3.

Since the Sydney Morning Herald has only a short free viewing period for articles, Dr McPhillip's artcle is given here in full. God's feminine side is still fighting for recognition March 11, 2005 The Catholic Church operates like a men-only club, writes Kathleen McPhillips. Last weekend the hierarchy of the Catholic Church intervened to block a lecture by the renowned feminist scholar Dr Carol Christ from being given on church property. The move was not wholly unexpected, given the conservative nature of Cardinal George Pell's governance of Catholic culture in Sydney. While the pragmatic issue of finding another venue has been solved, the issue of Pell's authoritarian style is more difficult. It continues unabated for two major reasons. The first is that the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church allows a small group of celibate men to exercise ideological control; the second is that there are so few declared intellectual responses within the Church to Pell's theological stance to foster dialogue. One function of theology should be to challenge orthodoxy and to encourage a dynamic interpretation of faith and culture. In this context, the censorship of Dr Christ is a concern. What danger does Dr Christ present to the Catholic hierarchy? Is it because she suggests that the image of God as exclusively male does not and cannot reflect women's experience of the divine? Is it because she knows that in many societies the divine has been represented by the feminine? Is it because she argues that the continuing abuse of women's bodies is related to an exclusive male pantheon? Are these such radical and dangerous ideas that they have to be quashed? That they are exposes a church that shores itself up by conformity rather than making a convincing case for Christianity. So what is the nature of Pell's censorship? It represses free speech, debate and rational argument which are the hallmarks of understanding, diversity and intellectual rigour. Theology is immensely broad, with a magnitude of ideas and debates, making a significant contribution to understanding faith in the modern world. Why should this be restricted? The statement banning Dr Christ from giving her address reads that \"it would be inappropriate for a talk promoting Goddess worship and pagan spiritualities as an alternative to the basic tenets of the Christian faith\". This is a misreading of her work and indicates that the decision to ban her is not based on an informed reading of her book, She Who Changes, the subject of her lecture. This work is a critical engagement with process theology, the basic tenets of which hold that creation is a process of constant transformation and is not fixed to eternal laws of truth. Originally argued by the theologian Charles Hartshorne, this view suggests that we can never fully know God because our understandings are constrained by the brevity and nature of our existence. We are a small part of a larger whole, and history shows that our ideas of God change constantly according to cultural, geographical and historical contexts. Dr Christ takes these ideas into a feminist arena, arguing that it is only in the West over the past few thousand years that God has been exclusively imagined as male. One of the roles of feminist theology is to shatter this theological mistake and allow the divine to be imagined in the multiple ways in which God/Goddess is experienced by humanity. As a feminist theologian Dr Christ is only too aware that religions such as Christianity, which portray God as male, are damaging to women; hence the low status of women in the major religions. What can be so radical about the suggestion that we could conceive of God in a feminine form? Plenty of theologians have suggested this before. It can only be a dangerous statement to a patriarchal church. And in that sense it becomes a radical statement.Kathleen McPhillips is a senior lecturer in humanities at the University of Western Sydney. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/news/Opinion/Gods-feminine-side-is-still-fighting-for-recognition/2005/03/10/1110417616090.html", "http://www.newdimensions.org/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=ND&Product_Code=2688", "http://www.goddessariadne.org/carolwords.htm", "http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/ancient-goddesses/", "http://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0156.htm", "http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/ancient-goddesses/", "http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/relrpt/stories/s1319351.htm", "http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/relrpt/stories/s1319351.htm", "http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/relrpt/stories/s1319351.htm", "http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2744", "http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/liane/PAPERS00/ces/beercan.htm"], "link": "http://alyric.blogspot.com/2005/04/il-papa-vs-goddess.html", "title": "\n                      \t \n                      \t Il Papa vs The Goddess\n\t                       \n                          "}
