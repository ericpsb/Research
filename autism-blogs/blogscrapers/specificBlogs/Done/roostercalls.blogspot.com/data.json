I called it out, he wrote it down, then he looked up at me and said, \"disorder, like when you have Asperger's Syndrome or autism.\" Then he wrote: not in order. This time, my chest knocked a bit, and I needed a big yoga breath. \n \n\"Yes, when you have a disorder, you might learn things in your own order. Just like you learn lots of things differently than the way I do. You learn them! Sometimes you learn them sooner than I do, and sometimes you learn that later, but you certainly learn them in the order that's right for you!\" \n \nToday is IEP day. I feel so tempted to tell the school exactly how I'd define their  IEP . When we got the notification last week, it looked different, and it said they were required to let us know that they would be requesting a change in eligibility, to emotionally disturbed. Naturally, I felt confused, and upset. With shaking hands I called the school, and I was told, \"Really? Ooops, that was just a clerical error. We don't send our own forms any more, some secretary in another office does them and she makes mistakes.\" Sometimes I have an urge to tell my son he does not have a disorder, that everyone in the world has their own order to things, and sometimes it is all I can do to resist telling him it seems to me his educational system and his school are in disorder, while he is perfectly fine just the way he is. But I realize that saying this would not serve us well. \n \nThe class can move along to \"disorder\" if they must, We are just going to concentrate on beautiful.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2014/09/too-much-homework.html", "title": "\nToo Much Homework\n"},

My experience with autism is very hard. I tend to do strange things. I tend to talk about strange things that no one wants to talk about. Autism makes it hard to make friends. Autism does not make families sad, it makes them happy to have their own special kid in their life. Autism does not make people\u2019s lives too hard, it makes their lives lighten up a little bit. They can be proud how much their kids are learning and how they are managing life with autism.

{"date": "Friday, June 21, 2013", "body": "\nRight now I am imagining someone just stumbled on this blog. \n \nThis new reader knows a child who sounds like my Rooster did several years ago. Reader wants to know... how have the recent years been for Rooster? \n \nOf course, Rooster is a case of one, and the child Reader knows might have a very different path, or a similar one... we all have unique journeys. \n \nBut I was once like this Reader, and I found similar stories to my own, and wanted to connect. \n \nSo, Reader, if you know Rooster and his family (my husband, J; my daughter, Peaches; and myself) struggled substantially through the difficult years when he was diagnosed with autism and began school, let me tell you a little about our trajectory from then to now, the summer before fourth grade. But I will work backward. \n \nAs I type, my kids are pretending to run a dance studio. Peaches, who happens to be typical, plans, naturally, to be the star. She has hired her brother to be her bodyguard, dressing him in almost all black, including the large, oversized shades. The one exception is the pink and green bow tie she insists he wears. She pays him from her piggy bank, knowing he is motivated, as he is saving to get his own talking toy like the one she purchased from her savings. Today, the toy that has a voice I found grating, came on in the other room. Rooster told Peaches, \"I think you are neglecting your toy. Clearly she needs more attention.\" \n \nRooster's sister is his most accepting and inclusive playmate, though they fight like siblings do. Looking back, finding friends has been the hardest part of our journey with autism. They are few and far between, but there ARE friends, and they are rare treasures. Rooster still has unusual expressive language. He still processes slowly, has somewhat restrictive interests, and can melt down. However, the fears I had that he would never take turns, share, express empathy, engage in imaginative play, or sustain a conversation proved unfounded. I would have loved him with all my heart no matter how he developed, but he has continued to show me that he is full of surprises of many kinds, and while he is on his own unique path, it's a path of certain growth.  \n \nRooster continues to struggle academically. He has dyscalculia, a math disability, and ADHD, in addition to autism. He needs an aide in the general ed classroom, and a resource support and a gifted ed therapist for math. Reading appears to be his greatest gift, and today we will go to the library to wallow in the wonders of words. Our family shares a deep, abiding joy in books. \n \nIf, Reader,\u00a0 you are wondering what tools have proven most useful to our boy over the years, my opinion is that we benefited tremendously from (not in this order necessarily, except the first one, which has been, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the key that unlocked all the other resources time and time again): \n \n \n the blogosphere (other blogging families have been virtually lifesavers) \n families we have met in waiting rooms and autism meet-ups  \n social stories \n ABA \n gfcf diet (NEVER in my wildest dreams would I ever have believed that until we tried it) \n time, patience, hope, love \n \nI have said it before and I will say it again: doctors never provided us much value, despite going to the ones with the best reputations and highest bills. From general pediatricians to a variety of specialists, their advice and tools were mostly mediocre and sometimes wrong, painful, and detrimental. We do have a good developmental pediatrician now, but the best doctor we have ever seen is the one whose doctoral program focused on special education, not medicine. Other things I wish we had skipped: speech therapists provided by schools, ADHD medicine (we did a few trial runs before realizing they were NOT right for our Rooster), and osteopathy. We would never advise others against anything (see the unique path philosophy above), they just didn't fit our needs. \n \nNow, if you will excuse me, I need to check on the bodyguard and the diva, and get us ready to pick up some amazing stories in the library. Amazing stories are like life blood for this Roostery clan.\u00a0  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2013/06/where-are-they-ahem-we-now.html", "title": "\nWhere Are They (Ahem, We) Now? \n"},

Halfway grown, going in to fourth grade. For the better part of two decades I worked in a school that held K-3 in one building and grades 4-6 in another, so I always thought fourth grade meant \"big kid.\"\u00a0  \n \nI'm forty-one, I've lived close to half the length of my grandparents' lives. They were my heroes and I miss them.  \n \nMy daughter turned just turned seven.\u00a0 My grandma has been gone now more than half my little girl's life, and she never met my grandpa.  \n \nIn a year my son will be the age I was when my father left my family for good. Unthinkable to leave my babies... and they are still, for sure, my babies.\u00a0  \n \nIn college I dated a boy who made the mistake of wondering aloud what if we got married? I laughed without thinking and hurt him when I said I had no intention of getting married, and certainly not so young. He married the next girl he dated, and now has a son about to go off to college. I see his son's photo on Facebook and cannot grasp it. At all. \n \nThis weekend my husband and I will celebrate eleven years of marriage and thirteen years as a couple. He looks, to me, pretty darn close to the way he looked the day I met him. Okay, so he's a little bit cuter now. But he was plenty cute then, beautiful enough in looks and in spirit, that I thought, ever since the night we met, he might be the perfect person at the perfect time to ask me, \"What if we got married?\"  \n \nAnd when he did ask me? You know I couldn't trust that much goodness without double checking it, and so I negotiated, and I said, \"You know I want kids, right? You know I want more than just one, right? You know I'm complicated... \" And he told me, as he has since the beginning, \"Oh, I know all about you...\" And he does. And he told me, as he has since the beginning, \"Why don't you just let yourself enjoy the happiness? It's okay! Let's enjoy it together!\" \n \nJ has always said, \"Enjoy the vigor of your youth! Enjoy your vigors! You will never be younger than you are today!\"J has always said it's okay to be happy, and he has always offered to hold my hand if being happy scares me too much.  \n \nIn our early days, we used to hang out in front of mirrors and smile at the reflection of our arms around one another, the way we kind of resembled one another in a way, and how we could never stop radiating our joy at finding one another. We held hands as we walked ourselves down the aisle. \n \nNow we sit and marvel that we aren't those young twenty-somethings anymore, as we exchange neck rubs and swap complaints about our aches and pains. It can look, for all the world, like I'm disgruntled. I totally get that. I can appear ungrateful and negative and very, very tired.  \n \nBecause it's been nine long years helping our son navigate autism, asthma, ADHD, ocular torticollis, night terrors, and food allergies.

I get that, I really do.  \n \n(Recently I stumbled across a blog post by someone all full of self-righteous indignation toward Glennon, taking her to task for not wanting to be all cheerily carpe diem 24/7/365.

As our families and our \ncommunity discusses this issue and tries to find a reason for this \nheartbreaking tragedy, I feel that it is very important to remember the \nfollowing:  There is no connection between planned, violent behavior and an autism spectrum diagnosis of any kind.  \n \nAutism is not a mental illness; it is a developmental disability. Many \nautistic people may have emotional regulation problems, which are \nimpulsive expressions of frustration and anger, that are immediate and \ndisorganized. They may lash out with threatening statements or \nbehaviors, but these behaviors are impulsive reactions, they are not \ndeliberate or organized plans. Once the situation has been diffused, the\n behaviors will stop. What happened in Connecticut required methodical \nplanning of a deliberate and tremendously violent act; this is not \ntypical behavior of an autistic person. \n \nRight now we are all struggling to find a reason why this kind of \natrocity would happen, and we can speculate about the mental state of \nthe shooter; about gun control laws; about the current state of our \ncountry\u2019s mental health system, or about whatever else that might help \nus make some sense out of this. Please know, and please tell your \nchildren, that even if the shooter  was  autistic, autism is not the explanation for this tragedy. \n \nIf anybody has any questions about autism, please do not hesitate to contact me. \n \nThank you very much for your time, \n \nJill \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-connecticut-tragedy-and-autism.html"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2012/12/why.html", "title": "\nWhy?\n"},

For a while now I've been realizing and considering the significance of this truth -- that I have exactly what I asked for -- but to see it in my own handwriting really illustrates that reality in a more effective way for activating my sense of gratitude. \n \nJournals are so last decade!

{"date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2012", "body": "\nIn June, I lost a friend. \n \nI say friend, though he might have called me a \"colleague.\" In fact, many nights I'd come home and ask my husband, \"How do you think I can get C to hang out with us outside work?\" I sort of mildly stalked him online a bit via LinkedIn and Google to learn more about his work and ideas. And, invariably, I would end up saying to J, \"You will love him. He's a genius!\" \n \nC had this way of making everyone who ever worked with him want to be his friend. I knew this from the first day I met him, but it was irrefutable once he died. Everyone had a story about the way C could make people feel special, cared about, and heard, even though he somehow also managed to keep us all at a little bit of a distance. I am not sure any of us \"colleagues\" who revered C got to be the kind of friends who he'd hang out with outside of work. \n \nI do know that we were crushed when he killed himself. Person after person spoke the day we gathered to remember him and used the word \"light\" to describe C. When I called my husband, who had never met C, he'd heard enough about him that he immediately gasped and said, \"Not C! Why?\" \n \nLet me be 100 percent clear: I do not know why C chose to die. I do, though, I fear that I suspect it.  \n \nI fear it when my son is teased for his autistic traits. I fear it when my daughter worries about her appearance. I fear it when kids I teach roll their eyes at a classmate for anything that makes them different. \n \nC didn't have autism. He had such an incredibly handsome face that, when he smiled, as he almost always did, I found myself thinking that he was the first man I'd describe as \"radiant.\" And, smart? Don't get me started. C didn't seem, in any overt way, \"different.\" What terrifies me is that I think he felt different. On the inside. I am scared that every time our mutual work involved learning about oppression, discrimination, and genocide, he felt a deep resonance and fear of his own differences. \n \nI feel guilty telling C's story, or my take on it, even now that he is gone, because one instinct tells me it is none of my business. Yet another tells me it should have been, and should still be, my business to use the powerful tool of storytelling to reach out to C, to you, to anyone and everyone, and say: We are ALL different, and we are ALL the same. We are unique, and we are people. We should not live with a fear of differences, only of fear. \n \nI do not know if C suffered any abuse in his life; it's hard to imagine it because I knew him as a big, strong, successful, sought-out, professional, but whether his personal life or background told a very different story, or whether he perceived himself or his life very differently, I am not privy to know.  \n \nI do not know why C is gone. It makes me sad and angry. And sad. Did I mention angry? There is not much I can do with my sadness or my anger except blog, and so that is why I am telling you. \n \nWhen we tease, when we ridicule, when we roll our eyes, and when we denigrate, we risk hurting the human victims of our abuse, and sending a message to every onlooker that they could be next. When we tease, ridicule, denigrate, we risk destroying the genius that our world needs, and we risk extinguishing radiant light. We risk leaving ourselves very dark and very sad. \n \nI want better for all our children.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-candle-memory.html", "title": "\nA Candle, A Memory \n"},

In fact, on my next birthday, I plan to wish on the candle (I only allow one - I don't want to set off the smoke alarm) that my family celebrates hundreds more birthdays, very happy ones, but without the parties that make me so inclined to open up a bloggy vein and weep. Next month, my delightful and complicated boy will turn eight, and I thought I had cleverly sold him on the idea of celebrating with his adoring family at an overpriced amusement park, eating Z Pizza and gorging on allergy-free cake. But his sister insisted on a party this year -- two weeks ago -- and even though we arranged a boys' day out for him so she could revel in girly paradise with her friends over mani/pedis, now nothing will do for him but a party of his own. And I must admit to you the awful truth. I. Cannot. Do. It. For the first time in 14 birthdays between them, I am foisting the festivity on their dad. It's not just that I'm too tired, though I am weary to the bone. To the bone, I tell you. To the marrow. It's not just that it feels only fair that daddy take a turn, since his usual contribution is pretty much lighting the candles and trying to pretend he can remember people's names. It's that I can't bear the fact that my son's classmates won't want to come to his party. There are worse problems. I can count with deep appreciation so very many blessings: that we have two amazing kids who are here to have birthdays, that we live in a beautiful and peaceful place, that we can afford to throw them a party, that we have people who love us. But for me, loving my kids means wanting people to see the good in them, including wanting them to have friends. I don't really know if Rooster has friends at his school. I know he has enemies. I know he has people who tolerate him. I know he has frequent conflicts. But I don't know if he has friends. And this year, it makes me sad. It makes me especially sad as my husband pays the park rental fee and tries to make a celebratory plan. It makes me sad because I don't know if anyone will show up.

She tries every combination her rattled mind can make using the word autism, until it's too late to sleep and too early to rise, but never finds her way in any clear directions. So much for a degree in tech.  I want to reach her and tell her that the reason none of those digital pages have any answers is that the answers are just down the hall, where her son is in his bed. He is the answer, himself, to the question: Who is my child? Where is my child? He has been her question and her answer, and she should rest easy knowing that nothing anyone else ever says or does will change that he is her beautiful boy. I cannot go back and help myself, when I was that woman trembling in the face of a word -- autism -- and the fear that the word was enough to destroy a family's hopes and dreams. But I sit now in front of my computer, determined to find some path to other mothers, other fathers, who sit in front of their computers in despair; determined to tell them, I know, I know, I know. Hope, hope, hope. Sleep, sleep, sleep. Your child is your child. Autism is just a word.

Having the world's most talented educational therapist who also is gifted at ABA. Yesterday my son was working with the genius S, his ed therapist, on math, his nemesis. But it wasn't his complete lack of number sense troubling him. \"We ran straight into his diagnosis today,\" S told me. He got very rigid about a set of directions, and he became extremely agitated because he thought he was going to be able to write a story, and then it turned out he was actually working with word problems. Perseveration, anxiety, impulsivity -- wham. At the end of the session, S told me something like: Sure, we didn't get as much math covered as I would like, and as an ed therapist, that could bother me. But as a behaviorist, oh my gosh, this was big. He learned how to stomp through something, to stick with it, to calm himself down when he was in sensory overload. He got through the work! That is a big deal. I am so proud of him, and I want him to know that being able to do that is important. When Roo finishes all his work and does it calmly, he gets a reward. He definitely lost his cool for part of the time, and he didn't finish everything. I was tempted to give him the reward anyway for trying so hard. But together we decided that he would get a reward -- just not the same reward he gets when he finishes all his work calmly. Instead, I took him to the library to get a card and check out 10 books. He tried to talk me into both rewards, but when I talked him through it, he sighed deeply and put his hand on my cheek. \"Okay, mommy. Next time, I want BOTH prizes. Now, let's go get some BOOOOOKS!\" I love that kid.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2012/04/learning.html", "title": "\nLearning\n"},

Seriously, this is priceless advice. See, we had our IEP today, and given the fraudulent and unscrupulous treatment our family has received previously, I went in with low expectations and high preparations. Three hours later, my husband and I emerged, weary, but satisfied, to drive to our separate jobs. I called him from my car. \"I just wanted to say that we did a good job for our boy today,\" I told him. Then I said something like, \"I felt like our concerns and our son's needs were taken seriously today. I felt like the people in the room understand now that they can't mess with us and expect us to tolerate less than our rights. And you handled yourself very well.\" And my sweet and wonderful husband laughed in a way that told me he had a story to share. He asked me if I had noticed his notebook. I had seen it - I noticed he took careful notes, but I didn't read them, as I busily wrote my own notes. \"Why?\" I asked. Just before the meeting began, he explained, he had grabbed his pen and scribbled a named in large letters on his pad. Underneath, he wrote a phone number. Then he casually left the writing in plain site for the duration of the marathon. I mean meeting. The name? On his notebook? The name was of the attorney made famous in these parts over the last four decades for representing people with special needs, and successfully fighting to ensure that private and governmental agencies provide the services to which they are entitled by law. No one has fought harder or to greater avail to ensure compliance with IDEA, ADA, or the Lanternman Act, that this woman. She pretty much calls the district on their shameful acts, makes them straighten up and fly right, then sends them a hefty bill for her hard work, and says, \"You're welcome.\" She says to the world: You will not abuse or neglect the vulnerable and the innocent. I think she probably has a fan club, and I would like to join it. My husband never threatened legal action with my son's current school or district (yet), though parties withing the district have admitted to actions that would likely justify it; it didn't (yet) seem to be in Rooster's best interests, and right now, what is best for our boy is our top priority. Nothing is off the table - we just want what is right and what is fair, and we are committed to do what we need to for our adorable Rooster.

{"date": "Saturday, March 24, 2012", "body": "\nI asked a woman recently to describe a time she thought she dealt well with an interpersonal conflict. She said that once she had to deal with a special needs parent. She told the parent what needed to happen for the child but the stubborn parent wouldn't listen to her. Something happened to my ears. Only for a minute, but it was surreal. Have you ever had this happen? My ears picked up an entirely different channel. For a minute, I could not hear this woman's story, which had started to demonstrate serious flaws in her reasoning and judgment. Instead, my ears picked up on a drum circle. And a hazy radio signal that was going in and out of channels. I refocused. Once again I could hear the interviewee tell me how this unreasonable parent had wanted her child to have \"special\" treatment and how that isn't fair to the regular kids, and I saw her catch herself and realize to some degree her answer was not a good one. It wasn't linear, coherent, or applicable, and it didn't demonstrate empathy or skills. I was clear as a bell as I watched the woman reframe and ramble back toward a semblance of an answer. There were other, good conversations with different people that day, and in the days that followed, and never once did my ears do that funny thing again. I wondered what had happened to me for that minute. Was I going crazy, hallucinating drums and hearing voices? Should I talk to my doctor about my ears? Then, even more recently, I listened to people talk about a new movie that is coming out, a movie that is supposed to be funny. In fact, my husband's work even has a connection to this film, so I was listening carefully when the autistic jokes ensued. My ears did that crazy business again. Oh, wait. It isn't drums. Wait! I figured it out. That is my heart. It beats loudly, into my ears, sometimes when my feelings become so big and crash so loudly on the shores of my being that I am too flooded for words. Usually somewhat articulate, when my system short circuits like this, I can't speak or hear momentarily, and I think my automatic response is to try to hear all the little voices inside me -- thus, the static of the untuned radio. I am a firm believer in non-violence. I hate weapons. Sometimes words are weapons, though, and sometimes they feel like sticks and stones. This thing my ears do? That is what I call self-defense. Not the kind of self-defense claimed in the news lately, used to justify murdering an innocent child. No, this is the self-defense against verbal attacks against innocent children. I don't want to fix this thing that happens with my ears. I want to market it.

So he calls me from the store today, and it goes like this. \"Hey, honey,\" he says. \"I heard you say we needed bread for the Rooster so I stopped at the store to get it. Do you need anything else?\" \"Oh, thanks, J. No, I just really needed the bread.

{"date": "Sunday, March 4, 2012", "body": "\nToday, I was six years old. We all are sometimes, but today transported me to a very particular summer day at a campground in Virginia in ways that have me once again staring, mystified, at the concentric circles of life and family.  I am at the playground, granted permission by my mother to play unsupervised until lunch time, when I will make my way back down the winding lane to our 40-foot-long air-conditioned \"camper\" where she is watching television as she cooks. Only the girl playing on the merry-go-round tells me she has the Barbie Dream House (the one with the elevator) that my mother refuses to get for me. The next thing I know, my father is angrily retrieving me from the girl's Jet Stream, dragging me back to our site, where my mother abandoned her mini-television a few hours ago and has locked herself in our station wagon to rock, somewhat-catatonic, back and forth, hugging herself. It seems lunch came and went but I did not, and the men had begun to discuss searching the water, calling the sheriff. She sees me through the window and moans and moans as my father opens the car and pushes me into it, into my mother's rocking.  If she never entirely forgave me, I get it now. I get it in a way I wish I didn't.  The situations are entirely different, and exactly the same. My mother believed in benign neglect, and in the 1970s I had free reign of a large campground from the time I started kindergarten. Today, driving to the park, I explained to my daughter that she had to be where she could see me at all times, because last time at the park I got nervous when she played hide-and-seek with her friends too close to the busy urban streets and the crowded parking lot filled with strangers. I do not so much as leave her in our own front yard unattended.  But when I turned around and found the backseat of my Prius empty today, maybe three minutes after parking and gathering our gear, I knew my mother's heart in the back of that old station wagon. When I forced my brain to accept that, indeed, my child had suddenly vanished, and I was not asleep, having an illogical dream, many thoughts pin-balled through my head all at one time, none too productive: Had I, when adjusting my parking in the space to get maximum shade, run over my child as she silently slipped from the car? Four times I bent and peered under my vehicle, pointlessly. Had she, as a joke, hidden in the far back of the Prius, under our earthquake blanket? Thrice I flung around the blanket. Did the car next to us grab her just before pulling away? WAS SHE PULLING A STUNT? Did she head for swings, to the left? To the playground, to the right? To the stores, behind us? IF SHE DID I WAS GOING TO PUNISH HER LIKE SHE'D NEVER FORGET. Where was her school's event, the reason that we came to the park? Should I go look for it? But what if she came back? How many minutes had it been already? Why hadn't I agreed to bring my husband and son? Why were there no police nearby? Why were there so many people nearby? Why were there so many tragedies in the news lately? Why hadn't I been paying closer attention? How did she shut the door without my notice? Had I zoned out? Had I .... had I? Lost my mind?  And the whole time, my scream: PEACHES! PEACHES! PEACHES! It wasn't a call, it wasn't a question mark, it was an exclamation each time, unmistakable terror tinging the edges. It was my mother, rocking.  After at least five minutes, a pink blob comes into focus, quickly cresting the hill toward the parking lot, and I become certain over slow, drawn out moments you could count on your fingers that a little girl needs one tremendous, gigantic, enormous punishment for torturing me, for abandoning me in a station wagon, borderline catatonic.  She is so sorry, so sorry, so very sorry, when she sees my face. She had followed friends to play, she cries, only to realize she'd gone without me when another classmate arrived and announced, \"There is a mommy in the parking lot yelling PEACHES, PEACHES!\"  She sits in the grass where I have crumpled and begs me to be happy again, to take her home, to forgive her. I am fury, I am fear, I am forgiveness, and as much as I want to punish and shake her til her teeth rattle, I simply talk, and kiss her, and tell her she has to stay where she can see me, where she can see me, where she can see me, like I told her, like I told her, like I told her. I tell her most of the people in the world are good, but that I was so scared, so scared, that someone not good had taken her, or that she had walked behind a driver who could not see her little body. Her little body.  I do not tell her I had done the same thing at almost her exact same age. I do not tell her that all I had wanted today was to go to this typical school event and do our best to fit in some and connect a little and get some volunteer hours and not stick out overmuch for once. I do not tell her that I know exactly how she feels -- sorry, guilty, responsible, scared, vulnerable -- that I know exactly how my mother felt -- sorry, guilty, responsible, scared, vulnerable.  We dust ourselves off slowly, and walk back down the hill, around the corner, to raise money for her charter school, running laps along with everyone else, but not really.  This post, this day, these experiences and feelings, had nothing to do with autism, only that is never really true.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2012/03/thinking-of-sandra-cisneros-again.html", "title": "\nThinking of Sandra Cisneros Again\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "body": "\nRight now, my son is sitting on the sofa with an apple in his hand listening to Greek mythology on the iPad. He will be eight in about three months, and he has autism.  Right now, my daughter is in the bath tub playing with toys. From my spot in my bedroom, I can see her through the French door to the master bath, talking to herself, acting out some kind of scene. She will be six next month.  Today I really liked it when some of the mama's I adore in the blogosphere posted this on facebook: \"It's hard having an autistic child. It's even harder being an autistic child.\" I think it's true and valid. I feel like I could see my son posting it when he's old enough, if fb is still around in another five or six years.  I also think it's valid to post this: \"It's hard being an autistic child. It's even harder having an autistic child.\" It might seem impossible to think both are true, or it might make me sound obnoxious to say it. But that's okay. I also liked it that some friends posted this Dr. Seuss quote: \"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.\"  When it comes to the question of autism's difficulty, what I feel is this: it's all about perspective, this life of ours, and along with it, this business of \"harder.\" After all, can you really compare? Is suffering really measurable? How many of you believe that those pain-o-meter pictures in the hospital that ask you how to quantify your distress really mean that the doctor understands what you are going through when you tell him you are at level 3 or 5 or 7?  I can't speak for my son, who has autism, about how hard his life is or isn't, from his perspective or my own. I can't really compare my challenges to his. But I value the reminder in the facebook post that he very well might have the perspective that autism is harder for him than it is for me. I know that there are days his sister would likely argue it's no walk in the park for her, either, that her brother has autism, and I think she'd have a valid point, a right to her perspective and to some kind of fb quote all her own. I'm okay with anyone who wants to say they have it rough, who want us to know their perspective on how hard things are. Difficulties come on a spectrum. I'd argue, too, that there could be a lot worse things in our lives than having autism in it. One would be not having autism in it, if it meant that there would not be a little boy sitting on the sofa with an apple in his hand listening to Greek mythology. Things at our house seem pretty hard through some looking glasses. But warm baths and juicy apples and learning and imaginative play and love look pretty beautiful too. I know my mama friends would agree with this without even asking them. I just saw yet another quote on fb that resonates for me, and with this post, and so I will leave you with that: \"Feelings are much like waves, we can't stop them from coming but we can choose which one to surf.\"  Thanks, friends.

{"date": "Saturday, December 31, 2011", "body": "\nI have not jogged much in recent months, given the longer hours and seemingly endless commute of my new job, and the shorter days  and busier weekends of winter. The other day, thanks to vacation, I found myself on a treadmill, and I saw all kinds of symbolism in it. Humor me.  Completely out of shape, I set the bar low, the time for a half hour, and the difficulty level at 3. Then, I began jogging in place, negotiating with myself, tired and wanting to quit as soon as I started. This, I thought, is who I am now? When did I weaken to this pathetic degree? I made deals with myself. First I thought, if I get to halfway, I can quit, and at least I had fifteen minutes of cardio -- that's a start, right? I stared at the timer, appreciated the psychological genius of how it switched often between counting up and counting down. Planning to quit halfway enabled me to get to halfway and say, well, that wasn't so bad, I'll just do five more minutes, and continue in that vein until, five negotiations later, I jogged further than I had planned. I didn't set any records or anything, but I surpassed my goal. Sometimes, parenting and coping with the additional special needs my son has overwhelms me. I feel that there is no way I'll be able to finish the course. It stretches out too far, the hills look too steep, and I just know I lack the stamina. It helps when I can dial things back, and focus on the small increments, one lap at a time. This school year won't kill me if I only focus on this week. This week won't kill me if I just focus on this day. I can survive the day if we just get through this chore. But eventually I do get really bone weary. Eventually I do need a break from the treadmill. I need to stretch, to cool down, to replenish. Remember I mentioned I was on vacation when I found myself contemplating all this, right? Even the word vacation had felt out of my league. Felt like Publisher's Clearing House; you see the videos that show it happened to other people, but you're pretty sure it doesn't exist, and, if it does, it'll never happen to you. If I can't figure out how to drive across town to see my best pals, how could I wrangle a vacation? Aren't those things EXPENSIVE? But the need for a break was written all over me. I kept telling people I would take one, but no one was fooled - certainly not my husband. So he and his parents (world's best in-laws) called TO. They yanked me off the treadmill of workatwork-and-workathome-and-work inmysleep...workatwork-and-workathome-and-work inmysleep... and they laughed at my objections, my belief that my kids' worlds would stop spinning if I didn't keep running in place. My husband took me on a vacation, and I had nothing to say about it. His parents kept the kids. They took better care of them than we do --  made them eat broccoli and practice math, took them to see parade floats and The Muppets, improved their table manners -- and when we got home to our sleeping angels, clean house, cheerful MIL and FIL, and even all new light bulbs, I knew two things: I am very, very, very, very lucky to be loved and supported by my amazing family, and I was kidding myself if I thought I was going to make it without a break. I couldn't have made it another yard. All the warning lights were flashing wildly while I pretended not to sweat. The world kept spinning even when the treadmill didn't. I stopped. I rested. I wept. Hey, people. I even found the time to jog. And to have epiphanies I could blog about again, in case anyone still reads here. I don't know what the trip cost. It was cheaper than dying. If you are running on a treadmill, here is the wisdom I offer: Pace yourself. Focus on small increments. Don't always look at how far you have to go, sometimes count how far you have already traveled. Step off sometimes, especially if anyone offers to help. If they don't offer, ask. Rest, or you will never go as far as you need to, and you might fall off the treadmill and really hurt yourself. Blog about it. That's all I got, people. Now, I'm limbering up; vacation is over, and the treadmill awaits. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/12/working-it-out.html", "title": "\nWorking it Out\n"},

{"date": "Friday, December 23, 2011", "body": "\nBefore I even knew I was Jewish, I can remember all kinds of Christmas guilt and anxiety. It had nothing to do with religion. I grew up with an alcoholic father I rarely saw, who traveled for \"business\" most of the week, and who bought us a 40-foot camper so my mother would keep my brother and me away for the summer, but Christmas eve found us all around the tree each year, unable to figure out how to be a family. Inevitably, my brother and I bickered over ornaments, my mother complained about how hard she worked to make things \"perfect\", and my father smilingly slurred snide and sarcastic zingers from his corner of the sofa. My mother grew louder and my father quieter and more sour, as my brother's head nearly exploded from the pressure, until at last I wept. My crying infuriated everyone. Once I cried, my mother blamed my father, my father blamed my brother, my brother called me a baby, and I cried more. My mother hurled something against a wall, I cleaned up the splinters, my father passed out, my brother turned up the music... Then, to bed, so we could wake up and unwrap countless presents wrapped opulently in guilt and misery. The Christmas morning I was ten, we left on our one and only family vacation. With gifts of Arthur Ashe tennis rackets and tank tops, we headed off to Disney World, where my parents took Polaroids of us by day (wearing parkas purchased in the gift shop -- Orlando had a record cold spell and flurries) and took their screaming matches out on the town by night, while my brother and I stayed in the hotel room with a babysitter and a television that seemed inseparable. By my eleventh Christmas, my mother had left my father, my father had fled the country, and I had learned about Judaism when we moved in with my grandparents. What on earth does this have to do with autism? Well, it's convoluted, I admit. I started liking Christmas a lot better after my parents split up, the inclusion of Chanukah in my life notwithstanding. I liked celebrating without the smell of alcohol, without anyone smashing things and screaming, without such fancy and expensive gifts. I started making my own community and spending time learning about my friends' traditions, making my own traditions, reclaiming the ideas of celebration and joy. I began dreaming about one day having my own family, raising children who never associated Christmas with vodka or beer, bitterness or misery, nor with religion -- children who knew they were Jewish and felt free to live, worship, celebrate, believe, and be, any way those chose, any way that made them happy. We would light candles and eat latkes, we would decorate the tree with ornaments we made ourselves. We would try, learn, love, be happy, and celebrate. To paraphrase Sandra Cisneros, what no one tells you is that when you are a parent, you are still a child. The trick is not to let your own childishness ruin things for everyone. This is especially true if you are a parent of a child with special needs. When it comes to Christmas, I don't want to neglect the little girl I still am inside, but I don't want to put her needs over those of my own children, who I want to put first. First, but not only. So, it's complicated. You can bet that Christmas has not turned out like I expected. Some years we light candles for eight nights, and some years we settle for two or three. Some years we have a tree, and some years it is just too much. Once or twice we have visited Santa. This year I managed to get out just a few Shutterfly cards. Part of this has to do with autism. It just does. It just does. Once again, screaming has become part of my holiday traditions. I find that I have resumed my role as the one who ends up crying sometimes. And I admit there is some bitterness. Some guilt. These are not the holidays I envisioned as a child. This is not the life I envisioned. But not all of this has to do with autism. And I don't \"blame\" autism. We all are who we all are. We're complicated. We are real. We are a family. And here is the thing: what I really wanted from holidays as a kid was not some picture of perfection. It is pictures of perfection --- and the insatiable desire for those illusions --- that led to the mess of my childhood. Yes, I had dreams of gingerbread houses and stringing popcorn. Yes, I had dreams of grating the potatoes and following my grandma's handwritten latke recipe, and playing dreidle and singing songs. But really all I truly wanted from my holidays was a loving family, warts and all. And so I am trying to joyfully celebrate the way the family I have today needs me to, not the way the girl I used to be might wish we could. No latkes this year. No gelt. No tree. No gingerbread. Warts? We got 'em. Oh, how we got 'em. But tomorrow we will gather with extended family and there will also be no vodka, no beer, no snide remarks, and no guilt. There will be autism, and maybe some (kids) screaming, possibly a moment of anxiety, but not too much. And there will be love, in abundance - the greatest gift of all. And because that means so much to me, I will try - try my best - not to look too far back or too far forward, but be right there, in the moment of celebration.

{"date": "Sunday, December 11, 2011", "body": "\nWhen I met my husband, I taught fifth grade, and he loves to recount how I never let him carry my very heavy teacher's bag for me. He also enjoys calling me his \"locomotive.\" He says I have lived my life like a mission, and that I get a sense of control over the world by doing everything I can every chance I get. But it's changing. I have not yet met my son's new aide. This guy started work a couple of weeks ago, and I've already had three or four people tell me how talented he is at helping the Rooster, but I've let my husband handle that relationship. My kids take swimming lessons on Saturdays. They started about two and a half months ago, but I don't even know the name of the place. My only contribution to this endeavor involved terrifying my husband with stories of kids with autism and water danger, and sending him a list of local swimming classes; he took care of the rest. He has fought the battles with the discrimination and negligence at Roo's school more than I have. He has sat alone in the tiny blue plastic chairs at parent conferences for the very first time, putting me on speaker on his cell phone. He drops the kids off at school this year. He takes them horseback riding on the weekends. After three years of frustrating our neighbors with our lawn, we have finally hired a gardener. Instead of volunteering for things, it's all I can do to send checks. It's not one thing, it's everything. Even this blog. Where am I? What am I doing? It hurts me, this falling away. In the hardest moments of it, I feel a little like I'm failing, a little like I'm dissolving, and I'm sad, worried, scared. But my husband looked at me tonight and told me to get a grip. He didn't mean: go do more. He meant, lovingly: make peace with taking a breath. He meant, embrace stopping the madness. Don't weep about it, do it with intention. Choose to stop, don't go til you crash. He meant: it's okay to let your husband help you. He said, \"You have been holding the spinning world over your head and protecting it with your two hands while taking whippings, beatings coming at you from all sides. It makes sense your legs are tired and you need a breather.\" He said, \"You have been working since you were 14. No one has ever said before, 'It's okay. I got this.' But honey, it's okay. I got this. Ok? I got it. And listen to  me: everything is going to come back to you. Your energy. Your sense of yourself. It's going to come back. But only if you stop for a while. Stop, it's okay. I got this.\" I don't exactly know how to start to stop. I don't know the rules for embracing letting go, dialing back. I have no experience at it. But I carry my husband's words around like a love letter in my back pocket, and they are giving me strength to try. To try to not try so much.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/12/starting-stopping.html", "title": "\nStarting Stopping\n"},

And to begin, I have to tell you something that probably will clash jarringly with your notion of me; are you prepared? It's not creepy or spooky, it's just going to be hard for you to believe, that's all. You see, sometimes I ... jog. I jog slowly, of course, with poor form, and not all that far, but I jog when I can in this large, urban crazyzone in which I live. And even though I jog only in the daylight and only in places I consider relatively safe, sometimes I imagine what ifs, especially as I pass those who are faster, fitter, stronger, but appear (even) less stable than I am. You know, if for some unimaginable reason, someone wanted to do me harm, I wouldn't be that hard to catch, that's all I'm saying. So today I'm jogging (let's just use that word loosely, shall we? but I am sweating) in the park past a fellow who very well writes poetry in his spare time but for some reason gave me the sense I should allow him wide berth and no eye contact, and I'm in the Halloween mind set after passing a picnic full of goblins and aliens, and I find myself wondering the darkest what ifs. And wouldn't you know it? They lead me back to autism. * I heard you just now when you said you saw that one coming. * It went like this: If I disappeared during this jog, would people search for me right away, or would they assume I ran off of my own accord? And if they put me in the news, would anyone say, \"I know she'd never leave her family! She must be hurt, we have to help her!\" (Because I would NEVER EVER leave my family, I only like to joke about it!) Or would they say, \"Well, I know her father ran off when she was little, so maybe...\" And would my Roo miss me, miss climbing in my lap and calling me wildly unpredictable nicknames like \"Mama Mineral\" and \"My Mama Pajama\"? Or would my Roo find more peace without being drilled on his lessons, more happiness without being nagged about taking on more responsibilities, more tranquility with just his even keel, level headed, serene dad? And if they never found me, would my husband find dealing with autism  easier without also having to deal with me-dealing-with-autism? Okay, okay, calm down. Don't send in reinforcements.

{"date": "Saturday, November 12, 2011", "body": "\nThe way I see it: - We had some negative experiences at Rooster's first elementary school. - We heard that another school nearby was better. - We entered the better school's lottery. - We got a call: we won the lottery! - We showed up to registration and were told, \"Oh, autism? No thanks, we have enough of those kids already. Our lottery was for typical kids. Go back where you came from.\" - We consulted the district, officials, attorneys, etc. and heard we had a right to enroll our son in the better school. - We finally were allowed to enroll him the week before school started. - We heard, \"Because you enrolled him so late, his services will not start on time.\" - We told them, \"Without services, he will struggle.\" - The aide started three weeks late, misses work regularly, and is described by the principal as inadequate. - My husband sees children bully, taunt, tease, hit, chase, and torment my son the minute he sets foot on the yard in the morning; my son doesn't want to go to school. He says everyone calls him \"Bad Rooster.\" - We get called for an IEP meeting to modify the behavior plan. At the IEP meeting, we hear that our son is a bully, that he is the one calling names, striking out. No one says anything when we describe the situation he faces the minute he enters the campus, never having even spoken a single word. - We agree our son's behavior has regressed, but we place the blame squarely on a transition from hell because of the school and the lack of supports to which the law clearly states my son is entitled. - We all agree the district provided aide does nothing, does more harm than good, and we decide to go for a behaviorist from a non public agency. - I have to leave the IEP meeting ahead of my husband. He decides to sign it. But strangely there is no printer available. He reads it on the laptop, he signs. - A copy comes home. It has a whole paragraph my husband has never seen. This describes my son as a menace and a safety hazard to others. It also has the wrong name of the school on the document, rendering the whole document invalid. A new document will have to be signed. This will all go down very, very differently. - My husband? The nicest man anyone has ever met, will ever meet? Quivering with fury. He says, \"They have messed with the wrong guy.\" He drafts emails, gets attorney phone numbers at the ready. He says, \"I will never trust those people again. I will not allow them to abuse the system or our child.\" The way the school seems to see it: Kids who have autism should go away. They bring down our test scores, our precious API, our race to the top. They are expensive. We teach reading and math -- that is how we get paid -- we don't have time or money or energy for the whole child. We told you that after we accidentally picked you for enrollment but you would not listen. We said you didn't want you but you came anyway with your whining rants about rights and laws and blah blah blah. You should go back where you came from.

{"date": "Saturday, September 24, 2011", "body": "\nDear Book Club, I feel all kinds of weird about writing to you via this blog post right now.  I feel all kinds of weird. Period.  And I'm questioning if I should write to you like this. I hope you will indulge me in my weirdness, as you so often do. But writing this blog is how I deal with autism, and dealing with autism is a big, complicated, messy, difficult to explain endeavor, as I think you can imagine from reading our upcoming selection,  Following Ezra . I think the author might agree that, when something helps you deal with autism, you just do it, even if it's weird.   I don't know how much it shows, but I struggle over talking about autism with our group; I never want it to invade the single social experience I grant myself as part of my regular life. I never want my struggle to bring the group down, or elicit sympathy, or take any of us away from our escape into books. Book club or elsewhere, I never want it to see like autism is a tragedy for my family, but I never want want to pretend we are typical, either. I know I already told you this but I can't express fully how joining your group meant -- means -- more to me than you can know, and that is because of autism. It feels to me like all the other places I frequent are autism communities, where my family can be one of the group, and I can swap parenting wisdom and resources with others in the same boat as I am as Rooster's mom. Book club lets me just be who I have always been all my life -- a friend, a talker, and a reader. And now that we are reading  Following Ezra , I don't know another word to describe what it feels like other than weird, which I admit is not such a useful word. So I'm trying to draw a clearer picture right here; how am I doing? No? Not so much?  I guess what I'm trying to convey is that I can't imagine how to talk about  Following Ezra , a book about autism and parenting, as the person I've always been all my life, because autism has changed my life, and changed me, so much that in some situations I find it hard to reconcile my before-autism and autism-immersed selves.   At only halfway through reading  Following Ezra ,  the anxiety of trying to imagine how I would talk about this deeply personal story that hits so intensely close to home had me feeling all. kinds. of. weird.  I read, and I pictured the story, and I pictured our next meeting, and I paced a little, and I put the book down. I picked the book up and rode the exercycle and realized my legs were whirring and I could not concentrate and I put the book down and thought about our meeting, and I thought about Ezra, and his life with autism, and I thought about Rooster. And I picked the book up, and I thought about the author, the narrator, the parent of this special boy, and I thought about my husband, then about Ezra's mom, then about me, and finally the only way I could deal with the weird feelings zinging about, the PTSD I am tempted to call it, was to pick up this laptop and write, and what comes out is this letter, my attempt at self-soothing.   My boy, Rooster, is not Ezra, and I am not Ezra's dad, Tom, but this book feels so close to me, my life, my family, my experience, our autism journey, that I find it more imaginable to step inside the pages and arrive at the Los Angeles zoo with Ezra and Tom than I can imagine even something as typical as our next gathering.  I keep hearing in my mind how I have talked about other books in our meetings, both fiction and, like  Following Ezra , memoir or nonfiction. I remember with previous books commenting on voices I found interesting or flat, a mother who I feel embarrassed now to say grated a bit on my nerves from how a big a deal she made of some things. Sure I could criticize -- those characters and writers remained strangers. But how will I talk about these people who feel like my family? That will feel -- well, weird. I am afraid that I hold this book too precious to dissect it without feeling like I am betraying people I have never met but count among a sacred community precious to me. I can't \"like\" or \"dislike\" this book, because it is somehow my life; not a story, but testimony.   So I admit I thought about not coming to this meeting of our book club. But I don't want to miss seeing you -- I don't want to miss the event I wait for all month, your good company, the beauty of your community -- and not going likely would just carry over the weirdness until the next time we get together.  So the only way I know to avoid the weirdness of how I might feel when I try to talk about  Following Ezra  is to plan for the possibility that I might not be able to talk about it when me meet. Though it would be unlike me, it's possible I might only be able to listen!  It's not that I don't want to talk with all of you, it's just that I feel overwhelmed at the thought of my emotions in this situation.  If you want to know what I think about  Following Ezra , I am putting some of my ideas in this post, where I can say it in my best way, in my own time, with the ability to hit backspace and delete as I stumble along. Following Ezra  is an important book about raising a child who has autism. Not any child, not all children, not the full spectrum of kids, but one boy named Ezra. In my opinion, it does not presume to be more, to get political or to speak for anyone, though in many passages I find it telling my own feelings and experiences. It purely resonates. The book is full of simplicity and love, and I treasure that about it. My favorite part of the book:  When Ezra says, \"You are proud of me.\" My solar plexus ached, and that is all I can say about that. Parts of the book that felt like I might have written them myself:  p. 3 \"a personal journey, beginning in darkness, fascination, love, and ultimately, a sense of awe for our unique, exceptional son.\"  p. 19 \"He's  gone .\"  \"p. 24 \"One evening, I try to put Ezra to bed one hundred times in a row. And that is just the beginning. The trouble is, I'm following instructions that were written for another kid.\"  p. 34 \"I once understood that having children meant sacrificing some sense of control, but more and more I find myself in situations like the one at the hair salon that seem completely out hand, and beyond my ability to manage.\"  p. 60-61 \"the dismal sense that we might never get this right -- that raising a child with no intuitive social instinct will be treacherous, a minefield with unseen disasters lurking everywhere ... Uncensored, he obsessively points out and comments not just on overweight people, but a laundry list of oddities.\"  p. 152 \"At the movies, he can take in dialogue without anyone expecting him to respond -- and he can play a DVD over and over again until he understands the words and keep listening until he commits the dialogue to memory. That explains why for several years of his childhood it's almost impossible to engage Ezra in dialogue, but he will routinely spout movie lines...\" The part least like my experience, which I found particularly fascinating:  Ezra's amazing memory. The rooster, so far, has shown no remarkable savant skills like that.  When I cried:  The whole bar mitzvah made me cry, because it is so happy. The hardest parts of the story made me nod my head, and several times I covered in gooseflesh, but I didn't cry until the end of the book as Ezra flourished through the experience of his bar mitzvah. I cried at the beauty, the love, the joy, the community, and I cried because I know that the end of any story like this is an arbitrary thing in a way; there are no real ends, but constantly overlapping spectrums of endings and beginnings in a complicated journey.  What I think of this book: It should be required reading for most of society. The numbers of people affected by autism are vast, and this book offers a testimony that opens people's eyes, whether they are teachers or clerks in a store that sell Homer Simpson dolls, therapists or neighbors, members of a congregation or barbers who encounter people with special needs. Anyone who doesn't think they personally know someone deeply impacted by autism probably is not paying much attention. Is it a good book? There is simply no way for me to answer that without bias, anymore than I would feel comfortable having my own children in my class and grading their work.  Following Ezra  wasn't a book club assignment, it was an intimate opportunity for reflection on what motherhood means to me. I didn't read it like a book, I went through it like therapy. And I'm glad I did -- thank you for choosing  Following Ezra , because I never would have, and now I am so happy to own a copy. And in case I have not said it, thank you for letting me join book club. I am so grateful for what it adds to my life. Wheeew. I am glad I got that all down on my blog. Now I can look forward to our meeting once again. I am feeling fewer kinds of weird now. Maybe just my usual amount.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/09/following-rooster-and-his-mom-through.html", "title": "\nFollowing Rooster and His Mom Through All Kinds of Weirdness\n"},

{"date": "Monday, August 22, 2011", "body": "\nWhat does it mean to have autism?  \r What does it mean to have a child with autism?  \r By now, you might expect me to have some insights. Not only have I been thinking about these questions as they pertain to those of us here at Casa del Rooster for the past five years, but I have cultivated a community of people with autism and their families, and many have been grateful enough to share their own insights with me.  \r And still, I have no great understanding about the meaning of autism.  \r Then again, I have no great insight into what it means to be one particular race, or religion, or profession. I only know what it means to wake, and work, and walk, through this life that is mine, and to see each event, each day, each person, as I see it, through the filters of my own feelings and the lens of my life experiences.  \r There is no one autism. There IS only one Rooster. He is my little boy, seven years old, impossibly cute, and I love him. I do not know why he has autism, but every maternal instinct I have tells me he was born roostery, that he has always been who he is, that autism has been part of his package since day one. I can't define his autism for you, and it makes me uncomfortable to categorize people by their \"functioning\" level, like they are competing appliances. But I can tell you this: people who do have a singular image in their mind of what autism is often find my boy surprising. They often don't know what to make of him or of many of his friends or of my friends who are \"on the spectrum.\"  \r And to be honest, while I find the word spectrum somewhat satisfying in its representation of infinite variety, what exactly is up with the singularity behind \"the\"? I mean, I find myself saying, \"Rooster is on the spectrum\" and thinking: Well, who isn't? When I really think about it, it stops making sense. I buy into the notion that there is a continuum to human sexuality, so I believe all people are somewhere on that continuum because there are no asexual people. When I say we all have special needs and fit into a spectrum of personalities and behaviors, that's not me trying to make my boy sound more typical, that's me confessing I have no idea what typical is, and owning that I'm certainly not it, even though I don't have autism.  \r Very soon, a new school year will begin. With it will come eighty-six gajillion opportunities to discuss with teachers, parents, kids, and strangers that my son has autism. They will look to me to help them make sense of it. Sadly, I imagine that I will be of very little use in that department. But I will tell about my boy. I will tell them he is seven, we call him the Rooster, and he's good and some things, great at some things, and challenged by some other things. When he struggles, we like to help him find ways to use his strengths as leverage for success. When he feels upset or sensitive, we model coping mechanisms and make sure he knows he is safe and loved. When he makes poor choices, we try to help him learn for the next time. When he does well, we celebrate a lot. Maybe telling people all that doesn't help them understand autism on any deeper level. But my son is not autism.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/08/tao-of-roo.html", "title": "\nThe Tao of Roo\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2011", "body": "\n\"How was the first day of school?\" A Top Ten List from Rooster (numbering system, entirely his; enumerated on the endless drive home) \"ONE: Terrible! I did NOT like having an aide after school. I told daddy I do  not want her to come anymore and he did not listen to me. And I hate it! TWO: She came and I DID NOT WANT HER TO and I AM SO MAD. THREE: And I DON'T want her to come back EVER AGAIN. I don't want to see her FACE! FOUR: And I DON'T want her help with my homework!!!! I want her to stop it! FIVE: She came anyway today and I did NOT like that! And I'm going to put daddy on a consequence for that! It's not right! SIX: And I never want to see her again! I'm ALL DONE. SEVEN: She just showed up and I told daddy I DO. NOT. NEED HER!!!!GRRRRR! I'm ANGRY. SEVEN: Yeah, seven. She better not come back tomorrow. DON'T SAY SHE IS. She is NOT!!! NINE: I told daddy I would be good and I was good and now I DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE HER and that is what I SAID but she came anyway. TEN: So I DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN AIDE ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S TERRIBLE! ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? BECAUSE I AM SO MAD, MOMMY!!!!!!!!!!\" Well. That was a fun day. I drove for about six months around Los Angeles in a billion degrees to rush my grateful children to their new schools and get to my new job and then reverse the whole deal, to be greeted so cheerfully by my oldest child, then race with him as the tears and other lovely liquids flew to go get his sister -- the last to be picked up (mother of the year award to me) -- and find out from the overly friendly after care guy that she's doing great except for that wandering off and disappearing stuff, oh and a little drama among the girls, but no worries. Yes, a runon sentence. Followed by a fragment. Lovely first day we had in these parts, people, just lovely, and since the aide WILL be returning to after care, AND he doesn't know he also will have a classroom aide tomorrow (not sure why she didn't show up today as she was supposed to), and since everything never gets easier, I will grammarize any way I please, including double negatives, thankyouverymuch. Let the new year of my whinefest commence freestyle, baby! For those who insist on bright sidedness, I can offer you this: We adore the aide. No matter the Rooster's newfound quest for independence, he has always deeply adored her, because she rocks the spectrum. She comes early sometimes, stays late often, helps him do his homework and learn such essentials as Capture the Flag and how to not freak out on a school bus ride to a field trip, and did after school as well as summer camp for two years. She said my boy had a great day until I arrived, not just in after care but in class, as reported by his teacher. (sigh) AND, since I'm on a roll, all cheerful and such, the after care director at the new school turns out to be the same guy who was the Rooster's camp director the past two summers, and we love him. And really I saved the best for last, in case you somehow made it this far and you needed a reward. We sent a Rooster Manual in to the new teacher today, inspired by the ultra fabulous and supremely wise  Redhead Momma , and this is what the new teacher wrote back: \"Hello! Thank you so much for the booklet to introduce Rooster to me. It was very  helpful for me to know a little more about your wonderful little boy. I  will keep in mind the information you have shared. I am looking forward to a great year. Mrs. Y\" Once I got over the shock and the weepy joyful tears, and the second rock of shock and jubilation and heart skips, I began to worry. You know, because last year we lost the first wonderful teacher the boy had by Halloween and the second before winter vacation, and the third teacher was good but lost his job by June due to budgets. And also because, well, that's how I roll. Please send Mrs. Y wishes for good health, job security, but no lottery winning until next year. A little birdie told me she has a fondness for ice cream so I'm sending her Baskin-Robbins certificates tomorrow. Tomorrow. I can hardly stand the thought.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://redheadmomma.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/09/and-theyre-off.html", "title": "\nAnd They're Off\n"},

The inclusion specialist had called to talk to me about the Rooster's difficulties in school. He seemed to have some understanding about phonics, she thought, but she could glean no evidence of number sense. He had multiple needs, fragmentary attention, and precious little time for services. What did I want her to prioritize?\r \r Deeply grateful for her interest, efforts, time and talents, I said, \"Here is what my gut tells me. He needs the math support more. But if you can teach him to read, I think he will read to learn. He came out of the womb loving books. I say you focus on reading.\"\r \r I remember dialing my husband next, whispering, a tear in my throat. \"Honey? It's me. Do YOU think he will learn to read? Do you think he can?\" We had to wait and hope, but my intuition told me a boy who loved stories as much as mine would persevere.\r \r I remember taking him to the ed therapist who took one look at his deplorable handwriting and wanted to work on writing and reading. We have one of the best ed therapists you can find for kids on the spectrum - she just finished her Ph.D. and she used to be a behaviorist; she is charming and tenacious and can tame wild beasts, plus she has amazing toys and the most robust sticker collection I've ever seen. \"I know you know more about this stuff than I do,\" I told her. \"But this kids has no number sense. Zero. Nothing. His amazing inclusion specialist isn't there any more and no one at school is making any headway with our boy and math. Do the math. Help him gain number sense. Besides, he already loves to read, and I can help him with all the language issues. You concentrate on numbers.\"\r \r I have no illusions that school will be easy for my son. At seven, he still has the number sense of a kid half his age. But the ed therapist is moving the needle. We see progress. And he's learning to read well enough that it will not be long until he's reading to learn. As I type this, he's pretending he has gone to bed, but I see the light under the door and I know he's cuddled up with a book about a little boy whose mom is president.\r \r I have never been an expert on autism, but so far my gut instincts seem to know how to help my Rooster.\r \r You think I'm talking to you? No, this is the pep talk I give myself as the weather cools a tad and people begin to talk about QBs and new lunch boxes. I feel fall coming, and if I didn't give myself this pep talk right now, anxiety might be the next feeling to dawn.\r \r When September comes, I hope all you special needs parents out there will join me in listening to our instincts.

{"date": "Thursday, August 11, 2011", "body": "\nEven in the toughest of economies, I have often been surprised that people are willing to babysit my children. As my husband and I return home, dread begins to pool in my belly, and I cringe as I strain to ask, \"How were they?\" It stuns me each time our gifted sitters tell me they had a fine time, and sometimes my shock compels me to want to overpay them. Once in a while I've had sitters tell me my kids went to bed early, after making a picture, playing a game, listening to a story and brushing their teeth without any fuss, and I've wondered if I returned to the right house. I've suspected some of my sitters of sorcery or hypnosis, and I have been humbled in the face of their superior child charming strategies.\r \r Don't get me wrong: I have worshiped my babies since before the first time I kissed the top of their funny little heads, and I Mama Bear with the best of 'em. But if I am totally honest with you (and I am compulsively honest) my children usually seem to me like the kind of kids that, if they weren't my own, would cause me to suspect inadequate parenting. From where I'm sitting, as the parent in question who works day and night to try to do what is best for our family, I tend to want to blame genetics a little higher above me in my family tree for my kids being willful, wild, and impulsive, but I would add that autism probably deserves some credit as well. My kids are  not perfectly behaved with ANYONE, but they sometimes can be cute and charming with pretty young sitters they don't see that often, or they can be holy terrors for those very same sitters who somehow love them regardless.\r \r That is all a very long introduction to today's headline. We just had our first sitter quit on us. It shocks me that it has taken this long. Truthfully, I would not want to babysit my children! And yet I didn't take it all that well. In fact I'm still not taking it all that well; thank goodness for blogging so I can get it out of my system.\r \r See, we don't usually get sitters so we can have fun. (I THINK I remember fun.) Unless it's our anniversary, a date night is rarely involved. But sometimes we both actually need to go to work, and yet also take the kids somewhere else at the same time. So this week, I arranged for one of the sitters we have used before to drive the kids to Rooster's ed therapy, then get them to camp. For the bargain shuttle rate of $55 thank you very much. Plus twice as much for the therapy, of course. But we could at least go to work on time. At the end of the day, when my husband picked the kids up from camp, the camp staff members sought him out. They wanted him to know that they observed my children behaving uncharacteristically aggressive with one another as they entered the campus, with Peach scratching and hitting her brother, and even leaving marks from her finger nails on his neck as they both screamed at one another. As they watched in shock (my kids have had no problems at camp that I know of), my disgusted sitter marched off, leaving the camp counselors to regain control.\r \r I expected to hear from the sitter, but I didn't, so today I emailed her. I said I heard my kids gave her a tough time and I wanted to know what happened.\r \r She wrote back and told me that the Rooster is not the problem, that he follows her rules and usually makes good choices, but she doesn't want to babysit for us anymore. She doesn't want to endure Peaches' disrespectful and rude behavior, and she doesn't want to be responsible if Peaches hurts her brother. I wrote back and said that it's fine if she doesn't want to babysit in the future, but yesterday she already WAS responsible for my children and all reports indicate she simply walked away. And with that, friends, we are down one babysitter.\r \r Believe me, I deeply understand the urge to turn and walk away when my kids get like that. I have felt it myself many times. But I hired this sitter because she had some experience with special needs kids and she is getting her teaching credential. Before she worked for us, I invited her over to observe them, and I gave her FULL DISCLOSURE. Sure, we get just as fed up with Peaches, but in this case, what about my boy? What about keeping him safe? And she thinks after a couple of hours with them once every few months that SHE feels overwhelmed? Really?\r \r And why did she not contact me, but wait to cancel our next babysitting appointment (in two weeks, in case you were interested in filling in?) when I asked her what happened? Is that her plan when she has her own classroom? Or her own kid?\r \r We used this sitter when our other gifted and amazing sitters were not available, and so luckily we still have them (J, J, A and M, for instance) to call upon in the future. It isn't losing a sitter that has me down. It's just -- well -- losing a sitter does have me down.

So I'm taking a different angle.\r \r Lately, I've noticed my seven-year-old Rooster hitting the kind of milestones you might not be able to appreciate fully unless you love a child with special needs. So, I bring these jewels to you, hoping to find an audience who will understand the unabated joy in some of these less-than-typical milestones. Give us a shout out, will ya'?\r \r - While out of town for a reunion, Roo tells me, \"I miss my Iron Man costume. Where is it? I have not seen it. It's LOST...\" I say, as I often do, that it's not lost, it's just not here with us. It's at home. Then, he floors me. \"What part of the house is it in? Maybe we can find it later.\"\r \r - While visiting with his infant cousins, he patted them on their heads and told them they were beautiful. Then, he looked at his toddler cousin whose hair has grown long and lighter than it used to be. \"Do you remember when her hair was dark, mommy? I miss her dark hair.\"\r \r - A few times a week I ask my little guy how much two and two make. Almost every time he counts on his fingers. This has gone on for about 14 months or so. Last week I asked, and he kept his hands in his lap. \"Still four!\" He beamed at me.\r \r - My boy started to read in first grade, but about 20 times slower than his teacher would like. He. Sounds. Things. Out. At. His. Own. Roostery. Pace. An \"I Can Read\" Book at Level 1 could take all night. In the past few weeks, he's sprinting along at a new pace. And forget just sounding things out, he read \"laughed\" and \"peace\" without pause. He read about 6 books before bed and still went to sleep at a reasonable hour.\r \r - Monkey bars represent an enormous obstacle to my low-tone boy, but he made it across three rungs the other day for the very first time!\r \r Maybe only some of these make any sense to you, so let me just say my boy is showing signs of developing temporal understanding, better abstract reasoning, more ability to plan, more interest in others, improved strength, and improved academic skills. We feel like his most recent eye surgery has helped his vision and his visual perception. And he's getting cuter all the time, reaching a level of almost impossible cuteness.\r \r So isn't that awesome?

{"date": "Saturday, July 23, 2011", "body": "\nI haven't posted regularly in what feels like forever, because I've been going back to school while working full time and raising two kids and helping my son navigate autism and finding a new job and ... well, acquiring significant material for this blog just by living my life. Now, I need to share. But I might ramble. And you might not want to follow, but I've got to get it all out, just for my own good. It might not seem like it, but I'm writing about autism, and the thread it stitches in indelible patterns throughout all the backdrops in my life. So I'm in my first week at my new job, a chaotic event week at my new workplace that takes place once each year and coincided with my arrival, and so far I've attended a seminar about context in documentaries (there are inherent choices behind each cut, frame, shot, and edit), a live testimony from a survivor of the Rwandan genocide, and a presentation by an expert in the Holocaust. Now I am in line to get a plate of food, which I will eat during a working lunch on a topic I have not yet mastered. It would not surprise me if I looked a little pale, and if I had smudges under my eyes. The lady behind me said something like, \"What moving, amazing... what stories... it's so hard, but so important...\" She looked pale and had smudges too as we exchanged a few more convoluted thoughts, and I don't recall the transition, but I came around to full alertness when she said, \"My friend told me after my family recently experienced our own tragedy that I was experiencing my own holocaust... You see, we lost my three and a half year old grandson...\" At some point she said she had no idea why she was sharing this with me, because it was not typical for her to do that, especially in a buffet line. At some point after that, she said, \"He had autism. He wandered off... \" Every life is a story, every story is all about context. You cannot document a life without making choices of which context to include and which to leave out, because life is too big and messy and layered. Our lives can seem so random, so disconnected, so different, but that's just costuming, just the cover art. You see? I have not been writing much here at Rooster Calls, but I've been thinking about you, this, IT, quite a bit. And now this is going to seem like a tangential explosion, but if you have come this far, hang on for a moment.  I have not changed workplaces in 16 years, when I was a BABY, and I feel a little scared as I tackle my new responsibilities. My son got accepted into a new public school through a lottery system and we celebrated because it has such a good reputation for special education, and then that school said, \"Oops, we missed the fact that he has autism, and we already have enough of 'those kids' so we are rescinding  his acceptance\" As my husband pursued legal recourse, I felt torn between wanting to fight and wanting to run from any school that wouldn't want my beautiful boy. Someone I love just had her heart badly broken. I turned 40 and worried about aging. So all this to say I think it's a really good (scary, overwhelming) thing I made a career change that will help me remember things like CONTEXT, that will help me with the perspective I've been begging for on this blogging journey. From my own bias as storyteller, through my own lens, via my own filters, this is what I heard this past week, in various experiences, and what I carry with me: Life is hard. There is no justice. Life has no undo button. Memory is powerful. We live for our children - they are our hope. It does no good to compare suffering. Giving testimony can help a survivor go on. Some atrocities are very hard to fathom, and we must stand in the way of anything like it. Music can transport you. Our memories, stories, context change over time. Silence does not help. To choose not to choose is a choice. Choices have consequences.  Never be a bystander. Time will pass. Hate hurts everyone. In the end, we have to live with ourselves alone. Stories teach. Writing matters. Live another day. Assume nothing. Show respect. I am a humanist. I have no idea if I'm doing what I am supposed to be doing, and I mean that on global and granular levels, and I mean it about my career, my family, my blog, what I wore today. I do know I'm listening and learning, and my instincts tell me I am doing what I need to do. I don't claim to know if there is a reason that I met that grandmother in line for food, but I do believe that our stories mattered to one another, that we had something to offer one another. If you got to this point in this post, I hope that what I wrote today mattered somehow to you, had something to offer, something you can take away with you. My story is a patchwork, shot through with countless colors and threads, autism among them; just telling it helps me find the beauty in this messy life.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/07/facing-myself.html", "title": "\nFacing Myself\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 24, 2011", "body": "\nIn previous posts, I mentioned a situation we have been dealing with regarding school placement, and this weekend that drama unfolded in a way that leaves us facing another decision. Maybe you have some wisdom that might help? We welcome all thoughtful and supportive insights. Here is the basic breakdown as I see it of a very complicated situation. In March, we put the Rooster's name on the Open Enrollment list at a school I'll call The W that we heard is more \"autism friendly\" than the school he attended in kindergarten and first grade. This other school, we hear, has a more actively involved special needs parent body, more active parents overall, a beloved resource teacher, and a very strong principal. We assumed we would not get in, the way you assume you probably aren't going to win the Powerball, but it's surely worth a buck to try. In May, we had our IEP. The Roo's current school generously agreed to increase all kinds of services for our boy, mostly because he struggles so much with math and he has extremely slow processing skills. Oh, yeah, and monumental ADD. But every person at that table, without exception, acknowledged what a great boy he is, and that he is bright and charming and learning a lot, with help... In June, the W called and said we had won the lottery, (and no that is not a metaphor I'm extending, it's an actual lottery where they supposedly draw names at random to be FAIR) and that our boy would be able to attend their school. Thrilled, my husband and I rushed over to sign the papers a week later as instructed. When we got there, it seems they had discovered my son's IEP. (We had not hidden anything, we completed our application fully and honestly.) The woman who greeted us at the reception desk explained that my son could not go to that school after all. She said, \"We are a small school, and we already have a lot of kids with autism.\"  This next bullet point represents my husband morphing kind of like Bruce Banner into Lou Ferrigno on some level, and while he remained respectful at all times on the outside, he popped some serious muscles of indignation and outrage on the inside. Let's just say lawyers, civil rights experts, district officials, and experts in education immediately heard from my husband, all in his admirably polite but clear and definitive terms. Let's just say that my husband is a professional writer, and he used the tools of his trade to make his perspective absolutely clear. \"This is not just the back of the bus,\" he explained, \"this is being dragged from behind the bus, and it is NOT right, and it will not stand.\" So this weekend we got a call and an official email from the district saying that the principal has been instructed to enroll our son on August 25, and we should go to the school to meet with her again on that date.  My husband needed to fight this because he knew he could not let injustice score another point against a child, our child, and he feels deeply gratified that he prevailed. That does not mean, however, that we are at all certain we now want to send our boy to the school that does not want him, where we have clearly made some enemies. It's very complicated, of course... but we have a month to figure out what to do next. Keep him at his old school, where parents have made us feel heartbroken, the kindergarten teacher probably deserved to be fired, and all three of the first grade teachers he had seemed good but only lasted a matter of months? But on the other hand, at his old school, he had some really good service providers, a wonderful IEP, and people who find him adorable. They have told us that we are wanted there, and that's not for nothing, though it is a school with lots of room for improvement, and possibly at risk. Or move him to the new W school, where the principal has us flagged as troublemakers, we don't know anyone else, and the amazing special ed resource teacher everyone has gushed about for the last 4 years is leaving anyway? But it's a nicer campus with more stability and resources, and better programs. I didn't even mention the wild card that our daughter, Peaches, is starting kindergarten in a charter school next year. That means a year from now, she should be able to pull in her brother, as a sibling, and we'll have to consider what THOSE changes might mean, besides even more transitions for a boy who doesn't navigate them with particular grace and agility. So, if you have a positive, encouraging comment to leave, we welcome it. (Of course, trolls and critics need not apply; comments will be moderated thankyouverymuch.) For now, we breathe a little easier, at least, knowing that we have a choice at all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/07/lottery-winnings-and-losings.html", "title": "\nLottery Winnings and Losings\n"},

My friends told me that once your kid turns seven, you have taught them all they need to know, and then rest is up to them. Take 'em to school and let them do their thing, but by seven they are ready for the world.\"  I doubt that works for anyone -- in fact I know it doesn't, because well into her eighties my grandma was still teaching and worrying about my mom --  but clearly my beautiful rooster needs more than being dropped off at school to be ready to tackle the world alone. I write largely about the good things lately, because my boy has a lot to celebrate, and because I am feeling stronger these days, but we have plenty of work cut out for us.  Among many other things, we still need to teach my seven-year-old boy to ride a bike, swim, add, and BE A FRIEND. He needs help with zippers, snaps, utensils, and IMPULSE CONTROL. He has yet to master board games, hopscotch, sports, or CROSSING THE STREET. My husband just remarked to me, \"I still yearn for when I can have a conversation with our boy about a non-preferred topic. I know we will get there, but it's taking a lot longer than I had hoped...\"  All this flashed in my head in the moment after this stranger told me I was \"all done\" parenting my oldest child.

It has an  outstanding rep for being the best public school for spectrum kids and  simply outstanding overall in every way. The parents I know who have kids with autism there talk about it like it's the haven we've all been waiting to find. Of course, I put Rooster's name in for the \"Open  Enrollment\" lottery. He was selected. Cheery acceptance letter,  celebration. Then they found out he has autism and that the IEP we just  did a week ago gives him additional services next year. (We were NOT  keeping it a secret in any way.) Now school W will not take him. \"We  already have too many kids with autism.

I am so ashamed that I said that. Immediately I thought of an Archie Bunker episode I watched sometime before the age of ten that I have never forgotten. It was about feminism, and a character told this \"riddle\" about a boy who is with his dad when the boy gets very badly hurt. The dad rushes the boy to the hospital. Just as they take the boy into emergency surgery, the surgeon says, \"Wait. I can't operate on this boy. He's my son.\" The riddle is, how can the boy be the son of the surgeon as well as the man who drove him to the hospital? It was the 70s, and no one could figure it out, because \"those were the days\" when no one's mind could readily come to the conclusion that a woman could be a surgeon. Even in elementary school, I got it, and I felt enraged. I hated the assumptions, the minimization of my gender. For one brief moment, I forgot that I stink at science and I forgot that I wanted to be Charles Kurault when I grew up, and instead I wanted to prove the disbelievers wrong, I wanted to be a great scientist.  So a friend heard my mistake, heard me make the offensive university remark, and she shot me a look. \"Can you imagine sending BOTH of your children there for free?\"  I felt enraged, at myself. I hated the assumptions I had made about my own boy, the minimization of kids who have autism. But ever since that moment, I have been thinking how much I WILL believe that my boy can do anything he wants, anything he sets his mind to, and that includes going to a highly competitive university when he grows up.  I DO believe. Sometimes the group think of assumptions clouds things for me for a while. Sometimes I confuse belief with hope. Belief is easier, hope is scarier. But for my little seven-year-old boy who is on the spectrum and has ADHD, and for kids like him, I'm not going to give up on either. If you see me make a ridiculous mistake or an offensive assumption again, please, shout at me.

Reflexively, I looked to make sure all of us were out of reach, and then caught myself -- he no longer uses his hands to express frustration, just stamps his feet as he learned to do as a better alternative during our ABA sessions.  Then, he screamed, \"I HATE my MOMMY. I HATE you, mommy.\" And the sting barely lasted a millisecond. I knew, with complete conviction, he would later apologize; in fact, within the half hour, he proclaimed his enormous love for me, topped with hugs and kisses.  I am so glad that my son lost his temper the other day.  It showed me how far we have come, how many tools he has, how our hard work has paid dividends. It showed him that he can get upset, and then he can turn things around.

For. An. Hour. With the option of quitting sooner. Nope, he wanted to PLAY! With his buddy! And, when no one won, well, I think maybe we all did!!!!

He does things his way, that sweet boy of ours, and tonight he lost a tooth Rooster-style.  For the last few days, he has started crying unexpectedly. It caught us off guard. He isn't prone to fits of sadness. But what really threw me? When I asked him what upset him, he said, \"I am going to miss you when you die, Mama.\" The mantra he tells me lately: \"Mommy, you are going to get old, and then I'm going to be alone. I don't want you and daddy to die.\"  My husband wants me to tell our boy that we will never die. I can't lie, though --- it's virtually beyond my powers to tell lies. Plus, what would the DEITIES do with such a pronouncement? So I tell my boy, \"I have no plans to go away, my love, I'm right here with you now, hoping to be here a very long time, and I love taking care of you. Let's go make some happy memories right now, okay?\" He dries his eyes and nods.  There are people who know my boy who can't stand his unique ways; they find him too loud, it bothers them how he takes his own time meander along while they race from A to Z, and they would like to control him, soften his dramatic edges. But there are others who respond to him with an affection similar to that which he stirs in me, who catch his contagious enthusiasm and delight in it. These people make a point to tell me things like, \"You know, he is a special boy.\" I realize lately that I divide the world into these two camps, and lately I only have heart for the latter. Someday I hope to have the patience and good will to reach out to the others, to teach them the error of their ways, to help enlighten them to what they miss when they choose not to make a friend in my little guy.

If you are a special needs parent, you know that sentence comes with the onus of ... duhn duhn duhn... deciding how to celebrate. I almost feel like I should just rest my overwhelmed head in my two hands in a dark corner and not come out until he turns 21 and I can just buy him a beer or something. My beautiful, charming, funny, complicated, sensitive, loving, challenging, delightful boy will turn seven next week no matter how much that shocks and exhausts me, and he simply and absolutely deserves to be celebrated, so I am trying my level-headed best to get it together and throw him a... a... (ohholycowamicrazyorwhat)...a party. See, he doesn't want to go to Disneyland this year. He cannot be distracted and deterred by bribes of rides and slides and pricey tickets and the Fast Pass. This year, he totally gets it that it's his birthday and he gets to call the shots. First, I thought he told me that he wanted a \"night party.\" Well, he's also been telling me he how much he likes the girls and how he likes the \"sassy\" way they walk, and I thought he envisioned himself in high school musical or something. Then his sister translated. \"No! He wants a party in 'SHINING ARMOR' mommy!\" Oh! So much more age appropriate! And so it became the plan. My knight has invited his whole first grade class, and his pals from social skills, and a neighbor, plus I threw in a few ringers who I know love us enough to show. I think I hand wrote 40 invitations about a week ago, then I did an evite. We have 3 RSVPS so far. Good enough. I spent part of my weekend creatively solving the problem of how to make a knight theme work with no weapons or potential calamities or law suits, and then I handed my paycheck over to Oriental Trading, Amazon, and Castle Park. Next up, I will find our metropolis' finest nut free, gluten free, casein and soy free, chocolate treat that can be designed in the shape of a castle or dragon or what-have-you. All I know is this. Autism might be hard, and I might hate parties, and I might dread the unanticipated surprises that are likely to occur, and why exactly do kids parties have to cost more than my savings for retirement, BUT...  I can still vividly remember birthdays one and two and three... they are microscopically tattooed within my wrinkles... and they were hard, and I was scared, and my boy didn't want to celebrate. It wasn't fun. He didn't play with his friends. I wondered if he would ever be happy. I wondered if we would make it. Nothing felt right, and autism seemed to rain our parties out. And so we stopped having them. And here we are. This year, my boy wants a party, and he wants to have fun, and he wants his friends to come. Some things stink, but some things feel kind of right. It's drizzling now, but the forecast calls for sunny skies again soon. We have a lot to celebrate. Seven years ago, I carried around a gigantic belly full of a boy only I could hold, a secret joy all for myself. Seven years ago next week, I got the best birth day present, my very favorite boy, and I had to figure out how to start sharing him with the world. We have been on a journey together, a journey that I try to learn from an understand each and every day as best I can. And so I will not rest my overwhelmed head in my two hands in a  dark corner next week. I will stand beside Sir Rooster, and together we will slay dragons. And play miniature golf.

But it is a gift, a treasure, a milestone, a minor miracle, when my son, after practicing the word for more than THREE YEARS, responds to a direction by saying, \"OK.\"  I turn away so I can enjoy a private smile. Yes, those two little letters mean a lot to me. But more than that? It's what he doesn't say. Those other two letters. Well, actually, if anyone could spell \"NO\" with more than two letters, my son could. Still can. But now it's almost rare to get, \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" I do not miss those days one bit.  If you are a parent or teacher or loved one of a child who has autism and \"no\" is the biggest part of their limited vocabulary, please do not give up hope. Please know that I almost did, and I would have been wrong if I'd accepted that a tirading, toy throwing, temper tantrum-ing single world vocabulary was the extent of my son's future interactions.  We have practiced the word, \"OK\" with him, modeled it for him, rehearsed, begged, reminded, scripted, and bribed it out of him. We had ABA for every single week day for two years. We have books about it. We praise the daylights out of it. Not because we want our son to be something he isn't, not because we don't love and adore and accept him, not because we wanted to spend our time with him issuing commands and forcing compliance, but because he always seemed so furious in his world of endless NOs. He seemed to say no to ease, to peace, to comfort, to being. He has come so far, through sensory work, through OT and PT and school and \"helpers\" and... love. He is still a fighter in the best sense of the word, but he has put down his gloves a bit, and he has made some room for ease, peace, comfort, being.  Today he watched Lilo and Stitch, and he started laughing his heart out. Our friend Decy said, \"He sounds so happy.\" I felt my eyes widen. To hear that said about MY boy! My boy?! I confess, I pretended I hadn't completely heard her. I said, \"What did you say?\" I wanted more. She said it again. \"He sounds so happy.\" This is not a sudden thing. Our Rooster has been gradually doing better, emotionally, step by tiny step, but it still thrills me to hear anything so radically different from back when I started writing this blog in 2008. My. Boy. Sounds. So. Happy.  If you can't imagine hearing that about your child, hang in there. I am rooting for you both. Be patient. Do what you think is best. Love.

I feel like I\u2019m in a Tilt-a-Whirl. All around me, autism awareness advocates struggle valiantly to promote inclusivity, empathy, awareness, community. And all around me, bureaucrats fight over the failing economy, especially about who should pay for it, which is almost always someone \u201celse.\u201d    People are in their own frenzy of fears, and every important issue in our country \u2013 from health care to education to wars to taxes -- seems rife with divisiveness and antagonism. Dizzy, I have held onto the nearest wall, immobilized, waiting for my equilibrium, but now I have something to say. It might be a jumble, it might mix some metaphors and take broad strokes and combine disparate topics, but amid the chaos, there is a simple point: It\u2019s time for us to take care of our country.     And you know what? Taking care of autism IS part of taking care of our country.     Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t care a bit about autism, and even less still about inclusivity, empathy, awareness or community. Fine. Let\u2019s say instead you care only about money, capitalism, and American corporate success. Fine, fair enough. Here is a concept I think you will understand, pertaining to education, health care, and disability services:     You can pay big now, or you can pay huge later.     You can pay high costs for services for children, or astronomical costs for lifetime services.       Or forget about special needs for a second. You can invest in schools, regardless of whether you have kids or even like them, or you can pour much bigger sums of money into such sinkholes as prisons. Don\u2019t like property taxes going to the public schools you don\u2019t use? Would you prefer them locking up the uneducated masses that you fail to rehabilitate? Would you prefer increased crime and drug use? And when I say pay now or pay more later, the later is not a generation away\u2026 the later is getting sooner and sooner as the size of our neglect grows and our past transgressions come due presently.     Hey, if you don\u2019t know or love someone with a developmental disability, I get why you might resent \u201cyour tax dollars\u201d going to serve \u201cthem.\u201d I don\u2019t need to try to reach your heart, really, because I can talk to you where you live, in your wallet. I want you to think about  the twelve-year-old college student  well on track to win some of the world\u2019s highest prizes for his genius in math and his contributions to society\u2019s understanding of advanced physics theories you and I are not likely to grasp. Have you seen the press coverage of this boy? I want you to imagine his parents had not had access to any services when, at age 2, that child received a diagnosis of autism. They thought he might never communicate and participate in the world around him. Can you please calculate the difference between what that child will likely now contribute to society, and what he would have cost \u201cAmerican tax payers\u201d had he had to live in an institution? I\u2019m talking dollars and sense here, people, and no, that is not a typo. What about the comparison between what that boy might contribute to society and what you and I might have to offer? Is he more or less worthy than you are? Is he more or less an \u201cinvestment\u201d in America\u2019s future than I am?    If you can quantify those things, I hope you will explain how. Well, for my money, it doesn't work like that, not one bit. But, for anyone out there who simply has to measure things, I will try to make things add up. Simply put, people invested in that boy when he needed it, and now, his future tax contributions will likely contribute to taking care of us when we are the vulnerable ones. I wonder how he and his generation (currently 1 out of about 150 of which have autism) will feel about taking care of the elderly and infirm?    It\u2019s autism awareness month. I wear blue not because Autism Speaks necessarily speaks for me or my family, or because I\u2019ve ever been much of a joiner, but simply because I feel less lonely when I, as an autism parent, connect with community. But you don\u2019t have to be interested in being part of my community to realize that our country must support education, health care, and services for all of our most vulnerable members, including those with disabilities. You just have to understand basic principles that tell us not to be penny-wise and pound-foolish.     That isn\u2019t really how I roll, to be honest -- I think you should care about protecting vulnerable citizens not because they might or might not turn out to disprove Einstein\u2019s theories, but because they are human beings, and we are all one big human family. But if you have to make it about money, then maybe that\u2019s just your own vulnerable special need, and I\u2019m willing to look past it to help you learn, because we all need and deserve some help and inclusion in this life.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.indystar.com/article/20110320/LOCAL01/103200369/Genius-work-12-year-old-studying-IUPUI"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/04/awareness-is-so-money.html", "title": "\nAwareness is So Money\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "body": "\nI started this blog three years ago. Then... I was scared. I felt hopeless. I needed to unload, be heard, connect, find comfort, hear from others, cry. I cried every way you can, and never seemed to run dry. My son seemed to struggle every waking minute, and sometimes while he slept, to regulate, cooperate, interact, communicate, find his balance, be. I wrote to seek, I wrote to salve, I wrote to save. I had no life. I did not have a clue. Now... I worry. But less. I worry like I did 8 years ago, or 10, but not like three years ago, when worry had me by the throat. I hope. A little. Not brazenly. I have not forgotten the deities who remain out to get me, but we maintain a wary settlement for now. My son regulates, cooperates, interacts, communicates, and finds his balance sometimes, and I accept the process, and his autism, more and more when he struggles. I write for pleasure and for work, to help and to heal, sometimes for myself and sometimes for others, when time permits. Our lives feel full. I am getting a clue. Yesterday I took a walk with a dear friend. We live a few streets apart and try to find at least a day or two a week to hit the neighborhood bike path for exercise and friendship. We talk about work and family. I asked about her husband's work. \"That reminds me,\" she said. \"He has a co-worker, a woman with a four-year-old who got an autism diagnosis last week\" I told her, \"Have her call me. I'll do anything I can to help.\" It is my turn, after all, and I have learned some stuff that might be useful. I never turn down a chance to help another mama the way the mamas of the blogosphere help me. My friend and I walked and moved on to other topics. Yesterday I took my daughter out to lunch with her classmate S and S's mom. \"Is Peaches an only child?\" she asked. \"No? Where does your son go to school?\" I told her about our Rooster, and she asked, \"What do you think caused his autism?\" I told her my thoughts, my uncertainties, my questioning process, and my one conviction: \"I know parents who believe they know what caused their child's autism. And I just try to respect where they are coming from, even though I don't have any answers or might see it differently. It's a hard road, and everyone has to find their way as best they can. Autism is not just one thing. And there is not one right way to think about it.\" Three years ago, the blogosphere embraced me, embraced my family -- my Rooster, my Peaches, my husband and me. They listened to the turmoil, gave me space, sent me love, explained the tools and choices available, offered their own stories and feelings, and, best of all, painted a picture of a brighter future. They didn't promise fixes or tell me I could CURE my son if I did THIS or THAT the way they did, but they -- YOU -- told me that, no matter what happened, time could very possibly help us all in some measure. That, usually, odds are good that time does bring some ease.  Children grow. Families learn. Sleep comes. Development unfolds. Wisdom takes root. Usually. And for us, much of this feels true three years later. We found one good doctor, changed schools, endured two years of ABA, conquered late potty training, evolved our PT and OT programs, survived IEPs, made peace with the mysterious improvements that a GF diet does bring our son despite our inability to explain why. We tried horseback riding and music, quit speech, joined a social skills group and found a MeetUp. We sleep more, fight less, laugh some, and work hard. We have some friends. I asked our Rooster yesterday, \"What is autism?\" He said, very, very slowly, \"Autism is trying.\" It is ambiguous, but I like it. As I write this, one child screams and wails in the next room, and the other tries to soothe. Peaches, my NT almost-five-year-old, has flipped out because I spoke to her sternly, and because she is a drama queen prone to flipping out quite often these days. ABA has taught me she is an attention seeker of the highest proportion. Rooster, who clearly seeks to avoid her noise, offers a refrain of, \"Feel better, feel better... please stop crying... behave yourself! Stop crying!\" But if he only wanted to avoid the noise, he would walk away. He would take his toys to the playroom and be done. He comforts his sister because he loves her, he hates to see her sad. He comforts his sister because he can. Because he has empathy. Because he loves his family. Because, like the rest of us, he seeks peace. Three years later, I have a different lens, a different perspective in many ways. I don't expect my family to feel like a Little Bill cartoon or an episode of Seventh Heaven. I haven't given up hope that someday we will be maybe a little more Charlie and Lola and a little less Oscar-the-Grouch-meets-The-Simpsons. But forget about TV, three years later I just look at our family as our family, an example of one, a Casa de Rooster and Peaches. I see where we have been, who we are, and the journey we walk together, step by step. Today, my son read me a book. My daughter asked him to share a sticker from the goody bag he got yesterday at a party for kids on the spectrum. \"Okay,\" he said. \"You can have ONE. But only ONE.\" Today the sun came out in SoCal after days and days of downpour. Today  we get to stay home on a Monday. It's a three day weekend. It's a three year anniversary. It's a pretty good day, three years post autism diagnosis, and that is something to celebrate. And so I celebrate with this gift to myself: writing here at Rooster Calls.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/02/its-my-party-and-ill-blog.html", "title": "\nIt's My Party and I'll Blog...\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 22, 2011", "body": "\nBelieve it or not, the parent association meetings for my son's school take place at 6 PM on Friday nights.  Our school board member could not believe it either, but he came anyway, dined on cheap pizza and iced tea at card tables in the auditorium, and pitched his plans for a new span middle school in the district.  A pretty good-sized crowd turned out, and with my oldest in first grade, I expected to be a little bored as secretary taking notes about the middle school.  Then the Q and A started. The Q and A that made it the most memorable meeting I think I have ever attended... Are there special day classes at this new school? Because my son has special needs.  Are kids fully included? Because my daughter has autism. Is it going to remain open enrollment? Even for kids who have IEPs? Can you promise?  I have no idea what came over me but the meeting changed for me very suddenly. I went there to take notes and get home as early as I could to write a paper due Monday for a class I'm taking; I had wanted to fly under the radar quick and painlessly. But as I realized how many people in that room had kids with special needs, my heart started racing. I zoned out of their Q and A for a bit for some internal Q of my own.  She also has a kid in the inclusion program? You mean I'm not alone in that here, like I tend to assume? You mean there as so many of us? Why so many? All autism, or other diagnoses too? Can you hear how scared they are about the school in our district? We are, I mean? Why is it so hard? Are the NT families tuning out? Do they get it? Why can't we do more for kids, all kids? Why are the numbers soaring? Why are the dollars disappearing? What can we do? How long will it take?    I lost the thread of the room and I shot my hand in the air. I had no plan. I had to listen to what I said just like everyone else did because I didn't know where I was going.  I spoke louder than I planned, and slower than I am known for.  \"As the parent of a child with special needs, I get sick of being made so other all the time. And as an educator, too, I just want to say that it is past time that we all realized that all people have special needs. And that we all benefit when schools address all those needs to the best of their ability. Not  other  schools or  other  rooms in the school, not somewhere else, but everywhere, fully included. And there just are not enough options for meeting kids needs, not enough schools doing what needs to be done to help all learners, and I can't understand why not.\"  The school board member considers this new middle school his pet project, the thing he says he commits to making happen, hell or high water, during his term, through sheer determination to serve the needs of the constituents, and that is why he spoke to us on his third late work evening of the week, tired and dogged. But that focus shifted when I spoke, and the night seemed to crack open, and a new connectivity hatched as a result. I have no perspective on how others saw the night. But what happened next, for me, sent me reeling. The school board member engaged me. He agreed. He spoke with passion. He believes in inclusion, he cares about providing services, and he was willing to talk about this important concern instead of his middle school for a portion of the night.  At the end of the evening, I walked over to a mother who has a 10-year-old with autism. We clung to each other's stories like the only two English speakers who find each other in the whole of Asia after trying in vain to pick up either Mandarin or Cantonese. As we talked, the assistant to the school board member approached us cautiously. Young and beautiful and clearly career minded, she had put together the Powerpoint and served as an able sidekick to the school board member, but coming into the circle to chat she looked like a nervous deer. She stumbled through explaining that her sister recently died, leaving behind a nonverbal 8-year-old. Together, she and her mom needed to figure out what to do for this child to get him the services he needs. Business cards and iPhones and hugs circulated rapidly as we exchanged information before she left with the school board member.  The other mom and I walked to her car, then drove to my car, then said goodnight four times before I finally drove home. We talked about our dreams for our sons, our journeys with autism, how much we would love to start an inclusion model charter in the district, how we might involve the guy from the school board because he seemed to get it and want to help.  In the car, my husband called, wondering why on earth a parent association meeting would last past 9 on a weekend night. I wanted to tell him about the meeting. He asked what happened? What was it about? I tried to find the words to tell him. But what was it about? About a middle school. About inclusion. About community. About dreams. About possibilities. About autism. About parenting. About questions. About healthy food in the cafeteria. About government. About reform. About money, or lack of money. About local control. About children.  As secretary, I can tell you what HAPPENED at the meeting, but I guess what the meeting was about is determined by perspective --- the hat you wear, the cards in your hand, the agenda you care about.  But that makes sense. Because. we. all. have. special. needs.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2011/01/we-all-have-special-needs.html", "title": "\nWe All Have Special Needs\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, January 16, 2011", "body": "\nWe here at Casa del Rooster are doing, er, um -- okay -- these days, in case you visit this blog regularly and have been wondering. You know \"okay\"? Okay, as in, the Rooster's Mama has never seen a half full glass? Okay, as in, shhhh, never tempt a jinx. Okay, as in a song a dear friend gave to me: I just wanna be OK, be OK, be OK today.  Yeah, enough said about that. But on a recent okay day, I found myself rushing through the grocery store, focused on my list mantra: milk, chicken, fruit, lunch box stuff... milk, chicken, fruit, lunch box stuff... milk... Then a lady stepped in front of me to get some cheese. I think: I know her, I know her. From where? How do I know her?  Who is she ? She moves to the next aisle but I stand rooted. It's important. I can see her in my mind, and she has something to do with the Rooster. I pass right by the chicken I need and slowly head to the aisle I think she chose. Yes, there she is again, with her list, her white hair. I close my eyes for a moment. Yes, I see her now. It has been, what, three years? Four years? Am I slow to recall her identity because my aging mind forgets more and more as I approach 40, or because my defiant heart didn't want to budge from its perch in an okay day to visit a painful memory? She is one of the doctors from our old pediatrics office. Not our own former doctor, the young Dr. S, but his older partner. The one everyone told us balanced things out -- you get the young Dr. S who has small kids, a big heart, infinite energy, and the latest greatest knowledge, and you get his older partner, doctor J, who has a grown child and all the experience you will ever need. Seeing this doctor pick out apples should not be enough to knock me off my okay perch. And it's not, really, overall. I will still ring up my groceries with the adorable guy who always has something nice to say, and I will still smile at all the grocery jokes they make at TJ's. I will still go home and enjoy making my kids a healthy snack from the bounty I just bought. I will still watch my son and marvel at his recent improvements, his growth, his hard work. I will still have an okay day even when my kids skirmish a bit, and I will still  be okay, be okay, be okay  with my kids snuggled up on either side of me for a bedtime story. But for a moment in the grocery store, fragility seizes upon me in the produce aisle. The memory of fear, isolation, loneliness, fatigue, failure, and desperation is not okay. A missed diagnosis, unreliable medical care, insensitive remarks, arrogance, disregard for developmental knowledge in pediatrics, wasted time, needless tests, horrible referrals, bad attitudes, selfishness... who knew how barely below the okay surface these old injuries could live? I circle back to where I started to get that chicken on my list. I do not speak to the doctor, and she has no idea who I am or why for a moment I had to close my eyes and hold on to my cart. And that is okay with me. I only hope that she and her partner both remembered what I said when I quit them, three or four long years ago now:  The next time you meet a child like mine, a child with autism, I expect you to do right by that child, by that family. I expect you to listen to them, hear them. I expect you to diagnose them. I expect you to help them. I expect you to provide resources to them. Because that is your job!

If you look at that letter now, you can see all the signs that it made its reader crazy -- the paper has clench marks, some tear stains, maybe a drop or two of my blood... \"With a heavy heart\" the principal wrote that my boy's first grade teacher will not return after winter vacation. I should say, my boy's SECOND first grade teacher. His first teacher lasted about a month before she left for a job at a better school, where her kids attend. They did not replace the first teacher, they just took the whole class and added to another. In one fell swoop my kiddo lost the experienced and highly regarded teacher I'd begged the universe for, the classroom I'd helped him transition into, and the small class size. He landed in a different room on a different floor with an inexperienced young thing trying to handle 28 first graders, including some who had made life nightmarish for Roo in kindergarten. Now, she's gone too, and I called the principal urgently requesting contact with the third string before school resumes in what seems like a year and a half (or on January 10) after this lengthy winter break that helps nothing but the pathetic budget.  So, tomorrow my husband will take Rooster by the classroom to meet New Teacher #3. We worked for several hours today composing a letter to #3 about our expectations. It goes something like this: Welcome, please try to last longer than Lee Press on Nails. Our boy has autism, and we know more about him than you do. We are sick of getting the run around. We pay an ed therapist a lot of money because she knows what she is doing, and none of the teachers here seem to. We've brought her in for meetings with the other revolving cast of characters and explained how her strategies help our guy with academics, especially math. Use them. Like, on Monday, when you start. Use. The. Strategies. They aren't rocket science. They are simple and they work and you will use them. The IEP says you need to help out. Read it. Help out. Do your job. We will be in touch. Lots and lots of in touch. In your mail box. In your email. On your phone. In the homework folder. Often. One of us works right across the street, and can run fast, find you in heartbeat. Want us to go away? Gladly. Then stick around, use the strategies, read the IEP, help out, and do your job. Our boy has autism, not the plague. He's sweet, cute, and he works his butt off. Sincerely, Rooster's parents, the Bears Does anyone have $46,000 I can borrow? Um, annually? I heard of the perfect private school for my boy, only it has one problem. Or make that 46,000 problems.

Since apparently someone has been plying Peaches with Miracle Grow, I thought we should duck in and grab her a new pair of kicks that fit. About a month ago, Roo got new shoes, so I had no plans to get him any yesterday. Of course, then he spied the light up shoes with skulls on them, and his sister says, \"You HAVE to get those, Rooster, they are so much cooler than your OLD shoes.\" Thanks, Peach. Suffice it to say, my boy lost his marbles that I would not give in and buy him an extra pair of $50 shoes that he does not need and I find aesthetically abysmal. He cried all the way home and told me about 600 times that he HATES the OLD (more expensive, bought just one month ago, light up, cute) shoes because they stink and he would throw them in the garbage. I did not back down one centimeter and gave him the same reminders all 600 times. (Not looking for opinions on that one, just saying.) When he threw his shoes in the trash, I made him take them out, apologize, and listen to my speech about appreciation, money, etc... Cut to this evening. Although I am Jewish and my kids and I light candles, we also have a Hanukah bush and will open presents tomorrow morning in our play room. (Guilt, guilt, guilt.)  So I suggested maybe we already have too much stuff and maybe we should do a quick sort and organize. Peach says, \"What do we do to organize?\" So I suggest we look through our stuff and decide what to keep, what to throw out, and what to give to other people who might need or want the stuff we aren't using. Rooster appeared engaged in playing with toys. Without missing a beat, though, he looks me right in the eye and says very calmly, \"I have some stinky shoes I want to give somebody who wants them. They can HAVE them.\" I don't know if that READS funny at all, if you can picture the scene or you had to be there, but I can tell you it took me 10 minutes to breathe again because I laughed so hard it was silent, and the kids looked worried I might keel over. So, autism. Maybe it causes some perseveration and tantrums here at casa del Rooster. Maybe it gives me worries that keep me up at night. But I think we spit in its eye tonight. Go, Rooster.

{"date": "Saturday, December 4, 2010", "body": "\nAs I type, I try to block out my son's screaming tantrum. We rarely sees these  ragefests anymore, but they sure bring back old memories. We used to see this nightly. Now we go long enough between them that I can no longer recall when he last turned red as a tomato and slammed every door in the house like this. So you think I'm upset? Frustrated? Angry? I'm not. It's fascinating on so many levels.  First, as he stomps and screams and paces, his sister calls out prudent advice. \"Take a deep breath,\" she suggests. \"Do you want me to tuck you back in?\" she offers. She modulates her tone of voice. She asks me for guidance. Shazam, my girl returns! Just like we haven't seen the Rooster act out much lately, we also haven't seen that sweet, gentle girl we call the Peach, either.  And I'm fascinated about how these things are coming together.  For a few weeks I've worried and lamented all about Peaches and her inescapable change in personality. She gets in some trouble in preschool, she acts out at home, she seems sensory seeking, she becomes remarkably hyper, she crashes into everything she can find, she puzzles us and her teachers, she gets distinctly LOUDER. Then, a few days ago, I picked her up from after-school care and she hands me a pile of adorable holiday cards she drew. \"Thank you!\" I cooed. \"I love them!\" She stares at me and says, \"They are not for you! They are for the HELPERS. You have to MAIL THEM.\" Ah, a clue. On Halloween, we'd said goodbye to the \"helpers,\" our ABA therapists who felt like they lived with us for two years. I begin to wonder if Peaches misses them, misses the structure, misses the attention she got when her brother's ABA included her. Fast forward a few days, and NPR has a story on siblings and why they tend to vary so much in personality. One theory ties in to Darwin, and generally follows the notion of specialization of species. Roo came along first and took the role of Tantrum King, so Peach came along to be Princess Perfect. Well, not always -- Pixie Mama can attest to Peaches not always living up to her name -- but now that Roo is doing much better overall, Peaches has plummeted. And it all makes some sense.  Tonight, before the Rooster flipped out because his daddy denied him some candy, I thought about these recent changes, and I asked Peaches, \"How do you feel when Rooster behaves himself better than he used to?\" She shrugged and looked down. \"Peaches, how do you feel now that Rooster doesn't need helpers anymore?\" She shrugged again. \"Sweetie, how do you feel when people tell Roo how great he's doing?\"  She looked at me. \"I'm not doing great?\"  Ahhhh. Can't believe I didn't see this all coming.    And then within an hour, the candy rage ensued. And there came my girl out of hiding, gentle and maternal and in charge.  I need to do a better job at balancing my kids' needs. I need to give them both room to specialize in excellence. I need to remember what we learned about ABA and the need for attention. I need to brush up on my Darwin.  The screaming just stopped. We all survived the fit.

{"date": "Saturday, November 20, 2010", "body": "\nWe wrapped up a chapter in the book of Rooster's autism, and for us this means we come home at the end of the school day like free citizens. Yes, friends, we have graduated from ABA. For almost two years, I hightailed it from work to pick up each grumpy, noncompliant child, fought my way through LA traffic, and pulled in my driveway to find a therapist waiting for us to start part two of our work days.  When we started, we thought if we got nothing out of ABA but potty training, it would be worth it. We got a lot more than that. Roo learned to tie his shoes. To take turns. To sequence ideas. To stay on topic. To play games. To be a friend.  I can't say ABA did it all, but Friday when I picked him up from school, a little girl with pigtails abandoned her place in the jump rope line to race over and give him a hug before he left. Today we carried on a long and meaningful conversation about why he cannot quit going to his math tutor. And this afternoon he played a great monkey game with me while we got assessed for the next chapter -- AKA social skills classes. Ah, yes. We won't be slowly galavanting home every day all of a sudden. But during the holiday season, we plan to live a little freer, enjoy our newfound ease.  I remember right before we started I told the members of my autism Meet Up group that we had just been approved for 15 hours a week of ABA. \"Oh!\" several moms remarked. \"Well! We will miss you! See you in a couple years!\" I am looking forward to seeing them again. They were right. We stopped going to meetups because ABA took all our nights, and we saved weekends for chores, family time, tutoring, and horseback riding. This week, we ate dinner in a restaurant! Like regular families! Friday night I even took the kids to the holiday parade. Ah, to be a bird released from its cage... I did not love ABA, but I have to say I feel really happy we did it. We struggled significantly more than the family on Parenthood, to be sure, and I longed for the privacy to eat dinner in my pjs once in a while, but ABA gave us some worthwhile tools, strategies and structure. For Roo, the programs did not look like the DTT programs I expected from my limited knowledge of ABA. Mostly, his ABA focused on play therapy. And while he didn't conquer every challenge, he took it as far as he could in the realm of playing with his sister, his therapist, and me every day. Now we're ready to try it with four kids in a social skills class. But get this... social skills is once a week. And. (Are you ready?!) I. Can. Drop. Him. Off.  Peaches has waited almost her whole life for some undivided mommy attention, and as Roo's behavior improved, hers fell apart completely. If she qualified for play therapy too, believe me I'd sign her little self right up pronto, but since her only diagnosis is stubbornness, I'm going to try to work some one-on-one magic with her my own ABA-trained self.  I think this could be a good new chapter.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/11/chapters.html", "title": "\nChapters\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 2, 2010", "body": "\n You are a big baby. No, don't take it as an insult. I'm a big baby too. Proudly.  It's like Sandra Cisneros says in her wonderful book of vignettes called the House on Mango Street.  \"What they never tell you is that when you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two and one...  Because the way you grow old is kind of like an onion or like the rings inside a tree truck or like my little wooden dolls that fit one inside the other.\" So I for one want people to remember that sometimes I'm a baby, a teenager, a bride, a middle-aged mama, all at once; I am determined to remain more mindful that those around me are needy preschoolers, gawky tweens, ambitious college kids, even when their years outnumber mine, because it helps me remember our humanity. I am tired of my own intolerance toward people, and I am exhausted of the intolerance I witness. We tend to talk about children like they are sacred members of society  but only until they become adults. W hat then? Yes, I see children as sacred. And the children you and I once were did not die, we simple grew our onion skins around them, some layers thicker than other; we too should respect the sacredness of one another.   I write this on election night, as I watch malicious slander turn democracy into a competition of who you most want to vote against, a contest of the lesser evils. For once I found myself almost able to imagine not using my rights and exercising my responsibility to go to the polls. Almost. (But my inner adolescent caved to the peer pressure on Facebook, the little girl in me listened to my grandma's voice inside my head, and  my six-year-old self needed to wear that \"I Voted\" sticker to school today.)   I write this after overhearing one educator  completely out of patience with a peer, disparaging their colleague  in a way they would never treat a child in their classroom. If they heard their students speak in a like manner, they'd pull out some social stories and teach some important lessons! Don't get me wrong, I espouse the idea, \"You ought to be old enough to know better.\" Adults should act like adults - responsible, knowledgeable, reliable - and adults should face consequences for childishness. But by that same token, self-centered name calling IS childishness. Petty bickering, tug-of-war selfishness IS childishness.  All I'm saying is that, as adults, we can talk until infinity about the importance of inclusion in schools, anti-bullying measures in high schools and colleges, and friendship circles for kids, but we err when we think the cutoff for those needs comes at age 13 or 18 or 21. We (and I mean me, too) need to respect the feelings and the value of each and every person, big babies or small.  I am a big baby, and I endorse this message.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/11/baby-talk.html", "title": "\nBaby Talk\n"},

A few days later, a letter comes from the bank. Thank you for the deposit of those checks, the letter says, and here is your corrected math...  Hey, I can't throw stones -- I took only college algebra, reveled in my B, and ran as far from the math building as I could to get my BA.  My boy, with double vision until almost 4, holding his head tilted and turned to help his brain make sense of the world, never had a real fighting chance at number sense with the DNA we gave him. Not that ADHD and autism help much, either. And, can you say, dyscalculia?  Every day, I sneak the same question into a conversation with my Rooster. It's always, in essence, 2+2. Sometimes I make it into a word problem. I've invented a character named Two Head Fred. Guess how many eyes he has? Cookies get involved. Legos. Two for you and two for me. His shoes and Peaches' shoes. Now, of course he is on to me. But in all sincerity, he looks at me daily and says, \"2+2? Mom? I don't know? Five? Free?\" He can't do TH sounds yet either.  Yes, yes, we have the Touch Math curriculum. Sure, sure, we've tried songs about math. Oh, of course we bought the stuff from Melissa and Doug. Absolutely I have Unifix cubes. What do you mean did we get a tutor? You betcha. YouTube? Watch it. Gotta love School House Rock. My husband bought a supply of nuts and bolts to use high interest manipulatives in patterning and sequencing practice. But so far, it ain't adding up for Roo. \"Um, one? Seven?\"  Sometimes I panic. Sometimes I lose patience. (Yes, me.) Sometimes I freak out. Sometimes I get lazy and let things slide.  Here is what works best, if not for Roo, then for me: I look back at the Pile. You know, the documentation. The assessments. The report cards. The lists. The bad reviews, as it were. I remind myself that we had days when we wondered if he could GO to school. You know, as in handle a day? And I thought he might be going to the prom un- potty trained for a while there. And reading, which has a LONG WAY still to go, came a long, long way in the last few months. Today my boy and his sister built a castle out of pillows and only fought about half the time that they laughed and conversed. Today Roo and his dad cooked gfcfsf corn dogs, and Roo wrote down his version of the recipe. Today I am reminding myself: all will be revealed in time. Don't go miscounting the chickens just yet. I mean, what works best for me? Keeping in mind that everything is relative. What works best for me today is this: If dyscalculia turns out to be our biggest problem, life could be worse.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "body": "\nI have the Lincoln house on my mind.  When Peaches was a baby, we began outgrowing our first adorable little house. In SoCal buying a house ain't easy if you aren't a media mogul, but we scraped together what we needed and started looking. A expert finder, I spied a great little yellow house on Lincoln Street before our hot shot agent could say Open House. Oh, so cute was this yellow house. Old, full of character, a master bedroom to envy, a master bath to lock yourself in and refuse to exit. I wanted the yard for my kids, the hardwood floors, three bedrooms. Unfortunately, one of the three? Smaller than your closet. And there were a few other small flaws. Like the kitchen? Old, but without the charm. And without the dishwasher. And without a few other major things. But! I found it! Affordable three bedroom! Fast! Ta da! Bird in the hand! Yes, this one!  My agent might not find with my speed (who can? I met my husband online! I'm a super searcher!) but he does know real estate. First, he said, you have to sell your own adorable little house. So, with his help, we quickly did. But in the course of those short weeks, someone else got our Lincoln house. Sold. I panicked. Now we had a buyer for our too small house and nowhere to go but limbo. For several days, maybe two weeks, I turned myself into knots. My husband likes to tell me, \"You are a twister.\" Even more than a finder.  Finally, I found the place we call home now. The minute I saw it, check marks went Ding! Ding! Ding! in my head. Yard, bedrooms, kitchen, a bathroom to lock yourself away from humanity. Check check check, ding ding ding! Better than the Lincoln house? Yes, except for one thing. This house fell within the behemoth school district. Not the small, warm, friendly, cozy, Mayberry district of the Lincoln House, just blocks away. Still, Peaches would have room to grow past two feet tall in this house, she would have a room with a closet instead of having a closet for a room, and we could make the numbers work before we landed on the street. Sold.  Flash forward a few months: Rooster gets a diagnosis. And, guess what? Turns out that the behemoth district? It has services. Lots and lots of services. The cozy district I wanted so badly for my kids? They are the ones who had missed his diagnosis completely. They would have offered my boy no help. Funny how some things do work out for the best in the long run despite twisters and their panic attacks.  Lately, I keep thinking about the Lincoln house for solace. See, I've been wanting things again lately. I've been reaching for things, good things that seem like a pretty good match for our family's needs despite a few small flaws. But I haven't been getting those things I want. And I feel on the brink of panic, fearful of outgrowing my shell or winding up in the streets.  Breathe, I tell myself. Breathe, and turn down Lincoln Street. See? That house stands as a symbol, if you choose it to be one. It was a good house, but something better came along. Something that turned out to fit better. Something with unexpected bonuses. It just took time.  I'm letting go of Lincoln houses, and trying to be patient.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/10/real-estate.html", "title": "\nReal Estate\n"},

I'm up early and up late, I'm trying new things and trying for new things, and I'm very, very, very me lately. I think a lot less about autism and a lot more about autism. The struggles change, the struggles stay the same. I never knew how MUCH this journey would be, and I'm not sorry one iota, but my hands stay full. How are you?  How ARE you?

I love knowing that some of my favorite bloggers are taking the show on the road, publishing here and there and everywhere.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 19, 2010", "body": "\nWhere have I been? It's a good question, to which I have only inadequate answers. I have not, however, been in Metropolis  waiting for Superman . We all know I am not that naive. He ain't  comin '. Fortunately, though, I did get a chance to  go to the documentary with my blogger friend , and as a special needs Mama, I just have to state the obvious: I don't know anyone in this community who believes Superman is coming to make schools the places that they should be to properly include all kids with special needs. Not Superman, not the government, not Oprah, not a miracle. As a teacher, I say to you: Our public schools are broken. Our children are not. Our system is flawed, but our children are beautiful. We must do what we can for our kids, despite the fact that it's overwhelming, that there is no map, no clear destination. As a teacher I say to you that our children are more than just our future. They are right now. They need us. As a teacher, as a mother, as a voter, I am not sure what to do, but \"nothing\" is not going to cut it. Now, in case you've recently been under  kryptonite , Waiting for \"Superman\" is Davis Guggenheim's look at our public school system and how, among other things, a handful of heartbreaking families struggle to escape sure catastrophe (their local schools) by hoping to win the lottery that is the charter system. Having taught in public and private schools, and having observed charters, I wanted to see this film once I heard the buzz. I heard words like \"depressing.\" I heard assessments like \"beating up teachers.\" I heard \"indictment of unions.\" I heard, \"Public schools suck.\" I have a child in public school. I have a child in private school. I have an interest in them attending a nearby charter school in the future. I visited the first KIPP classroom in Texas while serving in Teach for America. I needed to see this film. One of the film's  protagonists  explains his own realization that no Superman would come rescue the disaster public schools have become, and I believe that is true. The overall situation is dire, and it is worse than dire overall for kids who have physical, emotional, or developmental challenges. But no film is perfect. Not even documentaries are completely objective. You can't tell the whole shebang of education in the length of a feature film. I appreciated this film and what it shared, I think it's something you should watch and discuss, but it is not an A to Z picture. As lousy as the conditions are in schools today, as horrifying as the system is that gets me writing late night letters to the White House on their web site, what school really boils down to on a daily basis for most children is teachers. Good teachers make for good learning. I know good teachers. They aren't all in private schools. They aren't all in charter schools. There are teachers who are heroes. For many children, a teacher is as close as they will ever come to Superman. I don't want you to see this movie and think all teachers contribute negatively to the tragically unheroic system. I don't want anyone to believe teachers got us into this mess or refuse to get us out. And the beautiful, heroic kids in this film have families that have their backs. I am deeply thankful for that. But that is not the story in every household. Want to know what systems are as torn, twisted, mangled and maimed as the school system? (No, I'm not talking about health care, but that was a good guess.) Families. Let's say Education Superman made schools stronger, healthier, cleaner, safer, more resourced, and well staffed. So then all our kids would get good educations, go to college, thrive? Even the ones who live with challenges like homelessness, domestic violence, illness, substance abuse, neglect? We'd need Family Superman, too, wouldn't we? Schools have increasingly hard jobs in increasingly hard and complicated times. I don't have any answers, but I absolutely plan to keep asking questions. Why is the public school system broken? Why does government get it wrong over and over and over? How can we support teachers who make a difference? Where can we find the leadership we need? And why do we consistently fail our most vulnerable members of society? Are unions really the problem? Are charter schools really the answer? What about kids with special needs? We don't need to find a Superman or  Wonderwoman . We need a nation of them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://elizabethaquino.blogspot.com/2010/10/waiting-for-superman.html", "http://elizabethaquino.blogspot.com/2010/10/waiting-for-superman.html"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/10/daily-planet.html", "title": "\nThe Daily Planet\n"},

I want to write a book.  3. I have been dreaming about people lately only to wake up and find out something very important happened in their lives. I find that not at all cool or interesting but just creepy, and prefer to dream about Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia lowfat frozen yogurt with full fat hot fudge on top.  4. Lately I've been getting up at 5:15 to meet my neighbor and get in a power walk before school. (Before school? Before 20 million things. Before the marathon called our days.) Even writing that I \"power walk\" and \"at 5:15\" sounds weird to me. I really do that? Crazy. Doesn't sound like me at all.  5. People like to talk about my hair. Not me, other people. Some people worry about my hair being big and wild and crazy, and get frustrated by it. Not me, other people. Some people say it's really sad that it's getting way too gray. Not some people, just me actually. Some love it and stop me in the airport or whatever, and that's pretty cool. Okay, I've exhausted my thoughts on the hair thing, but someone else will bring it up today, guaranteed.  6. I miss blogging. I'm too busy. Right now I should be ashamed of myself for taking the time to blog. But I'm not. I am hurrying, though... 7. On my next birthday I will be 40 and for the first time ever I want to have a party.

There are, in fact, many answers. Ever since the word autism came into our lives, I have as many perspectives on events like birthday parties as I do hats to wear. It makes me feel a little dizzy and schizophrenic. I see each birthday party with the eyes a mother of two, a teacher, an OT, a behaviorist, of just plain old anxious me. The birthday party was: Fine. The birthday girl's family is adorable, and they have a lovely home. I managed the expected and unexpected obstacles with finesse, other kids melted down as much or more than mine, I had some adult conversations, some people barely noticed us, I remembered an alternative treat for the boy that pleased him, and no one got hurt.  Wheew . I'm tired, but all-in-all, not a bad day... Disappointing. It reminded me that no matter how far we've come, the other kids have come farther, and no matter how hard we work, we have so much more to do. My boy pushed a kid, called a child a \"loser,\" flipped out when the face painter closed up shop before he got his painted, and screamed at our hosts, \"I WANT A  GOODY  BAG! NOW!!!\" My daughter lost her shoes, stuffed herself full of sugar, and instigated an argument with her brother the minute we got in the car to head home. Inside the  goody  bags? Contraband. Uh-oh... who knows what was in that candy  Roo  gobbled up before I could stop him, but it said, \"Made in China\" on the bag, and nothing else. Terrific. I am so grateful. I know too many people for whom going to a birthday party is impossible or unthinkable. Every time I read the news, my blog reader, or Hopeful Parents, the shame I feel over my self-pity grows and grows. We had a beautiful day to be together and be with friends. Many of the people there offered us support and understanding, and I feel so appreciative. Therapeutic .  Roo  could bounce in the bounce house, swing in the play room swinging chair, and pet animals at the petting zoo. A ROOSTER walked right up to him, so purposefully, I kid you not! Hey, with that kind of therapy, we didn't even feel the need to drive to horseback riding therapy afterwards... a good thing with temperatures in the 90s.

The phone rings. My husband, at Children's Hospital with our six-year old son who has autism, tells me I handed him the wrong prescription this morning on his way out the door and he's hoping I can send a scan or photo of the one he needs for our boy's blood draw, ASAP. I set aside my computer, scramble for the camera, the script, the card reader... How did people survive without ubiquitous computing? In 5 minutes, thanks to numerous gadgets and some of my husband's charm, my husband has things underway at the hospital to check up on my son's blood... Peaches climbs from the tub, drips her way through the house, asks to be held like a newborn, helps me make a cheer up sign for her brother, refuses to sit more than six inches from me as she devours the opportunity for undivided attention. The boys return, and before the key unlocks the front door my boy makes it clear that he NEEDS to bake a pie. URGENTLY. He has had pie on the brain for days, so I prepared last night, stealing away during ABA to stock up on GFCF ingredients from two separate markets. Sadly, real GFCF \"pie\" is beyond my patience and skills as well as the inventory of both markets, but I know he will settle for \"crumble.\" With both kids as \"helpers,\" we manage to whip up apple crumble in about an hour, leaving the kitchen sorely worse for the wear. While it bakes, we eat carrots, sandwiches, chili, lemonade. Finally, the timer dings. A boy demands a melted marshmallow on his \"pie,\" and a Peach opts for ice cream. In the end, it's really only these toppings they like. The \"pie,\" or crumble, tastes too healthy for their liking. I end up eating more than my share. They tear through the house grabbing toys, wearing my very favorite blanket in the entire world over their heads as they play ghost, building structures on the coffee table, laughing, arguing, goofing around. It's barely afternoon. The house is a wreck. I realize no one brushed their teeth this morning. The TO DO list stretches long and foreboding... I pick up my netbook, with a blind eye to all else and a firm refusal to worry about blood panel results, and resume writing this, the formless blog post in front of you right now.

I grieved over the entries' references to torticollis, sleeplessness, colic, immunizations (not that I think they caused my son's autism), grumpiness, feeling different, doctors, tests, worry and anxiety, the feeling even when my son was 8 weeks old that things just were not right. I scoured the journals and indicted myself for not figuring things out sooner,  not doing more, not being a better mother. That is not why I turn to those journals now. Two and a half year post diagnosis, I find myself in a new place with autism and with parenting, and with both my children. I am coming to a place of acceptance that I am all done having babies. Now that Peaches is wearing 4T, I realize soon there will be no more \"Ts\" in my clothes shopping soon. My baby girl practically runs our household. My boy starts first grade soon. I am 39. Our family is complete. We've given away everything baby. I turn to those journals to remember the joyful times of babies in the house. I turn the pages to bring back the smell of baby, the coos and hiccups I wrote about with such joy in the good moments, to remember that I did take time to celebrate, to wallow in the happy moments. One coworker asked me over lunch about these crazy weeks of getting back to school, juggling both kids' crazy schedules and needs, and behaviors. While we all laughed at my ridiculous tales of dramas and chaos, a woman chimed in: \"Yeah, well I remember you about a decade ago doing lunch duty going on about if only you met Mr. Right, and all you wanted was to find a great husband, so....\" And I remember that too. And I don't dispute, amid all my kvetching and kvelling, that all my wishes came true. One the one hand, I have everything I ever wanted. On the other, I still find things plenty challenging. I am never going to be the person who is all that sorry for complaining -- it's part of my identity! it's deity insurance! -- but I fully recognize that some day down the line I will yearn for these very days that flatten me. As I flip through my old journals now, I treasure the references to cuddling, to firsts, to celebrations. I love that I chronicled who visited  us, what my kids  wore, how we laughed. I don't keep those journals any more, but I do have this blog. When I completed my first year of blogging, I found myself rereading my first posts, again like a detective, looking for evidence: were we or were we not making progress? How much? But some day I will be rereading these posts to revel in when my children still said ridiculously funny things I could put in Notable and Quotables, when they were first starting school, when they were still wearing sizes with letters in them. My husband has an expression: Enjoy your vigors. I was thinking of that when I decided not to clean the house tonight, not to fill out paperwork, but to blog. This is where I'm enjoying  the vigors, not of my youth, but the youth of my kids, right now. In that spirit, I am leaving this is a journal letter that my future self can enjoy... Dear Rooster and Peaches, The days are getting shorter again, and even though the nights still feel hot often, you can feel some fall in every morning. You wake up sweetly lately, Roo's footsteps quickly sounding his rush to the bathroom before piling in our bed, Peaches asking for breakfast and attention. I love the way you are starting to do such big things independently: the way you brush your own teeth, pick out our own outfits. I love how you both ask more and more questions. Today Peaches asked, \"Was is better a long time ago in the old days, or is it better now?\" I love how Rooster is trying to control impulses, and feels sorry when he makes a bad choice. Roo, you asked me yesterday, \"I'm still a good guy, right  mommy? I'm not naughty?\" I assured you that even when you make a naughty choice, you are our sweet and good  boy, and that we love you a million percent. You love hearing how much we love you -- so Big!! -- and you love our kisses.  You love Super Why and you are proud of learning to read. Peaches, you love attention, back scratches, music, and collecting. Mostly, you love attention. You are all about princesses and pink. You are proud and how quickly you learn, and you are good at numbers. We had a decent summer, and I have some back to school anxiety, but I am very proud of both my boosties, and I am so happy to be your  mom. Love, Mommy\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/09/vigor.html", "title": "\nVigor\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 30, 2010", "body": "\nDear Teacher, We haven't met yet, but since I'm a teacher, too, I am imagining we have some things in common. As the school year is about to start, I bet you are gathering materials, organizing supplies, and thinking, thinking, thinking. I wouldn't be surprised if you fall asleep at night making lists of things you need to do, then wake up in the morning wondering about too many administrative details to count. I bet you feel pressures in every shape and size due to budget cuts, bureaucratic red tape, reform efforts that make the local, state and national news daily, and a pile of memos clogging up your email. I can guess you feel at least a little sad to see the summer end, and a little wary of the heavy lifting that lies ahead, even if, like me, you adore your job.  For me, when I am feeling so many things at a chaotic time, it can be hard to remember that other people coming at the chaos from a different direction have their own swirling emotions that might collide with my own.  My little boy is about to be your student. He doesn't much want to gather any materials, and as hard as you have worked to gather your supplies, he isn't going to be as thrilled to use them as we would all like. He's six, has no concept of a budget or the impact of its reduction, and in fact he's more than a year behind his peers in math skills; actually, we'd be happy to see him grasp one-to-one correspondence. This summer he got his fourth pair of glasses fixed for what seems like the thousandth time, because we're desperately trying to help retrain his eye muscles in the hopes of avoiding a second surgery, and while you might have concerns about his reading and writing being below grade level, we are simply blown away by how tremendously far he has come through constant effort that only increased since school let out in June. While he enjoyed his summer time, he didn't exactly go on vacation -- he did tutoring twice a week, ABA behavior therapy five days a week, social skills classes, and day camp. He learned from every single thing. This summer our boy worked diligently to learn lots of important things, like how to ride a horse, take turns, identify coins, hold his temper, draw pictures, play board games, and even play some sports, and he is starting, very gradually, to learn to swim.  We aren't helicopter parents, we are just a working mom and dad trying our very best to raise both our children and help our son on his journey with autism. And as fall approaches, we think about the coming year throughout our days, too. We are watching the calendar with anticipation just as you probably are. We wonder if we are ready. We wonder if we've done enough to support our son, knowing he will start off behind. We wonder if we prioritized the right things, and if we've let him have enough room to be himself. We wonder about you, too. We wonder if you will see our boy, beyond his diagnosis, and how you will feel about including him in your classroom. We wonder if you will see how much we have in common as we head into fall, all a little nervous, all wanting the best for the year ahead, but all with our own backpacks full of needs, concerns, wishes, and fears.  Sincerely yours, Rooster's Mom \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/08/tis-season.html", "title": "\nTis the Season\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, August 22, 2010", "body": "\nI don't want to talk about the end of summer and the back to school season, but there really isn't much choice. Tomorrow the faculty return to work at the school where I teach, and while I never did have a vacation, I did work days an hour shorter than usual, and I will miss that as I resume staying until 4:30. A week from tomorrow, Peaches starts her last year of preschool. And two weeks after that, the Rooster starts first grade. So, denial or not, here comes transition season. Verklempt. We have had some firsts in these parts. Right now, my little girl is away from home for the first time. She and her grandparents are taking a trip a few hours away to visit family for most of the week. We left her today, and as I type, I am waiting to hear that they arrived at my brother-in-law's house safe and sound after their four hour journey. That waiting thing can be blamed on the poor quality of this post... I'm half here, writing for distraction. I am also trying to distract myself from my stress of being a student again. Six weeks ago I started a one-year program to earn another credential, and I turned in a big paper today, with another big paper due on Friday. These are very rigorous courses and I love them yet find myself counting down each week; 46 more to go. All the writing for my credential can be blamed for the scarcity of my posts these days. This past week, my husband took the kids to his parents' house for several days while I got some of my work done. It was an unusual week for me, for us, but a good one. My husband's parents are wonderful grandparents, and they all had a good time hanging out together, swimming and playing, and I cranked out some serious business. When I went to join them yesterday, Rooster had learned a bit more \"swimming\" (though he still wears his floaties) and I noticed some better impulse control, some leaps in language. All these firsts can be blamed for me feeling a little more emotional today, a little mushy and sentimental. So I'm pointing my finger and placing blame every which way, but the real truth is: We're going back to school, and all the transitions freak me out. I feel like I'm falling down the rabbit hole.

She came home Friday after reportedly being on excellent behavior all week, and we were thrilled to get her back. What a strange week it was while she was away, and how revealing. When our boy has our undivided attention, he charms us silly. Without a peer around, he has no conflicts. When he doesn't have to share, he has amazing manners, all pleases and thankfulness. When he's getting the things he wants, the word \"no\" disappears from his vocabulary. When his sister goes away, he speaks of her with tenderness and longing. Wow. When his sister returns, of course, some things go back as they always were, but even that brings surprises. How is it that I am still shocked that my son has autism? How does it still catch me off guard? Because once his NT sister, two years younger, shows up at is side, a contrast is inescapable, especially as we hear how Peaches spent the week doting lovingly on her baby cousin (two years her junior). And with a peer around, our boy has conflicts - oh boy does he. He finds sharing a huge challenge. He screams \"NO!\" Compliance evaporates. He says \"mean words.\" More than anything, I am happy to have everyone together under one roof again, and I'm so grateful to my inlaws for hosting our littlest for a week, but I am also processing all this transition.

{"date": "Sunday, July 25, 2010", "body": "\nI have never been much of a movie enthusiast, to say the least -- I might see 4 films in a year. Why? (I am asked this a lot here in Hollywood, with people's mouth agape in horror.) Beats me, really. Partly I prefer to read. And that is probably tied to my dislike for the emotional entanglement and the too visual environment of big screen films. I prefer to use my imagination, pace myself, skim when I need to, come back again when I want... I don't avoid hard topics when I read, but I do when I watch movies. I don't know how many times I've read (and wept through) The Diary of Anne Frank, but it took me several years to get myself to rent Schindler's List, and I made frequent use of my pause and fast  forward  buttons. I'm grateful to own the a copy of Anne Frank, but glad I've forgotten much of Schindler's List, which I never plan to see again. I have read many books about autism. I confess that sometimes I've trudged and sometimes I've skimmed the most painful ones, and sometimes I've had to read through a curtain of tears. Since the Rooster's diagnosis, though, I have not watched any film depictions of autism. Of course, there aren't that many, but I've also been conscious of my choice. My husband, on the other hand, has an entirely different relationship with film, and he works in the field. He has watched  Apocalypse  Now many times, and tried his best to foist it on me when we were dating, yet somehow we managed to stay together and get married anyway! He worked on the movie Saving Private Ryan, and he's hard to choke up in front of a screen. However, last week he came home from work not quite himself -- not quite as mellow and chill as is his natural, beautiful, even keel way.  Of course, I probed. Turns out for work he'd needed to screen Rain Man a few times. \"You know,\" he told me, \"I could see some of our boy watching Dustin Hoffman, and it hurt to see.\" My husband is steeped in optimism, and he has tremendous faith in our boy and his potential. He said he didn't look at the movie and fear for Rooster that he might face the same particular set of challenges of the character or the real man who inspired the film. It's not about that, and it's not about judging the character or the movie's inspiration. Instead, he ached, I believe, for the realness of the story, and, he told me that he grieved, \"for the what might have been, for anyone.\" Later that night, before bed, he brought it up again a different way. \"Sometimes I think we forget that we always carry it with us, it's always there every day, you know? You think you aren't thinking about it and then you watch Rain Man and you find yourself shocked that you want to cry, but it's always a part of us underneath the surface.\" I guess that's why I don't watch many movies at all ... I have plenty of over-exuberant empathy in a day without adding that, I have too many things, not just autism, just beneath the surface that I carry with me. I'm glad J doesn't carry around as much as I do. I think of  Apocalypse  Now and Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List and Anne Frank as tragedies. I don't think that way of autism. I think of it as one kind of reality, which has countless different faces, different experiences. Would I eradicate autism if I could? I am sure some people will be offended if I say I would be okay with that. But autism, which really has been  sucky  in my overall experience, has undeniably given us gifts as well, and our boy is a joy to know, so I do not think of his autism as a tragedy. Rain Man might just be a movie, but autism is a reality, and that's why I think J felt so moved.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/07/moving-pictures.html", "title": "\nMoving Pictures\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 5, 2010", "body": "\n Recently I took Peaches to the park to play with her best buddy and his siblings while Rooster was off at day camp. \"How is Rooster?\" asked the sweet dad on the play date. \"If you don't mind me asking, what is the prognosis for Rooster?\" No, I don't mind being asked -- I appreciate concern about Roo -- but I don't know what to say, exactly, either. We have many people who micro-\"ist\" our boy. By that I mean that we have people who deal with his this issue or his that therapy... they touch his trunk, his tusks... but I don't know how many really deal with the whole elephant in the room of where our journey might take us. Then again, did my parents know when I was six what my future held? Do any parents have a prognosis for the future of their kids? You have kids, then you hold on for dear life... you wait and see where the journey takes you, I guess. Sometimes I wish I had a crystal ball... Some of the ists in our life have tried to prepare us for the possibility of thinking about group homes one day, while others talk like they assume Roo is going to find some special Bill Gates or Steven Spielberg talent and take over some sliver of the world. And then there are a lot people who fall somewhere in between... Lately, Roo has taken to asking me, \"after first grade, THEN can I go to college?\" I overthought this perseveration for quite a while before I smacked my forehead with my palm and realized that when my boy gets stuck on something, a movie or a book can almost always be blamed. You probably got it faster than I did, since I confessed to you last post that I am so not a movie girl, but Toy Story 3 is the origin for the college obsession. (I love when my boy asks, \"When I go to college, can I come home and watch TV? Soon can I go to college?\") Well, we might not be ready for college come fall, but there are some big developments and a graduation of sorts underway. First, our boy is VERY GRADUALLY, and haltingly, and with lots and lots of support, reading his short little Open Court first grade books. Let's hear it for his AMAZING tutor, Ms. S. Wow, it's hard, and it's wonderful. I weep a lot. Roo gets exhausted a lot. We plod forward. Twice a week, he sweats and struggles and earns his giant sticker for tapping and blending, for sounding out, \"See Tim spin.\" Second, the talks have begun to plan a graduation from ABA in-home services. Wheeeewwww. No, his behavior isn't perfect, but we might have squeezed as much juice as we can from this lemon, so to speak.By Thanksgiving, we should have 10 hours a week freed up, after almost two years of \"helpers\" and programs. Next up, social skills classes. Math still mystifies our boy in a way that is beyond troubling. Numbers seem to have no significance to him. His four year old sister often tries to whisper the answer to the math questions we offer him or otherwise throw him a hint as subtly as, oh, a great big red hickey. Today I gave him a little word problem to ask him to add two plus two, and he goes, \"Three! Six? Umm, maybe 10? Can I have a snack? WHAT?!\" Meanwhile Peaches is all but thrusting her four fingers in his eyeballs. At camp, the Roo has a shadow, and she tells us he has been learning to play pickle and kick ball, do hopscotch, make Fortune Tellers (aka cootie catchers), and step dance, among other things. A few days I have needed to pick him up later than she can stay, and he has managed the last half hour of the day okay without her there, just hanging out with other kids his age. Last weekend, we discovered a place in the area that does FREE therapeutic horseback riding, and while Roo isn't exactly The Boy Who Loved Horses, he did pretty fantastic riding on Mark, the sweet white horse, with the help of three expert volunteers. After, we got to swim in the pool at the ranch, and while neither of my kids can swim yet, it's one area that our little guy is making progress faster than his sister. He still wears his floaties, but he's holding his breath and going under, blowing bubbles, practicing strokes and kicks a bit... he's not afraid of the deep water, and he's making progress. I have no idea what my son's long-term anything is, and I'm not going to even try to predict tomorrow. The words tomorrow and yesterday still confound him, and he has a poor sense of time. But I am very proud of him, and I love watching him grow, change. I think about his \"developmental disorder,\" but more I think about how far he has come. A year ago, who would have predicted my boy would be sitting straight and tall as instructed as he takes a horseback ride, reading to me proudly about spinning Tim, wanting to master hopscotch, holding his breath underwater? The long term prognosis for the rooster is that his mama is going to love him. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-next.html", "title": "\nWhat Next?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 23, 2010", "body": "\nTaking the time to write this post causes me guilt. Not taking the time to write this post would cause me guilt. When stuck between a rock and a hard place, I write. I faced a similar conundrum today. After two days of being part of a jury selection process, and two days of child care DRAMA that resulted in missing ABA for the Rooster both days, I found myself in the final minutes of court. It was after 4. The natives were restless. The prosecutor and defense attorney accepted the jury, and I had not been among the 12, though I was among those in the box. The 7-business-day trial would be able to start on Monday once an alternate was in place. The judge met counsel for a fast side bar, came back, announced juror 31 could be the alternate and we could all go home. As juror 31, I'd been dreading a moment such as this, and finally piped up in an 11th hour like I was in a movie or something. \"Wait! Your honor, may I say something? I already explained this in the jury room and they told me to tell it to you should the need arise. My son is six and he has autism. The state provides him with therapy he needs. It's called ABA. And I have to be there to be part of it. If I am on jury duty, he will not be able to have his therapy, and he needs it.\" The judge called the attornies to sidebar again. He returned, gruffly said, \"Juror 31 is excused.\" I paused, so he said it more firmly again. \"You are EXCUSED, juror 31.\" All day I'd been imagining being excused. I imagined trying to resist smiling, trying to look serious as I exited. I'd watched others leave celebrating and considered that tacky and disrespectful. Instead, I slowly drooped out of the courtroom. Not taking the time to do jury duty made me feel guilty. Taking the time to do jury duty would have made me feel guilty. I didn't expect to feel deflated by being excused. Quickly I did a gut check: I didn't like the idea I was \"playing the autism card.\" Everything I said was true, but should autism get me something other people want? Or get me out of something other people don't want to do? Mostly I felt confused. Why did I cry in the courthouse alcove? Was it just this guilt? Was I ashamed? Embarrassed? Why did it make me so sad that in our group of about 20 people, another woman leaned over to me and said, \"My son is ten and he also has autism.\" Why did it make me so emotional that another potential juror being excused as well grabbed me and hugged me in the badge-scanning line? Why did I need to call my husband from the parking garage to unload it all to him before I could manage to drive? Why did my husband tell me he felt a similar feeling, to a lesser degree, when he did the exact same thing in a courtroom a few months ago? We don't particularly WANT to do jury duty, but at the same time we wish we didn't have a free pass for such a challenging reason. It's hard to lay bare our issues in a forum like a courtroom. It's hard to say that we can't keep up with some responsibilities that others can because our plates are too full. I told the nice stranger who hugged me that my boy is doing okay, he just needs the structure and support of his therapies. I didn't want her to think we were facing bigger challenges than we are; I didn't want to exaggerate, and I wanted to let her know I am proud of my son. \"He's going to be okay,\" I said. \"I am sure he already IS okay,\" she told me. \"He has a mother who works hard to take care of him. He is your boy. He is okay. He is okay.\" Another woman had appeared quietly from nowhere. \"Things can always be worse,\" she said. \"Everyone has challenges. They come at different times for everyone. Don't feel bad.\" I couldn't keep my eyes dry. I have more questions than answers about why my day made me so emotional. The important things, though, that I take away are these: Maybe I shouldn't have taken the time from my homework to write this muddled post, but I feel better now that I did. Maybe I shouldn't have escaped my civic obligation to maintain the Rooster's support programs, but now that I've reflected on it, I know that I'm glad I did. I hope one day doing jury duty will be no big deal for our family. I like to imagine Rooster serving one day, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/07/excuse-me.html", "title": "\nExcuse Me\n"},

The only way I know to save myself is to purge here: We scramble to make arrangements. We quilt together child care plans. We hand off the baton in the knick of time to get Roo off in this direction, Peaches in the other, before we go to work. J gave me this  one, my favorite: \"We're barely laying the track before we're rolling over it.\" Somehow, through creativity and determination, amazing babysitters (of which we now have SEVEN in our arsenal!!!), kind  friends, and generous family, we're juggling 3 summer camps, educational therapy, new ABA schedule and new -ists, business trips for us both, and careers. We are bleeding child care money at heart-stopping speed, but seeing our kids benefit makes us believe we are investing as wisely as we can. Peaches and one babysitter hand squeezed us a large pitcher of lemonades from lemons off our tree, and she came home from camp this week having designed her own game. She has been full of smiles lately and noticeably less grumpy. Roo enjoyed a field trip to play mini golf with his social skills class, and brought home a daily evaluation form full of praise. They are sounding things out now and then, writing more and more. I am proud of my little ducks, and that makes it easier to endure the hours of careful calendaring, the intense commuting, the begging and borrowing, the expenses piling high. Should  I really click PUBLISH and tempt fate? Oh, no way. If I end on a positive note the deities will punish me. Here is the down side of  summer so far: - The social skills camp for spectrum kids that we love? Practically promised to set up a carpool program. Not so much. Pick up  is at 2:30. That is where the 7 babysitters come in, because I don't get home until 4. As if the camp didn't cost enough. - So far we have no plan at all for Peaches for all of August. - The rock star ed therapist? $150 an hour. - Every day one of my kids has some special day, like Water Play or Sports Share or Field Trip, requiring me to do 10 extra things. - I have vacation envy. It's just not in the cards for us to travel right now. There,  that's more like me.

The doc, who I swear I don't resent for being a couple years younger than me and ridiculously nimble in the witty banter department, chides me for neglecting my health and not racking up more copays. When I am nonplussed, she nails me. \"You want to take care of your kids?\" she asks. \"You need to take care of yourself. You are not young anymore.\" Wow. I don't disagree with a word she said. In fact, I agree too much. What day does it happen? Your 30th birthday, do you wake up not young anymore? Or is it less a date and more a milestone -- like once your child outgrows 18M clothes, graduates to 2T, you don't have a baby anymore? My husband laughed when I told him that the doctor drew blood I still needed, shot me in the other arm, then stabbed me through the heart with her honesty. \"She don't know nothin'\" he reassured me, knowing how I love a little Southern for comfort. But he's an LA boy. He also pulled out a little industry wisdom. \"I was listening to Dustin Hoffman talk about how they don't offer him lead roles at his age. He said, 'So I'm middle aged, what can you do?' And his father roared, 'Middle aged? How many guys you know who are 120 years old?!' Cheer up, babe. You're still plenty young.\" The grandmothers in my life lived into their nineties. Next month I will be 39. I'm not young anymore, it's true. I am middle aged. My babies will soon be too big for clothes with a T after the size. I feel funny shopping at the Gap. Sometimes, I confess, I buy from Talbots. When did this all happen? But the truth of the matter is: I have more in my life than I ever dared to hope. My cynical preteen self stared at the board game LIFE my cousins liked to play and believed in my heart that the little plastic piece of my life would never have more than my own pink peg inside it. The day I married my husband filled me with more joy than I thought a human body could physically contain without igniting. And tonight, because of what began as an annoying scheduling snafu and a sudden change in ABA services, we all found ourselves home for the day before dinner time, so we enjoyed a special meal around the backyard table, the California golden sunlight streaming through the branches of the camphor and lemon trees. Now, our bellies full of veggies, grilled pork chops, and fresh squeezed lemonade, we are each doing our thing. Peaches rides her scooter, Roo swings on his rope swing, J sips his Pacifico and smiles at me blogging on my netbook in my PJs. I don't too much mind not being young anymore, really. Like my mama likes to say, I earned these gray hairs that peek through my auburn mess. But my doc has a point about me needing to take care of myself. I do. We both want me to take better care of myself. She thinks it involves taking some pills, seeing one of her referrals, making more appointments, and maybe she's right. But for myself I prescribe missing more appointments, having more happy scheduling accidents, and spending time in the backyard with my family while my kids are still young.

Yes, I need to find a way to use something INTERNAL to lift me instead, but this week I had the good fortune to stumble on a book that served as a mighty crane to hoist me from the dumps. I got such a high from this book that, against my better reason, I must share it with those of you who might also find it useful. This book has nothing to do with autism. It is not intellectual. I found a typo. It is laced with profanity to the point that it uses an asterisk in the  title . PC it is surely is not. If I hadn't read it on my iPhone via Kindle, I might have hid it in my garage. But you know about the research on how laughing clubs in some parts of the world provide tremendous benefits to people on an emotional and spiritual, sometimes even physical, level? Yeah, you don't need to Google the nearest one or travel to another continent if you want to laugh and feel good, you just need to get this book and read it. I went from weary wallow to hysterical hiccups in under an hour. I escaped stress, fear, anxiety, and fatigue, and I didn't have to learn anything, or agonize, or analyze, or emote, or anything but just observe, relate, and laugh.

So, the book is called \"Sh*t My Dad Says.\" Sue me if it's a crime: It cracks me up. I'm already writing my next post in my head, about stuff my mother says... And I can't help but wonder if one day my kids will write something about stuff I say. It's a scary thought; I surely don't give them much funny material.

{"date": "Monday, June 7, 2010", "body": "\nCynics who avoid sentimentality? March on -- the grump is out. Come back next time. Come back June 9. Ten years ago tonight did not fall on a Monday, but a Wednesday, and I remember that because ten years ago tomorrow my life would change forever on a Thursday night impromptu date at a divey gay bar with the man who would become my husband. I can tell you, now that I've changed it, that I used to always use June8 as my password for everything. Before I learned about digital safety, it made sense: more than a date, \"June 8\" has become my mantra. My husband and I use it as shorthand. When one of us is sad, scared, worried, sick, in pain, or joyful, we can simply mention the date, and thereby share our support, comfort, love, and solidarity. You know those melodramatic movie scenes in hospital delivery rooms? Well, in our real-life version, I breathed June 8, self medicated by repeating it over and over... My husband and I might have taken a pass on birthing classes, but he knew just how to hold my hand and invoke our magic date and help me do whatever it took to bring our child into the world. On June 7, 2000, J was still the guy I'd just met online by searching a dating site for the keyword \"writer.\" (Sure, he had to be a nonsmoker and live in driving distance, but my priority? I wanted to meet a Word Boy.) After scanning through about 2000 guys, J was among 7 I took the time to email, one of two I gave my phone number, and the only one that I talked to so long the battery died on my cordless land line. After exchanging what felt like real correspondence online for weeks and having a conversation so satisfying it felt like a real date, J and I agreed meet on a Friday June 9 for Indian food. But on Thursday, when he called to firm up the time and place for our plan, he caught me in a bad mood. I explained that I resented how my close friend had just called and talked me into meeting her and her East Coast visitors at a local dive bar, that I was both getting ready to go and simultaneously brooding about how to get out of it so that I would not be up so very late on a school night. The real root of my brooding? I didn't want to be tired the next day when I would finally meet J for the first time. \"Don't worry about it,\" he told me. \"Just decide to go out tonight and have fun. If you decide to have a good time, you will.\" I insisted that the evening had zero potential for fun... unless... unless maybe... So, J and I spontaneously decided to move up our first date... we both went to the hipster bar that Thursday night on June 8 at 10 to meet my friend and her out-of-towners...  I got to the bar first, and saw from the window when J got out of his car and walked toward the door. I knew. We had only exchanged one photo each, but I knew J the minute I saw him. I knew as he walked through the crowd toward me that I would greet him with a hug, and I knew as I hugged him that I would care about him. I knew when he held my hand that night that I might fall for him. I knew when we said goodnight that something important had happened in the 3 hours we spent holding hands, talking. I knew, and he says he knew too. Maybe so -- we have never been apart in any real sense ever since. Eight years ago tonight was a Friday. We spent it out of town with friends and family who came to celebrate at what we loosely called a rehearsal dinner. The night epitomized what J and I describe as \"usness\" -- a warm gathering of good people with simple pleasures and heartfelt words. Since we were getting married out of town, I'd discovered the restaurant the way I had found J -- online. I'd found it through an intense search for just the right place by focusing on words... this restaurant was named for the fact that it is part art gallery, part book store. Ecclectic, unusual, perfect. And the perfection continued the next day, as on June 8, 2002, J and I walked ourselves down the aisle to Beatles music, exchanged vows we wrote ourselves, asked our friends and family to speak, and had his dad officially pronounce us husband and wife. A caterer we had never met, chosen for her company's name (Pure Joy) and online reputation, provided a picnic in the nearby park so inspired and delicious no one believed me when I told them how low she dropped her prices when she learned I taught children the same age as her little boy. (She also threw in extra desserts: \"Teachers deserve to have amazing weddings with excellent food,\" she proclaimed, and I agreed!) One of my dear friends had just launched her photography business and shot our wedding for her costs only; just recently her gorgeous work graced major national bridal magazines, but not with photos any more moving than the ones she took on our simple, beautiful, magical day. Tomorrow is June 8. Tomorrow is my favorite day, my favorite date. Tomorrow marks a decade of \"usness\" with the man who teaches me how to \"decide to go out and have fun.\" Tomorrow marks the beginning of the journey toward a Rooster and a Peach. Tomorrow I will not be blogging. I have a date. Cynics, see you June 9,when we will resume our regularly scheduled ranting. Happy anniversary, J.

{"date": "Sunday, June 6, 2010", "body": "\n (...\"Oh yeah, well, don't get so distressed. Did I happen to mention that I'm really impressed...\"  Sing it with me now...) The big news around here, in my opinion, is that my kids are beginning to read. We are talking small steps, but for me it still feels like a big deal. The Rooster's incredible inclusion teacher sent home a bunch of word family cards recently with a sticky note on top that said: Rooster can read! He read about 30 words to me from the cards, though it's still pretty hard for him. He struggles to keep focused, he struggles with his vision issues, he struggles with a few letter-sound confusions (b for d, for example), but he gets there in his own time, my boy. Peaches, who watches every bit of my practice with him, chimes in, too, sounding out some of the c-v-c words, and enthusiastically writing me love notes, like \"Peaches Love Mom.\" These things make my heart sing. By far less important news, the school district here has a boiler plate letter they mail you when your child is not performing at grade level. We get them each reporting period, but this one, the year-end version, is different. This one says that my child is not up to their standards in reading, math, and PE, and that I should discuss the matter with him, and instruct him to work harder, because he might not get promoted to the next grade; after a serious discussion, my child should print and sign his name below. I understand it's a form letter and that they don't really expect my six-year-old who has autism to have a cursive signature, or more importantly to be able to pull himself up by his bootstraps academically. But I have to confess: I gave that cold piece of correspondence the finger -- flipped the bird right at the poorly Xeroxed, insensitive, useless piece of beaucracratic drivel. Then I said, \"Hey, Roo? We got a paper from your teacher. It says here to keep working really hard in math, okay? Can you do that for me? Can we work on some math together now?\" He said, \"Okay.\" So I gave him a crayon and had him print his name, in his usual large and awkward fashion, across the form, and I sent it back, and then we got back to work on one-to-one correspondence, meaning math, not the one-fingered salute to our mail. Peaches' report cart also arrived, and I tried to read it standing up, but found I could not -- I nearly fell over, but managed to lean against a wall for support while I snorted and snickered. I don't know if you will see the humor to the degree I did, but I have to share this excerpt with you just in case you might get a kick out of this description of my (barely) four-year-old (bossy and willful) preschool girl: \"Peaches has delighted her teachers and friends with her imaginitave stories and expressive way of recounting her stories. Peaches is a real schoolgirl. She just loves schol and the way the day is spent. She often forgets that her position is that of student because she really feels like she is her teachers' assistant.  While we must remind Peaches of her role as a student,  we delight in the fact that she has assimilated so many of our classroom rules and expectations...\" (bold and italics mine, snicker and snort also mine...) Only a couple more weeks, 2 more field trips, a thousand more parties, and a quarter million more To Dos, along with infinite logistical challenges, and then, ready or not, here comes summer (school).

In 2007, we had an out of control 3-year-old not yet diagnosed with autism, and a fussy one-year-old. We had already sold our house, but had yet to find a new one, and we left the party early to go look at the place we now call home. We would have left the party early either way, though, because my kids had too many needs to make partying any fun. Our felt frayed as we met up with our real estate agent, but thankfully at least we found our home. In 2008, we attended with our newly diagnosed 4-year-old and our toddler. They took turns melting down and having potty issues, as both remained in diapers and lacked communication skills. We stayed as long as we could before making our apologies and beating a hasty retreat, but I doubt we lasted more than 90 minutes. By 2009, we had shocked ourselves half to death by trying and then liking having our son on the gfcf diet, which helped his digestion incredibly and his daily moods considerably, but made parties a challenge. Even though we brought along a bag full of food just for him, Rooster got angry not to have the same thing as everyone else, and he made some enemies of the other kids whose food he tried to grab and who couldn't understand his unusual language. Our daughter, 3, had developed a sudden and acute fear of dogs, and spent the party shrieking at our hosts' loving and wonderful canine. As we fled the party that year, everyone cleared a path, giving wide berth to my screaming and dysregulated offspring. That brings us to today. The kids ate a huge meal before the party, and packed special gfcf brownies to take along. We talked in advance about the sweet doggie we would see and how we would be nice to her. Once at the party, my son, now 6, played with the other kids without much supervision or intervention, and sat calmly on a blanket listening to the band play. He only said one thing that caused me to flush crimson and do damage control. He also charmed some grownups who hadn't seen him in a long time. My daughter, now 4, chatted up the grownups, amused herself on her own playing with some toys, and never made a peep of pooch protest. Oh, Peaches had a few meltdowns over this and that - lately my NT girl gives me a harder time than her big brother - but nothing epic. Both kids swam with their dad, used the potty when they needed to, and took the news that we needed to head home without much fuss.

Does anyone else describe their weekends as survival? My mom asked me what we did today. \"Just tried to keep our heads down,\" is how I put it. It wasn't a bad day, not by our standards. We spent it trying to minimize meltdowns and make time pass. I really want to be a better adjusted, more content person. If you have a reading list that might help, I'm ready for some homework. The keyboard on our new netbook sucks. Or my hands are just huge.

A voracious reader, I consider myself a lifelong learner. Nothing has taught me more in my 38 years than the boy about to turn six and the girl who just celebrated her fourth birthday at Disney Land. Everything else I ever learned fit inside a water bottle. My children teach me as much as the Pacific Ocean they love so much. It is tumultuous learning, fraught with frustration, and I fail all the time. But I am a teacher, and I preach the value of failure, the merit of \"discovery learning.\" I yammer on to anyone who will listen that lessons that stick present challenges, that nothing valuable comes easy. So I'm trying to learn in concert from my kids and myself. I'm trying to value process. I'm trying to keep growing, and to keep going. My brain cells don't multiply like they used; these synapses slow down sometimes. I miss the plasticity of my college mind. But much more rides on my knowledge acquisition these days. I am no longer learning for the sake of my future, but for theirs. And so I keep plugging away, doing my homework, listening, learning.

{"date": "Thursday, May 6, 2010", "body": "\nSometimes I get fired up and a dash off upset letters to the president. Usually it's about education. Oddly, I have never written to him about autism. I thought about that today, and it turned into me dashing off this post. (I wish I had the time to research a more in-depth, journalistic piece. My To Do List cracks up at that mere thought.) Maybe you will consider writing a similar post, and link to it in the comments: If I could talk to President Obama, Congress, or other influential leaders, what would I  tell them about autism? - Autism is not just one thing. It's not easy to define. To know one child with autism is to know one  child with autism. You could have 20 autistic people in a  room and they could have very little in common. Some would look you in the eye, some  would carry on  a conversation with you, some would hug you, some would have special talents, some would have very high IQs, some would spin or flap, some would have more than one diagnosis, and some would not -- but every single person in the room would have value, importance, significance and worth. - Even the undisputed stats tell us autism in an increasing concern. It is time  to make this a priority of our surgeon general and our Secretary of Health and Human Services. I see the military getting behind the cause of fighting obesity because they see the national importance. Well, obesity is a real concern. But it has taken us far too long to realize how important. Let's not be so slow to help families who deal with autism - who deal with inadequate resources, discrimination, health challenges, and economic struggles. - Like obesity, autism becomes more expensive when ignored. It is not just right and ethical to provide support to children with autism, early intervention is actually quite cost effective. We need to act to ensure equal access to early intervention regardless of geography, ethnicity, class, or anything else. - The education system, in vast need of reform, must differentiate for the diverse needs of all learners, but particularly kids on the autism spectrum. This requires differentiated instruction, adequate resources, and better trained educators. Public officials need to think about how we can make this happen, and how they can influence teacher preparation institutions to take on these challenges as well. - Parents with kids on the spectrum face struggles financially and in maintaining their careers. Their circumstances vary as widely as the kinds of autism that exist. Some parents of kids with autism are blue collar and some are white collar, some are famous and some are very private, some are married while others are divorced, some are CEOs, some are teachers... Tax breaks could benefit many, and job flexibility could benefit many, but the  important thing for our leadership to grasp is that by helping families cope with challenges brought by autism, those families have more to offer the country as well. Everyone benefits. - Families with autism are vulnerable. Because autism has so many unknowns, there are those who would exploit parents to make a quick buck. How can Congress encourage innovation and supports for families  but also act swiftly to put a stop to those whose snake oil would do financial or physical harm?o - INCLUSION, INCLUSION, INCLUSION. There is no where, no reason, and no benefit in hiding away the ever growing population of children and adults with autism. Segregation benefits no one,  and inclusion benefits everyone. We need to support the inclusion of kids on the spectrum in schools, clubs, teams, and we need to extend support beyond school age years. The children diagnosed every 20 minutes today are the adults, the VOTERS, of tomorrow. Some might still need supports into adulthood, but the more we help early, the better off they will be. - Promote volunteerism. People who spend time helping those who have autism will learn, dispel myths and ignorance, build community, make a difference, and reap their own rewards. People with autism have a lot to give, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/05/laying-down-law.html", "title": "\nLaying Down the Law\n"},

I would post about school, but I just can't yet. Instead I bring you my first ever ADHD-style grab bag of thoughts I've wanted to share. A little bit of Notable and Quotable Peaches: Are TOES private parts? Daddy: No, toes are not private parts. Peaches: Well, then, WHY do I HAVE to wear closed-toe shoes to school?!!!! Me: Rooster, did you have a good day? Roo: YES! Just only one little time out. Me: Why did you get the time out? Roo: Because I told the teacher, \"You can run, but you CAN'T HIDE!\" Next, an epiphany and a question: Since my husband's grandmother recently passed away, a few people wanted to make donations to a cause in memory of her. His aunt asked, \"What autism charity would be the best choice?\" Amazingly, we don't know. We were stunned to realize we know very little about nonprofits that help families with autism. It made us wonder: Is there some amazing charity that helps kids with special needs get services? Preferably one that doesn't care about anything else but helping kids like ours experience things like classes, camps, horseback riding -- whatever makes kids happy while relieving parents a bit. (We would prefer an apolitical charity, as we at Casa del Rooster don't really have the oomph left over at the frazzled ends of days to contemplate any political matters beyond voting in elections.) If you know of an organization like that, let me know. If not, hey, let's start one! PRODUCT ENDORSEMENT: Oh, my. Guess what we discovered? I feel like I just clawed my way to the best dress in Filene's (sp?) Basement or something. We found ZPizza. Not impressed yet? Listen to this: ZPizza is in our neighborhood. They sell organic pizza and related good stuff. They sell healthy salads. And. They. Sell. GFCFSF pizza made with daiyana cheese. And it does not cost a whole paycheck. And... are you sitting down? They deliver it. Wait: They are also VERY NICE and extremely considerate. My whole family can eat there happily after catching a movie next door, or call 'em up and tell 'em what to bring us. I'm thinking if we ever adopt a child or a puppy I will name it Z. I'm a little excited. I receive no kickbacks whatsoever, but I am telling you to find a ZPizza and eat there, pronto.

I try to be mindful of it, and to realize that people, including myself, have slips of the tongue, moments of being inarticulate. I try to be less sensitive. But I feel a little chafed lately by a four letter word. We see a dentist who performs miracles with my son, because he loves his job, loves kids, and specializes in pediatric dentistry for children who have special needs. When his nurse accidentally gave the Roo a flouride treatment his chart said he should not have, the dentist blanched. Reading a scary look on his face, I asked why that was such a big problem. \"Well,\" he said, \"THEY, you know, with metals, THEY...\" and he cocked his head toward my child. \"We try not to give THEM those treatments because sometimes severly autistic kids...\" For some reason, I reassured him. I think I wanted him to simply stop talking. What was done was done. There was no point to saying my son is not \"severly autistic\" because I don't even really know what that means, and thanks to Christine I understand how objectionable and ambiguous terms like \"high functioning\" sound. I could not undo what the nurse had done, and I didn't really even know how a big a deal it was - I'd have to figure that out later - I just wanted the dentist to stop talking because his pronouns made me feel a little novicained and queasy. I like our dentist, and I like the teachers at my son's school. I know they try hard to help my boy, and they value inclusion of all kinds of kids. But when Roo got hurt at school last week, a teacher called me very worried. \"I think his nose is bleeding because he banged it, but since they don't feel pain like other people... I mean, I just don't know how badly he is hurt because I know they can't feel pain, and I just want to be sure he does not have a head injury.\" At the phrase \"head injury,\" I flew out of work to go to my boy, no time to explain that my son, and many kids with autism, feel pain, and made sure my boy's nosebleed was just a nosebleed. It was. I found him weeping, because it hurt. I wanted to cry too -- the \"theys\" were getting to me. They say April is the cruellest month, and I have to say our April of dentists, dramas, disasters, bullies and booboos lived up to that. On the one hand, I was probably too sensitive amid the chaos. On the other hand, April was autism awareness month, and I'm not sure I was as good of an advocate as I should have been. Next time, I want to do better. Next time, I hope to embrace the teachable moments better, not let the \"theys\" slide.

We know the pros and cons, we weighed countless variables, we listened to doctors, we read, we cried, we gave them a try. We thought what we gave him seemed to help him in many positive ways, but as soon as we saw what we thought might be a side effect, we knew we didn't want to push our luck.  Right now the Rooster does not take meds, but we have been considering trying again with a different prescription, and we've mentioned this to the school. Friday our boy went on his first field trip without my husband or me to chaperone. I stared at the clock all day, concerned, waiting for the phone to ring. I took my cell with me to the bathroom. There I found myself preoccupied with wondering about the bathroom situation at the museum he was visiting. I reviewed in my head the other four field trips we went on this year, and how he seemed to do okay. I somehow managed not to chew on my nails. Finally word came: Good trip! No problems. The teacher wanted to know: He was so good; had we medicated him?! Ah, well. I try to remember that is good news. What it reminds me, though, is that my husband and I can't attribute every good day on meds to the meds. When we took him off the last prescription, I lived in fear he would regress. Instead, he seemed more present, his conversation more engaged. We really have no way of knowing how to tease apart all the variables to figure out what the meds did or didn't do for him. I spend a little bit of every day analyzing why the boy did well or poorly at this or that. I analyze his meals, his sleep patterns, his health status, his routines, his sensory diet, and then usually I blame myself for any imperfections in any of the above. That is, when I'm not busy berating myself for what I did or didn't do or eat or take while pregnant, or loathing my own DNA. Perhaps I have been spending time looking into meds for the wrong one of us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/04/pill-box.html", "title": "\nPill Box\n"},

I try hard to remember this when I feel judged, and when people make assumptions about my family or me. I try to remember we are all more alike than different, we all need the benefit of the doubt.   Still, here is what I want to say to those people who have assumed they know what it is like to raise my children, and who make judgments without compassion:    I don't know what it was like the first time you had a crush, or what it felt like when someone you loved suffered or died. I don't know what it feels like when you wake up in the morning, or how you dream at night. Even though, like you, I have loved, I have lost, I sleep and dream and wake, I can't know your experience. And I don't think you would like it if I assumed that I do know, that I could tell you how to pursue your career with more ambition so you wouldn't have such a lousy job, that I could teach you how to get in shape the right way so your backside wouldn't look like a nursery full of babies' dimples. If I have never walked in your shoes, you might find it callous of me to suggest you don't know the right way to put a spring in your step but that I do.

Some are sure I should be more aggressive while others think I just need some inspired yoga, but the truth is, the one thing I need to be more of is just  RESPECTED  without judgment.

He heard them talking about the Rooster as they entered campus. \"He is not normal,\" they said. J held  Roo's  hand and approached the group, who continued to point and talk animatedly about our boy. \"He is not a normal human being,\" a little girl said, \"he spits.\" Another boy in the throng didn't like my husband telling the kids to back down, telling them to not say that any more. \"He is not normal,\" the boy said, turning his back on my husband and my  Roo . Around 1:15, J called me. He told me what happened, how my son began his Monday morning after our first decent weekend in months. He told me my son did not even react, he simply held firmly to J's hand. \"Why did you wait so long to tell me this?\" I shouted, looking at the clock, torn between listening further and racing to call the principal before the school day ended. \"That was 5 hours ago!\" And then my resilient husband's voice broke. I'm the kind of girl who compulsively asks people, \"Are you okay?\" I have asked J about a dozen times a day for a decade. It's a reflex; he gives the same honest answer every time except for today. Today he said, \"No.\" The teachers tell us this: It does not begin with the children. It comes from the parents. Parents who worry that No Child Left Behind means All Kids Left Behind, and think my son will keep their kids from a good education. Parents who know little or nothing about autism.

{"date": "Saturday, April 17, 2010", "body": "\n\"I no longer wish to parent this child.\" Have you heard the news? Well, if you have been to this blog before, you know sometimes I get inarticulate when I get upset, so I've been thinking more than usual about what I want to say here. I apologize if I'm nonetheless incoherent and rambling, but I know I have to get this off my chest. What does it mean to be a parent? To be a family? To make a commitment? When I was 10 or 11, my dad took off, and I never saw him again. Don't be sorry -- I consider his absence a stroke of luck, because my father was a criminal, an addict, and a compulsive liar, and I ended up with my mom and the two best grandparents any child could ever have. But I spent a lot of time in my childhood thinking about what it meant to have had my father leave. At times I wondered if it marked me somehow. Was I unlovable? Was I a loser? Was I only half as loved as my friends? And I wondered how I might pay the price; after all, I knew at least one friend whose parents didn't feel comfortable having her play at my house because of our \"situation.\" I knew it was not my fault that my parents divorced or that my father defrauded people or that he left. I knew, too, though, that I carried his genes, and I wondered if that did make me tainted, if I would grow up and steal or drink or have addictions. I wondered if I would leave my children someday. I simultaneously vowed to be nothing like him and to worry that I might not have a choice given my DNA. And while I was not ashamed that my father had walked out on us, I sometimes felt embarrassed that I had no one to take me to the Father-Daughter picnic kind of thing. Along the way, surrogates come into all our lives -- people you adopt or who adopt you as the next-best-thing-to-kin. We have soul sisters, father figures, borrowed Grannies and all the rest. We build a community based on love connections rather than blood ties. But sometimes when conflicts arise in those connections, and sometimes when endings happen, people end up saying, \"Well, blood is thicker than water.\" Sometimes people feel that if you aren't related to them, it's easier to walk away away from you. And then the sting returns... and then if you lose that person, you feel acutely reminded that you don't have those blood ties. I don't say goodbyes as easily as some. I believe in commitment. I believe in wedding vows and til death do us part, I believe that when you adopt a child you are their family the same as any other family. Oh, sure, I might fantasize about running away from home as much or more than the next girl, but the truth is, I believe strongly in responsibility to home and family, in putting the good of the tribe ahead of the good for myself. If I make a promise, I mean it. If I make a bargain, I keep up my end of the deal. Sometimes I still wonder what part of my father I carry inside me, but I'm nearly as old now as he was when he fled, and so far the only family resemblance I'm aware of comes in my ruddy cheeks and blue eyes. I do not know the woman from Florida in the news for sending her adopted child back to Russia with a note saying she longer wished to parent her child. In fact, I know very little about her, because I can't bring myself to follow the news coverage. I heard the basics on the radio while I was driving, and before the 30 second piece ended, I had tears in my eyes and turned the station. I guess I have always reacted strongly to stories of child abandonment, I guess I always will. But I wasn't thinking of my father when I heard that story. I was thinking, as I always am I guess, of my children. What if my Rooster was orphaned, had no family to raise him? Would he be  unadoptable ? Would he suffer a similar fate to the boy from Russia who was turned away for having too many issues? Children are beautiful little beings we fantasize about when we want to start families. Then the come home, still beautiful and small, but much harder than we imagined. They come with dramas and they take enormous effort and they can pummel you sometimes with their force, flatten you with their needs. But parents who choose to have them (biologically or legally) make a promise, a commitment, a sacred pact. To me parenthood goes something like this: I will love you, my child, no matter how hard it gets. I might not like everything about you, but I will do my best to raise you to be a person you will love, who will have things to offer the world, who will love your life. I will shelter you, I will protect you, and I will teach you. Wherever I have a home, you have one as well. Your childhood will not last forever, and so I will treat it as a sacred space in time, and I will use it to help you begin the best future you can have. I will be your parent, you will be my child, and nothing can come between that. As someone who admittedly kvetches ad  naseum  how hard I find it to parent, and how difficult it seems my children can be, I really cannot imagine doing anything else. I cannot imagine ever walking away. I cannot fathom writing down the words, \"I no longer wish to parent this child.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/04/this-child.html", "title": "\nThis Child\n"},

After 90 years of a healthy and active life, Rooster's great-grandmother on his father's side passed away. We are so grateful that in January we were able to attend a wonderful birthday dinner party for her, at a beautiful restaurant at the beach, with all her family gathered around. After dinner, when we went back home for cake and ice cream, we set a timer on the camera and got great shots with everyone smiling and laughing,  everyone's  spirits high. I remember how she had spent part of that day reading books to Peaches and Rooster, as she did every time she saw them. Each time she finished a book, Rooster said the same thing: \"Another one, please.\" Sometimes he'd tell her, \"Let's get cozy,  GG ,\" and they would snuggle up on the sofa under a throw, books piled up on the coffee table. If another grownup tried to listen in on the stories, Rooster sometimes objected saying, \" Shhh ! We need privacy!\" This could go on for an hour or more. At her 90 th , we truly celebrated a long and full life, and we embraced her with love and affection, and that is very fortunate. Just a few weeks ago, she went with her daughter and son-in-law on a getaway trip, where she dined in style, joked around, and went swimming. Her illness happened very suddenly. She had devoted daughters and sons-in-law, loving and attentive grandchildren, adoring great grandchildren... she had a community of people who mourn her loss, but celebrate her life, and we hold her memory in our hearts.

{"date": "Sunday, April 11, 2010", "body": "\nMy husband gave me a metaphor the other day that has me thinking. See, I have a weird jaw problem, a kind of TMJ that has bothered me since childhood. When my jaw is \"out,\" which is about half the time, it ranges from mildy irritating to intensely painful, and the longer it stays \"out,\" the more the discomfort spreads to my shoulder, my head, my neck, my back. Then, my jaw pops; the ball and joint essentially line up properly again, my jaw goes back \"in,\" and I feel immense relief, until the next time. The other night after J tucked in the Rooster, I asked, \"Does he still feel off to you? Still feel far away?\" He said, \"Yeah. It's like your jaw. Things haven't felt right for a few weeks. I keep waiting for him to suddenly snap back like he does, to look me in the eye and say, 'Daddy, Daddy, listen...' and have a real conversation with me again.\" You know what a sucker I am for just about any cheap metaphor, and this one really made sense to me. I've been thinking about it ever since. Yes, it does feel like our Rooster has two essential states -- one where he feels present and accesible, and one where we talk about him as being \"off,\" meaning varying degress of unreachable. Sometimes I get angry or frustrated or depressed about the Rooster being off, and sometimes it feels like he'll never come back again. Having the jaw metaphor helps. First, the metaphor reminds me that the Rooster likely feels at least as much discomfort when he's off as we do, and so I need to be more understanding. Whatever causes him to veer off (illness? food? chemistry? fatigue? emotions? AUTISM?!) is something beyond his control, something happening to his body, not a choice he makes. The longer he suffers, the more likely the affect is to spread --- we see his language weaken, his very limited impulse control vanish entirely.

Trust me, it's almost worthy of a snort, this notable and quotable from my Peach, who has been a rather rotten peach while her grandma visited this week, I have to say. So, we here are grateful for the laugh and are eager to share the mirth with all of you. But get ready to read ALOUD, please. Don't preread it silently, even if you are alone in the room. This one gets its guffaw from the voice.  As a quick side note, I've never once seen my husband obsess on anything outside his passion for filmmaking until he was moved by his deep hurt and frustration in response to a certain schmockity nonsense. My heart aches at his sincere, bewildered, aching discomfort. I figure a certain someone for what she said, but I wish she knew my sweet husband and how she shook him. It is for his sake I've been looking for all the laughs we can get, and so you now need to prepare yourself to read this like a four-year-old and her weary mama:  Peaches: Mama, I see the waiter, and the cleaner upper and the cooker. Is that all? Who else works in this restaurant? Me: The hostess. Peaches: Hostess? What is a hostess?  Me: She is the lady who walked us to our seats and gave you your crayons, remember?  Peaches: Hostess? Do they ever call her a ho? Me: Um, no. No. Would anyone call me Guh? Just Guh, instead of my whole name? That would be silly. Peaches: But hostess is a long word. What if she is rushing by and they want to talk to her? They could just shout, (SHOUT THIS PART, READER, AS PEACH DID) \"HEY! HO!

{"date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "body": "\nI am watching Parenthood on Hulu on J's Mac mini in our bedroom to escape for a little while because he was afraid my other escape  from  parenthood might be more drastic and involve a padded room, and that sounded expensive and messy. I'll come back to that later. More important to me in this moment, though, as a former arts and entertainment writer, I sit here watching something actually geared for my own demographic for one of the rare times in the last half a decade, and I find myself strangely compelled to do a little of my old schtick. Maybe I felt a little time warp seeing Lauren Gilmore -- I mean, Lauren Graham -- with the same hair she had before I had children when we'd meet up on Tuesday nights on the WB to compare dysfunctional families. This time, her dysfunctional family has both more and less in common with my own family, but just like with Gilmore Girls, I can't stop drawing comparisons while I watch the show. In the Gilmore Girls, I was Rory, the studious offspring of the antiauthoritarian mother Graham played -- I was the girl who deeply loved her grandparents, worked on the school newspaper, wanted to tackle the world. In Parenthood, I am Kristina Braverman, mother of two, increasingly overwhelmed by worrying about my son's special needs.  I'm seeing lots of reactions to Parenthood within the online autism community, and while the reactions to the Asperger's storyline are mixed, the likeability of the overall show seems a common thread. I suspect it's because, like me, many people see themselves in one or more of the characters, who all seem familiar in an overly stylized kind of way. Yes, TV shows oversimplify, follow a predictable arc, wrap everything up neatly in well under an hour once you take out the ads. Yes, they stereotype, and sure, everyone is kind of hot. Parenthood is one of a good many shows where you can't help get distracted thinking about the implausible math when you try to reconcile the ages of the characters and the casting. Those things are necessary ingredients in the recipe for Hollywood offerings. But here is my more nitty gritty comparison between The Braverman Clan and the Rooster Household. - So, as I write this, Max's new behaviorist is offering him a chance to earn a lizard if he will play four square with a girl at the park. Now, the Rooster would take a lizard any day over whatever is the hottest game rocking the elementary world. But his response would to the quid pro quo would go something more like this: NO! NOW GIVE ME A LIZARD NOWWWWWWWWW. I'M NOT PLAYING WITH HER, BUT I WANT THE LIZARD. RIGHT NOW. And let's say he did agree to the cupcake behaviorist's deal. They're going to need a few seasons and a few more specialists to help him figure out the coordination and focus to play the game. - Now I'm watching a scene between Max's parents as they talk about their sex life. Okay, well, I think it's great they have time to talk about it, greater still time to do it. But the part that I can't relate to AT ALL? That Max's mom is going to tell the young, adorable, ABA chick who clearly has no stretch marks that Max's dad, and I quote, \"has a good one.\" Or did I mishear that line? Please tell me I did. Because I'd be more likely to tell the new pretty young thing working long hours at my house that my husband has the smelliest socks in history and terrible morning breath. He doesn't, but I wouldn't mind her thinking so. Let her keep her eye on the little boy, not the big one! - So now the episode is wrapping up, and everybody is playing nicely, adults and kids alike. The wayward teen has ulterior motives, but at least she's doing extra credit work on the literary journal. (I approve, and the title \"Spectrum\" was a nice touch.) Max wants some bugs, so he seems ready to do more social skills work at the park, no big deal. The single guy springs his biracial son onhis parents for the first time and they smile and break out the family bicycle so he can sail off down the road to new family cheers. The Type-A attorney accepts that another mama she loathes from the playgroup put the moves on her stay-at-home husband and even offers to put their daughters into a pottery class together. It's not that I mind the happily ever after, I even like living vicariously through it. But in the final scene, Max's mother remarks that she finally feels relaxed after two months. Two MONTHS? TWO MONTHS? Wow, the Bravermans went from diagnosis to relaxed thanks to ABA in less time that the Rooster clan managed to make it through the waiting list to sign up for the prerequisite parenting class before we could get into ABA... I jokingly call us the Rooster clan, but really I envy people with a clan around. I envy the way the Braverman siblings check in on each other, the way the home of the senior Bravermans serves as a hub where everyone connects. Sure, they aren't real, life isn't that simple. But that's why I use it for escapism. And why, are you wondering, do I need to escape? Well, I promised I'd get back to that. You see, yesterday, I took the kids to Rooster's school for Open House, and with several hundred kids around, my two stood out dramatically as the two worst behaved, to the point that I grounded Peach for the first time while she is a ripe old four years old. J had to drive them both to school today, because I woke up just as furious as I'd gone to bed. Then, today Rooster came home from school with a note that he'd been sent to the principal's office after having four time outs. He spit three times, called somebody a \"jack @ss\" and finally got the boot when he gave his teacher and aide his middle finger. Everything is being documented since parents started complaining about Rooster about a month ago, we have is IEP early in May, and we're wondering if we should be thinking about yet another school placement before too long. So you could argue that my escapist time would be better spent with something a little less close to home than a show called Parenthood that has an autism story line, but I was actually happier to spend my evening with Max and his peeps than with my own two tonight. And if you think that sounds mean and heartless, I welcome you to come over and demonstrate your best techniques for quality time at Casa del Rooster. If you can find the happy ending over here, you're a Braverman than I.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/04/parenthood.html", "title": "\nParenthood\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 30, 2010", "body": "\nBelow is a guest post from J, my husband and mirror opposite. We have nothing but love and family in common (though I guess that is plenty). If you want a quick character sketch of J, I can sum him up as deliberate, artistic, reserved, patient, calm, unflappable, and at peace with the world. No, I do not know how he ended up with me, but somehow we work just right. We keep each other out of trouble most of the time. We both love words and love writing, though we write completely different things, about different kinds of things, and in different ways. Recently, we both felt compelled to speak up on the same topic, though. We've wandered around for several days, grieving, muttering, \"Smockety, schmockity...\" We both needed to say something, and wrestled with draft after draft, sometimes written all in our heads. We both felt like we'd witnessed the equivalent of gang violence in the blogosphere, and inaction was not an option, inaction equalled complicity. Well, maybe that last part is how I would describe it; I don't want to put words in J's mouth. Instead, I'll just give you his words in by way of this guest post -- an open letter to a blogger who unacceptably and unapologetically attacked a member of our community. Connie, When I decided to write an open letter to you I\u2019ll admit that what I really wanted to do was to write a letter about you for people in the autism community to read. But I think you\u2019ve endured enough vitriol. I know you\u2019ve heard the message. In the end all I want is for you and others to appreciate what our kids go through and how heroically they\u2019re fighting.  I\u2019d love to know that you feel a little compassion, that even though we can be a little disruptive, you know we deserve a place in our communities and a little dignity.  I\u2019d like to offer you some measure of sympathy as well. We all make mistakes. We all come up short in our conduct. Hell, in my life I\u2019ve uttered some things that I\u2019m very thankful aren\u2019t cached on Google\u2019s servers. The fact is, your mistakes happened under the amplifying effects of the internet, and the scale of the response must feel pretty enormous.  Right now you\u2019re not just Connie. People aren\u2019t just mad at you for that post. You are the stand in in our minds for a million tsk-ing, intolerant, vicious attacks on us and our kids. You\u2019ve just tapped into a bottomless pit of hurt and anger that\u2019s been looking for some expression. While that\u2019s a heavy load to bear, it also puts you in a position of great power, but you need to hurry. Your story has gone viral in this community and the timing is ripe. Autism Awareness Month begins April 2nd and right or wrong, you\u2019ve become a symbol of the need for awareness. One in every 106 kids are now being diagnosed with some form of Autism so this is big news. I\u2019d wager that come Friday your story will be in the mainstream national press.  Right now that headline is, \u201cWoman Holds Bible, Mocks Autistic Girl.\u201d And that whole \u201cfirst recorded human flight\u201d thing. That\u2019s the kind of stuff that gets ratings and sells papers. I don\u2019t think you want that.  You have a very short window to get ahead of this. Don\u2019t clam up. Reach out. Make amends. There are plenty of great bloggers out there who would talk with you and answer any questions you have. Write what you\u2019ve learned about what we go through. You have the floor. Speak out for us and turn this into something good.

We had heard all the cds too many times, and we had bellies full of snacks. It seemed as good a time as any, really. \"Honey, should we talk about autism?\" I asked. And so we did. Grownups up front, a kid in each of the back two rows, some of the eye contact made through mirrors, we talked about what autism is and what it means for our family. At first they seemed interested, though a little uncertain. Then, they seemed comfortable knowing that Rooster has autism, and that is why we have so many helpers all the time; that autism makes Rooster different from us in some ways, but that we are more alike than we are different. And then they just wanted to know if I could find and play the song with the pirate girls in it just one more time, and if there were any cookies left. Now that MOM-NOS inspired me, it might be time to take my show on the road: I might be ready to visit the kindergarteners and see if I can get them to understand what autism is and what it means for their class.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2010", "body": "\nI can't believe it's taken me more than a week to write about what happened at my son's school. Well, it was been a  doozy  of a week. (Peaches turned four, Spring Break began, my mother flew in from the East Coast, I was sick, I took both kids to the dentist for the first time and found Peaches had two cavities, went to Disney Land, had an egg hunt, and some  Schmockity   ick  hit the fan... ) Still, J and I giving a talk to Rooster's kindergarten class about autism felt monumental. Just as we'd been following the uplifting and captivating story of MOM-NOS meeting with Bud's sweet and supportive class during lunch, we got word that Rooster had made some enemies among the  kindergarteners  and their parents. A few moms told their children not to play with our boy, and at least one wanted him out of the classroom. Fortunately,  Roo  has a good teacher and an amazing inclusion specialist, both of whom are also lawyers. They made it clear that bullying and discrimination would not be tolerated in the classroom. I asked if perhaps I could come lead some parent education, and the kindergarten teacher through her hands up, telling me she considered it somewhat useless to try to reach the parents. \"I gave up on teaching the parents,\" she said. \"Every year one or two of them try to separate their child from others based on race or religion, so if they still do that in this day and age and in this city, I'm just going to focus on teaching the children. With the kids I still have hope. But none of this nonsense happens in the classroom. Rooster is a part of things just fine inside the classroom.\" So, we have our work cut out for us. We still plan to reach out to the parents. But we started with the students. It was the day before Spring Break - a Friday - first thing in the morning, and we met with an adorable group of five- and six-year- olds . I want to tell you all about it, want to include the little speech we'd prepared, share with you some of the cute comments... but the truth is, I've started this post six times in as many days. It began with a sentence amazed it had been three days, then almost a week, then a week, then more than a week... I think that the drama in kindergarten might have been the start of me unravelling once again. The talk went great, but prepping for it and giving it took a lot out of me, and there wasn't exactly enough of me to start with, if you know what I mean. It feels like it was years ago. Everything just keeps piling on and on and on, and I'm feeling defeated. In May Rooster will turn six. My current project is (supposed to be) planning an amazing birthday party to which I can lure his class. This is not very us-like; it feels like a SHOULD but it's not how we roll. And I'm not really ready to roll anyway. I'm more cranky, miserable, ungrateful, exhausted and  blech  than usual. So this is not much of post. It's more unravelling....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/03/beginning-of-end.html", "title": "\nThe Beginning of the End?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "body": "\nWhen I\u2019m angry, I lose my voice; no, not in the sense that I go quiet, but I become completely inarticulate. In person, face-to-face, I stammer, stutter, turn the color of Kool-Aid. You can\u2019t see that when I blog. Instead, I go AWOL. I\u2019ve spent several days trying to write in all kinds of different ways about the cruelty we\u2019ve witnessed recently in the blogosphere. Really there are no words I can say, except perhaps to quote my son: \"Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!\" Yet I cannot sit silently by either. So the only thing I can think to do is to take a different voice that I hope comes across at least a little better than my own. In the spirit of point-of-view writing, like I used to do with my writing students, I am going to express my feelings through a grandmother in my imagination. I do not know the real grandmother nor do I know anything about her, and I can only hope she wouldn\u2019t mind too much me using my imagination to express my feelings here about the horrible treatment she received at the hands of an ignorant blogger. Okay, me shutting up now, so that I can speak\u2026 You can call me Grandma. During a recent afternoon babysitting my granddaughter, I was reminded again how hard it is for my son and his wife to face bigotry, discrimination, and judgment every day. Although it was a very difficult day, and an emotional one for me, I remain grateful for what I learned, and even more grateful for all my precious children and grandchildren.  My granddaughter had to have yet another painful blood draw on the day I\u2019m describing, and since both my son and daughter-in-law long ago used up their sick and vacation days and fear for their jobs if they continue to miss work, I volunteered to help out. Blood draws are never easy. I promised my granddaughter that after the lab work, she could choose something fun to do. Sweet girl that she is, she wanted email her brother, my grandson, now serving in the military, but her computer has some kind of virus. Could we go to the library to use computers, she asked? Well, I don\u2019t know an email from Morse Code, and libraries can be tricky for our sweet girl, but grandma did say she could do whatever she chose, so that is how we found ourselves waiting to use public computers already in use, and how we came to be the objects of scorn and ridicule. When my granddaughter and I got to the computers, some children were already playing video games. My granddaughter\u2019s autism has a negative impact on her impulse control, and while 15 hours a week of ABA therapy for the last 18 months has given her a number of useful tools to deal with the stress of waiting her turn, it is still a struggle for her. I smile even now to picture how she tried her best to remember the coping mechanisms she\u2019d learned while clearly feeling impatient and exhausted from her morning visit to the Children\u2019s Hospital. I could tell that the mother of the girls on the computer felt uncomfortable in the face of my granddaughter\u2019s developmental challenges. Not that her challenges are anything to be ashamed of, but knowing that others feel uncomfortable around us makes it hard for me to make eye contact sometimes myself. I knew that to others, we looked awkward and loud and off-putting, but at the same time, my sweet grandchild had practiced and practiced and practiced being patient so much, I knew that she was doing her best to waiting to use the computer. She was perseverating on her own struggle with patience, repeating to the point of exhaustion, \u201cI\u2019m being very patient, grandma!\u201d I know that helps her maintain her calm, pass the time, deal with the stimulation that is dysregulated through her nervous system, so I tried to support her as best I could by saying, \u201cYes, my love, you are being patient.\u201d I don\u2019t know exactly how long the other girls had been playing video games when we arrived, but I admit my heart sank when I saw them there. Of course, they have every right to use the computers as much as anyone, but this is the thing: Everything is so hard for special needs children like my granddaughter, and sometimes you just wish something would go smoothly and easily. Sometimes you just wish for a break, a simple day. Sometimes after getting through the medical challenges our girl has and helping her navigate through the choppy seas of her day, you see healthy, typically developing young people who always have blue skies and calm waters, and you feel bone weary, a tad bit jealous, and a little frustrated. I put those other girls out of my mind \u2013 I had to \u2013 a focused on being the most supportive grandma I can be. I kept reassuring my girl that, yes, she was being very patient, and soon, it would be her turn, because experience has taught me that I could best help her that way. Finally my granddaughter\u2019s loose grip on control escaped her, and she approached one of the girls playing video games. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn, it\u2019s my turn!\u201d For a brief moment I imagined that perhaps I could hope for some compassion from the children, or perhaps their mother, who was, after all, reading the Bible. But do you ever get the feeling that some people choose their books just so that the title will be impressive to those around them? I hate to be judgmental, but I can\u2019t say that The 90 Day Bible Speed Read or whatever it was really impressed me in the way that the woman seemed to hope it might, as she clearly pretended to read it to avoid dealing with the situation at the computers. Again, I am a little ashamed of myself to make such a judgmental declaration, but moms who find a computer where they can plug their kids in to avoid having to teach or parent them themselves make we want to take a ball point pen and jab myself in the eye. Anyway, since I got no help from the mother and no compassion from her daughter, I simply did the best I could with what stamina I had left. Suffice it to say we managed, and my granddaughter eventually sent a beautiful, loving, supportive email t her brother in Iraq. You\u2019d think this would be the end of the story, except that today my daughter-in-law brought me this awful thing that had been written about us; the mother from the library said the most horrible, wrong things about my granddaughter and me. For a moment, I wanted to hate that woman. No, to be honest, for a moment I did. I hated her. But then I remembered something important. I remembered that I once was the parent of three healthy, typical children, and I didn\u2019t know about autism either. I didn\u2019t know about neurologist appointments, IEPs, co-morbid conditions. I didn\u2019t know about patience, and I didn\u2019t know about my granddaughter. I was ignorant once, too. I had to learn too. And I didn\u2019t want anyone to hate me for all that. I tried to picture this bloggerwoman as someone\u2019s daughter, someone\u2019s granddaughter. When I do that, I can\u2019t hate a person. I just can\u2019t hate someone I can imagine playing in a sandbox. So after I read what she wrote, I decided to just try to do for that blogger what I tried to do for my granddaughter at the library that day when she was struggling so hard to be patient: I tried to love her. Love isn\u2019t easy. Autism isn\u2019t easy. Patience isn\u2019t easy. Life isn\u2019t easy. But hatred is ugly. Hatred is what that woman wrote on her computer about my family. And hatred is unacceptable. I don\u2019t want to be a part of hatred. Besides, my mama used to say, \u201cKill \u2018em with kindness.\u201d So, mother from the library? Wherever you are? I want to tell you something. No matter how wrong, mean, and selfish you are, no matter what you write, my granddaughter and I forgive you. We hope you learn your lesson someday about autism, we hope eventually you and your insensitive friends learn how much people with special needs have to offer the world, but even if you are a very slow learner as you appear to be, we forgive you, because we\u2019re patient like that. And, finally, thank you. Thank you for reminding me what amazing children I have raised, what a lucky mother-in-law I am, and how much I treasure all of my grandchildren.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/03/eye-for-eye.html", "title": "\nAn Eye for an Eye\n"},

Suddenly, it seemed Rooster was three years old again --- I scrambled out of bed and into his room knowing before I got there that he was having a night terror. In the 20 seconds it took me to get to him, I noted how strange it felt to realize I'd nearly forgotten the night terrors that once plagued our home, and how it felt like much more than three years had passed since they happened regularly. I scooted in bed next to Rooster and out of pure muscle memory began comforting him by stroking his hair, rubbing his back, murmuring  reassurance ... \"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay...\" then I remember that none of that stuff had ever worked back in the day. I took a deep breath. Then, it clicked. The power of the deep breath. I'd been in his room two minutes or so when the last three years of learning from, about, and with my son all clicked into place with the power of the deep breath. I could practically hear the answer spoken aloud. The rooster did not need me to come solve his night terror, to come fret and soothe and worry and smother and TALK. He needed me to breathe. I held him in my arms. I went quiet. As he yelled and cried and clawed at himself, I breathed, long, slow, deep breaths. Within another two minutes, he did the same. He stopped thrashing, he stilled, and he breathed. For the first time in three years, he had a night terror. For the first time ever, I knew how to help him, by not helping him so much. When I could just relax and breathe, so could my Rooster. No more night terrors since.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/03/dreams.html", "title": "\nDreams\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 11, 2010", "body": "\nI carry a crazy rag bag of memory snippets around in my own head, and since my own head is the only one I can see from the inside, I'm never sure if it looks like anyone  else's , but I must sort of assume it does or question my own sanity. I prefer not to question my own sanity, thank you. So I find myself lately thinking about the snippets of the past in my mental rag bag, and wondering about what bags my children will carry with them. In my own bag, I have some particularly odd school-related scraps that seem to resurface frequently when I rifle through. There's a glimpse of myself in the fifth grade dressed as a cardboard hamburger for a play about nutrition, an even shorter piece in which I'm walking from one class to another trying to remember the spelling and definition of \" bucolic \" for a vocabulary test, a large swath of frustration from having to make the letter P into a picture that looked like a PIG in first grade, when already I could have spelled BOVINE but could not begin to draw so much as a recognizable stick figure. Then there are the bits of pieces of exceedingly random memories I carry around of my mom,  apropos  of nothing I can figure -- the bee that swam into her soda can at the pool, the time she made me go wallpaper shopping with her when I was 8 and I couldn't stay awake because it was so boring, how she took me to the mall with her once so she could buy a bathing suit for a trip to Florida even though when we got there it actually snowed while we were at Disney World. Some of my memory snippets embarrass me; I mean, they are memories of me being embarrassed (like the time I forgot to lock the bathroom door when I was at work in college), and yet when I think of them, I relive the embarrassment as if for the first time. I have an impulse to protect my children from the negative snippets, but I don't think that is possible. When I catch myself saying something stupid or insensitive to them, I try to stop myself with this reminder: Do I want it to make into their high rotation snippets? And sometimes, control freak that I guess I am, wishing I could take a moment we just had and foist in into their snippet library. I guess now that they are getting to be ages that I can recall being myself, it occurs to me that we are truly laying a foundation for their memories now. It strikes me as a daunting thought, like the realization that, as they are about to turn 4 and 6, no babies live at my house any more. One thing must be true: my children cannot possibly remember a time BEFORE we had ABA in our lives. My children cannot possibly remember life before autism, though they don't yet grasp what that means.  Also, there is no way they can remember me before I had grooves etched in my face. In their memory, I've always had \"old feet,\" too. Today as I drove to school, Peaches wanted to know all about my Grandpa. She kept getting confused between who her grandpa is and who mine was, but she kept saying, \"Can you tell me more?\" I told her the big stuff first, and then I had to rely on the snippets. When I close my eyes and picture my grandpa, I briefly see him putting his keys in the pocket of his plaid golf pants, then next dancing a little jig around the breakfast table, then taking  bananas to his 92-year-old mother, then handing me a stick of Big Red gum. Sadly, I have no way to pass those snippets to my kids, or make them very meaningful or coherent for them, so I keep those to myself, cherishing the way they keep my grandparents alive for me if not for my children. Surely these memories make me wonder what will first will come to my children's minds about me one day. Just the thought is enough to inspire me to my best behavior for at least a little while. When I think about school, and particularly my son's experience with it, I get very anxious about the memories he's making there, and the impression that they leave with him. Does anyone else feel this way, too?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/03/snippets.html", "title": "\nSnippets\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 26, 2010", "body": "\nMy son's teacher wanted to speak to my husband about a few issues this morning on the playground. For one thing, she said that another mother had let her know that she'd been hearing things about our Rooster. Her daughter had complained that he got up in her face, got too close. This other mother said she felt she would need to talk to her daughter about Rooster about his diagnosis. The teacher responded by asking her to choose her words carefully, because the rooster has not yet learned the word \"autism.\" Also, the teacher wanted us to know that my boy has been responding to corrections (like, \"Stay in line,\" or \"Keep your hands to yourself,\") by saying, \"I can't help it.\" She feels like we need to keep him from buying into this line, because if he says it often enough, he might come to believe it. I really respect this teacher. She has the boy's best interests at heart. Part of me wishes he could repeat kinder with her, but she believes strongly that he should go to first grade, which all of us assume he will repeat. Of course, transitioning a boy like mine comes with heavy doses of fear, as I worry that he will have a teacher who won't advocate for him bravely as she does. We want that mother in the class to talk to her daughter about our Rooster, we are glad she was planning to do that. We appreciate that the teacher offered that mom language to use like this: \"Tell you daughter that she has trouble with reading, but Rooster has trouble with things like playing with friends. Everybody has stuff that they have to learn to do, that is hard for them.\" We appreciate that the kindergarten teacher doesn't want  Roo  to believe there are things he \"can't\" do, that she doesn't want that word to figure prominently in his impressive vocabulary, that she believes in tough love. Soon, if not this very weekend, we plan to try to introduce our guy to the word for his diagnosis.  Goodfountain  wrote a beautiful post today about her relationship with that word, and if you haven't read it you should; it's a word that requires getting used to for sure. I don't know what  Roo  will make of it. What I hope, though, is that we will help him use it for finding community, as we try to do, and that he won't use it as a reason for why he \"can't.\" I expect this will be a weekend in which I'll be coming back to this blog again, to process not only my evolving relationship with the word autism, but my son's as well.

{"date": "Friday, March 5, 2010", "body": "\nIn my last post, I talked about how we are all related. I was thinking about my friend Elsa, whose niece suffered one tragic lost after another in Chile. I was glad I could lend a hand to Graciela, her niece, who I never would have heard of had I not met Elsa in an OT waiting room and she reached out to me, one mom to another. Today I am thinking about how related we are once again. We are one big family, and there are all kinds of needs in our family. Autism is a part of our family, for better or worse. I am writing from a professional development workshop. I came here full of excitement --- totally professionally pumped. I had to apply to get into this workshop, I had to work hard to make my application, and I looked at this trip as a bit of a graduation... me embarking on opportunities to think about something other than autism, to stretch my brain, to stretch my wings, to take on challenges. And I am loving it here at this workshop, and I am loving learning, and I'm loving connecting professionally. But are you ready for this? One of the best parts so far has been NOT \"leaving autism behind.\" I mean, don't get me wrong, I had fun \"flying solo\" and relaxing in the airport with a magazine, but one of the best parts is realizing how, as much as I wish autism NEVER existed, it is a part of me, part of us all, and it can help us learn and connect. If you read here, you know I'm no cheerleader, and I rail against autism. But I can celebrate our community, and I can celebrate our children, our children who have autism, and our hope, our possibilities, our potential. It is EVERYWHERE. See, when I got into this workshop, I had trouble getting a hotel room, so I took a chance and asked a woman who works at a sister school who also got in if we could be roommates. Last night when we were introducing ourselves to one another at the Marriott, she said to me, \"My five year old son has autism.\" Can you believe that I am OUT OF TOWN and still STAYED UP TOO LATE and didn't get enough sleep in a bed with all that thread count and delicious pillows? If you could see the BAGS under my eyes...  OY . My roommate and I have some serious stuff in common. Piles and loads and heaps and mounds of stuff in common. And we are very different. We talked about doctors and ABA and schools and  meds  and theories and guilt and denial and special talents and boys and potty training and husbands and working and  IEPs  and inclusion and special ed and movies and .... it helped. And as we were talking I realized I'd been holding my breath when I arrived at the conference. I loved NOT talking about autism, on the one hand, but I also felt I was holding something back. Everyone was talking about their kids, and I felt I had something I wasn't saying. I do not love autism. I love a boy who has autism, and many families who love someone with autism. I can't \"leave it behind.\" I can't leave being  Jewish behind. I can't leave being married or short or neurotic behind. Autism comes with me, and that isn't so bad. My family is ALWAYS with me. Wherever I go. We're all a family. We have a lot of sisters. Oh, I am learning A LOT at this conference.

{"date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "body": "\nTonight, I am pretty sure I was stoned on Sudafed. I say pretty sure, because I've never done drugs, but I certainly felt an altered state of consciousness as I zoned out, stared into space, left sentences unfinished, and could not for the life of me find the organic macaroni and cheese kit in the cabinet. Sadly, I liked how I felt. Not just because my headache went away and I could breathe again, either. So, no more Sudafed for me! I will tough it out through this horrible sinus business, but I am not a fan of altered states of consciousness because, as enjoyable as I find them, they scare me. Call me a control freak.

It's no damn wonder we have a huge drug problem in our country. 8. When does my Rooster feel like my Rooster? And when doesn't he? 9. If Sudafed feels like that, what must real drugs feel like? 10.

{"date": "Sunday, February 21, 2010", "body": "\nToday my husband cleaned out a bunch of junk from the garage. One piece of detritus he found? A rental agreement dated exactly 12 years ago today, with one of my previous names on it. I stood looking at it, absorbing the serendipity of the date, trying to calculate many things, some of which remain incalculable. Twelve years ago today, I rented my very first all-alone apartment. Twelve years ago, I walked away from a bad relationship, moved into a studio apartment, and thereby proclaimed I would NOT settle for less than what I wanted for my life. If I couldn't have a meaningful, truthful, passionate, satisfying relationship, I would rather be alone. The risk scared me. It scared me often, and in waves, and cyclically, hormonally, on full moons, and whenever I had a bad date, or no date at all on a Saturday night. But some of the time, I had an inkling better days would come, and I knew that I had to believe in myself, be true to myself. My very favorite memory from my little studio apartment -- and I made MANY happy memories during my two years calling it home -- came the night I first spoke on the phone with a guy I had met online. I had one cordless phone then, just before I got a cell in 2000, and we talked so long that the battery simply gave out. That had never happened to me before. I distinctly remember the butterflies in my stomach as the phone began its warning beep and I told J how much fun it had been to talk, but we'd have to catch up again tomorrow, if he would give me another call then. Then, I waited five minutes, staring at the clock, for my battery to recharge enough to call my best local girlfriend and blurt out hurriedly, \"My phone is dying but I just had to call you and tell you that I just had the best date of my whole life... on the phone! I have not even met him! It's crazy! He's probably an axe murderer or something I am sure so I will NOT get my hopes up but we (waving arms to keep away the motes) talked for TWO HOURS like we were in high school or something but it was all real stuff and interesting and ... OH! There goes my stupid phone! I gotta go!\" By that time, I had already started looking for a bigger apartment, so by the time we were officially dating -- the live, face-to-face kind, J -- who I married in 2002 -- never saw inside that studio apartment that I came to love before I outgrew it. Among the calculations I toyed with today, I wondered how many times you could fit my tiny apartment into our small house. Several, to be sure. I also figured that our mortgage costs nearly five times my old rent - Yikes! And, of course, because I tend to spend a lot more time worrying about the future than I do mulling over the past, I pretty quickly turned to future calculations. I wondered, if I make it through another 12 years, how different will my life be from now? I will mark my half century, my daughter will be almost old enough to drive, and my son will be just shy of 18. That kind of froze me in my wondering tracks. A lot can change in 12 years. I know from personal experience, for example, that if a girl proclaims to the universe, deities and all, \"I will NOT accept abuse or mediocrity, I choose to pursue my dreams,\" that good things CAN happen even after a series of bad breaks. In the 12 years since I signed that faded rental contract, a whole heck of a lot more than just my small life has changed monumentally. When I moved to my studio, Bill Clinton was president, the World Trade Center thrived, and I hoped in my lifetime America would elect a woman or a person of color to the presidency, but I never would have believed for a second that I'd so soon see an election between one of each. After a few minutes of standing speechless in the garage, I tossed the contract into the trash, and went on to spent much of the afternoon bribing the Rooster to work on bits of academics here and there. Hundreds Day is coming up at school, and so we had a display to make out of 100 Skittles. My boy has no concept of numbers, and our next diagnosis is sure to be  dyscalculia . He can mostly count out the 100 candies okay, if you correct him here and there along the way (like when he always skips 21), but if you tell him you have 20 red candies and he has two orange, and you ask which one is greater (more, or a bigger number), he will simply guess in the hopes of avoiding the  zillionth  explanation of greater than and less than. Quantity simply means nothing to him. Lately I've been fearing that he will never get math due to his  dyscalculia , never get reading due to his  Irlen's  Syndrome, never get school due to his  ADHD , never get socialization due to his autism... That's a lot of  nevers  to worry about. If you buy into them, if you believe those nagging  nevers , you have to give up the hope that this bright and loving boy will find a way to thrive, that he'll have friends, that he'll succeed at school, that he'll learn to drive, graduate, get a job. The fears nag at me often, late at night, and early in the morning, and when I'm at work and see a class of  kindergartners  writing addition and subtraction facts... But most of the time I do realize that my Rooster is right now just a kindergarten boy with a lot on his plate and some wonderful resources to help him navigate his challenges. And I know, more importantly, that a whole heck of a lot can improve in twelve years if we all stay true to ourselves, believe in our possibilities, and refuse to settle for less than we deserve. Thank goodness for that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/02/you-do-math.html", "title": "\nYou Do the Math\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 19, 2010", "body": "\nOn the one hand, joy is one of my favorite words, but on the other, I think relief might be my true favorite feeling. That says something about a person, I think. What does it say about me? Maybe I lack endurance. Maybe I have a low pain threshold. Probably I'm just too uptight. I'm thinking a lot tonight about relief, and how significant it is to me right now. I am honoring relief, and acknowledging how much I value it. I worked all through college on the campus newspaper. Having imagined for my whole life that I would become a journalist, getting paid to work with my friends in a kind of apprenticeship felt natural and wonderful, but also stressful and draining. My work wasn't just for joy, it was how I paid for books and gas. I didn't volunteer, I held paid staff positions, among many talented people who, unlike me, went on to impressive careers in the field. Being a morning person, I always took 8 a.m. classes, and being a newspaper editor, I tended to work until about 9 p.m. When the paper went to press, I never knew where to put my pent up stress, my leftover adrenaline, and I tended to fret and sweat every last headline and piece of punctuation even when they could no longer be changed. I struggled to figure out how to downshift after work so that I could face the series of long and stressful, though exciting and rewarding, days and weeks of each semester, and still embrace the good times of being a college kid. The sensation that gave me a small measure of relief came when, around 9 or 10, we shut off the office's computers; the room, already quieting by degrees, stopped humming as the last Mac finally let out its sigh, and we each headed off on our separate ways. Whenever someone describes the sound of silence, I think of the news office, and the relief of turning everything off. I don't get  migraines , though since my mother and husband both have, I can appreciate how severe they can get, and that they are in a class by themselves -- they are not your standard issue headache. One time though I did have a vicious headache, brutal in its intensity, severe enough to send me to the emergency room, where doctors and nurses finally medicated me to knock me out and silence my excruciating complaining! It wasn't the most agony I ever felt, because after all I've given birth twice!, but it hurt like hell, and unlike labor it never relented for a single moment before the drugs kicked in a few hours into the abyss. When I woke up, I felt better. Not ready to tackle the world -- I actually still felt bad enough that on a regular day it would have warranted several Advil and probably a trip to the school nurse. But by comparison? I felt such relief, waking up without the agony flattening me, that the relief itself felt precious and worth celebrating. With each passing hour, as I came back to one hundred percent, I acknowledged the growing relief to anyone who would listen. Those who had to put up with my bitter proclamations of my pain then had to tolerate my detailed analysis of my recovery, my comparisons to my college newspaper office, but surely that also, in turn, gave them less of a headache than my moaning and groaning. As I am sure anyone who knows me would agree, I am one who grieves deeply and keenly when I grieve, and I grieve long and slowly. It is relief from grief that emerges most incrementally, that almost requires time lapse video to trace. The grief is like being swarmed by six million killer bees, and after you kill one at a time, day after day, slowly the buzzing ebbs and the dark swarm shrinks. Relief... a marked decline in pain... a reduction in tension... a subsiding of stress... edges out joy by a nose for my Olympic gold in the emotions field, even though that makes me much less vibrant and fearless than I'd like to be. I have been blogging for two years now. My blog began with a quest, many questions, terrible fear, and much grief, as my husband and I began the journey to get our son diagnosed and, more importantly, get the Rooster healthier and happier. My blog began as my grandmother's decline became steadily more insurmountable. My blog began in a place that felt, to me, at the time, bereft of relief. It has been two long and slow yet fast and furious years. You can look at photos of me then and now and see a map develop of the rough terrain I've traversed. So many lines on my face! The days? How long they have been. The weeks? Full of limping, limping to Friday finishes. The months? Seemed to change in a blur before I got used to writing their number in my checkbook. We have filled two years with passages, with treks, with expeditions. We have worked. Our. Asses. Off. In two years, I cannot imagine how many doctors we have had, let alone estimate the number of visits. The dollar amount would surely draw a gasp. The miles we've logged would choke an environmentalist, but at least we finally bought a hybrid. (Stupid  Toyotas , though; don't get me started.) In two years of adjusting to autism in our lives, I have written more first person than I, with my journalism background, ever dreamed I'd write in a lifetime. In two years, I have blogged enough to fill two paperback books of more than 300 pages each. I wish I could tell you I filled these two years with joy. I did aim to. I believe my children have known  their  fair share of moments of exquisite joy in this time, and that their childhoods are not lacking it. For me, though, these two revolutions of the earth about the sun have been tinted, I must admit, though with some shame, by my grieving process. I have been slow to let go of the pain it cost me to say goodbye to my grandmother, I have been slow to process what it means to have a child with diagnoses:  hypotonia ,  torticollis , asthma, autism,  ADHD , food allergies,  strabismus , and the latest,  Irlen  Syndrome. I have been slow to learn and accept and heal and regroup. I have been quick to cry and moan, to research and read, to learn and try and brainstorm and invent, to wallow, to weep, wonder, to worry. This is my anniversary post, celebrating if you will two years of Rooster Calls. I've been conquering one killer bee at a time, and I'm ready to celebrate the relief of that today. Before I shut down this humming laptop, I raise my glass to you, my readers, and to this, my blog, and say, \"To relief... which I feel emerging, tiny bit by tiny bit. And to joy, which I hope waits in even larger measure for our whole Rooster clan as the sun rises on our new journeys. Thank you for helping us get there, and may you and yours have healthy measures of relief and joy coming your way, too.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/02/two-feelings.html", "title": "\nTwo Feelings\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 13, 2010", "body": "\nToday I took my Rooster on a little date, a little mother-son time at the park. Only he had his eye on other girls the whole time. Had he been anyone else, I might have taken offense. Instead, I pretty well enjoyed being thrown over for a cutie named Abbie. So I park myself on a bench after a while near another mom and a couple as  Roo  and Abbie and some other  new-found  friends run, climb, slide. It isn't clear to me which parents go with which children, and I must be just as anonymous, as suddenly all adults look up when they hear a loud five-year-old proclaim, \"Come with me! I will take you to Never Never Land where we will never get old!\" Off they fly as the \"old\" audience chuckles, myself included. The nearest mom looks at me, smiling. \"That little boy? You heard him? Cute! So cute!\" My boy and I don't share much family resemblance; we both have wild curls, but of opposite colors and lengths to be sure. \"That's my little boy,\" I say, beaming. \"My Peter Pan!\" I can't remember the last time I spent a substantial chunk of time with my son (or even talking about my son) when the word autism did not come up. We stayed at the park for two and a half hours, though, and I never felt the need to say it, imply it, or really contemplate it much. Sure, he probably stood out in some ways at times, both favorable and not, but he also managed his emotions, enjoyed himself, and socialized. I don't hate the word autism, but I enjoyed a break from needing it in my vocabulary today. When Abbie's parents told her to say goodbye, she did so reluctantly. She wanted to keep playing. He, however, nearly melted down --- he didn't just want to play, he wanted Abbie. \"No! She can't go! She needs to stay!\" he told me. \"I need to play with Abbie forever!\" I knew that this could unravel, but I also knew how far my son has come thanks to his ABA program \"When Things Don't Go My Way.\" I took a deep breath, summoned all my patience, and explained that I understood his sadness, but that I knew he could keep calm and talk to me about it instead of throwing a tantrum.

EVER,\" he repeated for emphasis. I told him I understood EXACTLY how he felt, because I've wanted people to stay with me forever too, and sometimes they couldn't. But, I told him, \"For now, at least you have me.\" I don't know that my boy enjoyed the time he spent with me as much as I enjoyed him, but at least he got my completely undivided attention.

I turn this idea over and over, and wonder what I am meant to learn beyond this cliche. About a year ago, my husband and I decided that our two vehicles needed replacing. BOTH -- what an expense! At age 37, I still drove the very first car I ever purchased, still played cassette tapes in it and rolled my windows down by hand. My husband still drove the used car he bought when met him, in spite of the ripped up seats, poor mileage, chronic repairs, swaths of missing paint on the hood, lacking safety features. We needed to buy two cars. We gulped. We spent time researching, reading Consumer Reports, making lists and comparisons. Then, we panicked and decided we could only afford one car. We opted to get one brand new, fuel efficient, family-sized SAFE car for me to use with the kids. Eventually we thought we'd scrape together a little more money for a good used vehicle for my husband. Then Cash for Clunkers happened, and we could not deny the  clunkiness  of his vehicle, or the lure of shaving $10,000 off a hybrid. We took on a car loan and bought our family its second, oh-so-safe Toyota. Ironic, isn't it, that our carefully planned purchases meant to last us many years both made the news within the first year for their recalls and their terrifying potential dangers.

Maybe it\u2019s a blogger you have always wanted to meet or the author of your favorite book. Maybe it\u2019s someone in your community who is making a difference. Maybe it is your grandmother or a dear friend. Write them a letter or an email. Tell them how they are making a difference in your life or how they are inspiring you. Just start. You will know exactly what to say.\" Dear Friends, Do you know why I like you? Because you teach me things. I admit I make a poor student, but I'm a voracious one, and maybe because I learn so slowly, I seek patient, kind, forgiving teachers such as yourself to be my best friends. I want to thank you for making a difference in my life, for inspiring me, for teaching me. Oh, you thought I was supposed to be the teacher? But no. You -- doctors, parents, architects, researchers, - ists , whatchamacallits by profession -- you model so much that I need to learn, and so I see you as my teachers. Did you know that you taught me how to exercise? My parents seemed never to have spoken that language, and so you took it upon yourself to kick me into better shape. Now, I jog, and I think about how you taught me how, and I feel better, stronger, healthier. You taught me confidence. That one took you countless, countless hours! Several of you t0 ok  turns approaching that lesson from various modalities, but it finally sunk in after all these years. Friends, you taught me to travel, to take risks, to broaden my horizons. In doing so, you undid the lessons I thought I'd learned at home: that risk yields failure, that the world is a scary mean place, that who I was going to be was limited by the failures of my lineage. You taught me how to grow up, how to slow down, how to embrace my youth. You have taught me how to parent, and how not to parent. Some of you have taught me without ever showing me your face. I have listened to you in my mind when I needed to, though I might not have ever heard you speak aloud. Friends, I might not always do you proud in demonstrating what I've learned, but I believe I earn an A for effort, and I want you to know that every single day, whether I mention it or not, and even (especially) when I am sulking, I feel deep gratitude for the many friends who have served as my best teachers. This past weekend, I had a rare opportunity to indulge myself in a little getaway. I loved spending time with one of you, and I had the rest of you on my mind nearly every single minute... I took the time to reflect on you, on your many lessons, on my good fortune to know you. Oh how I thought of you as I explored serene art galleries! I thought of you as I perused countless shops. I thought of you over delicious meals, silly drinks. I thought of you as I read. I tried to follow all your best advice. I came home calmer, more centered, with more room for patience. I came home and saw I had a homework assignment, and immediately I knew it was time to thank you. I hope you hear what I'm saying. Happy Valentine's Day, friends, with love.

{"date": "Saturday, January 30, 2010", "body": "\nMy boy has been taking some lovely steps forward. It seems his class must be taking leaps, though, and they started off far ahead to begin with. Most days I am able to happily revel in his lovely steps -- his increased communication, his greater inquisitiveness, his sounding out of some short words, his shoe tying, his ability to (mostly) dress himself, his willingness to spend extra time with me trying to explore basic math concepts like \"more and less.\" Friday, though, the note came home from kindergarten officially warning us he is not making adequate progress in math or sight word recognition. This is not our first such note -- in November it only listed math. At the time, my response went something like, \"If his biggest problem in school is math, I consider it good news.\" Guess who overhead me? The deities. And they were not amused. The  Roo  has long days because he has two working parents. In school, he has had much to overcome, so he has a dedicated teacher, a hardworking aide, a (weird) speech teacher, a patient OT, and a super inclusion specialist all trying to help him overcome his challenges. After dismissal, he  goes to aftercare with an aide who makes sure he does his homework and that he participates at least a little in the group games and physical activities. At 4:30, I pick him up and we head home. When we get there at 5:15, our behaviorist is waiting for us to start two hours of ABA. During ABA every weeknight, we have dinner, unpack and repack backpacks, and focus on behavioral goals like turn taking, maintaining a conversation, and self care skills. At 7:30 we have time for a few stories,  toothbrushing , and bed. That leaves weekends for \"extra practice.\" We sneak in math and reading into every day activities as much as possible, counting everything we can, sounding out signs, all that stuff. But on weekends we also need to work on his low muscle tone (today he started  Kung   Fu ) and his cooperative play (today we went to the park). When the kids want to see \"videos\" on my computer, I act like it's a huge gift I give them when I play Schoolhouse Rock math videos from  Youtube . When I read them stories, I let them select from my pile of library books pertaining to the kindergarten curriculum. Hey, I'm a teacher. I know some of the advice I ought to give myself. I know that kids develop at their own pace, that autism is a developmental disorder, that it won't help to make  Roo  resent learning by \"teaching\" him at home all the time, that you can't compare kids, that he has an  IEP  in place so the report card should freak me out less, that right now his socialization and behavior goals matter even more than the academics, that his vision problems have had a long term impact on his visual spatial reasoning and will likely be improved through his new glasses, that progress takes time, that he's just five years old and this is a marathon not a sprint. I know that we have a great team, and a wonderful boy. I know things could be worse, and that the report card doesn't convey a very full picture of our boy's intelligence. I know that he has  ADHD  on top of autism, and clearly he has slow processing issues, making him hard to assess. And I know I should take a deep breath.  What I don't know, and what I want to know, is: When ISN'T therapy? And if we're working this hard and so far behind, how do we hold on to hope of ever catching up on anything? Whatever happened to \"hanging out?\" Is it better to repeat kindergarten or first grade? Will things ever get easier? If so, when? Is he in the right school? Is there a right school? How can we even tell which things work, and which things don't? I mean, how do we know, when things go well, if we did something right, or he would have just made that development in time on his own? All of this... all of it... makes me weary and a little resentful. Not of  Roo  -- I'm so proud of him. Sometimes I resent how hard society makes it to deal with autism, how little  inclusivity  I can feel in some ways. You know what? Forget all that! I don't want to think about anything in this post except for my first sentence. Remember where I began? You don't have to scroll back there, because I am going to repeat myself for emphasis: My boy has been taking some lovely steps forward. However you add it up or spell it, that is what counts.

See, we have a fireplace that is just fine, now. It isn't fancy or luxurious or impressive or remarkable. My glee about the fireplace might seem disproportionate; I know J likes the fireplace, but doesn't feel the same degree of exuberance about the recent remodel of its facade that I do. Almost every time I look at it, notice its simple and unobtrusive way of fitting in with our basic little home, I find myself sighing with satisfaction. (Okay, and maybe fantasizing just a wee bit about painting over that stark bright white paint, but who wants to get all picky...) I'm glad I finally found a local handyman, got J to help mock up an easy design in  Photoshop , selected soothing natural materials, and ponied up the necessary cash, because it makes walking through my front door each day a little easier. I like overcoming the uglies. J likes the fireplace fine, says he's glad we managed to make the project finally happen with  minimal  intrusion into our busy lives, but if he can't relate to my level of gratification, that's because it didn't gnaw on his nerves every day of the last two and a half years. J doesn't sweat stuff like that, he finds his peace more readily. I envy it, I try to emulate it but can't. Our fireplace, when bought our house, stood out for its mistakes and made me itch with how badly I wanted to fix it. It was not hideous, just run of the mill ugly, and I wanted to improve it as fast as I possibly could. Two and half years was as fast as I possibly could. And the knowledge that it had the potential to look so much better but that I didn't have the capacity to make it happen with so much more consequential ugliness all around me --- well, that gave me mental  eczema . I find myself struggling right now with our daily routines, the essential structure of our life, the way I did with the ugly fireplace,  pre - facelift . Now, I know my metaphors get messy, but let me be clear: I am not comparing our fireplace to autism! And I CERTAINLY am not equating it with our children. I am talking about the grind... the shape forced on our family unit by the constraints of time and the shortage of resources. Our weeks look run-of-the-mill ugly to me. They have for too long. While I know that they are not hideous weeks, not nearly as grotesque as they could be, as they have been at some past times, while they aren't something to turn away from in horror for their gruesomeness, the fact that I haven't found the wherewithal to make them over so they can more simply blend in with our little life irritates me a little worse each day. Our weeks need a makeover. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KUUlukgav70/S1kdSQv-B6I/AAAAAAAAAGQ/Tjr3SyPICfc/s1600-h/redonefp.bmp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KUUlukgav70/S1kdSDEXhXI/AAAAAAAAAGI/xI8pJv3cyxc/s1600-h/uglyfp.bmp", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KUUlukgav70/S1kd5phk0bI/AAAAAAAAAGY/aNou3w6srt4/s1600-h/redonefp.bmp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KUUlukgav70/S1kdSQv-B6I/AAAAAAAAAGQ/Tjr3SyPICfc/s1600-h/redonefp.bmp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KUUlukgav70/S1kdSQv-B6I/AAAAAAAAAGQ/Tjr3SyPICfc/s1600-h/redonefp.bmp", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KUUlukgav70/S1kdSQv-B6I/AAAAAAAAAGQ/Tjr3SyPICfc/s1600-h/redonefp.bmp"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/01/slated-for-renovation.html", "title": "\nSlated for Renovation\n"},

Allow me to dump this: When I put sunflower seed butter on Roo's toast tonight instead of Earth Balance, he threw a football at my head. At close range.  I am pretty sure I could have paid for Julia's red carpet dress with what I've spent so far on Good Nights.  My car is on a recall list for a possible defect that terrifies me too much to describe to you in a post about jinxes. The dealership says it can't help me with the fix for month.  My son's teachers want him to learn to snap his own pants, and we are trying, but it doesn't help that he can't see the snap over his melon belly. No store I can find has sizes that fit him. Size 5husky are too tight, size 6husky are too long, and it's too cold for shorts.  Peaches has hit a phase of, um, okay, disequilibrium. But incessent whining and shrill screaming and absurd, obsessive demands make me want to describe it as b*tchiness. Sorry, I should have more patience.  I tried nine times to find out about Roo's day. Every answer one of the various and detailed answers he gave came from his Peter Pan CD. Tomorrow I get to take 60 kindergarten students on a full day field trip to an art museum renowned not so much for its child-friendly art but for its gardens  --- during the worst series of endless storms to have hit these parts in some time. I am listening to hail fall as I write this. The museum officials do not allow you to eat inside, and they do not have shelter where you can eat outside, and there are NOT enough bathrooms to suit me. This is how I spend my \"vacation\" days.  Okay, on the off chance anyone is still with me, I posit this theory, owning that it may be entirely wrong, and also that the deities might be about to smite me:  The Rooster seems like he is emerging. We spent the last year giving him some medication we believed would help him regulate his aggression, and when we learned we had to wean him off it I felt terrified, only to find out that with every level we reduce on his medication, he appears more peaceful, present, communicative, and happy. Now I find myself looking forward to April when he'll be completely chemical free.  I CANNOT BELIEVE I JUST TOLD YOU THAT. AND ON A NIGHT WHERE WE'VE HAD THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.  Climbing UNDER my bed now... Please do a purification ritual on my behalf, send our family any of your spare good karma, and wrap the rooster in a protective force field.

{"date": "Sunday, January 17, 2010", "body": "\nToday, I got a rare chance to catch up with a friend who has had a tough time of things over the last couple of years. She started down a career path she had worked long and hard to pursue, only to find out it didn't lead where she hoped. Then, after going to see her doctor for a run-of-the-mill appointment, she received an unexpected diagnosis of MS. Finally, in September, while headed on a  road trip  with her husband to visit family in another state, he told her that he did not want to be married anymore; they were still virtually newlyweds, and she never saw that coming. My friend is brave and strong and beautiful, and just four months after this painful crisis, already she has picked herself up and started fresh with grace that I deeply admire. I know she had moments of despair along the way, and that she still cycles through many emotions, but she simply refuses to linger in heartbreak. When I admired this about her, she told me that I had helped her. Me? What did I do? I haven't called enough and this is the first time I've seen her; I barely have enough coping skills to keep myself afloat most days, as you well know! So it surprises and deeply gratifies me that I could be of any help to anyone else. My friend she said that when she first told me a couple of months ago about the split, I didn't do what so many others had done. I didn't say, \"This will make you stronger.\" Instead, I said, with the voice of some experience in the breakup department, \"Friend, this is awful right now, but I want you to know that later new opportunities will arise in your life that would not be there had you not gone through this right now. They won't erase the bad, but they will bring new good things, surprises that you will cherish, and that you otherwise would never have experienced.\" Then my strong friend told me that she really has no desire to get any stronger, thank you very much, so sometimes she feels angry at first when people tell her about all that strength she'll gain from her divorce. (She knows that they mean well.) But, she said, what I had told her about new opportunities in her life ahead gave her something she could \"latch on to,\" and that gave her a sense of hope and purpose. Right now she's wisely focusing on her new and successful career, taking some time to travel and adventure, and being good to herself. We both look forward to getting together in the near future when we can celebrate some of the unexpected goodness sure to come her way. I can't adequately describe how much it means to me that what I told my friend played any small part in helping her. The beautiful thing, though, is that she listened, that she heard it, that she had the strength to use it in the way that she needed. I believe in what I told my friend. It took me years to figure it out after my breakup, although probably people tried to tell me earlier and I just couldn't hear them. And almost two years into Rooster's autism diagnosis, I still can't always carry the lesson over to realize that our family's journey, too, brings its own opportunities and joys if I am open to them. I want to be more like my young friend. I want to be a better listener.

So it takes a while; I practically forgot about the project. But this week, my friend brought me... ( drum roll  please...) Rooster Calls, year one, the book. Whoaaaahhhh . On my bedside table, I have a HEFTY paperback. My young editor informs me it taxes and maxes Blurb's size limit, which I'm going to guess (since the pages aren't numbered) is in the neighborhood of 300 pages. That's weird. I don't know what it is I expected, or why I found this so shocking, but the weirdest thing is that it looks just like a book. It looks just like I wrote a book, and it's got my name on it and a photo of my boy on the front, and it's sitting on my bedside table right next to stuff by Anne  Lamott  and Terry McMillan, and that strikes me and exceedingly weird when I think about it. Here is the weirdest part: I read it, and I liked it. I  enjoyed  reading it. Why?! I can't say I enjoyed writing it! Or living it! You know? It's my  angsty  wallowing. I can never really believe it that you all are reading as I write it, because I feel so annoying while I'm bleeding loudly into my laptop. Yet, when I read the book, I saw the arc of the story as one that showed a family developing, a woman growing, a community building. (You, by the way, are one of my favorite characters.) I don't know that I will want my kids to read this book ever. (I worry more, I think, about my mom reading it.) But, it turns out, my hesitation doesn't come from worrying I'm too negative (which, of course, I am), as I expected, but because I realize once again that I didn't write it for them, or for anyone else. I wrote it for me. My blog is my sanity, my outlet, my self-medication, my community, my drug. I DO want to write a book for others, and I fantasize all the time about how, in particular, to write one for families just facing a diagnosis who are freaking out the way that I was when started reading blogs because the books I found just kept failing me. I hope I write that book. I feel like seeing Rooster Calls as a book empowers me to believe I can do that. But Rooster Calls is how I give myself an act of kindness, and because it turns out I like reading it, I don't really want to worry about if anyone else does, especially my kids. Hey, I gotta go now. I am reading this really great book, and even though I've already read it once, I can't seem to put it down. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/01/booked-up.html", "title": "\nBooked Up\n"},

Maybe 20 minutes. But get this: They shared! They took turns! They used their imaginations! They seemed happy! They took their fun to another room and we let them! They were okay without us! Wow. Makes my heart soar even remembering it.  My inlaws watched my kids for THREE DAYS. My husband and I drove them there (about two hours away) and then got ourselves a hotel room nearby - just the two of us. We took walks, listened to the rain, read, went to fun restaurants, watched movies, sat in front of HGTV for  hours, wrote, and SLEPT. Don't hate me because I have beautiful inlaws! I grew up with crazy parents, if it makes you feel any better.  We celebrated my husband's grandmother's 90th birthday, and during the lovely party, my FIL looked at me and said, \"It's good to have family.\" Right then, as my kids happily mixed through the crowd of 14 relatives, everyone smiling and chatting warmly, I thought no truer words had ever been spoken. I don't remember ever feeling at ease at a family gathering before with both my kids present. I felt full of pride; that phrase \"pride and joy\" resonated like never before. My kids have come a looooooooooong way, to be (mostly) comfortably part of a celebration where someone ELSE gets the gifts, they can't eat all the same foods as everyone else, there are many things they shouldn't touch, everyone stays up past their bedtime, people want them to sit and smile for pictures, and adults want to just sit and talk and talk...  My mother sent me a bracelet that used to be my grandmother's. Speaks for itself... My husband bought me a necklace with a letter on it, the first letter of both my kids' names. I had wished out loud for just such a gift, but didn't really expect to get it. My favorite thing is that it's made from an old typewriter key. I love stuff like that. I especially loved that my husband heard me, made that particular wish come true.  My inlaws gave us a gift card of a future date, when they plan to come babysit while we go out to see a show. (Hey, I said don't hate me: remember, my own father was a wanted criminal chased by the feds for half my childhood!) During the best parts and the most stressful parts of the holidays, all the highs and lows, my husband took every opportunity he could find to tell me he loved me. Friends and relatives reached out with words, deeds, and all manner of generosity --- not just toward me, but toward our whole little family. We were given gifts of tangibles, of time, of support and patience, of WORDS, and even of educational support for our boy. It all equals love, really. I feel enormously grateful.   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-best-holiday-gifts.html", "title": "\nMy Best Holiday Gifts\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 3, 2010", "body": "\nI can't help but first get a little defensive about my love of books. BOOKS: I've got WAY more of 'em in my little house than gadgets, despite my work in technology. Go to the library where I work and grab any 30 books at random from the enormous collection. My name will be on some of the checkout cards, guaranteed. Check the computer records: I venture to guess that I've checked out more books than anyone else ever in the school, and some people have worked there a decade or more longer than I have. I've held cards to more libraries than I care to count, read more books than I know HOW to count. Kids books, adult books, reference books -- I love them. Paper, hardback, digital (Kindle), I love them. Respect them. I SNIFF them, and smile, like some people do with home baked bread. Really into books, this one. We're all totally clear on this, yes? Okay, well. A relative asked me today if books helped me deal with my son's diagnosis. My own reaction surprised me somewhat, and I've been thinking about it ever since. The truth is, reading has helped me in ways for which I'll be forever grateful, but books I bought about autism, especially when I sought answers in my early grief after my son's diagnosis, might have caused me more harm than good. Wow. Maybe this is a \"no duh\" to some of you, but just saying this shocks me; it's a new take on my own learning, my own self knowledge. I, like some friends I know, have lately had an urge to take most of my parenting books, autism books, special needs books, and trash them. Not all. (Some, like This Lovely Life, are treasures.) But most. Now, books might not be to blame, really; I confess I probably had some impossible expectations. I think I was searching for a book that was like a travel guide to my own life, a manual for my very own family, and that is a book I realize now that only I could write. But some books, I fear, might have exploited my (and your?) vulnerabilities. Some books I think tried to pretend they could really be that Fodor's for my Autism Travels. And they lead me in many wrong directions, costing me time and grief, and I resent those books. On a tougher day I resent them almost (but not quite) enough to make me (gasp) throw books in the garbage. I don't know how well you'd like it, but rather than read these wanna-be guidebooks that promise me more maps than they can possibly deliver, I know that I would prefer an honest book that starts like this: This is a book, and a book written in the time of autism - a pivotal time in which autism seems to be exploding, and every day autism presents our children, our country, our world, with rapidly expanding layers of questions. This is just a book, and it might help you. And it might not. As a book, it's not all knowing, it's not a crystal ball, and it's not going to be all things to all people. Autism is a spectrum, and most books come in black and white. Autism is complex, challenging, and not easily defined. The permutations of issues related to autism are infinite, and, especially given the limiting cost of paper and ink, books are most assuredly finite. Check the index of this book and you will find no rapidly expanding layers of answers. If you love someone with autism, or you care about someone who loves someone with autism, you need many resources, many supports, many layers of networks. You need more than this book. You need the blogosphere. You need the Internet. And maybe you need this book just a little bit, because this book will tell you how to find more of the things that might give you some of what you need. This is the book that wants you to put it down as soon as you can, and (after you have spent some good time with your family and maybe taken a hot shower) go to your computer. Because no matter what the authors of this book know about autism, and they know as much as the next family with a member on the spectrum, they do not know what your experience with autism looks like, or how to best support you, but they know that online it is entirely possible that you can find the community that fits your needs. Even that community will not have all the answers. Even that community will have limitations, and be stymied by some of autism's conundrums. But, like this book, you will be able to respect that blogging community if you choose it carefully, and it can be filled with love.  Is that book out there? Did I miss it on Amazon? Or do I (and a you) need to write it?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2010/01/book-talk.html", "title": "\nBook Talk\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2009", "body": "\nI remember as a child spending days questioning if, given the choice between two losses, I'd rather lose my hearing or my sight. I tried walking around with my eyes shut, I tried spending a day in silence. I framed it as a question of loss, and survival. I was kind of a brooding kid, sure, but I imagine plenty of people think about these things growing up, wondering: Could I face loss? Is one kind of suffering better or worse than another? Humans by nature compare. That seems somewhat  universal  to me. What strikes me as the funniest thing about the way I framed the question is the part about, \"given the choice.\" Control freak that I am, right? As if, right? Yes, wouldn't it be lovely if we could CHOOSE to be given the challenges for which we are best suited! Life should hand us little check-the-box surveys, and then parcel out our offspring appropriately, too... I grew up with a chip on my shoulder... er, um, I mean, a mantra, that said, \"I LIKE hard work. Bring it on. Easy is for wimps.\" Before we married, I tried to convince my husband to join the Peace Corps with me not for a better reason than that. The one big fight we had while dating was because I jumped to the conclusion that he grew up \"on easy street\" which I, in my overly  sanctimonious  ways (forgive me, I HAVE matured some in the decade since then) believed made him \"soft.\" I thought having a  dysfunctional  family qualified me as some kind of martyr! I had this notion that I paid some \"dues\" - whatever that means! It all seems pretty silly now, and I am sure I still have PLENTY more to learn about my own foolishness. My plentiful foolishness. But one prism through which I've come to better understand how foolish my controlling nature is has to do with the way I have been prone at times to compare special needs parenting. For as much or as little as you can categorize kids, or special needs kids, I have found myself at times lumping kids with autism into the ill-fitting and unhelpful boxes of \"more hyperactive\" versus \"more withdrawn,\" and when I have done this I have (foolishly) lamented that I am having a hard time parenting a \"more hyperactive\" son when my nature perhaps might be better suited to a \"more withdrawn\" one. If you are currently  UNFRIENDING  me on  FB , just know that I don't blame you, but I really am working on being less controlling, foolish, and, um, stupid. (Just don't call it a New Year's Resolution, because I don't make those...) To me, there is about as much point in thinking, \"I can't handle my hyperactive son,\" as there is in saying, \"You were given this challenge because you are strong.\" I don't believe either of those two things. As I posted a while back, I've already come to terms with, \"You get what you get and you don't get upset,\" and I certainly have learned that there is no measuring contest for grief and suffering, no prizes awarded. I have also learned that if there were, I wouldn't be anywhere near in the running (not that I mean to tempt fate). Now I'm striving to master the notion, \"Life is random and mysterious; live in the now.\" The truth, and the confession that I'm baring before you now, is that sometimes when one of my friends laments how hard it is to get their child to play with others, or to take an interest in toys or friends, I feel this tiny reaction that hearkens back to, \"I could handle deaf, because I'm not so auditory really anyway when you get done to it, but BLIND? And never READ again? Or SEE my family? NO WAY! Then I'd DIE.\" Well, I guess more accurately, what (stupid) my knee-jerk reaction says is, \"I'll trade you. At least your kid doesn't DIVE INTO a park full of strangers and act SO WEIRD that kids scatter. At least your kid doesn't walk into most groups of other children primed to start a gigantic conflict!\" As if, right?! As if my lot is tragic, or the lot of the child (and mother of the child) whose autism isolates them quietly is not... again, as if there is a quantifiable better or worse to the spectrum of autism's challenges. As if my angst of my son's frequent conflicts would vanish like magic if he retreated into himself more and engaged the world less. (Whoa... Can I unfriend MYSELF? But no, I forgive me for my foolishness because at least I'm trying to learn better.) Of course I recognize that I would not really \"trade\" my son for anything. I am telling you that I am not proud of my knee-jerk comparison reaction, and that by broadcasting my own ignorance, I hope that I help improve my own perspective. No, I'm not exactly going to through a celebratory party that my son sometimes hurls himself toward people in awkard and destructive and alienating ways, but I MUST remember, and I WILL remember to be grateful for his friendships, for the empathy he shows sometimes when someone cries, for his passion for life and life experiences. By writing this post, I help myself in the practice of remembering and appreciating. Our journey is to help the Rooster also find centeredness, calm, focus, self-control. Our journey is not so very different from the journey of a family trying to help calm, focused children on the spectrum express their empathy and passion. As the saying goes, \"We all have our stuff.\" In my quest for getting my head screwed on straight, and in search of that elusive PERSPECTIVE I yammer on about trying to find, I need to post about how I am learning that: no one goes through life unscathed, but that doesn't mean there is no JOY along the way; there are no \"points\" for suffering;  your suffering is not BETTER or WORSE than my suffering; your kid is not BETTER or WORSE than my kid; my kid's challenges are what I need to deal with, and I bring  my own baggage  to those challenges, with which I also must deal; I have as much or more to learn as my son; trying to control the universe and resent it for not complying, rather than trying to become a more patient, resilient, and accepting human being, makes me a kind of deaf and blind that I CAN choose not to become.    \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/12/controlling-myself.html", "title": "\nControlling Myself\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, December 29, 2009", "body": "\nI haven't talked much about this, but I have often remembered the first time I ever wondered: What if I had a child with autism?  This was well before we had reason to suspect that we already did.  My baby boy is less than a year old. He has had my heart for far longer than he's been outside my body. I fill journals with letters I write to him, pouring out my love and all my wishes for him  -- a precursor to this blog. We are living in our first home, our condo. We are downstairs, we have the TV on, I'm wearing sweats. The Rooster is a sweet, slobbery, difficult baby who sleeps poorly and catches every germ, and he is gorgeous and charming too, and I am still more giddy over his existence than I am exhausted, but only by degrees, and not all the time. Parenthood strikes me as harder than I had expected, though I had not expected ease. Already I frequently feel baffled and awkward at mommy/baby groups but I keep thinking of it as a mommy problem, not a baby problem.    The Rooster is playing on the floor, not too near the TV, because we have been careful not to let him get too much screen time - hIt will be a year before I introduce him to Sesame Street (when my very pregnant body needs a rest after I feed him dinner and before daddy gets home), and I still am allowed to watch things that interest me on occasion. He is playing with farm magnets while Good Morning America is on, and the doctor is doing a medical story about \"The Tilt Test.\" The idea is that you hold your baby in outstretched arms, then tilt him to see if he allows you to, or if he leans his body in effort to not tilt, or something like that -- somehow your baby's performance in this maneuver will indicate to you if he might have autism.  I immediately pick up the Rooster, and my heart starts to pick up its pace. The question has arrived, and we are tilting. The doctor in TV Land indicates babies will clearly do X or do Y in response, but not my baby. My baby seems to do kind of an XYZ thing. Inconclusive, if you even believe the validity of such a test, which I find dubious. I hear the question spoken inside my head: What if? And I think to myself this premature, uninformed, knee jerk thought: \"Nothing could be worse than autism.\" And next I think, \"I couldn't survive if my baby had autism.\" I have no reason to believe my child has autism, and for a moment I am caught shocked by the knowledge that I have neglected to worry about this ism, and in my neglect I have surely jinxed us into increased vulnerability. To make up for lost time, I begin to apply myself to worry about autism, which I know precious little about, in the hopes that worrying about it will serve as protection. I assume having an autistic child means never hearing your child tell you, \"I love you,\" and I imagine that this is the worst thing that can happen to anyone in the whole wide world. As I listen to the morning show segment, hearing the word \"autism\" over and over again, I picture stereotypes of hopelessness and isolation. I make my boy cry as I keep trying to tilt him, and each time the outcome is inconclusive.  In another couple years, while we muddle through more inconclusive times, when we are asking ourselves these questions again, I will begin my education about autism and children with special needs. I will have as much to unlearn as to learn, and that is saying something.  I'm not a perfect student, and I am still forever asking my husband: Will he be okay? And my husband is forever answering me: He already is okay.  I read at Hopeful Parents today an interesting essay that said that kids with autism are not less -- in fact, they are more. Then have much to teach us. Not everything in the essay resonated for me, but that part sure did.  I've had a little holiday time off, and so I loaded the Kindle software on my phone and read \"What I Thought I Knew,\" a memoir of a special needs mom's unique journey to special needs motherhood. I highly recommend this fascinating story of a divorced woman who discovered in a very unorthodox way that she was already sixth months pregnant, and that her child is likely to have special needs. She is not sure she wants to have or to keep this baby, a baby she did not plan for, a baby for which she is unprepared, a baby likely to have many challenges. She punctuates her tale with lists of things she thought she knew along the way, and then goes on to show you how wrong she turned out to be.  Earlier this month, I woke up with a strong urge to know how those of you who read this blog would complete the sentence, \"I thought autism...\" I wasn't sure why I wanted to know, and I hadn't yet read the memoir, or even heard of it. Those of you who commented really described similar suppositions to the ones I held. You said things like, \" I thought autism was kids who couldn't talk and who just rocked back and forth,\" and, \" I thought autism c ould only mean 'unreachable'. \" In that vein, here are things I thought I knew, in my own journey as a special needs mama.  I thought I knew what autism looked like.  I thought I knew that having a child with autism would break me.  I thought I knew what happiness looked like.  I thought I knew how to make sure I raised a happy child.  I thought I knew how to prevent bad things from happening by worrying about them.  I thought I knew everything I needed to know about hard work, and that I would always enjoy working hard at any challenge Here is what I know today:  I have a child with autism. He tells me he loves me in so many ways, not just with words alone. He is not broken, nor are my friends' children who cannot say the words out loud. I am not broken, either. We are only as isolated as we choose to be.  Happiness looks different than it used to, and I get my share. I cannot GIVE my children happiness, but I hope I am helping them find, create, and embrace it.  Worry is just a black hole where time gets lost. It tugs at me all the time, but I fight to keep it from sucking me completely inside its vortex.  Sometimes life is hard. It is a work in progress. It is at the mercy of time.   Life changes, and life changes us. Much of what I believe I know at any moment in time will require some serious unlearning and relearning later.  What about you. What do you know? Is it what you thought you knew?  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/12/i-thought_29.html", "title": "\nI Thought...\n"},

I've never big a  drivethru  kinda chick. Just that word, \"fast\" seems so delicious sometimes. I miss fast. Everything about our eating at  Casa   del  Rooster seems slow since we went  GFCF , and not just slow, but tedious, dull, and  unfulfilling . If it can't be tastier, I wish it could at least be quicker and painless. I am glad we went  GFCF , because I know when my son is on the diet, he has fewer complaints of stomach pain, more comfortable digestion, and, according to our documentation, better focus and behavior. But I am not good at  GFCF , because I am not a natural cook, and the half dozen things I learned to cook well before we had kids don't translate into things my boy can eat, so my grocery budget has quadrupled as I try to make up for my lacking skills by buying from  Applegate  Farms, So Delicious, Energy, Amy's, Ian's, Pamela's, etc. At my house we now eat separate, kind of pathetic, uninspired meals. Oh, most of us eat quite healthy food, and I feel a surge of joy when I give my kids nutritious meals that they enjoy. But it takes about forever. It takes four grocery stores, orders from Amazon, 25 mile drives to a specialty bakery, time spent scouring  gfcf  blogs, sneaking off if the rest of us want to enjoy some delicious gluten the boy will covet... food has lost its joy in a lot of ways, and at  Hanukah  and Christmas, I find myself a little bummed about it. Yeah, all you great cooks out there? Especially you soulful food writers at (Never) Too Many Cooks? You put me to shame. I want to be more like you, but it ain't going to happen. I love to read about your delicious creations, but as a voyeur. My chef's hat is off to you, and I sincerely hope your families appreciate you. Feeling a little homesick as the holidays approach and my East Coast relatives hunker down to watch the snow fall, I especially long for the comfort foods of my upbringing. They will not by on our table this year. But I wanted to share them with you, and maybe they will inspire you. Don't worry about how they sound, trust me about how they taste. They are perfectly satisfying, and they taste like love. Make them if you get the chance. Would I lead you astray? No, I can assure you I would not. \"Candied Sweet Potatoes\" (No, you have never had anything like this, I promise - recipe from faulty memory, handed down through generations, and my family doesn't measure) Bake several big fat sweet potatoes on cookie sheets lined with foil until the smell fills your house and you can hardly stand it you're so hungry, then hull them out of their scalding skins into a bowl of butter, and lots of it. (I have a special pair of potholders for this very purpose, used only in November and December each year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.) Stir in 1 or 2 jars of Marshmallow Whip (those wonderful glass jars filled to their blue lids with  jetpuffed   marshmallowy  goodness and heart clogging corn syrup). Add a few dashes of vanilla and plenty of brown sugar. Fold in coconut. Yes, just what I said, you can thank me later. Grease a baking dish (I use 11x17), and spread your heavy sweet potato mash into the dish. Heavily sprinkle brown sugar all over the top, and then another sweet sprinkle of coconut. Bake it again. Share with people who will go back for fifths, sixths, and blame you for it a week later when they cannot zip their pants. You will still be smiling. Blueberry Cream Pie Preheat to 400 Mix together about a cup of sour cream (lite is fine), a couple tablespoons of flour, about a cup of sugar, and a beaten egg. Fold in blueberries (pint to pint and a half) Pour into a pie crust (I like graham cracker best) Bake 25 minutes, while making topping topping: 3 TB flour, 2 TB butter, 1/4 cup chopped pecans Sprinkle topping on pie and bake 10 more minutes Chill - should be eaten COLD. I have  TMJ , and when my grandma made this pie for me, it always caused me to smile too wide, so that when I chewed and smiled like that, my jaw ached. What a fool I looked like, grinning  ridiculously , stuffing my face, holding my jaw, eyes watering in pain and  ecstasy ! Holy cow how I miss that. Ho ho ho!

{"date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2009", "body": "\nToday was our first parent teacher conference since the Rooster started kindergarten, and I'm determined to make some lemonade. Lemons: The  Roo  is not making any measurable progress in math. We understand that he struggles visually (poor kid likely had double vision until he was 3 and had eye surgery) and spatially, and that math uses the same part of your brain that relies on those visual/spatial skills. We also know that the lemon doesn't far fall from the tree, because  Roo's  parents are writers for many reasons, including math avoidance. On the other hand, we also know that, for all his pragmatic and conversational challenges and his mitigated  echolalia , our boy does have a lot of verbal skills. He has a gargantuan vocabulary, was born with a book in his hands, and his  ADHD  virtually vanishes for as long as you sit down and read to him. Therefore... Lemonade Recipe: We are going to squeeze math into every activity we can for the foreseeable future. But we're going to do it with a spoon full of sugar. Nope, we are not signing up for  Kumon  or tutors, we aren't buying flash cards or drill and kill software. I'm going to approach it from the Rooster's strengths and interests. Today I picked 10 library books about numbers. To  Roo , who already spied them and insisted I start reading, they are books about bus rides and chicken pox, but they also have counting, evens and odds, and problem solving in their  story lines . On the car ride home today when the kids wanted me to sing Jingle Bells again, I got them interested in the inchworm song instead. (Two and two are four, four and four are eight...) Our beloved ABA helper,  JT , is in on it, so when he used  Roo's  token economy system tonight, he said things like, \"It you already have two tokens, but you need 3 to get TV time, how many more tokens do you need?\" I have buckets of ideas about creating math based audio stories, and some web 2.0 tools that might help me craft my own games and stories... Like most mamas presented with a challenge facing their offspring, I'm ready to leap into action, perhaps starting off with more ideas than useful, perhaps a little more  gung-ho  than necessary. But here are some of the sweetest things about the lemons on our plates right now: 1. My boy's teacher sees his biggest problem as MATH. Huh. I'm too terrified of the deities these days to tell you what I expected her to say about his many issues, but I will say this: I will gladly take MATH being his biggest challenge, if you catch my drift. 2. Literally within two minutes of wondering what math tools might best serve my son, I happened to glance at Google Reader to see that  This Mom  had written about the curriculum that works for her son. Stuff like that? Wow how it makes me want to drink a toast to the  This Mom , the Internet, the  blogosphere , and my special needs community. It didn't matter so much whether or not that math curriculum would be the right one for us, it mattered that I had a  cyber  friend to turn to, and a seed of an idea where to begin my search. 3. You know what? Who needs a third. Those two are sweet enough. I have some other numbers I need to go work on right now, to make lemonade for the Rooster.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/", "http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/12/lemon-aid.html", "title": "\nLemon Aid\n"},

And I'd be grateful for them, to them, regardless, but let me tell you, being a special needs mama makes me really HUGELY appreciative to have the kind of in-laws I have. First and foremost, they love us all. They listen. They HELP. They encourage and support. They lend a hand, they babysit, they invite us over, they serve  GFCF  food. Want to know what they do NOT do? They do not judge, criticize, blame, or hurt. Wow, I am just  as  grateful for all of that as I am for what they do. We spent Thanksgiving with J's parents, and I had a serious cough, laying me kind of low. They made me feel better, in more ways than I can tell you. And now, guess what? J has arranged our gift to each other, and between Christmas and New Year's we're spending a night or two in a hotel near his folks' home, while they watch our kids. Of course, it's my in-laws who are really giving us this amazing and generous gift, because no fortune in the world could make it possible without them, and it's a gift no one else in the whole world could give. There is no one else who has ever, let alone who could, who would, who we would want to, keep my two beautiful, darling, sweet, funny, smart, unique, quarrelsome, impulsive, high-energy, demanding, emotional, needy, diet-restricted, Good-Night wearing, sleep disturbed, early rising, rambunctious children. Heck, half the time I don't feel qualified to watch them myself. Of course, I must not look too forward to the holidays, because that is something those pesky deities frown upon mightily, but no matter what happens, I know that my husband's parents are two of the best gifts he ever gave me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/12/ho-ho-ho.html", "title": "\nHo Ho Ho\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 24, 2009", "body": "\nOooooh, please, please, please, if I accidentally fail to mention you here, KNOW that I grateful for you. I read your blog. I value your comments. I feel your support. I just NEVER EVER SLEEP so I mess up sometimes due to the cognitive toll of CONSTANT wakefulness. But I appreciate you! Just for being here. And some of the people I appreciate I realize don\u2019t even even have ANY IDEA who I am\u2026and I\u2019m totally cool with that... This Thanskgiving I feel the need to say how thankful I am for the blogosphere. I need to say that I am grateful for so much, but on the long list are: Christine reconnects me to the place in geography where I was the happiest. Not only does she live in one of my former hometowns, her blog feels like a home, too. She has the kind of life, of demeanor, that I had envisioned for my own self when I was growing up. I didn\u2019t turn out nearly as patient, reasonable, or domestic as I expected, but maybe there is hope for me yet, as I learn from Christine, or maybe she can at least help me learn to forgive myself for my shortcomings. In some ways, Christine is like my invisible friend. I mean, she is a very real, very bloggy friend, with whom I can email or Facebook. But sometimes it is Christine I talk to in my mind as I drive home from a long day, or whose advice I seek in my mind when I\u2019m trying not to choke my children. I have never heard her voice, but imagined it many times, reading her blog posts over and over. She has written words that felt like gifts to me. Her blog is very lovely, and though our contact is largely indirect, I am thankful for Christine. Beth inspires me to what bravery I can muster, because she exemplifies bravery, especially in dealing with things medical. One of the bravest things I\u2019ve admired about Beth is her ability to listen to her own intuition. She learns all she can from doctors, her amazing husband, reading, and her gut, and sometimes her gut has the wisest information of all. That is why her boy has beaten so many odds and defied obstacles to thrive so beautifully in her care. Her blog shows so much wisdom and balance, and I read every single word of every post with gratitude. Plus, Beth handles sleeplessness so much better than I do, and keeps her sense of humor about it, making her a hero for whom I am very grateful. Mama Mara blows my mind. She flaunts brazen humor about some of the dark things many of us shy away from, and she does it with fierce creativity. Mama Mara shows me that we can all do things that we don\u2019t think we can, and she helps me remember that no matter how big a turd life throws in your face, there is a good book that will help you figure out how to flush it down. Plus, her potty mouth makes me look virtuous by comparison, and I like that. Rarely do I (a sailor-talker in the f2f world) look virtuous. I admire MM because she refuses to let a bad man equal a bad life, and that gets a big A-Men from me, and because she fiercely loves her sons just like I love mine.  I appreciate her candor. Vicki took what life handed her and refused to break no matter what. She writes it like she lives it \u2013 honestly, openly, with passion and poetry. Vicki lives a lovely life. She helps me realize I do too. I appreciate Vicki\u2019s effort, her example, her wisdom. Drama Mama cheers for us all. She reminds many of us that we stand where once she stood, and we will make it to the other side like she did if we just. Keep. Trying. Plus, Drama Mama speaks to my inner Fancy Nancy. Mostly I\u2019m a tomboy type who slouches around with my fists tucked in my jean pockets, but sometimes I read Drama and realize it\u2019s time to get my eyebrows waxed and live a little. I appreciate her flair! Her style! And I just flippin\u2019 worship her kids. Redheaded Mama is an artist. I mean, yeah, there\u2019s her design work, but she\u2019s an artist through and through. And she\u2019s generous. If she has a resource, then so do you. She practically wrote us a minute-by-minute guide to Disneyland for spectrum kids. And then when she and her daughter came to Disney, guess who else they visited? ME! Getting to meet her in person was so satisfying, so real, so blog-comes-to-life. I appreciate Red\u2019s beauty. MOM-NOS is kind of an idol, isn\u2019t she? She\u2019s like the beloved celebrity that every fan thinks they have a personal connection to unlike anyone else\u2019s. I know I am not the only one to say this, but MOM-NOS\u2019s blog was one of the first I read, and the one I clung to, the one that made me sure, the one that made me sad, the one that gave me hope, the one that made me feel I finally found someone who understand. She welcomed me to the fold. She works at a college, and for some reason that always gives me this feeling that MOM-NOS is my RA, because she has so much sage knowledge from having already learned lessons I\u2019m still learning. And? Wow can she write. Sometimes spare, sometimes lyrical, always on message, always exemplary. I am so thankful for MOM-NOS\u2019s wisdom and generosity. Jess is the powerhouse. I used to have Jess\u2019 energy. I think I was twenty at the time. Jess is a hard working career woman who is equally as hard working at being a mom, and yet as hard as she works, as driven as she is, she is also always ready to emote. I deeply appreciate the sincere emotions she shares, the way she owns her vulnerability. I am always grateful for how prolific Jess is, that she is so often just there, writing, facing what needs to be done, admitting how hard it is, and embracing all of us going through similar trials. P is a blog reader of mine because she loves me since way back when, and knows I love her too. P accepts the crazy family I\u2019m raising now with the same kindness, affection, and simplicity with which she accepted the crazy family that raised me. P supports without judgment, and loves without condition, from thousand of miles away, and I appreciate P for being my steadfast, solid, sister-like friend, and for making me a quilt that makes me happy and gives me comfort every single time I look at it. PixieMama lives 100 miles an hour much the same way that I do. Pixie and I, we have lots in common for women 3,000 miles apart of different ages and different religions and with very different lives. We can talk, and we do. Pixie Mama came to visit, and proved we can have visitors in our house. Pixie teaches me not to apologize so much. I am grateful to Pixie for liking me, and my family, in spite our ways. I am also grateful that she gave me my mantra, \u201cBe OK\u201d and my nickname, SkyBluPink. JoeyMom never says she is tired. She makes me want to say it less, even! I find this very admirable. She has two delightfully squishable boys, and I get the feeling that, between teaching and raising them, she might just be a teensy bit, well, fatigued. But she keeps things positive, and embraces opportunities to have fun with her guys every chance she gets. She has some creative ways to channel her boys\u2019 energy, too, and when I run out of ideas at my house, I think, what would JoeyMom do? I appreciate her for many things, especially for inspiring me. I found Gretchen, and MOM-NOS during my first foray into special needs blogging, and I remember thinking, \u201cYes, my son must have autism\u201d at the same time I thought, \u201cThis beautiful mom knows what she is doing, and I like her. Maybe I can cling to her. Maybe she will guide me out of my fear and into some light where I can make a plan and find my way.\u201d Yes, thank you Gretchen. And thanks for making me laugh. I love how you write. I love the quotes on your blog; it\u2019s funny, I think YOU are one of those moms who can do everything! I am so glad for all that you share. Betty and Boo\u2019s mom writes about spectrum stuff, AND she writes about what was my PASSION before I ever had kids or knew much about autism and Aspies: BOOKS! I really appreciate how she pursues that passion, and I live a bit vicariously through her in that department. PBear leaves me incredibly supportive and useful comments, not just in my blog but by email, from a mom who has been there and gets it. She somehow manages to work, go to school, raise two kids, and send me encouragement. That\u2019s amazing, and I\u2019m grateful. My dear old friend C reads my blog even though she has heard it all by talking to me on the phone, and then she sends me encouraging messages AND tells me she likes my writing. I\u2019d be lost without C. That goes for E and D too \u2013 dear old friends who stick by me come what may. Kristen has a blog I enjoy reading not just because of what we have in common, but because of her writerly life. I appreciate how she opens up about her writing, and I enjoy reading about her process. I sometimes imagine scenarios in which we meet, hand out, write\u2026 J is a colleague, a friend, who reads my blog and then sends me resources. WOW, everyone needs a friend like that. I am so grateful for the articles, the links, the suggestions, the ideas\u2026 not just about autism, but about EVERYTHING. I appreciate J for being a wealth of knowledge. Know why I like Good Fountain? It\u2019s probably the same reason anyone likes her. Am I wrong, or does she just seems, well, GOOD. I like what she says! I like how she says it! She has good, simple, kind ways about her. I loved it when she said that some of what she likes best about her daughter is what makes her quirky. I sometimes feel that way about my son. And one post she wrote really stuck with me. She said that what we all need to feel good about ourselves is connection with at least one person, and that she hopes her kids have that. Yes, it\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s true\u2026 for our kids, for us, one good friend is what it takes. I wish our kids could play together. JHV and I were f2f friends about a hundred million years ago, but geography and time don\u2019t end friendships with someone you value. I adore JHV, and what I appreciate most? That someone as smart, artistic, spiritual, and busy as she is\u2026 she still likes me! I think I\u2019m surprised by it. I miss JHV. I am so thankful she sent her sister to my blog, and Jen of I\u2019m Going Coconuts. I am so grateful she reached out when my boy was diagnosed, had her friends care about me, send their thoughts of love and their generosity to me. I am thankful for JHV\u2019s friendship and love and hope and goodness. I think of her every single day when I see my very favorite photographs. Jordan probably doesn\u2019t know what a fan I am, because without meaning I tend to lurk over at her blog. I guess I never feel like I have anything to offer, but I value what she has to say. And I can so vividly picture her two sweet sons I\u2019ve never met. I found Jordan because everyone pointed me to her; they said she is a smart mama, and an amazing resource, and they were right. Thanks for all you do for everyone with special needs kiddos, Jordan. There are tons of things to value about Kyra, but they all relate to her positive nature. Every time I read about the way she uses the Nurtured Heart approach, I admire her more. And another thing: Kyra points me to other blogs and resources that I treasure. GFCF Mommy helps me feed my son, and find joy in doing it creatively, nutritiously. I am so grateful for that. I know I\u2019ve never commented on her posts, but I am a loyal fan. Good Mum has made me laugh so hard before that I made embarrassing noises. That is worth its weight in gold! Jen, who says she\u2019s going Coconuts, is as solid as a rock, and has a big, beautiful, giving heart. I appreciate Jen. My inlaws read my blog, and I feel so fortunate that they take the time to do that, and that they forgive my wallowing. I tell them pretty much everything, and they still read it online again, and don\u2019t seem to get too sick of me. Listening is an act of love, and they are very loving. I appreciate my mom and dad. Gwyneth writes some heartfelt comments and sends encouragement all the way from Africa. Years ago, we hung out, went shopping, tried on clothes together, wished our wishes. Never in a jillion years did I picture where our roads would take us. But when she comments from Malawi, I feel like she\u2019s right here. And her blog, Misadventures in Malawi, is captivating, and I appreciate the way she shares her life with me, and lets me share mine with her.  ASDMommy writes so tenderly about parenting, I\u2019ve repeatedly had the urge to hug her, drop by with yummy food and hang out in her kitchen, and then I realize that if I bumped into her in the grocery store I wouldn\u2019t realize it. How is it that we have never really met? I\u2019ve invented her voice in my mind; it\u2019s a clear voice I appreciate every time I read her blog. I appreciate Hannah\u2019s mom, too\u2026 I read about Adopting Autism and find so much perspective within it\u2026 and that Hannah is a great character\u2026 And I could go on\u2026 but don\u2019t you want me to get a little tiny drop of sleep? I appreciate you, blogosphere. Love.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/11/bloggy-thanksgiving.html", "title": "\nBloggy Thanksgiving\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "body": "\nDear Kindergarten Parents, Have your children mentioned a curly haired blonde boy in their class who sometimes has quirky behavior? That would be our son, Rooster, and we want to let you know that, despite his quirks, Roo has more in common with his classmates than he has differences, but that his differences stem from autism.  Rooster does not know about this diagnosis yet, and we want him to hear about it from us, not through conversations with classmates.  For this reason, we ask that you please NOT mention his diagnosis to your children until we are ready to talk to him first. We are writing to you in the hope that you will understand our son a little better and feel inspired as we do to help our children become friends.  Autism gets a lot of attention in the news lately, but the media often doesn\u2019t provide a very clear explanation of what autism is, probably because autism isn\u2019t just one thing. Autism is called a \u201cspectrum\u201d because it includes many kinds of disorders.  Some people might think of the movie Rain Man, assuming any person with autism is shy, does certain odd things over and over again, and has a special kind of genius. Our son does not have that kind of autism. Rooster is a talkative little boy who is intelligent, affectionate, creative, and loves to make friends. Because he does have so much in common with typical kids, it\u2019s no surprise that people can feel confused by his behaviors and his language. That\u2019s why we thought it would be a good idea to write you this letter, and hopefully help you if your kids have questions.   What does autism mean for the Rooster? For one thing, he has some communication challenges. He has a huge vocabulary, but it\u2019s very hard for him to say what he means. The thoughts are there, but they often come out jumbled, and he gets frustrated sometimes trying to express himself. Sometimes that causes him to \u201ctalk nonsense,\u201d or to start a conversation in the middle without any context, or to quote something he memorized from a book or movie. He also has trouble making sense of what people say to him. He just can't listen as fast as most of your children talk, so he takes a while to answer questions, and sometimes he misunderstands what he hears.  It\u2019s like trying to read this letter if someone marked out every third or fourth word \u2013 it would be confusing and frustrating. When Rooster gets frustrated, his behavior isn't always ideal. For that reason, we work on language and behavior skills with a trained specialist after school for two hours every day, 10 hours a week. Our Roo has autism. It's just one more fact about him, like his brown eyes and his curls. We certainly don't want to ever use it as an excuse for him to be anything less than his best, and we expect him to learn how to adapt to the world around him, not the other way around. We also don\u2019t consider his diagnosis a secret or a cause for shame.  Rooster hasn\u2019t learned about the word \u201cautism\u201d yet because we don\u2019t feel that at age 5 he is ready to comprehend it or to put that word to good use. But we feel like if we help adults in his community understand it, they can help children be accepting of all children, tolerate all people\u2019s quirks, and be patient with our boy in particular. We know that he has a lot to offer friends, as well as a lot to learn from them. We are new to this school and we are eager to build a sense of community where our family can make friends, give back, learn and grow. We are always happy to answer any questions anyone in his community might have about autism, or, more importantly, about Rooster.  If you have the chance, we hope you'll introduce yourselves to us at school, or by email or phone. We are eager to know you, and to know your children, too. We hope for a happy and successful year for all of Mrs. Smith's* kindergarten class. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/11/word-to-wise.html", "title": "\nWord to the Wise\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 29, 2009", "body": "\nMy favorite joke these days is an old joke, a dark joke, a joke many of you will not find a bit funny. But it's a free country, and we're all entitled to our own sense of humor. Since I've worked hard on being thankful and positive for the last few weeks, I think I need a little outlet after five days home, if you know what I mean. So what is my favorite \"joke\" lately? Nothing. I mean that literally. It goes like this, with numerous variations on the theme... I take my kids somewhere, usually a place that is entirely for them and costs me a small fortune, and they fight, spit, scream, whine, cry and scream. On the way home I say, \"Know what I really enjoyed about that experience?\" Wait for it... \"Nothing.\" Yes, it's childish and petty and unnecessary, but  C'MON . Seriously. Must I implode? Today, for example, we drove an hour to try to have a family meal at a restaurant that was our last best chance at being Rooster (and Peaches) friendly. This place is ON THE BEACH. It has the word PARADISE in its name. You sit with your feet in the SAND. They have a  gfcf  fruit salad to kill for, chicken fingers that Peaches loves and rarely gets to have, and they bring you crayons and coloring pages. This should be Nirvana for both of my kids. But all the way there Rooster was upset because he wanted to be watching TV. Peaches was in a frenzy of \"mine.\" We got a table facing the freaking Pacific Ocean, the breeze blowing, pretty girls sunning themselves, no overstimulating noises, no crowds, no dramas anywhere but at our table. We had fast service, the works. But know what I enjoyed about my meal? You certainly do... NOTHING. I might have hit gratitude overload. I am so sorry about that. I know I should be grateful for the little bit of salad my children's fighting and SPITTING (GROSS) and fork throwing permitted me to shovel in, and I really and truly am glad I have food to eat and money to pay for my food, but I wanted to scream as badly as I've wanted to scream in a long time. So I come here. I scream into  blogland . I scream out my dark humor, and it makes room for me to find my sanity again. I enjoyed Thanksgiving. Best one we had in years. I am grateful for the reminder to be grateful, too. I am wholly aware life could be a lot worse, in myriad ways. One glance at the news is all it takes to remind me should I begin for forget even for a second. I think often of how much real suffering there is in the world, and I count my blessings, too. But you know what I'm liking about autism these days? What I'm liking about what autism means for our family life? NOTHING. Whewww .

I thought I'd look back at old posts from a year or more ago to try to appreciate how far we've come. (Can you tell I was needing a little pick me up? Sense any desperation much?) I even though, \"Hey! I know! I can even write to myself of a year ago, and that will make a really meaningful writing activity, a great blog post, a way of reflecting and a process of self discovery!\" (Stop retching, it's rude.) So, getting all excited, I tell my husband the idea, and, sitting next to him, I open up Rooster Calls and look up my blog from last October. J was reading it over my shoulder, noticing in synch with me what was painfully obvious and obviously painful:  What I wrote then  I might as well have written today! Yes, it's just one post, but a year ago? The Roo? Said the EXACT SAME THINGS about Halloween, and now we deal with the EXACT SAME struggles. Ah, so much for growth! So much for trying to be clever. Well, anyways, so much for Halloween. I'm going now to search for another post from about year ago that validates me in some way or other, or I'm going to the kitchen to main-line the gfcf Halloween treats I ordered online for sixty trillion dollars.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/10/bah-halloween-humbug.html", "title": "\nBah Halloween Humbug\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 18, 2009", "body": "\nI've been wanting to write about a new ism facet the  Roo  has been exhibiting lately, for lack of a more diplomatic way to say it, these last few weeks. I wanted to write about it because, frankly, the behavior drove me crazy, and I wanted someone to help me understand it, tell me if they've seen it in other kids, tell me how to make things more manageable. Well. Today I went for a jog. I might have gotten a bit too woo and metaphor-happy in the fresh air because I started to see things in a new light as I sweat through the issue. The problem confounding me has been how the  Roo  receives presents. It USED to be that if you calmly gave him just one surprise item of anything, including new underwear, he'd make big happy eyes at you and say, \"Wow! Cool!\" He was GOOD at \"Thank you.\" Of course, if you bombarded him, say at Christmas or  Hanukah  or his birthday, he'd tear through stuff like a tornado and get all moody and run around overstimulated. Lately, a new wrinkle: even if  Roo  begs and begs and begs for one item, or if you surprise him with one item, when he gets it, he goes all crestfallen and dramatic, and he tantrums. It could be something you already know he loves, something cool he's never seen, or the exact object of his desire, and it doesn't matter. Full on sobbing ensues within minutes of getting the gift, whether it is wrapped or not, whether it's presented matter-of- factly  or not. He always says you got him the wrong thing. He is always disappointed. It's happening often, at home and around others. So, I was starting to feel grumpy and bitter about this, all taken-for-granted style. Like I said, I was thinking how, well, annoying it was, and I was thinking pretty unhappily about autism. I wanted someone to justify my annoyed feelings and offer a remedy. Maybe part of me still feels a little like that, but I told you something all mushy came over me on my jog, so you know where I'm heading, and YOU know that I know that I might be stretching things, but at least it's working for me, this other perspective... Maybe when the  Roo  gets something, it isn't some hugely bizarre thing to feel disappointment, because don't we  NTs  do that on a different scale? Aren't I, his mom, the tree the apple fell from, constantly wailing that nothing is ever good enough? When I was a kid, growing up in Dysfunction Land, I believed if I ever escaped, I'd never ask for anything more of the universe, or God, or deities, or karma, or luck, or Fate, or fortune, or whatever. But getting out was far from an end to my tears and wishes. When I found myself in a bad relationship, I told anyone who'd listen that I wasn't looking for Mr. Perfect but just for a real and soulful partner with whom I could build my life -- a deal I forget all about when J's mountain of laundry I washed topples over before he puts it away and it takes him six weeks to rehang the toilet paper holder on the wall. Now when I beseech the universe to make my son have better behavior, I overlook that moment when I was pregnant but having some spotting early on and I  beseeched  the universe just to give me a healthy baby and then I'd never ask for anything, anything, anything, ever again. Sure, I'd still love to know if any of you have any insights or wisdom about how to help my boy feel better about receiving things. But right now, I'm feeling like the very best gift I can give the Rooster is more of my patience and tolerance while he works through his emotions. And clearly I ought to jog more often,  doncha  think?! :-)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/10/in-presence-of-presents.html", "title": "\nIn the Presence of Presents\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, October 15, 2009", "body": "\nThe first week or two of kindergarten, our son's teacher remarked with surprise that kids liked him. She said, \"He has friends! The kids I've had with autism usually didn't have any friends.\" That last sentence depressed the heck out of me, and while the preceding ones might sound like cause for happiness, I had been through this before. Our boy, cute and charming at his best, likes to start strong and then slowly burn his bridges. Can you smell the smoke?  Whoooohheeee . We thought the wildfires got out of control in these parts. So. Kindergarten. The school wants us to have a class talk about autism. They want to read the children a book about accepting the friend with autism. It's a great book, to be honest, and I like it a lot, but I'm so not ready. The question, of course, is whether our Rooster is ready. All I know is that things are not going so well. The little boy Rooster clicked with best the first weeks of school now says the  Roo  is mean, and that boy's parents agreed, vocally, on the yard before school one day in front of classmates and other parents. And today? Today was a jab to the heart. Today my husband was home sick, so he couldn't take  Roo  to school, meaning  Roo  had to come with me to drop his sister off first at his old school before I could take him. \"Mommy?\" he says to me when he realizes we're leaving her there and he now needs to go to his new school across the street. \"Mommy, I'm suffering.\" He has never used that word in front of me before, and when I ask him why he suffers, he says, \"I want to go to THIS school, not my new school.\" I tell him he graduated from his little sister's school by finishing preschool there (knowing he knows better, but it was the best I could do in the moment) and that his new kindergarten is the right place for him now that he is five. He stares at his feet and says, \"I'm ungrateful at my new school.\" Then, as I walk him to his line, the two children already in place there notice us coming and  visibly  slump. \"Oh, no,\" they lament, \"here he comes. I hope he doesn't push me today. Rooster, don't stand next to me, I don't like how you poke!\" Friends. We know that the Rooster wants friends, likes friends. He does not know how to try to have them, though. He hears these children speak to him and he thinks that they are attacking him; he doesn't recognize in any way his part in building their defensiveness toward him. And so when they greet him with suspicion and fatigue, his own defenses flare, and he starts off his day by yelling at them, making faces, living up to the worst of their expectations. The vicious cycle in every way. I asked him today, \"What does it feel like to have friends?\" He said, \"It feels loving.\" I said, \"Do you have friends at school?\" He answered no, because those kids are mean. They are not mean. Nor is my son. By the time I left him in line, I'd smoothed things over, for the moment, through intricate social  maneuvering , through distracting, deflecting, through humor. They are ALL good kids, cute kids, special kids. They are so LITTLE, yet suddenly they are also getting so big, too. We aren't ready to give our Rooster the word Autism yet. And so I'm not ready yet for the class to read the book about it yet either. Instead, I decided to write a letter to the parents. I've never tried to keep our diagnosis a secret from anyone, except I guess maybe in a way from the Rooster himself. I realize by telling the parents in the class makes me run the risk that the kids will use the word against him at some point, so maybe it's time to talk to him directly. J and I will be wrestling this for a while, I think, but we know that you can't  unring  a bell, and so we're proceeding with caution. Today J has been reading about the Circle of Friends approach, wondering if it works in kindergarten, and I've put in calls to our ABA team. We've started accumulating social stories, video resources, and joke books for  Roo  to give him a social \"in.\" I've reached out to the parents of the boy who thinks  Roo  is mean, inviting them to come pumpkin shopping this weekend, but the response I got did not inspire hope. I've been reading Theory of Mind articles, and I'm talking to my boy about his \"inner voice,\" and how to be a good friend. We're volunteering in every way we can at  Roo's  new school, and I'm a room parent. We're donating to fundraisers and selling wrapping paper and trying to build some community. In other words, we're desperately scrambling, we're running scared, we're pulling out all the stops. We're trying to win friends and influence people, with autism on board. This, my friends, is harder than potty training. And, like potty training, it's messy. And we are experiencing many unpleasant accidents. But we finally have the potty training thing mostly mastered, so maybe there is some hope for us yet.

{"date": "Friday, October 16, 2009", "body": "\nTomorrow, I have some SERIOUS catching up to do. No, not just the bills and housekeeping sort. In the last few years AD (you know, after diagnosis years), I have become shamefully accustomed to missing birthdays and anniversaries; something entirely unheard of in my  BD  life. I guiltily scramble to get in belated cards before it's too late for even those. However, much worse than that, I've even begun to miss marking the anniversary of the passing of those close to me, and the shame of that I need to begin to clean up first thing tomorrow. I've mentioned within my blog before that I became pregnant with the  Roo  at the same time that a friend, N, became pregnant. Our somewhat new but already special friendship grew deeper during our pregnancies, and I brought yet another friend into our mix who also was due at the same time. When we three had our babies within three weeks of one another, it was natural that we bonded even more and organized our first ever  play date  together. I still pull out a photo from time to time that shoes the three car seats lined up, the  newborns  so tiny and beautiful. We moms shared our experiences, took turns rocking babies, ate a little lunch, swapped stories, arranged our next get together that day. Less than six months after that photo, N's baby was gone. It's still so difficult for me to put that sentence into writing, to remember that  heart wrenching  time. I have never stopped thinking of baby Katie. Recently, just before the fifth anniversary of her passing, I was thinking about her even more than usual, thinking of her mother. And then, suddenly, it was just  after  the anniversary. How did that happen? I have no idea; each year, our other friend and I make sure to reach out to N and to express our love for her, for her daughter who is so missed. Before the anniversary, I'd been trying to decide how I wanted to make my remembrance of Katie this year, and I was contemplating signing up for an upcoming local SIDS charity walk. Poof, time warped, and it's weeks later. Tomorrow, I'm calling N. I'm going to figure out where to begin, somehow manage to convey how sorry I am for missing her birthday, for not reaching out to her on the anniversary of the worst loss imaginable, to tell her I love her, to ask about her beautiful boys and her loving husband and her work, to tell her I never forget. I hope she will understand. Knowing N, she will. I think she knows how much her friendship means to me, whether we are in contact or quiet for a spell. I think she knows that I not only mourned the passing of her daughter, and celebrated the life of her daughter, but hold fast to the lesson that life is short, and our children are precious. Katie was Rooster's first friend. I wanted them to grow up together. I never forget that I am lucky. Another friend of mine, at least I would like to call her that despite never having met her anywhere but on our blogs,  posted today about how important it is to tell people how much they matter to us while they are  here , and not wait until after they are gone. I think her wisdom and her thoughtful post helped me today, and will help me do my serious catching up tomorrow. In her post, Jess wrote something of an open letter filled with friendship. It inspired me to say this to you, reader: Many of you are people whose birthdays, losses, or other meaningful times I've not properly marked as I should these last couple of years (especially here lately), and, friends, I want you to know that I'm sorry. I want you to know that even when you don't hear from me, on time or at all, I'm thinking of you. I want you to know that my intentions are good, my love still fierce, and that I in no way mean to make excuses for my slacking. If I come across as self centered while I'm throwing my blogging pity parties, know that I'm not as entirely self-centered as I might sound, because I really do consciously try often to center myself around my love for you, friends, and for my family. Thank you for all of your support, your wisdom, your kindness, for inspiration and celebration and tips, for holding my mental hand, making me laugh, setting me straight. If I were you I'd be thoroughly fed up with hearing about my fatigue, but it does account for my inability to keep track of what day it is, and while that is not an excuse, it does come with a huge \"I'm sorry.\" Everyone who reads here regularly, I want you to know you are appreciated, you are special, you are in my thoughts. I celebrate your joy, empathize with your challenges, and am so sorry for you grief. And now that I've said all that to you here, I know I am ready to say something like it to N tomorrow. With her I have some serious catching up to do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jesswilson.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/10/catch.html", "title": "\nCatch\n"},

Well, as overly prone to apologies as I am known to be (just ask Pixie Mama, I am a broken record of \"sorry\"), I feel kind of justified in the tired department because, on top of working very hard at work and at home, we never seem to actually sleep or even really rest. But here is the thing. Every once in a great long while, we have a day that approaches the reasonable mark for work levels and endurability. Like today, for instance --- today felt kind of human, maybe just a tad like regular life. These rare days are something so coveted and treasured it terrifies me to speak of them. But. They are the days when the tired cranks up to its highest level, and I can barely stand. I don't mean this metaphorically. I know it doesn't make any sense, but I felt like someone glued me to my chair at the dinner table tonight, and this monsoon of physical fatigue bordering on collapse happens like this every time we have this (rare) tolerably fair kind of a day. So if this sounds just like my usual complaining, it isn't. It's me thinking about what it means. Why when things feel just a tick better do I feel ten times more tired? I think it's because I can. I think it's because I spend so many days holding my breath while weight lifting that when I finally exhale and release, my muscles know now they can go limp. So I'm not complaining about my tired tonight. It's a welcome kind of tired. Tonight instead of refusing to talk to his ABA therapist, Rooster called out to him, \"Excuse, me, JT. May you please sit down and have conversation?\" He felt extra motivated to earn his rewards -- 10 minutes of TV time and a walk through the neighborhood's spooky Halloween displays -- and he knows \"volleying\" is the only way to get them.  He answered questions about school (recess was the best part, because he liked playing with the toys), and he asked for clarification when he didn't understand (what does \"least favorite?\" mean -- oh, that would be his lunch that mommy made \"wrong\"). Tonight Rooster had all his homework done before I picked him up. (He has a new aide after school --- his third in a month.) Tonight the Rooster asked questions. He practiced tying his shoes. He ate a good dinner. I have yawned seven times writing this. My arms feel made of lead. My eyes are watering because they want to shut. I am going to sign off, log off, slack off, and go to sleep. It's 8:26. I'm spent. But that's cool, because I'm going to bed. Because I can. And that's what is really cool. Do you know what I mean? Do you ever feel like this?

We cheered like we were in Rio when the Olympic committee announced the location for 2012. 2. J came home a few minutes early tonight.

We have a new sub at school. Not just a sub, but a former teacher. We taught across the hall from one another for several years before she moved back East for about the last decade or so. And while I was teaching fifth grade, I taught her son. He was the first boy I ever knew with  Asperger's . In fact, before him, I'd never heard of it. I have thought of him, and his mom, many times in the last two years. And now his mom has come back to sub where I work. We had LOTS to talk about. It is great to catch up with K's mom and have someone who gets it back in the community. 4.  I have some exciting projects going on at work. 5. The Redskins won their last game. 6. I have 346 points in Scramble. 7. I tried really hard to make it to 10, but I'll settle for this. It's chilly here in Alaska and time for me to hunker down in my parka and conserve energy.

Perspective. Forever it seems like I'm learning new lessons about perspective. Apparently I'm a slow learner on this topic, but an avid and engaged one at least, fascinated by the topic. Most of you readers learn much faster than I do, and I turn to you for the lessons I crave, so perhaps you will find zero enlightenment here. But on the off chance I have something to share with you, I'm going to recount my most recent lessons learned on the other side of the whole mother-daughter thing. So I took Peaches with me back East. Last weekend, we celebrated my 20 th  high school reunion, the arrival of my dear old friend's baby boy Noah, and my mother's 65 th  birthday and upcoming retirement. For this trip, the mother in me planned, organized, arranged, packed, purchased, drove, flew, coordinated, carried, clean, cajoled, coerced, comforted, apologized, pleaded, interpreted, explained, commanded, reprimanded, disciplined, educated, entertained and medicated in order to schlep an allergic three year old on a trip that lasted 45 hours and covered 3,000 miles, 4 airplanes, two cars, several houses, and almost NO SLEEP. The trip? Well worth it to  me, full of meaning, and lots of fun. But I confess to you that a week later I am still very worn out, physically still limping along, yawning, yawning. You know I'm not stoic! I am not mother of the year. I complain. I find motherhood, and my two kids in particular, challenging. I sometimes feel like I'm shouting into a black hole. Now, how about the flip side? I flew the coop early from my mother's home, and headed West in 1993, fresh out of college. For 16 years, my mother has called me before my trips to visit her, reminding me what she wanted me to pack, cautioning me not to bring \"that ratty sweater I hate and those God awful shoes...\" Different sweater and shoes each time, but the same theme -- I am not the  fashionista  daughter my mother wanted. Each time I arrive, she reaches in her purse at some point, and pretends she is about to apply lipstick. Then, she looks at the tube, frowns, and says, \"Damn, I bought the wrong color. Oh well, you can have it -- it'll be great with your complexion!\" It is almost always Toast of New York. I always complain that I don't wear makeup, but then I put it on to please (or silence) her. She drives me to the hair salon, and though it is actually walking distance, she drives the long way so she can remind me again how much nicer I would look if I just cut it \"a few inches shorter this time.\" On this trip, things were different. I brought along with me the  fashionista  daughter my mother always wanted -- Peaches. She merrily acquiesced to giving countless fashion shows. She trilled in  ecstasy  at all the new clothes waiting for her. She twirled. She applied lip(chap)stick artfully, often. Yes, she told anyone, you can \"do\" my hair! No one offered me Toast of New York lipstick. And you know what happened, right? I missed it. I didn't feel jealous not even a drop. Oh, I  loved  seeing Peaches and Grandma in their element. I loved having the pressure off me to be someone I'm not. I loved wearing jeans and not feeling like the disappointment of the ages. No one  kvetched  about my hair. But I realized that I like my mother's attention, too. Oh, I still got attention. In lots of ways. It was GOOD for me to realized I missed the Toast of New York, that's what I'm saying. It was a both-sides-of-the-desk good epiphany. I needed it. At one point, I'm standing in the shower while Peaches plays with Grandma and Grandpa's dog, Grandpa watches a little of The Game, and Grandma fusses around the kitchen. I realize I forgot to borrow a razor (and I couldn't pack one since we only did carry-on). I know where one is, though; I know I can grab a towel, make a dash, get a razor. I also know that I can call out, \" Mommmmm ! MOM!\" If I do this, I will sound just like Rooster and Peaches so often do. I do not wish to sound like them. I do not like it when they do that. It makes me grumpy. I am standing there, staring at my hairy calves, 38 years old and NOT lazy (though very TIRED), and I am sure you know that of course I call out. My mom doesn't grumble and snarl, \"WHAT?!!!!! WHAT do you WANT?!\" She just brings me a razor. She might even be thinking (though I doubt it), \"Once a year, it's kinda nice to be shouted to for this or that when my kid comes to visit!\" No deep, surprising revelations here, but for a slow learner like me, the good lessons on the other side of the desk -- er, shower? -- include these: Things I do for my kids now that they seem to resent or find annoying will some day possibly be appreciated.  Things my kids do that annoy me now, I will probably some day miss.  Attention from your mother feels good. Everyone needs some.  The rituals and scripts of each family weave into our identities. They have layers of value and meaning.  Grandmas are wonderful. Oh, wait, I ALWAYS knew that last one, always hold it fast in my heart. I should close by saying that this, my first trip home since my grandma's funeral, made me miss her very, very, very much. It also made me feel her presence as well as her absence, because she is such an integral part of who I am. I think she was whispering the lessons of this trip in my ear. As much as Peaches is the  fashionista  daughter my mother never had, I was the school girl daughter for my grandma who took pride in the same bookishness that made my mom a little queasy. But my Grandma, too, loved fashion, and how dearly she would have treasured seeing Peaches strut around in her fancy skirts on this trip. Peaches has her twinkle.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/09/on-other-side.html", "title": "\nOn the Other Side\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 24, 2009", "body": "\nI appreciate our ABA person. He came into our lives, into our home, going on about a year ago now I think, though I can't really remember life before ABA. Having him here kind of reminds me of the brief period in which I had a personal trainer: I dreaded the arrival of my trainer, and deeply appreciated the experience afterward because I knew I could feel the benefits. However, when my trainer moved to Australia, I gave a huge sigh of relief. By contrast, I dread the end of ABA, and I know I'll hate so see  JT  go. Honestly, he feels a little like family now. JT  has pulled my kids in the wagon around the block with me so many times I finally started to realize the neighbors might suspect me of polygamy. He reads to both my kids, plays with them, has carried them out of my car when they were sleeping, has fed them, has given many high fives and knuckle bumps. He disciplines them. He is super nanny plus some. JT  has a son, too, about the age of Peaches. We talk about our kids. Tonight, Rooster had a pretty major meltdown when we got home and met  JT  for ABA. Rooster became aggressive and  JT  became all business, enforcing the rules just as I wanted him to, but it hurt to watch nonetheless.  JT  asked me, \"Are you okay?\" I assured him I was, but we have kind of a standard dialogue every so often in which I ask him for a pep talk, and so I said, \"Can you just humor me and give a 'Things will get better' talk?\" JT  always complies with this kind of ridiculous request while still walking the \"I make no promises\" line. He finesses it well usually. Tonight he said something like, \"Sure. Some things will definitely get better, because they get better as they grow. They mature, and they get more control of themselves. They  become more independent, and that will help. Other things will be difficult, sure, but some things will get better.\" I had managed through Rooster's screaming, his thrashing, his food throwing, his whole meltdown, and the aftermath of tears. I had managed while tending Peaches, unpacking lunch boxes, making dinner, repacking lunch boxes, cleaning smashed banana from the floor. But tonight sweet  JT's  well meaning speech did me in. Of course, it was the \"they.\" He said it at least a half dozen times, and with each one I felt like something bit me. For a few times I tried to tell myself he meant \"kids\" by \"they.\" But he didn't mean kids. He didn't mean his kid. His kid and my kid don't fit into the same pronoun. JT  loves my Rooster. I know he does. And Rooster has kind of a love/hate thing going on for  JT . It's all kind of familial. Except for the they. Hey, I know.

{"date": "Tuesday, September 8, 2009", "body": "\nOh, I guess in theory right now I should be packing things, all kinds of things, but I'm not. In theory Peaches and I head East in the wee hours before dawn on Thursday, and in theory J and I take Rooster to his first day of kindergarten tomorrow morning. You know how I roll, though, friends, and I showed myself to be a foolish gambler when mere hours ago I spoke with enthusiasm for the upcoming adventures, so now of course my little Peach has suddenly spiked a fever. I am, as rooster likes to script (from The Moffats audiobook), GOBSMACKED. I am not packing a suitcase. I am not writing notes to the kindergarten teacher and the AAA (aide). Can't. Stuck. Stymied. Like the word petrified, like something pulled from the La Brea tar pits. Vigilantly sitting up waiting to see if the newly tucked in girl coughs, cries. Steeling compulsive peeks at the clock until the next dose of Tylenol in two more hours. As usual, the only thing I am able to do when I'm in this state is this. Blogging. Here I Am and Here. I. Am. I have no idea how to wait patiently as time passes, I only know how to pace back and forth in writing. So, rather than dwell (on whether Peaches has the flu, if she got sick from eating food she'd dropped on the floor at a fast food restaurant on the way home from my inlaws, how we'll divide up her care and Rooster's first day at kindergarten and WORK, if we'll be able to travel, whether we should have gotten Roo the flu shot during our last visit to the doc when he was already under the weather, if I can even contemplate flying East alone or missing my reunion/mother's 65th birthday/dearest friend's new baby, why the deities screw around with me, and how dumb I was not to get the flight insurance for the first time ever), I blog. I blog. To distract myself, here is a bit of noteable and quotable for you: Me: Peaches, do you know who is my very favorite girl in the whole wide world? Peaches: Who? Me: (touching her with my index finger) You are. Peaches:  You know who is my favorite girl? Me: Who? Peaches: (touching me with her index finger)AMIE! Peaches: Even though I'm mean, do you still love me? Me (to Rooster): How much do I love you? Rooster: So much. Me: For how long? Rooster: Forever. Me: Who loves you more than I do? Rooster: Me! I love me more than you do! Me: NOBODY loves you MORE than I do, Roo. Rooster: That's right! Nobody! Okay, whew. That was good for me. I think now I'll pretend to try look like someone deeply contemplating packing up for a fresh start at a new school with new teachers, new shadows, and a roostery kindergarten boy, and for a remote hope for a trip East with a Peachy girl. But actually I'll probably see you here again in about five minutes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/09/packing-it-in.html", "title": "\nPacking it In\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2009", "body": "\nI'm NOT saying that I'm optimistic about kindergarten. THAT would be  foolhardy . I think the last time I was optimistic, Bill Clinton (and his wife) had this good idea about reforming health care... Today, my son's first day in kindergarten, his first day in public school, had plenty of challenges. Plenty more await us. ALL I am saying is that on this one day, I could see the good side of most of the bad sides. We started our day by parking FAR away from the Rooster's school, because the only close spaces were right by the school that he no longer can call his own, and while I'm glad he's moving on, for him it remains a bitter pill. Good side of the long schlep? We walked along the four blocks with many other families, and I felt a sense of belonging to the new community. We met people, we smiled, we hadn't yet burned bridges. When we got to the auditorium, we quickly found the class assignment list, and the  Roo  is not in the classroom I've heard so many great things about. At first, this bummed me out. The good side, though? Later, the teacher explained that they expect to shuffle kids around the first two weeks. At least five kids can expect to change rooms. Plus, while the teacher didn't overly impress, the aide assigned to Rooster went out of her way to welcome me and put me at ease. She knew his file, assured me she'd made herself well aware of his allergies, that she's done this all many times before. Parents spent the first hour or so of the day in the room getting the lay of the land. One little boy who seemed to be missing a parent cried heavy,  hiccuping  sobs in the corner while the teacher talked. Seeing that the teacher offered him little empathy, my  Roo  took it upon himself to approach the boy. I couldn't reach  Roo , or hear what he said, but when it had no consoling impact, he took things up a notch, and reached out and hugged the boy. Seeming to calm him a little,  Roo  finally went all out and planted a kiss on his cheek! The boy didn't like that, pulled away, and finally  Roo  had had enough. \"Fine, then,\" he loudly announced, \"but you are crying too loud and hurting my ears!\" This got the teacher's attention, and she asked, \"Whose child is this?\" She meant the sad boy, not the  Roo ; she wanted someone to take the boy and get him quiet, and that made me worry a little bit about her empathy level. The good news? Clearly, autism or no, empathy is not lacking in my little guy. We have to master appropriateness and mood regulation, but surely he's A-okay with empathy, at least some of the time. After school, I picked the boy up and helped transition him for the first time to after care. When I excitedly asked about his day, he described it as, \"Not too good.\" Why? He said, \"Today I felt dumb.\" Well, OUCH. That? That's bad. How can that have an upside? Because a year ago, and certainly before a year ago, I could not have imagined my son expressing his emotions to me in that articulate way. They might not be the emotions I hoped for, but I couldn't be more proud of his language. We will address the feeling dumb part for sure, now that we know about it. On the way to after care, which is run by the same people who ran his summer camp, we crossed paths with several children  Roo  recognized. A couple called out happily, \"It's ROOSTER! I missed you!\" One let  Roo  give her a big hug. He had nothing but smiles for the familiar kids and adults in after care, and he also has an aide there as well. In theory, I will be out of town for the next two days. I didn't mean the calendar to work out this way, and it's hard to miss his second and third days of school. The good side? Daddy will get a turn to get a feel for the new school, having missed the first day to take Peaches to a doctor's appointment. Yeah, I'm still PLENTY worried about kindergarten. But today is just the first day, so I'm pacing myself. And along the way, I'm smelling a few roses.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/09/smelling-roses.html", "title": "\nSmelling the Roses\n"},

For instance, I used to have these two close friends. The guy was my roommate when, straight out of college I did a fellowship at a magazine very much like a journalism version of the Real World, and four of us from around the country came together as strangers to become editors and roommates in California. The girl I met a year later, in Texas, after I'd edited a story about Teach for America and realized I wanted to change my life and join. She was my closest buddy at TFA boot camp. I told her, \"You'd be great with my old roommate.\" I called him and said, \"You'd be great with my new friend.\" But they lived in opposite parts of the country, then in different countries, and this went on in different permutations for years. Finally, I told them both via email, \"If you two ever meet, you will fall and love and get married, I can absolutely feel it. So, here are the email addresses. Meet.\" They have three kids now. Sure, they stopped talking to me as soon they fley into LA to meet up at my apartment for the first time, but at least they are happy.

{"date": "Monday, August 31, 2009", "body": "\nFor J's birthday, I took him to see Julie & Julia. We both enjoyed the escape, enjoyed the chance to sit and talk about something other than our children afterward. Except, of course, that we DID end up talking about our children anyway, because the film, like most things in our lives, made us think of them. Ain't it funny how all roads lead to Roosters and Peaches. If you haven't seen the movie, Julie becomes a blogger striving to work her way through Julia Child's cookbook in a year and write about her experiences through cooking. Her story weaves in and out of Julia's own, and as the tale wove together, I clearly shared things in common with each character. Julia and I both love food, talk loudly, and care about finishing what we start. Julie and I both blog, have unfinished novels, live urban lives situated to suit our husband's jobs, and fantasize about meeting the writers we admire. There are even more differences, of course, the biggest is this: neither of those women have children. For Julie, a contemporary character, still in her 30's in 2002, childbearing time remains, but Julia clearly struggled with deep sadness about never having given birth. You can see it when she can't take her eyes off the passing carriage, when she lovingly strokes her friend's toddler, when she berefly sobs, \"I'm so happy for her,\" upon finding out her sister is pregnant. As the credits rolled, and J and I lingered in the theater, I asked him, \"Could you imagine us if we'd not had kids?\" I knew he could, and yet it still surprised me to hear him say it. We've had this talk before; I'm slow to absorb things sometimes. I told him, \"As crazy as I get, as much as I can suck at parenting, I'm one hundred percent certain I'm one hundred percent glad we had our kids. I wouldn't have felt fulfilled without them, even though I get depressed sometimes now.\" J loves our children every single bit as much as I do, and he offers them more patience and better disposition. He wouldn't trade them. But, as he tells me, he could have been happy, he thinks, either way. He can imagine us visiting far away places, exploring hobbies, writing together. And yet he's happy, too, that we have children. Happy might exaggerate how I am, but for me, having children felt like answering a question asked deep within myself. I needed to experience my children,  to know them and to know me, to see my future unfold the way it felt it had been written to do. In the movie, I could not relate much to Julie's hunger for blog readership, her need for accolades, her external motivations, the pain she experienced when criticized or rejected via her blog. I blog because I feel like I have no choice, and I do it for myself alone. I need blogging. I also deeply needed my children.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 25, 2009", "body": "\nWhen I read a post by  Drama Mama  last night, it got me thinking, and it hasn't let my mind all through my busy back-to-school day. Drama Mama is among what I think of as my \"imaginary friends\" -- those  bloggers  I read and relate to with intensity enough that I feel like we are confidantes even though they may never have come across my blog or heard so much as a mention of my name. Without knowing it, Drama gives me hope, because she is where I want to be, a place I think of as \"the other side.\" (No, I'm not  referring  to that kind of afterlife, just to life after the hardest part of special needs parenting struggles.) Both Drama's daughters are strong and amazing, and with her they form a  triumvirate  that have proven they can tackle anything, isms or no. Now that Drama is feeling like Drama, she wants to reach out and lend a hand to friend who, like me, remains more in the thick of things, still struggling to cobble together the tools, resources, inspirations, motivations, educations, inner strength, mental fortitude, physical stamina, chutzpah, whatever it takes, to help her child. Drama Mama wants to help, but she isn't sure what to do. And that got me thinking. I almost posted a comment, but I had too much to say. So I thought about it all day. I thought about how badly I want to rally, I want to get myself together, to help my child, to get us to that happy place, to make it across to where Drama and her family stand, and then I, too, will find others in the place where I am now, and I will help them. How? What do they need? That is Drama's question. Since I am still pretty rooted, still where her friend seems to be, I can offer the following suggestions from my standpoint to Drama and anyone else wanting to lend a hand to someone who seems overwhelmed trying to help a child succeed. (And, NO, I am not hint dropping. I actually completely suck at accepting kindnesses, and I much prefer giving gifts to receiving them, so, please, no one indulge me in the following): * A Coupon Book: Know those cutesy ones you can give your sweetie that offer a back rub on demand or a romantic dinner for two? A friend who is overwhelmed would welcome coupons for a free pass for a late night call just to listen as she vents, or an hour watching her child while she either gets out of the house or soaks in the tub. * Humor: Send her one funny email every day for a week. Or better, love bomb her with two or three every day for a month. You can never laugh enough. * Inclusion: Figure out an event where you feel pretty certain your friend and her child can feel welcome and included, then invite her. It can be a special needs  meetup , a barbecue in your backyard, or a  drive-in  theatre -- whatever works for them that you suss out. She's probably struggling to find places like that, and more pressing matters probably are taking priority over having fun, so to be invited out to do something that's a good fit without having to do all the legwork is a huge gift. Just make sure you really do your homework first. * Remind her of what's working: I often forget when things stink just how much worse they were a while ago. Make a list of the successes your friend and her child have had over time and tell her how impressed you are with what they have accomplished. * Remind her that you have been there, too. Tell her about some of your darkest times from long ago and some of your brightest spots from the here and now. Let her know that you believe in her, and that you look forward to the day you can celebrate with her, when she and her family too join you \"on the other side.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://likeashark.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/08/pay-it-forward.html", "title": "\nPay it Forward\n"},

Please wave your hands as you read this to dispel the hovering motes wishing to whammy me when I say anything positive. (WAVE 'EM I SAID OR MOVE ON!) I went to a baby shower today. When I came home from my three hour absence, J asked for the highlights. I had only one: I felt like a person. (I went somewhere that interested me, on time, dressed in clean clothes, talked about current events, enjoyed myself, didn't rush, didn't keep my cell phone in my hand the whole time...) I don't regret for minute that I have this family that keeps me from attending most celebrations, but I realized today that I have missed those things in my life and that, surprisingly, I still remember how to have fun. Rooster finished up summer camp yesterday. When I picked him up, his shadow showed me the video she shot of him in the talent show; Rooster got on stage and introduced himself and said, \"I am going to perform the Stink Leg Dance!\" Yes. The Stinky Leg Dance. The shadow said, \"He's going to be okay! If you need me to babysit, give me a call.\" Children I hadn't met before came to hug the Rooster goodbye of their own accord. Two said, \"I'm going to miss you, Rooster.\" An old friend, someone I dated in college, got in touch on  Facebook  to  commiserate  about our posts about lack of sleep (his due to work, mine due to kids). He said, \"I still can't imagine you with kids!\" That surprised me. I hadn't told him much by way of details about our  roostery  family, but his comment kind of opened the door, and I hesitantly and nervously sent him to this blog. It was about 2 a.m. when he sent me a message of kindness and support to say that he enjoyed what he found here. Here is a huge small thing. I took my son to the dentist. And. He? He? He was a perfect angel. At the dentist. I ... well, I stammered my thanks like an inarticulate goofball as we made our way out. Sure, it's a  schmantzy  Beverly Hills pediatric dentist who specializes to some degree in special needs kiddos and costs more than your average dentist, but my kid, who usually can't tolerate even a haircut, who howls and flails and kicks his 100 pound speech teacher, my kid sat still, obeyed, and had HIS TEETH CLEANED like a PERFECT ANGEL. He made jokes. He watched a movie and opened wide through cleaning and polishing and flossing. I nearly sent gifts to my friend Rosalie who sent me there, the dentist, the secretary, even the valet who charged me seven outlandish bucks to park for half an hour. AND DID I MENTION WE WERE ONLY THERE HALF AN HOUR?! The dentist started on time, finished early, and, left me woozy with the magnitude of going to a medical appointment that was simply no big deal. That no big deal is pretty gigantic. And here is the biggest small thing of all. The other night, J and I were getting ready for bed. As usual, we tried to describe a bit about our days. I said, \"Our kids were good today.\" A sentence like that, at our house, warranted an eye lock. We know when we're having a mind meld. Both of us thought, \"Have we ever said that sentence before? Ever? No, not ever.\" Our kids are not bad children. I'm pretty fond of them to be honest! They have wonderful moments. They have beautiful hearts. But never have I been inclined to sum up a day by saying, in general, \"Our kids were good today.\" Still no sleep in this neck of the woods, my kids had naughty behavior for hours this afternoon, and the air is filthy with smoke and ash from nearby fires, so it's not the most fun weekend I ever had.

{"date": "Sunday, August 9, 2009", "body": "\nSo, I keep reading about how anger is about ego. It makes sense to me, and helps me think about how I want to be less angry. I want to let go of ego. I want to make peace. (Don't throw up. I mean it.) Today I was thinking about this while I jogged, while I watched two delicate hummingbirds off to my left dancing among flowers and honeysuckle on the bike path, and how can you not want to be less angry when you see something like that?  While you are smelling the honeysuckle and you have your headphones on and the breeze is blowing? Have you ever seen someone -- like an ABA  practitioner , for instance -- respond to attacks or annoyances by thanking the offender? I have seen this a few times, most recently when my son kept halfheartedly swatting at his ABA guy  JT , and each time  JT  said, \"Thanks! Are you trying to high five me? Thanks. Now let's read a book. Thanks, let's read...\" It didn't take long to work on the Rooster; he soon read the book and stopped his attention-getting negative behavior. I learned from that, and it stuck with me. I have realized, for one thing, that you can disarm an angry person by thanking them. For another, it doesn't do any good to get angry back sometimes. You, I mean I, need to take things less personally. Saying thanks helps with that. So while I might be notoriously pissed off at autism, I decided that I would like to let go of some of my anger, and that, since autism seems pretty pissed at me, too, I would like to actually thank autism for a few things.  Autism, in fact, has given me some gifts, and therefore I would like to thank autism for: - community. I really appreciate the friends near and far, both  huggable  and only in cyberspace, that I never would have had if not for the diagnosis. Even my husband, who mostly hears of many of my new friends secondhand, feels the blessings of the connections. - patience. Not that I have much, but I've learned how to find some when I really need it. I might have mentioned, but I used to have a magnet that said, \"Lord, give me patience. And hurry it up.\" I'm a little bit better since then. (Yes, I am.) Yeah, I still have a long way to go. - healthier eating. I am not a huge biomedical follower, but we do a little, and we believe that changing the  Roo's  diet helped him. As we did so, we certainly learned a great deal more about the value to all people of more organic foods, fewer preservatives, and conscious eating. Hey, Peaches still loves her some  pop tarts , but now they cost us a fortune at Whole Foods! And we actually feel a little better about it. I'm just saying. - jogging. For a long time, I HATED jogging. HATED it. But then, as things got worse and worse at my house, it seemed like the one thing I could justify escaping in the evenings to go do, while J watched the kids. Lately, I've escaped some miserable witching hour meltdowns to go \"work out\" for a half hour or so, and let me tell you, the things I used to hate about jogging are delightful to me now by comparison. Autism, you know how to help me burn the calories, bud; high five! ( Oooh , that's kind of ego related too, isn't it?) - help with Scramble. I keep finding the word \"casein\" and I never even knew that word before autism came along. I'm racking up the points! (I really will keep working on that ego thing. It's a marathon, not a sprint.) Hey, autism? Thanks. I still don't like you. I still think you suck. But, thanks.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/08/thanks-for-that.html", "title": "\nThanks for That\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 6, 2009", "body": "\nAt our house, we went for three and a half years without rest, without functional sleep. What I am able to recall of that painful time has a hazy grain shot through, and I know we lacked the necessary energy to enjoy the good moments the way we wanted. And we did have good moments; it was period in which I gave birth to both children, my brother-in-law married, we bought our first house... but we stumbled through much of it. My most vivid memory of the toll the sleeplessness took happened early on, before Peaches' birth, when the Rooster was less than a year old. I remember on a Saturday late morning, marching in to the bathroom where my husband stood shaving, bitterly bemoaning to him, as I held my arms in cradle shape and the Rooster cried, \"YOU said YOU would take a turn, honey, please! You said you would! I'm  soooooo  tired! It's your TURN!!! PLEASE!!\" My husband sat down the razor and touched my arms gently. \"Yes, honey,\" he said to me. \"Look at your arms. You are not holding the baby. It's my turn. See?\" He pointed to a bouncer on the floor, where Rooster wailed. \"You just need to find a quiet place and go to sleep now. I will try to rock him. It's my turn. I have him. You sleep.\"  Now that we get reasonable sleep at least a few nights a week (though never more than four, I'd estimate), in some ways things feel harder. Oh, certainly not overall! Certainly I feel lucid enough at all times to know whether or not I am holding a child now. But I've diminished my endurance. About a year and a half ago, a parent introduced us to the joys of melatonin for the Rooster (vile curses to the heartless pediatricians who silently sentenced us to sleep torture as if they'd never heard of melatonin themselves), and shortly after that we sleep trained Peaches. Still, obviously, neither of our kids will win any sleep trophies. About three nights a week, sometimes more, they have nightmares, or accidents, or illness, and the  Roo  is prone to waking up at three in a hyperactive frenzy. The sleep I do get in a seven or eight hour night reaches deeper levels, and to pry my eyes open at two or three or four feels more arduous, and rising to deal with situations sometimes feels impossible. Where I used to feel like I slept with one eye open, that I listened to and for my kids while I slept, ready to bound out of bed during the nursing ages especially, and while I went at least a decade of waking exactly a minute before my radio alarm turned on, now I feel like I am pulled from sleep like someone drowning pulled from the sea. I am tired. This is more than a statement, it's become my apologetic mantra. It's nearly my identity. I am very tired. So tired that last night my husband ended up sleeping with the Rooster. I woke up when our boy marched in full of rough and tumble in the wee hours, but I couldn't manage to raise up my head. The words I thought to say came out like grunts, and the next thing I knew, it was Peaches coming in, having managed to sleep until nearly dawn, wanting to know why she saw daddy in bed with her brother. I might get more sleep than I during our darkest time, but I'm losing my touch; the cumulative effect on me means that I am more exhausted than ever. I find myself thinking about sleep the way I used to think about boys in my teen years. I fantasize about sleep, I manipulate situations to try to get closer to sleep, I try to figure out the mysteries of sleep, here I am even  journalling  about sleep. One thing that I come back to again and again is the idea of sleeplessness impacting cognition. I lose my pens a hundred times of day now, sometimes when they are behind my ear, in my other hand. I forget names of people I've known for YEARS. I can't remember why I called you once you answer the phone. Should I really drive a car?! Probably not, but I have no choice. And what about medical schools?! It horrifies me now, absolutely horrifies me, to think of young, new doctors trying to save lives walking around sleep deprived. I don't know why, but this idea plagues me regularly. And  Gitmo ? Sleep torture? Yes, you bet, it's torture. So, how are you this morning? You might have to tell me twice. I'm tired.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/08/yawn.html", "title": "\nYawn...\n"},

Some of you, I know your answers. Some of you I've never even met, but I understand you from the beautiful way you communicate. There are those who I know would say that the worst days are scariest. You are right, of course. The worst days make you wonder what will happen if things don't get better, and what if the worst gets worse. That is scary on a practical level. There are also those who I am pretty sure would say that the best days are scariest. Right? Aren't there a few of you out there like me? Aren't there a few others who have many hard days in a row stacked up like Tiny Too Little trying to climb up high  enough  to kiss a giraffe, and then that one good day comes, that one day when you  reacquaint  yourself with that long lost vagrant called Ease, and it scares you nearly into losing your balance and toppling to the ground for fear -- for the certainty -- that it just will not last? I sucked the marrow of goodness that came to me today, wallowed in a  visit  with old Mr. Ease, and tried not to let the  fear  inter fere . But I would  be a liar trying to curry favor among the wiser among you if I didn't own up to the fear that did make its way in around the edges, in some of the quiet spaces while my family enjoyed itself today. I admit to you, humbly baring my raw painful truths, that watching my Rooster navigate better than usual at a family gathering, I: felt proud; worried about regression; spiralled through the fears of what role his medication plays, and what might happen now that his  blood work  ( Argh !) indicates we may have to change ( Aaahhhgggh ) medication ( eeeek );  berated myself for my own panic;  waved my arms in the air to chase away evil deities.  Yes, yes, I DO hear myself. Remember, I said it was a trick question -- one in which there are no right or wrong answers. The truth is, I worry all the time. I see what is wrong with the worry, but still I do it. I can't blame autism... I have worried since the dawn of time. I am working on it. As part of my own self-conducted (and free!) therapy, I read all of you. At least I have learned enough in the process to know the worry isn't really doing me any good, and to celebrate the good days the best I can. At least I have learned enough to know I needed to write this post. As weird as it sounds, I needed to confess: I (we) had a good day.

You just want them to be perfect, that's the problem.\" Another sends me articles about the dangers of the GFCF diet, especially when blindly adopted by desperate and ignorant parents. Others repeatedly invite us to do things with them that we've said (over and over and over) we can't do because there are too many challenges for it to be worthwhile to us. For instance, we don't indulge in weeknight outings, because we have therapies every night when we get home from work and school, and then there is the gfcf food situation to navigate, and medicines, and then there are the behaviors to contend with... so, still, no. And then there are a few people who keep wondering in feigned shock why we don't just \"get a babysitter?\" Sometimes I feel like I run out of words, or I can't find my tact, and so I say nothing. Other times I think I step in it. I end up having to apologize, or worrying I should have. Mostly I can't figure out what I'm expected to say, or what I could say that would suffice. On the flip side, I have to recognize that the people saying these things to us probably don't always know what to say, either. Many are like we were before the Rooster came along -- largely uninformed about autism. And our boy doesn't fit the image most people have -- or that we had -- of autism. Of course, I totally understand that. I get where they come from, even though it results in some uncomfortable communication sometimes. While I still don't know what to say to some of the people I'm describing, and I don't expect them to know what to say to us, I do know what I would suggest to people  if they wanted to know what to say to us .

And if you can't make it, just know we have been thinking about you and we hope to see you soon.  - Are there any things we could do to make it easier to include you in our (blankety blankety blank)? - I'm interested in the gfcf diet. What can you tell me about it? How did you decide to try it? - You let us know when there is a good opportunity to get together, and how we can help make it work out, because we'd love to see you. - Your kids are doing great. I know that means you have been working hard. - I don't see what you see, but I think you are probably the expert on your own child. - I don't see your child the same way you do, but that's natural since I spend so much less time with him/her. - I know you've been through a lot, but you should be proud of the work your family is doing. - What can I do to help? If nothing else, I could listen. Now, anyone have some ideas of what I ought to be saying?

{"date": "Wednesday, July 29, 2009", "body": "\nA few months into Applied Behavioral Analysis, it's time to reflect on what we've learned from having in-home therapists 10 hours a week, besides humility, and how to hide the dirty laundry.  Before ABA, the rooster still needed diapers, though he could only fit his 50 pound body into  Goodnights , and could be coerced into using a toilet once or twice a day, maybe. Now, he looks cute in his  cammo  underpants, and has accidents three or four times a week, maybe, usually as he's running in vain to make it to the potty on time. Before ABA, any time you said \"no\" to the  roo , he would lose his mind. And this means  any time , including when he asked, \"Can I sit on your lap while you drive the car? Can I drive it myself? I NEED TO DRIVE!\" Now, you can say no to  roo , as long as you don't bark it at him in an angry voice (who, me?), and after you gently deliver the refusal, he will often say, \" Awwwww . Okay, mom,\" in a \" shhheeeesssh , what am I gonna do with you?\" tone, and then comply, move on to the next thing, play. And this means sometimes he accepts no for an answer even when his question is, \"Can I have a turn now?\" (Thanks, ABA, for his ability to  ask  that question.) Before ABA, our rooster considered everything in his home his personal jungle gym, and he made no exception for the bodies of visitors. Now, he still stands on my couch, but he takes his shoes off first, and for everyone NOT blood related, he has started observing \"personal space rules.\" Before ABA, the word Rooster used with greatest frequency was \" AAAAAaaah .\" Now, the words he uses most are, \"May I...\" Kid has a LONG daily wish list, but I'm just thrilled he's ASKING (to wear my jewelry, eat my dinner as well as his own, watch Star Wars, buy a new toy, make out a fort out of my pillows, knock down the tower I just built, use my cell phone... it's a good thing he has adjusted better to the word \"no\")! I would say ABA has done more for his speech and language development than three speech therapists combined. Before ABA, attending a party with  Roo  meant having a battle plan, including an intricate exit strategy, and doing lots of apologizing. Lots. Last weekend, J took the  Roo  to a birthday party while I took Peaches out for lunch. J had the easier time, and he had fun. \"I pretty much just let him play, and I mostly talked to other parents,\" he told me, while I gaped, feeling kind of jealous and awestruck. This was a major first, and I know the deities have horrible plans for us next weekend when attend my  niece's  first birthday for telling you this, but, Wow. When he told me this, I knew it was time to give mad props to ABA. Maybe the biggest endorsement I can give ABA is this: before ABA, I had no toolkit, and I ran out of patience all the time. Now, I have a toolkit, and I only run out of patience 60 percent of the time! And technically I'm not really  eligible  for services, so don't let on to the (bankrupt) state of California... In no way do I have any expertise about therapies, beyond being a mom and a teacher, nor do I know what is right for anyone  else's  child who has autism. From what I read, there are all kinds of effective ways to help kids, and I certainly understand why ABA isn't right for everyone. I just wanted to take a moment and appreciate all the resources out there who helped point our family toward ABA, because we see the benefits.

Today, at school, where I work, I am asked, fatefully, \"How's it going for Rooster at camp?\" Makes you want to smack me, doesn't it, knowing how I stacked the deck against us all? Ah, so. \"You know,\" I said, \"not since he was an infant have I ever been able to pick him up day after day and everything is just fine. The teachers always say, 'He had a good day.' He has friends and he's having fun. I'm enjoying the reprieve.\" Cut to: I walk into camp, and the shadow is ready for me, and I know that look even though it's the first time I've seen it from her. \"Today he had a tough day. Lots of tantrums. LOTS of them, just finished throwing a fit when he saw you pull up. Fighting with Amy. And he kicked me. Twice.\" As goes Rooster's day, so goes it for us all, I guess. I had a tough one myself. And I'm facing a quandary. I have lost my mind completely and somehow agreed to attend my twentieth high school reunion in September, because two of my dearest friends will be there, one with her new baby I haven't kissed and squeezed yet, AND the reunion falls near my mom's big milestone birthday, and what she really wants is to see me. What she wants even more is to see a grandchild. Well, she WANTS to see kids, but if she's lucky she will get to settle for one. I can manage to fly with one child, and, at that, I'd rather fly with snakes on a plane. I cannot (worth repeating CANNOT) fly alone cross country with both my snakes, er, children. It is not even fathomable without J, barely fathomable with him. But which one should I take? Last time I went East about a year ago I took Peaches. And she? Was. Awful. She went 36 hours without sleeping more than a catnap, never slept through any of the three nights we spent, startling every time she lost skin contact with me. I felt as if she would be my undoing, and with everything else going on, I was nearly undone for sure. When the second leg of our eternal trip back to Cali was delayed for hours, I sunk into the airport carpet and left a tiny piece of my sanity among the stains... I think I made a promise to the universe then that I'd never fly with Peaches alone again until she had a driver's license to show at security checkpoints. So it should be Rooster's turn to go. He hasn't been in two whole years. But Peaches will WANT to go, and Rooster will not. And Peaches will flip her little lid if I go without her. And Rooster will not. And Peaches will enjoy the reunion. And Rooster will not. And she will be able to occupy herself for a few minutes safely now and then in her Grandma and Grandpa's house, and Rooster will not. I asked my mother, \"Which one?\" And she said, \"Oh no, don't ask me to choose between my grandchildren, don't ever ask me to do that.\" I know, of course, that it isn't like that. I know my mom makes faulty oversimplifications when she says that. I know, as I've said before, fair isn't giving each child the same thing, but giving each what he or she needs. Honestly, I want to bring Rooster. I want him to do better than I think he will. I want him to charm everyone with those gorgeous long lashes and delicious smile. I want people to tell me, \"You exaggerate, he's doing so much better than how you make it seem.\" I want photos of him with family and friends. I want him to distract me from the people in my home town who are missing, who I am missing. I want him to enlighten people and make them care about autism. I want to be too busy caring for him to think about the last time I was home. I want to give him his turn, and to get a wee break from talk of fairy princesses and purple. It's not that I don't want to bring Peaches. I adore her, you know I do. I just cannot bring them both, and it's his turn. But then reality sets in. Rooster can't simply take turns like he's a typical child. Rooster travels with a pharmacy, and his daddy is the pharmacist, not me. The rural South has grits, gravy, hash browns, and disdain for special needs diets. I'd need to bring my own gfcf refrigerator. And neither the Rooster nor his mother need the pressure of those wishes I just described: WANTING him to do better than I expect pretty much dooms us, as I proved at the top of this post. I know in all likelihood that the Rooster would spend much of the trip begging to go home, missing his daddy and his toys, and that I would likely encounter painfully sympathetic looks from well meaning classmates and painfully unsympathetic looks from NOT well meaning classmates, and that I don't need any more reasons for holding grudges that date back to my angsty teen years. Even with all his curly-topped charm, my rooster IS a tough little boy. He is difficult and challenging and  roostery . But the truth is, as much as I whine and moan, I have a very hard time imagining spending a weekend far away from him. I mean, did I tell you that he has a crush on a girl, and that he started wearing a watch, and that today he sounded out the word \"mom\"? He's getting so much better at... UH, UM, he's getting much better at driving me NUTS is what he's getting better at, so there. And tomorrow he's going on a field trip and it's going to be a TOUGH DAY. You hear that deities? A TOUGH DAY.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/07/blog-post.html", "title": "\n??\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 11, 2009", "body": "\nIn the  blogosphere , I am first and foremost a lurker. While I've been blogging for more than a year, and I think of myself as somewhat prolific, I spend an even more substantial chunk of time reading. Lurking, because I often read on my phone, and it's hard to type comments on my phone (especially while I'm driving a car). I DO comment, I just usually comment in my head, with my heart. And I break promises to myself all the time to later dash those comments off when I'm on a real keyboard later. Being a lurker means that I feel a close sense of friendship or kinship with people who don't know my name, have little or no idea I exist. Being a lurker means I get to follow the lives of those who fascinate me, from whom I can learn, without leaving a trace. Being a lurker has helped me educate myself about autism. My  RSS   aggregator , chock full of myriad voices, reveals my two great interests: education ( particularly  as it relates to educational technology) and special needs parenting ( particularly  related to autism). In the first realm, I feel  professional , confident, empowered, excited, eager. In the second, I feel emotional, neurotic, needy, exhausted, cautious. Sometimes the two realms overlap. Then I feel awkward. Want to know how I feel about educational technology's potential for helping children with autism? So would I. I can't seem to wear both hats at once; I fall silent. As a writer in the  blogosphere , I found my voice through talking about autism, or more  specifically  at least talking about my family's experience with a child affected by autism. Although I've written ever since I could talk, I always preferred writing about other people -- I wrote news and feature stories, arts reviews, short stories and poems. I wrote in the third person most of the time. Then, my son came along. From the day I met him, I adored him, and I suspected he struggled with challenges I couldn't quite articulate. It took years into my desperate struggle to understand my son better for me to find the resources I needed, wanted, craved, sought. I had looked to doctors, teachers, therapists, family members, lactation consultants, mothers' groups ... at last I turned to Google, and finally I found the special needs  blogosphere . I read and read and read, and suddenly I had to blog. I had to say, ME TOO. I had to say, HI, PEOPLE IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS. THANK YOU FOR REACHING OUT! I THOUGHT I WAS ALL ALONE, AND I'VE BEEN SO CONFUSED! I read blogs, and then I needed to write one. I didn't write to be read, I didn't write for the sake of those whose blogs I followed, I blogged because reading blogs inspired me to seek the relief that writing gives. When I blog, it is a purely selfish act. That is a good thing. I do not speak of selfish in a  pejorative  tone. When I blog, I help myself. When I blog, I lose mental weight. When I blog, I heal a bit. When I don't blog, I suffer. When I blog, I am real, I am honest, I open up a vein. I do not blog for comments. I do not blog for anyone else. I deeply appreciate comments, I enjoy them, I welcome them, and I treasure the friendships and connections that result. But hecklers can't really hurt me, because I don't need an audience, and I don't much care if my stories of my experience with autism don't jive for someone else. It's a great wide  blogosphere  out there, and anyone who isn't looking to relate or be positive can keep stepping. Or they can just read me and lurk. If you can't say something nice... lurk. We all speak only from our own experience. In my experience, if you need to know about autism, you need the  blogosphere . If you need support for dealing with autism, it's the best place to go. If you need experienced voices to describe the pros and cons of therapies or treatments, it's the place to go. If you need a good cry, it's the place to go. If you need resources for your family, it's the place. If you need to know the ins and outs of  IEPs , it's the place. If you need to know how to get a screaming child out of the mall without getting arrested, or the best come-back line for insensitive relatives, or a  gfcf  recipe, or examples of how well special needs kids can blossom over time, or proof that you are not doing it all wrong, or a good laugh... well, you need the  blogosphere . If you need the  blogosphere , start by lurking. Read people who resonate for you, and then read who they read, and read people who read them. Lurk. And then, when you're ready, send me the  url  for your blog, so I can keep lurking in all the best  neighborhoods  in the  blogosphere .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/07/im-lurker.html", "title": "\nI'm A Lurker\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 10, 2009", "body": "\nI'm a little annoyed with autism right now, and I'm planning a little retalliation, a little subversion of my own. See, I got rejected for something today, something I really wanted to do, something for wish I had to rush through the application (which is totally unlike me), and while I'm not crying in my beer or anything, and it's a tiny thing in the grand scheme, getting turned down bugged me. It bugged me because just before that, I got accepted into something actually much bigger and more significant that I really wanted to do, something for which I worked feverishly on the application process, but after deferring for a year I finally had to myself that I don't and won't have time to devote to it. Autism? You kind of a greedy pig, in my opinion. You take and take, and I get mad. So here is my vengeful plan. I really am going to make that book happen. The one I posted about a while back. The one some of you probably think I forgot. Autism might suck up the space where I would have housed certain ambitions, but I can make new ambitions that fight back. In your face, autism. My son is and has always been a gift, a treasure... I don't, can't think in terms of \"sacrifice,\" because from the time I longed for my babies, I have always felt that they deserve everything I can give them -- that is my job, end of story. There is no more important job to me. My son ISN'T autism, and it isn't my son bugging me. And while I can appreciate that autism has brought me gifts -- including this blog -- I do still personify it in my mind as a really horrid houseguest a la The Cat in the Hat. It keeps leaving nasty rings in our family tub and drinking the last of the milk, and I'm annoyed, and I'm going to fight back by getting some pleasure out of a project that involves my passions: reading, writing, editing, helping, planning, producing, creating. So all of those who said you are in? Let's DO this thing. I hope you all agree: the book in my head has this theme/audience: You need to know about autism? Then you need the blogosphere. As a former journalist and a teacher, clearly I'm allergic to commerce; this project has nothing to do with \"career\" or business for me. If that is your interest, if you have a business plan in your head about writing about autism, I think you should pursue it, and I'll buy copies, or help any way I can. I want to make an autism book as a service, as an outlet, as a collaboration, as a learning experience ... everything I am missing from those other two projects that autism snatched. Autism? In. Your. Face.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/07/booking-it.html", "title": "\nBooking It\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 14, 2009", "body": "\nMy son didn't JUST lose his first tooth today. He lost his first TWO teeth today. And he didn't just \"lose\" them. He had to have them extracted, because our little shark boy already had the big teeth growing in behind the baby bottom incisors. AND I dreaded the dentist appointment, so J said he'd do it. At nine, I stared at my phone. I chewed my bottom lip. I knew it was tooth time. At 9:20, I was in shock when I got the call: All done! No problem! Piece of cake! Wham,  bam . (My brave boy! My amazing dentist!) We just put him to bed with his teeth in the special box under his pillow, and we got on video his eager expectation of \"coins!\" Peaches, of course, has many questions about this fairy business, vacillating between joy that fairies will be in her house and fear that they will come in her room. My boy. Five years old. Missing two teeth. Wrote his name for the first time. Sounding out a few short words (\"snow\" and \"bust\"). Dancing with the girls at camp; \"Mommy, I am going to introduce you. This is Amy and  Amir ! And this is  Amir  and this is AMY!\" My boy. Crying when he sees his old school, melting down today picking up his sister, sobbing when he asked, \"Where is MY  cubby ? This is not my stuff in my  cubby ! I miss my school!\" My boy. Language regression, less than zero attention span for ABA. Scripting,  perseverating . Put on time out, stamping away, declaring, \"I leave with my DIGNITY!\" Telling me he speaks Chinese, German, Spanish. My boy. Wow. This all seems very sudden.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 7, 2009", "body": "\nDear Rooster, I don't know exactly why I wanted to write you this letter today, but I've been moved so many times lately by this sense of you growing up in front of my eyes, and that probably has something to do with it... I guess I feel like putting these thoughts down right here as I am is a little like a bread crumb trail I leave in time. (How many times have you heard the story of Hansel and Gretel?! Toooo many! I finally hid the book; I don't like, among other things,  you getting the notion that \"stepmother\" means \"evil!\") You are my five year old boy, Rooster, but I still can look at you and see my little baby clearly, and I can't believe how big you are. I can't say, like some parents do, that the time went by so quickly. Ever since the first day I held you, time has done some funny tricks.... days will drag by slowly, and then suddenly, whammozammo, weeks will fly by, but mostly it has felt like at least five years! In a similar way, you will struggle with something in a protracted battle, to the point I want to cry for mercy, and then, whoosh, you conquer it and zip off to the next thing, leaving me with a slack jaw wondering what just happened. Oh, my sweet boy, we haven't had an easy road, but, as I liked to proclaim long before you came along, I like things challenging, and easy can be boring. You are so not boring. You are beautiful and complicated, and I cherish you. This week daddy took you to yet another new doctor, and this one is called a DAN doctor. This is new and confusing stuff to us, but we are expanding our horizons. Yes, this is going to mean some more medicines, and even more dietary rules, and no, I have no idea if this will be helpful or not, but your daddy and I have read, read, read, read, read, read, read, and we think it's worth a shot. Then, today, I took you to Dr. D, our osteopath/naturopath, or, as I like to call him, our voodoo doctor. He is the one who thumps you with a, er, massager thingy, and rubs your head, and today he was, uh, well, working on your strabismus, I think. I can't even WRITE this stuff without feeling a little shy about it, because I know that it sounds wacky.  But I have seen on more than one occasion how a visit to Dr. D has helped you feel better, communicate more, and behave better, so I am happy to take you there. As of this week, our ABA increases to EVERY day after school for two hours, and today our ABA friend JT asked you to describe your daddy. You said, \"His name is J and he doesn't exist.\" Clearly, we still have language to work on, and it has not been your best week for pragmatics. On the other hand, I loved eavesdropping on you and your sister in the playroom tonight, calling each other \"Sweetie Pie\" as you TOOK TURNS with your IMAGINARY PLAY and the Tinker Toys. The first time you ever verbally initiated recipricol play with Peaches, about a year ago (right after we started the GFCF diet), your dad and I teared up and grabbed a video camera. You have come so far, and I'm very proud of your progress. When we started ABA, potty training was our number one goal. It seemed to take forever. We'd already been at it for YEARS. And you put up a heck of a fight when ABA began. And then, it suddenly seemed come together, and time did one of those funny tricks again. When was the last time I needed to restock your emergency clothes in your camp/school/babysitting backpack? Suddenly I can't remember. On our trip to the East Coast, you managed to successfully navigate new, public, dirty, and even airplane bathrooms with very little issue. As I like to tell you, and as you love to quote, \"I'm so proud of you I could bust.\" At the doctors, they weighed you in at 50 pounds. Crazy! I pick you up sometimes now and carry you (like today when you didn't have your shoes and we needed to get across a hot blacktop driveway) and think, \"I gained more than this when I was pregnant with you... HOW is that POSSIBLE?!\" Only this week have I gotten back down the weight I was before you were born... again, I wonder how that is possible, too, that it could take me so long. We do things in our own time, don't we? Next week's medical appointments include a trip to the dentist, so he can pull your two front baby teeth, since your two front adult teeth have already come in behind them. How weird is that? It's commonly known as \"shark teeth,\" and while it isn't so rare, I had never heard of it before. So we aren't going to see that little gap tooth smile that usually marks the losing of the first teeth, but, again, we often do milestones a little differently at Casa del Rooster. Tomorrow you are going on a field trip with your camp, and I know you are going to have fun. I also know, though, that as you pass your former school, where your sister still goes and I still work, you are going to tell me, \"I want to go to my REAL school, mommy. PLEASE, mommy, take me back to my school.\" I know that we'll get through it, and that you'll have fun on your field trip, but I know that I will feel the sting of your request. It is bitter sweet not having you with me at school anymore. Like many things, it is hard, but it is right. You're sleeping now, my gorgeous boy, with the head full of curls that only recently emerged where stick straight blonde used to be. You are sleeping and growing and dreaming, and I'm hoping soon I will be sleeping, too, just a couple of rooms away. It's the end of another very long day, and we'll each wake up tomorrow a day older. Today was a day that dragged, but tomorrow could be one that flies. With time passing in such crazy fits and starts, I feel better having taken these minutes right now to capture a little piece of our now, so that we can both reread it sometime later, and know that we did have this time. That we did have good, and bad, and love. Oh, as I wrote that last part, I suddenly got it, I see why I needed to write this letter tonight. Rooster, a lot of women around me are having babies lately. As they do, and as I see them serenely carrying their contentedly cooing wee ones around, I find myself wondering, \"Did I MISS it? Did I do it? Did I experience it ENOUGH? Did I have a baby like that? Can I still feel those memories? Did I embrace it? Or did I MISS IT? I hope I didn't MISS IT. I hope it was GOOD?! I hope we were happy?! I had my babies, too... it wasn't all lost or terrible, was it?\" And on some level I know: we did it our way, and we did cherish it. There was plenty of good amid our challenges. The questions I have come from pure fatigue, pure exhaustion... but as tired as we were and are, the love is and was always there, always special. So that is why I write this letter. In case later we wonder, Did we do Five? Was it embraced? Or does everyone else get five and we just missed it all? Rooster, we were here, and, more than that, we were kind of happy sometimes, and we were full of love. And I knew it. I made sure to stop and know it. My eyes were open, my heart open. And I love you, as always, so big, forever.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/07/dear-rooster-its-hard-to-be-five.html", "title": "\nDear Rooster / It's Hard to Be Five\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 5, 2009", "body": "\nMy grandma has been gone a year now. Anyone who grew up raised by their grandma probably understands when I say my grandma was not what most people I know think of as a grandmother -- I didn't feel any sense of  generational  separation from her, I mostly just felt the \"mother\" in \"grandmother.\" My grandma was one of the very best friends I have ever known, and she was one of the few heroes in my life. I adored her, I adore her still. As this year of mourning closes, I feel like I am emerging from a dark, dank well --- like I've slowly been creeping toward the light. No one knew how sad I was but me, and while I will always miss her, while I will always long for her, I think it's good that I'm letting go of the grief drop by drop. I know she'd be glad. My grandma, a part of me, is always with me. Before she died, my grandma was sick for the better part of a year. If I'm totally honest about it, that year was harder. As bitter as it is to have her gone from me, it was a far heavier weight to bear to hold her here while she suffered. In some ways she felt farther away during her sickness than she does now. That year, too -- the time when she became ill -- was also the time of diagnosing the rooster. When the formal diagnosis came, the  developmental   pediatrician  tried as best she could to encourage optimism. My husband and I regularly reflect on how she told us, \"You're going to have work your @ sses  off for a couple of years, and then we'll all have a better sense of where we are, but I have a good feeling that the hard work will pay off, and you'll find the strategies he needs to deal with many of the challenges we're now facing.\" I won't shock everyone and go all glass-half-full on you, because that is not my way, but I will say this: we have indeed worked our @ sses  off around here, and, while we have PLENTY more work (and plenty more @ass) to go, we are finding strategies to deal with many of the challenges we've faced. I hope we will do as well with the next challenges when they come along. We have been all about the milestones here lately; we've celebrated a half dozen birthdays and some  anniversaries , and we've reflected on losses, and we're mostly done with diapers (in the waking hours at least) at  Casa   de  Rooster, and I've lost enough weight that I'm closing in on my goal. Today, I woke up and felt almost like I'd  rediscovered  my long lost self. Oh, I'm still pretty exhausted, and I'm still worried about this and that and the other thing, and the gray hairs are in a race with wrinkles, but the mantle of funk is shedding away some, and I feel somewhat renewed. Today, we zipped down the wide open 101 freeway and looked out at the ocean. We stopped for gas and the breeze blew and the sun shone gentler than ever. I held hands with Peaches as we walked to a little cafe and told her that I needed stop for a minute and look at her and absorb a really perfect moment. I expected her usual kind of response: \"Why?\" Instead, she said, \"I love you, mommy.\" A little while later I scooped up the Rooster and I said, \"I love you a hundred percent.\" I expected his usual kind of reply: \"No!\" Or maybe one of his new favorites: \"What does that mean?\" Instead, his face lit into this magical,  melty  smile, and he said, \"I love YOU one hundred percent!\" His smile has potent charm, and I don't care if that sounds like boastful mother talk, it's just true! Tomorrow starts our first full week of work/school/camp since early June. I don't kid myself about it. We're not looking at a week of roses. But I can't remember that last time I faced a week like this and felt even the slightest bit capable, like I do tonight. (And yes, I still worry about the revenge of the deities. I don't feel THAT much better...) \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/07/time-for-reflection.html", "title": "\nTime for Reflection\n"},

It's not only statistically probable, but I am about to jinx myself horribly. Because I am about to tell you that we've been on a journey to the East Coast, and every step we've travelled we've encountered friendship, kindness and NICE people. J and Rooster sat in a row of three, and Peaches and I sat in another row of three. Halfway into the flight, when J wrestled the boy to the restroom, I leaned over to the woman in the third seat of their room. \"I just want to say how much I appreciate your tolerance,\" I told her. \"I never know in a situation like this if I should start out by explaining that my son has special needs, or just let things unfold... but  clearly  you have seen that he has special needs, and I want to thank you for how nice you've been about his behavior. This flight is hard for him.\" She not only asked me all about autism, but she works in health insurance in Alaska and had many questions about ABA. When I told her that it has been a lifesaver for us, she wondered how they could recruit more ABA providers to Alaska. When we got to our rental house, it was late, and dark, and the lock box would not open. The cab driver helped us for many minutes, and helped me keep my wound up kids from running into the street. We are here so I can attend a conference in Washington, D.C., and getting this far provided us more than enough challenge. So my mother and step dad came to meet us, getting up before four a.m. and riding five hours on the train so we didn't have to go to them. They have put up with much inconvenience and little by way of adult entertainment. On top of that, my college roommate and dear friend who lives in Maryland agreed not only to drive the hour to visit us with her husband and two kids, but they brought with them a cooler full of lunch foods ( ceviche  too!  yummm ) and beer, and loads of toys to share and occupy the kids. We hung out for several hours, and while my kids occasionally threw tantrums and needed time outs and hit, her kids regularly forgave and shared and engaged. And, the niceness continues... Like, right now, a childhood friend I found through  Facebook  is driving three hours to come catch up tonight after 20 years! A dear college friend who lives in town works for a museum, and just wrote to offer to comp us tickets. My colleague from work arrived to attend this conference too, and, having lived here previously, she has navigated us, escorted us, shared Metro passes, and voluntarily took the basement bedroom at our shared house. Even more, she has tolerated my endless worries about my kids. This trip? It stirs up  alllllll  the reasons to worry. Yeah, I know, we're taxing my son beyond reason, that we're pushing all his buttons, but later I will have to post the photo of him throwing his body in anguish on to the concrete steps of the entrance to the Smithsonian because I wouldn't buy him a $100 space suit. I wish I had captured on video my husband's reaction when the guard came out of the museum to tell him, VERY politely, that he was sorry but he couldn't let the boy lay on the steps. J said, \"Great. Tell him that.\" Honestly, though, J has been the nicest person of all on this journey. He has the kids all day while I'm at an amazing conference, stretching my brain, meeting interesting people, having fun. He has them in a kind of funky house in a kind of remote neighborhood of a hot and sometimes rainy city full of mosquitoes. He has been up at night with the boy's mixed up body clock on alarm mode. He has been living with his  inlaws , who are wonderful, but who snore just a bit... I fervently hope I don't push J past his limits, that he isn't the one who spits on me or pushes me into traffic!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/06/goodness-gracious.html", "title": "\nGoodness Gracious\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 14, 2009", "body": "\nI really ought to write about the  IEP , the crazy day of the  IEP , the  inservice  I facilitated... that day brimmed OVER with  bloggy  compost... but I have this other thing, kind of murky and unformulated, demanding to have the first turn. So I don't know where this is going, but I want to write about water. What goes on with my son and water brings to mind some kind of Age of Aquarius feel, evokes that  diy   tv  program where designers go all  feng   shui  crazy over nature symbols.... My son is all about the WATER. Maybe that is why it took 32 hours and two pulls on a  vacuum  to coax him out of the womb? The photos I most cherish of him I took during his first baths. A  frickin '  Calgon  commercial, I tell you --- he LOVED the water. Among his 3000 piece bathtub amusement collection? Dive toys. Snorkels, Fins. I love that my child loves the water so much, that he can get his sensory needs met that way. And yet... We have moved frequently, and when we house hunted, I finally had to put my foot down when our agent kept showing us homes with pools. \"Tom,\" I said, \"we will NOT even look at another house with a pool. I don't want to hear about gates and covers. NO POOLS.\" And then, of course, I had to explain. \"I can't swim. And I can't handle the responsibility and the worry. NO POOLS.\" At that time, I didn't know how glad I'd be later I'd set that limit. I didn't know that my son would become so fascinated with water, and so determined to be in it, and that he'd have so little understanding of danger. Later we'd stay at a lake house on vacation, and it took nine adults constant vigilance to keep my son from simply running outside and throwing himself with abandon into deep water. I really, really need to learn how to swim. So, today, we joined the YMCA. I have no idea how many years in the making, but we've LONG awaited a way to get a little time tend to our poor, aging, adult bodies, while leaving the little bodies in good hands. Now that we have both kids in underwear (dare I say it?), now that we've made some decent progress in ABA (oh, I better dial back the positivity), now that it's summer, it seemed like maybe we could join the Y. The kids and I can learn to swim. I can try leaving them in the kids' activity room for child care in small doses while I do the  cardio  room and maybe I can lose a few more pounds. (Did I mention I shed 10?  Shhhh , don't jinx me. Three or four more and I'll call it done, good enough. I never even strive for skinny. I don't think it's under there, in this bod.) So finally we signed up today, and we all took the plunge. We got in the  kiddy  pool together. And it just felt to tremendously symbolic to me. Like, cheap symbolism, sure... Freud not needed for such  representationalism ... I just felt like I needed to write about it tonight. Not that I know exactly what I want to say about it. Just that I need to tell you. I just need to say that this trip to the pool, it represented us. Peaches dragged her feet, worried, balked at everything, needed coaxing... finally falling deeply in love with the pool after seeing other cute little girls in purple suits  frolicking  unafraid with their moms and siblings, though always ready in a moment to panic, worry or cling. Rooster brought his dorkiest tub toys, shrieked too loudly, swam right into strangers, broke all the rules, and charmingly wooed one mom, saying, \"Hi! I'm rooster, and I'm FIVE! I'm BIG! Can I play with you? Is that your girl?\" Rooster knew no fear. My husband smoothly entertained both children, knowing just how to get Peaches into deeper water, spinning her and flattering her every other moment, setting firm and appropriate limits for Rooster, and keeping him in check with threats of serious consequences, like having to go home early. Me? I flitted. I worried. I tried to PLEASE. I felt insecure being in a swim suit for the first time this  millennium . I studied the faces of everyone my kids came near. I tried to pretend to feel confident. I worried. I said that one already didn't I? I don't know where I'm going with this, but today we did more than go to the Y. We lived a snapshot of our life. We made the trailer to our movie, in a way. We were so us. It was complicated. We are a jumble of intensity, a mix of opposites and conflicts and contradictions. I can't swim, and water makes me more than a little nervous. My husband? A fish. When I met him, he had this freaky crazy lung capacity thing that people remarked about; he'd gone scuba diving in places all around the world, sailed into amazing adventures, done a semester at sea... When we married, I dreamed of having a son just like him, how they would swim together, how I'd learn, eventually, so I could keep up just a little bit. Naturally I never could have imagined how autism would figure into that whole fantasy. What does it bring, now, I keep asking myself? Does Rooster love to swim because he is daddy's boy, or is it about the sensory component autism, this thing I still can't quite grasp? And this inability to resist risk, to comprehend danger... how does it impact my dreams for him to swim like daddy? If Rooster is less scared than he should be, am I more scared than I should be? And what does Peaches pick up from all of this? Is her fear a reflection of my own poorly hidden anxiety because of, and for, her brother? Today at the Y, we played out all our issues. We were loud, sloppy, and emotional. We got funny looks, gentle reminders, and kind offers of help. We had poor form, and we stood out. We laughed a lot, and there was copious whining. The rooster beamed gloriously. Peaches was needy. We made some friends. I worried. My husband was heroic. I organized everything, and then some. We amassed enough laundry to cause grave concern about our carbon footprint. We left exhausted. We felt autism's presence keenly. And I guess that is what I really wanted to write about today.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/06/in-swim-of-things.html", "title": "\nIn the Swim of Things\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 17, 2009", "body": "\nI believe size doesn't matter, but perspective counts for a lot. I've written about this before, but here I am again. This is how I work through my stuff, and sometimes I'm a  slooooow  learner. Today I used my lunch break to walk over to Old  N@vy  because Peaches outgrew her bathing suit. After I grabbed her one off the super cheap sale rack and another for Rooster, I noticed that the bargains also applied to suits for grownups. I guess because we just joined the Y and I just lost 10 pounds that had been nagging at me, I decided maybe I too should try to look presentable at the Y. (I know, you can feel the horror, right?) I grabbed a sky blue one piece first and then thought I'd also try the black  tankini  kind -- you know, bikini bottom, but might as well be a one-piece once you put on the top? Those appeal to me since I'm about six sizes bigger on bottom than on top! (Sorry, this whole post is one of those  TMI  kinds, but I have no secrets.) In the dressing room, I tried on the one piece first -- a size large -- bracing myself for the fact that it might be too small for me, not wanting to be too disappointed. When I squeezed into it, though, I couldn't help the wave of shock and self-loathing. It was BEYOND too tight -- it was practically a medical emergency. \"Well,\" I thought, \"who was I kidding? Of course! Of course I don't fit these clothes! I thought I needed to lose 10 pounds? Thirty more is more like it! What is wrong with me? Why do I have such a skewed perspective? Obviously I need XL, at the very least. I need a specialty store, or tailor made swim suits. I am going to go running tonight. I am going to get serious. I am going to have to face just how heavy I have gotten.  Maybe I should think about trying to do The Biggest Loser.\" I nearly cried. So it was time for the  tankini . I had grabbed a medium top and an XL bottom, but now even the XL looked  minuscule . With a deep sigh and a sense of foreboding, I hesitantly tried the bottoms. They fell to the floor. They were too big. Now, of course, you know, this is not a story about bathing suits. And you know I have been down this road before. It's not that I care so deeply about my size or anyone  else's  -- it's how hard it is for me to see really with perspective. I suck at perspective again and again in all kinds of circumstances, more with the Rooster than with anything else. This dressing room just exemplified my weakness. My first instinct had been that because I'm such an idiot with perspective I didn't realize my weight problem. But then... I picked up the first suit, the too tight one, from the floor where I'd abandoned it in horror when I thought it represented my failure to grasp my own weight issue. I hadn't yet put it back on the size large hanger. But the tag on the suit didn't say large, of course. It said XS. Extra small. Yeah, I'd say XS would be too tight for me. Ever since I was about six. Never once have I been a skinny girl, it's true, but what happened to me when I thought the Large was too small really shows that my \"weight issue\" is partly a mental problem... my perspective is what is truly the wrong size. My eyes might struggle with estimation, but science tells me this fact: If I do lose another 30 pounds, I'm going to be in a hospital. There is absolutely nothing wrong with needing to lose 30 pounds. I would argue that there is something substantially wrong with not being able to look at yourself and know what how big or small you are, to make guesses that are wildly off base, to rapidly swing between feelings of accomplishment and feelings of failure. And, of course, this is how I get with autism, too. And that's what I've been thinking about all the rest of my day. Yeah, like many women I know, I'd like to be kinder and more accepting of my physical appearance, but that's nothing compared to how deeply I long to gain some autism perspective. I really want, really need, really must find a way to be more at peace with autism's impact on our family no matter what size it is, no matter how it compares with anyone or anything, no matter how anyone else measures our accomplishments. Because success or failure can be relative. But locking yourself into a small space and looking into a mirror to find anxiety, criticism, and confusion staring back at you and screaming all kinds of  fun house  distortions really makes you -- I mean ME -- the Biggest Loser.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["mailto:N@vy"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/06/measuring-up.html", "title": "\nMeasuring Up\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 15, 2009", "body": "\nIn a former life, I wrote quizzes for magazines aimed at the tween set. This will be exactly nothing like one of those. Ready? See if you can guess which part of my day made me fume more than any other, then check your points at the end of this, the ANGRY QUIZ: 1. The sitter was late to pick the Rooster up today. 2. My husband forgot his cell phone. 3. The reason my husband forgot his cell phone, as he explained it to me, is that I helped him by laying out much of what he needed today, only I didn't lay out his phone. I should not do that. 4. When I came home, the Rooster was off his rocker in a way I haven't seen lately; when I turned off the  tv  just as I told him I would (and he agreed) at the designated time, he howled, wept, and threw his body to the ground. 5. While I spent about an hour trying to figure out the Rooster's bad day, checking into what he ate, when he rested, how much  tv  he watched, etc, Peaches screamed at me the whole time to put my phone down and pay her more attention. 6. When our ABA guy saw and heard me trying to understand the Rooster's mood, he kindly told me, \"It's okay. It's his first week not going to school, being on summer vacation. His schedule is off, and schedule is really important for kids with autism. Tomorrow will be better.\" Did you guess which item above sent me into a blind fury, made me nearly grab a kitchen knife? Read on to find out... Was it: 1.  AAAAHHHH . Wrong answer. I knew the sitter would be late, so I told her to be there at nine, knowing the Rooster wouldn't really be done until 9:15. It worked out perfectly. In her defense, traffic does indeed suck. 2. Nope, but good try. While I do prefer to know my husband is accessible when the kids are with a sitter in case of emergency, and we do check in at least a couple times a day about crisis  management  issues, my husband regularly forgets his cell phone. I can't invest in getting angry about it anymore. Besides, he works in the Tower of Cell Hell. Having an excuse to talk to him on a land line kind of works in my favor. 3.  BUZZZZZZZZZZZ . That is just too funny to infuriate me! And I saw it coming. 4. Nobody picked 4 did they? I felt worried about the  Roo , and sad, but not angry at him. 5. Sorry. While I do get unjustifiably annoyed sometimes with my darling attention sucker, she is just three. Of course she wants my attention. It ain't easy having a big brother always in the limelight. 6. Ding ding ding ding! We have a winner! Despite all logic, the kind attempt of my ABA buddy to help me understand and be the grownup made me want to hurl us all into a raging volcano. We had just spent two full, hard hours dealing with autism's rages, language impediments, mood swings, potty training deficits, sensory defensiveness, and more, and yet somehow just hearing the phrase \"for kids with autism\" seemed like the slap in the face I could hardly stand. I effing hate autism, people. I know I'm not supposed to, but I'm really very tired of autism. I wish it would leave my son and I alone so we could play happily with Peaches and their daddy. I don't want to talk about the A word all the freaking time. I want it to go away, or to occasionally be able to at least pretend that it already went. Does that make me bad?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/06/angry-quiz.html", "title": "\nThe Angry Quiz\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 25, 2009", "body": "\nSo I find myself back in front of the same window. I've had a complicated relationship with this window for two years. Sometimes I stood in front of it and cried. Sometimes I've snuck peeks through it when no one was looking. Sometimes I've gone to crafty lengths to avoid it. Through it I watched my son on the preschool play yard. I have watched him walk the perimeter of that space in self imposed isolation, I have watched him throw his body into the sand in wired/tired moody fits. I have watched him hit, fight with other kids who had no idea what to make of him. I have seen him teased, mocked. I have watched him shake his cute thing to High School Musical, with a teacher, or with his best gal pal, or with his \"shadow,\" or all by himself. I have watched him laugh, hug, play, and be loved. And for two years, I often left that window and had to remind myself to look in another -- his sister's. I love my children with equal ferocity. I care equally about their schooling. Fair isn't giving each child the same things though, it's giving each child what he or she needs. Peaches has not needed me staring longingly through her window. Now I still pass his window frequently on my way around campus, and, for the third year running, I do stop and look sometimes, only he's not at this school anymore; he was not invited back. Instead, I look through, and I see my daughter. So far I always see her playing happily with all her friends. Watching her this week, seeing her on that too familiar yard effortlessly playing where he brother had experienced so many highs and lows, I suddenly had to duck into a closet for cover when I found myself more shaken than I had ever been in front of that window. You can't compare. You can't measure. I wasn't THINKING anything when I melted down. It just happened, that same illogical emotional kind of surprise I get when I watch a remarkable piece of theatre or the Olympics or something. I saw my daughter holding hands with friends laughing and carrying on and my heart had a little earthquake. Watching Peaches through the window, I thought of the callous, tactless woman who told me, \"It's only going to hit you more and more what his challenges are as you watch Peaches develop normally.\" She is the same woman who told me she was surprised I had another kid after the Rooster. But though she lacks communication skills, I won't deny that seeing Peaches' effortless socialization made me acutely aware of how hard it is for him even now, two years older than she is, to navigate a playground with any degree of social success. \"My\" school was not the right school for my son, and I wanted to find him a new school as much or more than the school wanted to see him go. But there is no denying it feels better to leave on your own terms. I can still see Rooster through my school's windows. He is at the school across the street now, and through certain windows I can see him when he's outside playing on the playground, now there for summer \"camp.\" Mostly I feel my load greatly lightened by the increased distance, the ability to take off one of my hats, the separation of church and state, so to speak. But the other day I did intentionally sneak a peak when I knew he'd be playing outside, to see how he was doing. I saw him with a little girl who looked to be about seven. While I watched, they hugged. Later when I picked him up, that little girl showed me the gap in her teeth, and then said, \"We're going to take good care of the Rooster while he's at camp.\" One of my favorite John Irving novels uses the phrase, \"Keep passing open windows.\" In the book, it's a way of saying, \"Don't jump!\" It's a survival phrase. For me, it's also good advice.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/06/goodbye-hello-window.html", "title": "\nThe Goodbye Hello Window\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 9, 2009", "body": "\nDear G, Oh, sweetie. On the one hand, I want to give you some tough love. It's for your own good that I tell you how unattractive everyone finds your incessant indulgence in pity parties. On the other hand, I realize pity parties are the only kind you get to go to recently, and for that I feel like hugging you, and giving you the opposite of tough love... just love. I'll try to be even handed. Okay, here is some advice for you. I want you to take a deep breath and think back to that 21 hours of alone time you and J had this past weekend. Remember? Ahhh, breathe it in all the way to your core. You were a lucky girl to get to celebrate your anniversary, and I sure hope you banked the good vibes of that little getaway so you can use them now. This is a tough week, I can't help but grant you that, but it's NOT the end of the universe. Try to remember that the Rooster will be better off at a new school, and that you will enjoy the benefits of a little separation of church and state, so to speak. I know for all your stress that you are actually happy to have a new school for him, you are just worried about the niggling what ifs and uncertainties... no one invents stuff to worry about like you do, but try not to do that to yourself so much, please. And yes, this IEP comes at the world's worst time ever possible, but you'll get all work done before the meeting, and no one has ever died from missing a few graduations, retirement parties, and celebrations. In a way, it's ironic that missing parties and events lately makes you so sad; aren't you the same girl who used to complain half the time about the events you did have to attend? So chin up, babe... you'll be glad you didn't eat all those calories. Not everybody hates you, you can stop eating worms... you completely exaggerate in your own mind how much attitude you get, and tomorrow I want you to focus on the support you feel from your most supportive friends and colleagues. If you can't feel the obvious compassion around you, reread your blog comments. Only a fool would fail to feel supported after that. You are so lucky; don't take it for granted. That would be doing a disservice to so many wonderful people all around you. You know what I think your real issue is, G? And I say this with all the best intentions: you haven't gotten over this whole autism thing, and instead you've been convincing yourself it's something you can't handle. Well, sorry, but I remember you sitting on the floor in your condo close to six years ago negotiating with the universe to give you a child, to please not let you miscarry, because you would do ANYTHING for this baby, ANYTHING, and you got a beautiful little boy. You keep touching the bruises from each day like you want to feel each injury over and over again, and it isn't healthy... why do you replay each slight and every comment about his \"special needs\" in your head that way? To see if it still hurts? Maybe you need to repeat after me 3000 times until you've reached real acceptance, \"My son has autism.\" Maybe then we can be done with it and get back to business, the business of raising your beautiful, delicious, smart, feisty, difficult children. Your son has autism. He also has cute curls, a darling vocabulary, kissable cheeks, an impressive imagination... and, yeah, there is also the autism. Deal with it. I am sorry if that sounds too harsh, because I'm not trying to hurt you; rather, I'm trying to show you that you are NOT hurt, you are OKAY. You don't always realize it, but you are. Yes, you didn't get dealt the really easy hand. But there are so, so much worse cards you could have gotten, my friend. You used to proclaim proudly that you LIKED hard things, that you welcomed challenges. Okay, be the kind of leader you like to imagine. Make it work. Lemme see some lemonade, sister. A long time ago you were a lonely girl wishing and hoping for more. You wanted love, teamwork, obstacles to overcome, family, new beginnings, and stories. Well, nothing is perfect. You got your wishes, G, all that and more, and what you got is really good stuff. You can choose to wallow in the sh*t that comes along with your life, or you can realize that sh*t comes along with EVERY life and you can celebrate all the goodness in spite of that. There is goodness aplenty for anyone willing to see it. Oh, stop crying already. I'm tired and I had an epic day, and I've got two substantially longer ones to go, so can we wrap this up now? You know I love you. And you know I'm right. Now let's go to bed.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/06/note-to-self.html", "title": "\nNote To Self\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 7, 2009", "body": "\nThis coming week, like all the others, floors me. Monday means OT, restocking the  cubbies , replenishing the  gfcf  school stash, a big school party, full work days, long commutes, ABA, whew.  Tuesday means meetings, preparations, dropping off thank you gifts, mailing Father's Day gifts to make sure they make it in time, more work, more ABA.  Wednesday is OT, a half day for children but a full day for me, the last day of school, the start of cobbling together babysitters, and the end of a two year attempt to fit a square peg in a round hole... no more struggling to get my son to make it through attending the school that has been my Los Angeles home for 14 years. Oh, and ABA... Thursday I am responsible for an in-service day for my colleagues and my bosses -- an  in-service  day one of my friends said she'd rather be doing just about anything other than attending -- and I'm somewhat nervous. But more importantly, the minute it finishes (or possibly a few minutes before everyone finishes with my meticulously planned out and pedagogically ambitious sessions that might or might not inspire technology integration among the challenging audience of exhausted and spring feverish educators) -- I will skip lunch to get in my car and race across town for the rooster's  IEP , then gather myself together to race back to pick up Peaches, then turn around and race back again toward home, where the Rooster will be waiting, and it will be time for more ABA.  I can't even begin to imagine being able to think past Thursday. We're still newish at this  IEP  business, and while I know what to expect, I also don't. I know that we'll review Rooster's goals, that we'll talk about his behavior challenges in details that will necessitate I use up my allotment of cheap off brand tissues provided for the occasion. I know that the team will recommend inclusion in general ed kindergarten at the school across the street from where I work, and that the team will argue for a AAA paraprofessional aid while I will probably put up a fight for a BI aid from the vendor we used this year. I know we'll be offered school based OT and not the therapy room we've been using, and that we pretty much see the point of this. I know we'll talk a little about my son's progress, but much more about his irritability, behavior challenges, and needs, needs, needs. I know we need to do all this, and that it's important. What I still don't know is what I always haven't known, what I've questioned since the first post I ever wrote on this site, or before that when I commented on others' pages. I don't know what it all means in the big picture. I don't know exactly how I feel or exactly who this boy is, exactly how far off the mark he'll be with his academics, exactly where to spend the most of my worry chips. I don't know exactly how much to panic or how much to hope. I don't know exactly how to measure anything, or exactly what autism means to me, to Rooster, to our clan. I don't exactly know what to make of the Rooster calls... I haven't found clear perspective yet, and I don't know if I ever will. This is a gigantic week. It is a turning time. Among many other things that might not seem related but are anyway, it's been almost a year since I lost my grandmother - today was the unveiling of her headstone and I couldn't be there, across the country, with my family. It's my wedding anniversary tomorrow - lucky seven - and also the anniversary of the day I met J nine years ago. It's the last week of school, and that has a context it never has had for me before. It marks the end of my son's career as a student where I built my career as a teacher, just as it marks my daughter's graduation from the faculty child care center; ironically, this fall she will enter the preschool grade Rooster is leaving after having spent two years there. This week promises to be a  roller coaster  ride of emotions, an inordinate amount of stress, an overdose of transitions. I should be looking forward, prepping, planning, rehearsing. I'm not. Mostly I'm looking back. Mostly, when I wrap any part of my head around any of the sea changes taking place, I'm mostly noting how far we've come rather than where we are going. I'm not bright siding, I'm just processing what strikes me most at any given moment... Like, today was a hard day, but so much farther ahead than the hard days of a year or two ago. Today the Rooster had three or four accidents, and that seemed like an awful lot. For about a nanosecond. And then I remembered it's been only the briefest time since we managed two or three successes getting him to use the potty in a day. Today, we put the Rooster on time out, and he accepted his punishment, and handled it just as he's supposed to, and then didn't need to be prompted to apologize for his actions. Today the Rooster struggled to take a conversation 4 levels deep despite doing much better at it a few days ago, but I vividly remember asking J with terrified wonder last year, \"Do you think by the time he's five we'll be able to ask him questions and he'll answer? Do you think he'll be able to ask questions when he's five?\" Today was hard, but today was tolerable. Today is about as far as I can look right now. The week ahead will come, just like the year ahed, and I'll deal with it then.

And you might have noticed that sometimes I worry about things that never happen. But once in a while I intuit that things are going to be okay. When this happens, you can put money down on my intuition. I met my husband online. I can't tell you that I knew that we'd build our life together this way from the outset, but I had this intuition from our first email exchange that nothing bad could come of it. I spent barely any time online dating... it's not necessarily my style, and I quickly met and fell for J. The first time I talked to him on the phone, I knew I'd just had the best date I'd ever had in my life, and that agreeing to meet him in person posed no danger. Anyways... Pixie Mama is here. For anyone who worried that either one of us would be an axe murderer, we can both assure you that the only weapons we've come near since her arrival Saturday are the Rooster's (by way of Luke  Skywalker's ) \"light savers.\" We both acknowledge why some people might find it scary for one blogger to travel 3,000 miles to spend a week in the home of another blogger she's never met and her husband, two kids, and special needs challenges. Yeah, it could sound chancy. It is hard for me to imagine someone wanting to visit us: Our house is small, our city enormous, our days LONG, our kids challenging. But Pixie Mama wanted to come -- she loves Cali, she cares about the Rooster clan, she needed a break. And my intuition said things would be okay. I was wrong. Things have been much better than okay. Pixie Mama arrived about 50 hours ago with gifts like stickers for the kids and a journal, robe and art for me. These gifts have arrived since: 1. We all went to the ocean. Twice. Somehow living in Los Angeles this idea rarely crosses our minds, even though my son worships water. Yesterday I chose a too crowded beach that challenged the Rooster in terms of  noise , crowds,  overstimulation , waiting in lines... and still he maintained and found some bliss as we muddled through. Today we visited the ocean on MEMORIAL DAY and managed a perfect outing, with lovely weather, in a quiet spot, and shot winning photos, all thanks to Pixie Mama. The ocean has tremendous power. 2. Dare I write about it? On one hand, it should be an ENTIRE post unto itself. On the other, we've had too many ups and downs, and I've flown already in the face of the deities so often... let me just say this. It was an amazing weekend for potty training strides, and I am proud of my boy. 3. Peaches and Rooster have been pretty lovely together. Oh, sure, they also have argued over the radio and fought and shouted some. But when Pixie Mama painted Peaches' toes, Rooster cried of envy. Peaches said, \"I know! I know what to do! I will SHARE my new polish with you, okay Rooster?\" To which he put his arms around her and thanked her with hugs. I painted his toes, she blew on them to dry the faster, and they loved on one another. Okay, this is a GIFT. 4. Peaches is terrified of  Malificent , the scary witch of Sleeping Beauty. She went on and on about this at dinner, and my Rooster brimmed over with empathy. It went something along the lines of, \"Peaches, if that evil witch tries to scare you, I. WILL. PROTECT YOU.\"  Melty ,  melty ,  melty , melt. This is what the Rooster said when he grabbed Pixie in a hug... giving the highest compliment he bestows, and echoing my sentiments precisely: \"You are so dear to me!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/05/pixie-dust.html", "title": "\nPixie Dust\n"},

My jaw aches, my posture's poor, I rarely feel like walking up to my fourth floor office, and I've changed so much, I'm like Clinton pre and post white house.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 19, 2009", "body": "\nMy kids have read too many fairy tales; when they get angry at me they call me \"STEPMOTHER!\" Peaches and Rooster believe, understandably given the literature, that stepmother means  badmother . I've been trying to explain to them the truth,  dispel  the notion that step-families want to ditch you in the dark with a crumbly scrap of bread. Sometimes the family you make, the family that happens after the genetics thing plays its hand, is the family you can count on to feed you through the famine. I have the greatest  stepdad  ever. My only grievance with E is that he took so long to find my mother and show her how to love a good guy. I was in college when they met and married, and I have always wished I  could've  spent more time with E. While I was thousands of miles away, he did more than just make my mom happy - he became a true son to my grandparents, who adored him, and E did things for my grandparents as they reached the end of their lives that I wish I could have been there to do. Hard things. Generous things. Loving things. Family things. My mom and I found our mother-daughter footing shortly before E came into the picture, and once they met, my relationship with her only grew and grew. He seemed to be the key to unlock the best aspects of my mom. My  stepdad  knows I love him and I know he loves me, though we can be somewhat awkward still in our expressions of it. When I fell in love with my husband, I fell for the whole package, and for his whole family, too. Among the most exciting parts of marrying him, and making it official, were these momentous milestones: I gained a warm and close-knit family, and I got to use the word \"Dad\" again. My in-laws let me know I could choose to continue calling them by their first names if I wanted, but that they also felt comfortable being called \"mom\" and \"dad,\" and as someone who didn't really grow up with a \"dad,\" the temptation was  irresistible . As an adult, I really hit the jackpot when it comes to adding to my family, especially for a girl who had to be rescued by her (phenomenal) grandparents from a cast of  MIAs , addicts, crooks, thugs and dysfunction.  First, E, then my in-laws. Having my in-laws means having solid support when we hit a crisis. It means we're not all alone here in this lonely state. It means a place in driving distance to have a real holiday meal. It means family I can talk to without worrying about the time difference. It means connectedness and compassion and backyard barbecues. My  inlaws  have helped us move. THREE TIMES. Once without much help from us, as Jeremy took me to the ER for the day. They have come to help us through STOMACH FLU. They have watched our kids FOR THREE DAYS so we could get away. They have accompanied the Rooster clan to DISNEYLAND in 90 degree temps. My  inlaws  come to lend a hand when we try out new treatments with the  roo  so we don't get overwhelmed. They sleep on an air mattress in our playroom to help us do all this. And they don't do it just for J. Yes, they love him dearly. But they make it clear that they do it for me, too - that I matter, too. They are my family; I feel like the terms \"in-laws\" and \"step-\" need rewriting, they need better PR. Looks like I'll be tossing out quite a few Disney books here soon... if anyone has any picture books to suggest that celebrate step parents, or in-laws for that matter, I'm in the market...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/05/family-matters.html", "title": "\nFamily Matters\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 18, 2009", "body": "\nI am pretty sure today is Monday, so I'm not sure why it was so Freaky. Freaky Monday has no ring to it whatsoever. First up on the list of Freaky involved a case of deja vu. You see, five years ago tomorrow, a little roostery boy emerged into the world full of attitude, and two days later he I left the hospital just as the SWAT team descended, weapons aimed directly at our car, helicopters hovering so low and loud I had to cover my ears. Today, as I sat in a meeting at work, just blocks from that same hospital, I struggled to focus on my boss' message as I heard those helicopters again. No, it wasn't PTSD. Almost exactly five years later, the same disturbing story: a gunman in the mall near the hospital, near the school. When the rooster was born, the man with the weapon disappeared without being caught, and no one was hurt. Today, I heard the word homicide. It sent a shiver through me. I couldn't help but recall how upsetting it felt to bring my new, beautiful, tiny little baby out in to the world only to face rifles and sidearms and scary men in flak jackets screaming at us to get out of the way. Even for LA, that's pretty freaky. Freaky number two, no pun intended... When we started ABA a couple of months ago, the Rooster didn't want to set a foot into a bathroom. He threw epic tantrums, hitting and spitting to avoid the mere sight of the potty. Well, we are NOT out of the woods yet, but he's made substantial progress, and he's been successful many times. Today, however, my son wanted to earn a few gfcf chocolate chips. He  really  wanted them. And he also proved to me what I've long suspected: he gets confused about what his body tells him, and he has a hard time doing what we all take for granted. See, we've had lots of pee success, but not so much the other kind, the kind that he knows will earn him some chocolate chips. So for ABA tonight, I sat in the bathroom with Rooster hoping to achieve our mutual goals for nearly two hours. He was so determined, I couldn't get him to LEAVE the bathroom. Our ABA helper could barely get over the irony. We have a long way to go, but we've come a long way, too, and we're proud of him. Freaky three isn't all that freaky, it just felt that way. I got an email from my mother-in-law (Hi, Mom!) saying she Googled GFCF and the name of her town and up popped my blog. I had told her and my FIL about it before, but this is the first time she'd read it. It felt a little freaky to think of my worlds colliding like that, but it felt good. She wrote me the nicest note: \"Mom here,  I was researching gfcf foods ... when I came upon roostercalls and checked it out.  ...  I love how your southern-ness comes through your writing and how your love for Rooster bursts through all the anguish over his diagnosis.  I'm glad you have such terrific women who can give you support and comfort in the difficult times and encouragement for the future.   Enjoy your time with pixiemama next week! With love, Mom\" Isn't that freaky good? I think so. I could go on about the freaky day, but it wore me out. I'm tired. I'm going to curl up and think about how much my life has changed in the five years since my rooster came into it on May 19, 2004. No matter how much I might wine and wallow, I never forget how lucky I am. I have a beautiful son, and tomorrow I plan to celebrate him. Happy birthday to the best rooster ever.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/05/i-am-pretty-sure-today-is-monday-so-im.html", "title": ""},

{"date": "Friday, May 15, 2009", "body": "\nNow, come on, people, clearly (undeniably, indubitably, and OBVIOUSLY) a year later, I KNOW the rooster has AUTISM. He has it, I name it, I say it every day in copious contexts. I write about it. I have a  freakin ' BRACELET about it, if you want to get down to brass tacks. It's pretty matter of fact: Rooster? Has autism. Not the end of the world, just the facts. So, this is a real question for you: Why, when someone else states it, as a matter of course (in contexts like, \"Yes, that is fairly common in children with autism...\"), WHY does it still throw me? No, not rhetorical, because I can't quite seem to GET it, and I just know that  you do , and that you can say it to me, and it won't hurt the way this thing I'm telling you hurts, smarts, stings. Help me make some sense... I'm saying to you that on a regular basis a therapist or doc or whoever will be talking about my child and simply toss in that he has autism and so this or that thing is common and my BRAIN kind of tailspins, and my heart kind of spasms, and, well, I don't know why I get mental hives or whatever, but it's shocking to me that I experience this emotional response, when, in fact, I'm well aware that he HAS AUTISM. You know? Like, I thought I did the whole nine yards, up to an including acceptance, but maybe not so much? And there is this: my son has always had stick straight hair.  Blonde . My hair could best be described as a mess of curly. Auburn. Before his diagnosis, I remember I'd joke with people, \"Who can believe that  I  have a  blonde  child with straight hair who doesn't talk much?\" We all got a good laugh at that one, at the unruliness of my  sproingy  reddish hair (rather similar to my husband's but exponentially BIGGER), and the  randomness  of genetics. Well, one day a couple of months ago, the boy woke up, wandered into our room, and left us speechless. My husband finally remarked, \"Where did those CURLS come from?\" Everyone we see seems to want to know the same thing lately. Why did the Rooster's hair wake up four and a three quarters years old with the curls I had once expected to be a given? And why, ever since those still- blonde  curlicues appeared, have I halfway expected him to suddenly talk to me in fluid prose, eye to eye, heart to heart, nary a script or a meltdown to be seen for miles? That's just dumb. Have I just gone crazy? Am I in the most pathetic state of denial you ever did see? Do you ever feel the same? And how exactly can I get over myself? I'm bugging me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/05/no-duh.html", "title": "\nNo Duh\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 9, 2009", "body": "\nNow, this Notable and Quotable needs substantial prefacing.\u00a0 The Rooster, a highly verbal boy with an extensive vocabulary, also talks slightly like his last name should be  Gump . It's not exactly a drawl, but he talks slower than most folks where I grew up in the rural South. And what he says is best described by our ABA friend Dan, who calls it \"word salad.\" As a result, you can't always take what Rooster tells you at face value, and it's a little like verbal charades sometimes. Naturally, since we spend so much time with him, we're pretty good at figuring out what he means, and recognizing the origins of scripts. Most people have no idea when he's scripting, because he does it rather artfully, and that sometimes can lead us into dangerous waters. When he learns new words, and the bigger the better, he sprinkles them around liberally without understanding them. His favorite word this week was \"responsible.\" I heard him use it close to a dozen times, never meaningfully, and he resisted my attempts to inform him.\u00a0 Anyway, that is some serious lead up, huh? The conversation I'm about to share, I also must note, came with long pauses, and funny inflection, at the end of a long, intense and napless day. We were kind of snuggled up on my bed. If others who didn't know him heard it, they might take drastic measures. Me, I'm not discounting it whole cloth, but I'm not sure, for once, what to glean. Is Freud in the house? I definitely will be rethinking and stewing on this one: Me: What is it like to be the Rooster? (Usually this kind of question would be followed by, \"Can I watch TV? Will you read me a book? Can I have a cookie?) Rooster: Mom? I wish I was never born. Me: Rooster, \u00a0what character said that?\u00a0 Rooster: I don't know. Um, maybe Kermit? I need to be me! Me: Are you a happy boy or a sad boy,  Roo ? Rooster: A sad boy. (gives a big smile for a moment) Me: How can I help you be happy? Rooster: I don't know. Maybe make a big smile for me? Maybe we could go on a date some time?\u00a0 Me: I love you, Rooster.\u00a0 He also told me this, which I KNOW to be truthful and accurate, \"Mommy, you have a bad nose. It's bended. I don't like it.\"\u00a0 Okay, then there is Peaches. She ALWAYS tells it like it is, and there is no misinterpreting. Today, (again with thanks to Andy Glockenspiel, my kids' new guru) she hits me with, \"Is Rosa Parks dead?\"\u00a0 Me: Yes, Peaches, she is.\u00a0 Peaches: So we can't call her?\u00a0 Me: No, we can't.\u00a0 Peaches: Because she's dead?\u00a0 Me: Yes. Peaches: Like Noah? (of Noah's Ark...) Me: Um, I guess like that.\u00a0 Peaches: Can I see a picture of them dead?\u00a0 Me: I can show you a picture of Rosa Parks, when she was young. (Gotta love the iPhone, as we were in the car at the time.) Peaches: So Rosa Parks is not ever going to smile again. Because she's dead. And we can't call her.\u00a0 Me: That's right, Peaches.\u00a0 Peaches: Mommy, how do you get dead?\u00a0 Wow. I had no idea is was Deep Conversation Day.

I miss baby showers, retirement parties, well, you know... everything. And now I am going to the EAST COAST for work at the end of June. I need to spend at least three nights in D.C. for a conference, plus the travel days... And I can't decide what to do. Choice 1 I can go with just my coworker, who happens to be a dear friend. While there, I can try as hard as possible to meet up with long lost friends and dear old college buddies who live in the area. It'll be fun. For J and the kids, it will be a monumental struggle, and I'll be worried about them. I've gone away twice before. The first time, J forgot to pick them up at daycare for over an hour and was charged $400, among other snafus. The second time, they all got stomach flu and relied heavily on my  inlaws  for physical and mental relief. Choice 2 I can bring J and the kids along this time and make a vacation out of it too. My mom and  stepdad , who live about 5 hours south, can meet us there, as it has been WAY too long between visits, and this way we won't have to fly to see them, which is more than double as hard (two more expensive flights with a long layover in between, followed by an hour drive across the state line). My mom and  stepdad  can help J out with the kids while my coworker and I attend the conference during the day, and we can all hang out each evening. But we'll miss a couple days of therapies, and we'll have to travel with the challenges of the ism... searching for  gfcf  foods, dealing with time change, sleep challenges, etc. I am torn. Mostly, I want all of us to go, but I also remember how hard it was when we did it two years ago. And yet I don't want to be \"grounded\" forever by autism. The Rooster has grown so much since then, and he would probably have fun on his travels... On the other hand, the whole thing sounds crazy. I guess the third choice would be to tell work that I just can't go. But D.C. is my favorite place, filled with people I want to see, and this is the most important conference for people in my position. I'm so conflicted. I know there are way bigger and more important problems, and you are all busy, but I feel like I've gotta toss it out there just in case: Anyone have wisdom for me?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/to-capitalize-or-not.html", "title": "\nTo Capitalize or Not\n"},

But yet I have stuff I need to say... so I'm settling for bullets. (The harmless kind.) * Send good thoughts to my inlaws, and the other 35,000 folks with homes in danger in the Santa Barbara area.

What, you don't know the vocal talents of this enthralling wonder? Oy, how I miss my NPR... but I digress. He has this cd he loves with hokey songs with moral messages, singing praises to Rosa Parks and why it's great to different and all, and since it makes him happy and teaches him something valuable, I can endure. But there's nothing my little scripty boy likes better than to toss a lyric at you when you least expect it. Yesterday, I reached my limit of patience (before most of you even woke up!) and starting grumbling and getting a little up in his face. Nonplussed, Rooster got even closer to my face and laid a little Glockenspiel wisdom down on me, not quite singing as he said: \"You're gonna get hit by your KAR-MA, and that ain't good!\" * We made the trek to the developmental pediatrician's office today (we = the two kids and me) and when Peaches heard we were going to \"the doctor,\" she said, \"So you won't be mad anymore?\" Yes, I'm working on signing up for anger management classes, Peeps... it's on the to do list. In chapter 66. Or 666. Or something. * Rooster and Peaches each made me Mother's Day gifts in their classes. They both enjoyed the very much. I didn't get a bite, a sniff, or to read a word, but they tell me they were delicious, beautiful, and heartfelt, thank them very much. Someone needs to explain that all presents in the whole world are not just for them, but I am not up to it just yet. * I bought the tix. The Rooster Clan heads East in June. We're renting a house so that my mom and stepdad can hang with J and the kids while I'm at my conference in D.C. I've nearly broken down just thinking about how crazy we are to try this. So crazy that the developmental pediatrician, who has no idea I'm dumb enough to try to travel with my brood, hugged me during our visit, watching my two kids destroy her office, and said, \"I do not know how you do it. We have got to get you some help. I'm going to be researching some this weekend. You guys need the right meds, and I'm not stopping till I find them, and you need some babysitters, and some respite. These two are ....\" She never found a word. During our visit she did make a few references to zoo animals though.

I was ten,  angst-ridden , angry, depressed. It turned out to be a big improvement over actually having him, a raging alcoholic, raise us, but it didn't seem like much bright side at the time in those years of slow regrouping. Then, in my twenties, came the second depression, when I married under duress and quickly annulled it. The man I'd trusted for five years confessed his cheating ways two nights before our scheduled wedding, ripping off some serious scabs and making me question my judgment, my past, my future. Thank goodness it didn't work out, because then I met J, and found out what it means to fall in love and build a solid relationship, but first I had to lick some gnarly wounds in those years of slow regrouping. It was then that I wrote a poem that I reread often. It's not a good poem, it's melodramatic and adolescent, but it reminds me now, in this, my third crisis, that as hard as things get, these things I have now comprised my hopes and dreams. I have what I wanted. I have it PLUS  autism , but which is bigger, autism or me? I read this poem, and I can pull myself back from the precipice a millimeter or two, and try to accept my third phase of slow regrouping. Forgive the bad poetry, but here it is, my reminder of the power of words, reflection, hopes, dreams, and self talk, in the journey and quest for more joy: Journey (circa 1997?) before I go there will be more pain I know there will be more pain before I go others will go first taking pieces of me                pieces I need                               pieces I cherish they will leave me aching they will leave me to pay the steep fare for their journey away from me before I go there will be more pain pains that sear, burn, sting, throb pains that shoot                and spread                               and torture my fragile flesh pains that humiliate before I go there will be more pain goings and comings and  sunderings lovers that leave and friendships that fade and longings unfulfilled before I go there will be more pain I will stand alone and I will stumble I will err and I will wrong and I will change, and not always for the better before I go and that is certain but will there be more joy before I go? will there be wedding days                and sacred vows                               and unconditional love both given and received? will there be babies                healthy, strong and mine all mine                               to raise and love and teach and tickle? will there be snapshots taken and scrapbooks filled and will there be more joy? before I go\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/they-come-in-threes.html", "title": "\nThey Come in Threes?\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 23, 2009", "body": "\nDon't read this one. We all have our own lists and I should just shut up. I have no idea why putting this out there serves as my only chance for a release valve, but it does, and it is, and so I write: Today I needed to sort out 600 scattered  jpegs  for 60 sixth graders behind on an important project. Today I needed to interview 120 students on my new video equipment to create a digital thank you for a major recording star, who happened to drop into my classroom during the production. Today I  needed to shoot bits and edit a short segment for our school community service organization; this involved first graders dressed like sea cucumbers, and little boys wearing robot masks. Today the fifth grade needed my help with their research projects, now into the crucial publishing phase after working diligently with my support on developing inferential questions, conducting research in the library as well as online and via interviews, note taking, and citing sources. But today was the rooster's first day back to school in a while, and he's on antibiotics, and, as I think you will recall, I had zero (zip, zilch,  nada ) hope of him making through an entire day, but I hoped upon hope I'd at least have the bulk of it, including the tribute to the singing star, under my belt before he got bounced out of school. I finished the 120 interviews, along with a little of this, a little of that, and none of the time I'd hoped to have for the fifth grade, by 2:40. At 2:45 I got the call. \"Our boy hit his friend.\" To be more accurate, my boy hit the child of the woman who wanted him expelled when he spit at her a couple months back; their last name is one I expect many of you would know, and while you should never, ever hit anyone, I do wish my son would especially and immediately stop hitting people with foundations named for them who donate impressively to the school and who have lost their patience (perhaps justifiably) with his aggression. \"I'll be right there.\" I gathered him up, tried to have something akin to a useful conversation about hands not being for hitting, arranged by fantastic luck to have his amazing occasional sitter pick him up, and managed to make some headway on the  jpegs  and the sea cucumbers before picking up Peaches to head back home by way of the grocery store. Tomorrow I have a half day to try to catch up on the outstanding business of today, as school closes at NOON. That means that if the rooster can hold it together for four hours, I need to straighten out only a few hundred  jpegs  and put the trickiest-to-edit parts into the community service video to show Monday. I won't be able to begin to edit the 120 thank yous, though, because while I have all this to carry forward from today, tomorrow's own agenda includes a meeting with my boss, giving a stern  cyber -bullying talk to some precocious fourth graders, turning in overdue time sheets, and filling out some neglected  POs  by noon. As the week draws to a close, my outstanding rooster business also includes the OT form that I need to fax to the school district, the arrangements for a summer camp shadow, the ABA log, and ABA tomorrow night. But the thing is that I don't know if the rooster CAN manage for a few hours tomorrow. It's all piling up, it's all toppling backward on us, we're all drowning. If I get the call tomorrow before noon, there is no place to move everything to on subsequent calendar pages... next week at work starts the slippery slide to Open House, graduation, summer programs... Next week in the land of  roostery  autism includes twice to OT, four nights of ABA, a full functional re- eval , observation by the inclusion specialist, a visit from the  Pre -K- Itinerant  Teacher, restocking the  gfcf  cupboards, and the slippery slope to his fifth birthday, new blood work, and an increased ABA schedule. My mother wants to know when we can come for a visit. It's just 2 flights and a 70 mile drive to get to her house 3,000 miles away. They have never heard of  gfcf  in my hometown, where a good many meals come with a side of biscuits, and my mother drives an hour across the state line to get to a decent grocery store. I really, really, really want to go. I want my mommy. And my stepdad. But at the end of the 10 travel hours with my children, I will need to be hospitalized. There is some worse stuff I haven't been writing about too because it's just too much, and it feels disloyal. We all have stuff like that, too, don't we? I would like to find Saddam Hussein's old cave and make it my own. I hope nobody read this. But I do feel a few pounds lighter.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/venting-for-sanity.html", "title": "\nVenting for Sanity\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 22, 2009", "body": "\nBright  Siders , please skip ahead. I'll put ** where you should look for my attempts at a positive focus. Those with a high tolerance for my pity partying ways, you just stick with me right here, okay? Because I'm going to give an honest answer to, \"How are you?\" And anyone with any standards at all would be sorry they asked. Well, I opened my mouth last week and said the rooster made it through a week at school. So far this week, he's made it through a half a day. He had a bad cold, maybe infection, as he has for about 4 out of the last 5 years. Teachers attribute his chaotic behavior yesterday to not feeling well (though I think maybe AUTISM had a wee bit to do with it) and so I schlepped him off to the  gajillionth  doctor on the hottest day of the year at about noon in a building being repossessed -- er, renovated? -- to look like a third world country currently with no nearby parking, though they tell me that these are just early days in a chic new look and efficient layout, and in order to take the only appointment they had to offer at this beacon of cutting edge medicine, rooster missed nap, ate lunch in the car, and nearly drove the office staff to self medicate. He screamed, spit, threw tows, rolled around on the floor under the doctor's chair, ran up and down the hall, and made animal sounds. The doc \" hmmmmmeedd \" and \" Reeeeealllyy ?ed\" and said, as I've heard countless times, \"I think he just has a cold, blah blah, surprised that he stays so runny and gross, blah blah, should run more tests, blah blah, immunity issues, blah blah, here's another antibiotic, blah blah.\" I reminded him that the teachers think the rooster gets crazy when he's sick, but I think he gets crazy on antibiotics, but I agreed to a 10 day dose of  amoxicillan , AGAIN. He's been  perseverative  and barely tolerable -- though I love him dearly -- ever since. My nerves can not take much more of his most stuck record, the current story he tells about mommy on the red carpet with the fancy red dress and the cameras clicking and getting the trophy... the kid seems to think I am  Miley  Cyrus, and I can assure you emphatically that I am not. Whenever I try to redirect the conversation, he wails, falls to the floor, flails angrily. I finally distracted him for a while by pretending to be a cat. It was no better, but it was different, and for a few minutes, kept me less insane. Then he started pouncing on me with a stuffed mouse and some nasty old string and repeatedly insisting I meow, and I wanted to be  Miley  again. I missed a half day of work Monday, then my husband missed a full day, then we paid a fortune to a sitter today, missing OT and ABA, and the one upside of all this should have been that I could have expected no calls during my work day to deal with the rooster's issues, but alas, no. The inclusion specialist showed up unexpectedly to observe the boy, and so I had to go meet with her and talk about the potential for him to be fully included in general ed with an aide to help him -- or not. It was not an uplifting conversation. When she said, in a fully appropriate context, \"He'll always be autistic,\" this should have been a no-duh for me, and especially since I'd set myself up for it, and I know it so well that I've said it myself. Instead, well....yeah. It's not the end of the world, but some days it feels like the end of my sanity. After this epic year, I still come back to the place of struggling with what the diagnosis MEANS, its size and shape, its impact on our tattered ragtag family. Tomorrow the rooster returns to school. His nose is less green, but that's about it. I have NO (none,  nada , zip, zero, zilch) hope any of us will have a good day. But I am helping with a high stakes project at work, and so my fingers are crossed that when the storm rolls in, I'll have some of that work under my belt. What a pathetic wreck I am, holy cow. A wreck. If this were a job, I'd quit. Military, I'd go  awol . Marriage, I'd file papers. This is my son, my baby, my boy, my first-born, my  roo . I'm in. I'm in for the long haul. The haul feels long. **Welcome, friends craving something, anything more positive and less wallowing from me. The weather in  SoCal  this week nearly weakened my knees. The morning broke so gloriously here that I almost ate some of my LA-blasting words. On days like today, my father-in-law says he can feel the housing prices start to come back up. A few months ago I became convinced my daughter could read my mind. I told J, who mocked me. That's okay. I don't need converts to what I know is true! Peaches and I were alone in the car yesterday, and she had on the cutest little outfit. I let her wear her new  dressup   peeptoe  pumps, and as I drove, in my  Keds , I kept thinking how much my grandma would adore seeing her, would revel in her  girly  ways, and what fun they would have trying on clothes and primping and such. I miss my grandma, I feel her loss so acutely when I look at Peaches. I wanted to think about something else, because I felt my eyes starting to sting, so I looked in the  rearview  mirror and asked, \"Hey, Peaches,  watcha   thinkin '?\" She said, \"I'm thinking about princesses. And you are thinking about Grandma.\" More of you have expressed a willingness to collaborate on my new project idea, and while I might not bring it up again here for a bit, I have plans underway to start laying some groundwork. Hurray! Yes, I'll take ALL the input I can get, from all of you, with huge thanks! Putting together stories for people desperate for community, support, encouragement, a good laugh, some hope... that sounds so beautiful to me. I always wanted to do Habitat for Humanity, but my awesome college  roomie  will tell you I blink every time a hammer hits a nail, and I'm a danger to myself and others around tools, power or otherwise. But I can help create a shelter for people who need it by using words, and I look forward to it. I tasted a cake so good last week, after one bite I sighed like I was on my honeymoon and declared, \"I'd like to change my address to this cake.\" This week, I decided no more cake, and I'm walking the straight and narrow... those ten pounds I never lost of baby weight? Well, Peaches is not a baby any more. She's three. Three... that's the same number of pounds I dropped this week. Seven more to go. Well, just writing this helped me a little tonight. When I sat down, I was a foul-mouthed, bitter, shrewish monster full of seething and  wahwah , and now I'm just tired and wretched ... a big step up. Thanks for reading this. You are a saint, you know. And I still have a few minutes left to play  FB  games before I crater, and the night time waking tortures can begin...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-am-i.html", "title": "\nHow Am I?\n"},

Maybe in my house, until my husband starts a blog of his own. But this week one thing feels positive to me. Amid sinus infections, hours up with a child throwing up,  heart wrenching  headlines, expensive errors, impending  IEPs , a thousand variables in summer planning, work stress, concern for friends, and hurt feelings, one thing has me energized, motivated, dare I say optimistic? No, the yoga class my amazing friend talked me into (thanks, S) was simply divine, and I still can't believe I managed to go, but that's not it. No, getting back to healthier eating and seeing hints of the benefits feels good, but that's not it. No, I am fascinated by the B vitamin information I've learned, but that's not it. No, it's amazing that the rooster might get to attend camp for free for two weeks as as special needs son of a Jewish mom, but that's not it.

Or emailed me? Or  FB  shouted out? Let's do it. P, of course I'd love your help! There are seven of us, I believe, who feel like contributing something, whether it's writing or brainstorming or proofing.

We could meet in a video conference? Or someone could just tell me how to start? Because I'm ready to start. Someone just tell me how.

Or tell me if we're on the same page? My \"vision\" or \"mission\" or \"seed\" or \"concept\" is this: Create a book for parents facing a new diagnosis that tells the story of so many of our experiences: We were scared, we blogged, we connected, it helped us, and now we can share what we did/learned/tried as we encourage you to add your voice and find your own unique way. The \"chapters\" or topics I keep contemplating: Diagnosis experiences Blogging/writing/self expression Family Life /  Marriage  / Divorce / Siblings / Extended Family IEPs  / School Therapies / Medication Autism conflicts/ philosophies/the big why?  Friendship Birthday Parties Emotions/Acceptance Having a sense of humor Community Some of the big questions in my mind:  Is it simply a putting together of posted blogs? Or is there a narrative  throughline ? I really think I envision a narrative organizer... What work serves as a good model?  How do the comments fit into the story? Is there an interesting way to focus on them?  How do we work collaboratively?  all that  legalish , businesslike stuff... so NOT my forte I hope those of you who said you're in read this and don't feel like tiptoeing backward while I ramble...

When we reached the verge of the rooster's diagnosis, I scoured the book stores, Google, Amazon, trying to find a family that resembled ours. Naturally, no family does, and yet many families do. And that, right there, what I just said, I think has the makings of an important point -- one that makes me think I might write a memoir. And: SO SHOULD YOU. If you want to. Yeah, so actually I guess those of us who blog already have. That's true. Here it is. We are telling our stories as they unfold. Those of you whose blogs I read? Now, talk about a \"spectrum.\" Some of you tell your tales with such writerliness that I am awed, and some of you are so funny I snort, and most of you are so much NICER than I am. But here is the part I keep thinking about. How do our stories all relate? Maybe we need to put them all together. Maybe we need to write a communal book, and show lots of other families that our family looks exactly like theirs, and nothing at all like theirs, and that they too are part of our family, and that we want to share this thing with feathers? (And maybe we'd each make a buck? Get some respite and have a potluck?) Or not. I'm tired. Things are hard. I'm aging. Maybe none of this makes any sense at all. Clearly my judgment lapsed grossly today, as I posted a current photo of my wrecked self on Facebook and didn't even make any self-deprecating comments, letting everyone have their own fun in the privacy of their own homes. (I can hear it now, \"Honey, look. Do the bags under my eyes look as bad as HERS do? Wowww, concealer anyone?\") But, just for kicks, I've been wondering what the opening line of a book about the autism blogosphere community I inhabit would look like, how it would start, what would be the through lines, the organization, the first line. Perhaps if I tried to write a book, it might start something like, \"When we reached the verge of the rooster's diagnosis, I scoured the book stores, Google, Amazon, trying to find a family that resembled ours. Naturally, no family does, and yet many families do.\" What do you think? Want to throw out a good line? Want to toss in a story? Suggest a narrative arc?

I am cheering on countless walkers for numerous good causes, I am there in spirit for my school's Big Sunday work service day, I send my regrets to the birthday celebrants, and I'm probably dropping out of the amazing online post graduate program I deferred last year in the hopes life would --- HA!

When I approached, children 12 and under stood in a semicircle blocking my path, but why would I want to keep walking? They sang Hope is a Thing with Feathers, and my eyes filled with tears. They were not there to sing to me, but of course they were. I wish I could share it with all of you. Beauty and joy.

{"date": "Thursday, April 16, 2009", "body": "\nUsually when I write, as when I read, I like specifics. Details create the movie in my head that makes everything so tangible, so familiar. Forgive me if I'm scant on details today -- I'm trying not to out anyone, and I'm not feeling too  writerly  at the moment. Today is more about processing an epiphany than setting a scene. I've been enjoying work lately because I've been inventing, thinking, crafting... mental  Pilates , and at work my core feels tight, you know? I'm so much stronger at work than home. My job is about teaching learning, teaching teaching, learning teaching, learning learning... my job is about what it means to interact with people and information. The students I teach are not \"mine,\" as I don't have classes per  se , but I work with everyone on a project-by-project basis, alongside the classroom teachers.  Lately I've been particularly enjoying a project with kids that involves all that good stuff, and I've watched their eyes shoot fireworks when things connected, and I've worked hard to cast a critical glance at my own self when I things didn't so that I could improve the project. One student raised his hand and struggled to find the patience to wait for me to come over and listen to a question. The question began, \"What if... what if... what if... what... what... um... what if ... what if...\" The same student showed great articulation earlier, and, following the bout of impatience I had just seen, I assumed I was being joked with when I heard the stammer. I felt a little annoyed, and I sighed. Finally we got down to the question -- a really, really good question -- and I tossed back more questions to prompt a dialogue. We volleyed questions and ideas until we were both talking faster and faster, and we were both smiling. I told a classroom teacher, \"Wow, I really enjoyed chatting with that child about the project.\" What the teacher said next reminded me of the student's name. A giant AHA moment flashed through my brain!!!!! I had heard of this student before. I had heard a name referenced, in fact, way back, and it was associated with less familiar things back then. Wait! I wanted to back up, start all over. I wanted to replay the entire exchange we'd had, I wanted to NOT sigh about the long stammering moment, I wanted to remember exactly how much eye contact we'd had... I wanted to hug this student, who I know struggled once in noticeable ways, who I know \"speaks a little French,\" who asks great questions, who charmed me today, who I get to work with again more this week, and who proved I am not,  after all , entirely hopeless when I think about my own child and school. You cannot compare people, we're all snowflakes, but a kindred soul is something you can't help but recognize. There was more like that at school today -- more examples of kids who overcame things, found good doctors or medication or outlets or whatever -- and this is a very high achieving school.  I often get so buried in my own quagmire I forget that EVERYWHERE people have challenges, and that you can find stories of overcoming obstacles. Today, I was teaching and learning, and so were the children. Today I was able to finally hear those of you who have been telling me that the rooster has time still, that who he is at age five is not necessarily who he's going to be forever, that some of you have seen your kids improve by hundreds of miles from where they were in preschool. I am still thinking about what a learning day it was.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/schooled.html", "title": "\nSchooled\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 12, 2009", "body": "\nI recently listened to the incomparable Sandra  Cisneros  on the radio reading from her groundbreaking work The House on Mango Street, celebrating its birthday (was it 30 years? and how can that be?). I've been thinking a lot lately about the piece in which she says that what no one tells you is that when you turn eleven you are also still ten and nine and eight and ... well, you know, right? I'm going to come right out and admit it. My take? What's been on my mind? Greedy stuff, and I don't try to equate myself with Sandra  Cisneros  when I say it, because that would really shameful. But here's the thing: What no one tells you is that when you are a mother, you are still a daughter, a granddaughter, a child, a needy baby. When you are a mother, you still get angry, hurt, or sullen sometimes, and you still want to cry, want someone to kiss the place that hurts to make it better, sometimes you still want to climb in bed and hug your pillow and wait until someone comes to rub your back to make it better. Now, none of those childhood comforts ever actually happened to me. I didn't have that kind of childhood. But yet since I'm still \"eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two, and one,\"  that means I'm still wanting, still yearning those childhood yearnings, even when I'm supposed to be on the other side. Sometimes my son needs me to take care of him through a very rough patch, and although he's almost five, he's also four and three and two and one (plus there's the whole autism thing), and he does things he should not do, things he ought to know better than to do, and I know it, and yet... and yet... and yet... it's so hard to find my 37 year old grownup, when I too am four and three and two and one, and it feels like through his behaviors he's torn down my towers, broken my doll, pushed me in the mud. Sometimes I feel the childish urge to push him back, to take away his toys, to call him names, to sob, \"That's not fair.\" Today, I felt so hopelessly infantile as I tried to mother, that I picked up my phone and pushed the speed dial for my own mom. It was the only childish thing I could think of to do that would cause no harm. And when her line was busy, and when I began to cry with longing for my grandmother, with wanting to be the recipient instead of the provider, I thought, surely, when there is no other choice, I will pull it together? I will age up? I will mother. I was sitting on the floor, thinking this, trying to breathe, wanting to rise. Then it hit me: I could call my husband's parents. Yes, that small I am. I did. I said, \"This is what the rooster just did, and these are the things I thought about doing, and since I know all of those things are wrong, I thought I could call you, and just talk in the space in which I might have collapsed, and this will keep me accountable, and maybe minutes will pass, and then I will be able to keep it together and be the grownup again.\" When I was ten, I needed my thick striped diary with the flimsy brassy key. I needed it to escape my home, and in it I wrote copious plans for my future. I outlined my grievances and charted my course for righting their wrongs one day. \"I will NEVER this and that... when I'M a grownup, when MY kids are sad....\" And now I'm 37, with a blog reflecting my layers of immaturity, my juvenile self- centeredness , my black-and-white and wrong-and-right, and me me me. And thank goodness at least I have it, because what might I do if I didn't? Today I'm 37, going on maybe seven or eight. Today I sat my sadness on my elbow, and watched as my street, an M street too, filled with other families hunting Easter eggs, laughing, smiling, no one fighting or worried, ten million miles away and foreign and yet just outside my window.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2009", "body": "\nAs a kid, I felt angry at my parents almost all the time. Mostly, I felt angry about their anger. So, I guess you could say I blamed them. Now that I have kids, I am angry at them most of the time. I say, in this blaming way, \"You make me so angry!\" Usually I'm angry about their fights. So, I think about that and draw a few possible conclusions. Maybe it's really not anyone else: maybe it's ME. Maybe I am an angry person, and my parents and my kids are not the problem. Or, perhaps things skip a generation. Maybe I had infuriating people above and below me on the family tree. Or, maybe we're all alike, my folks, myself, my kids. We're fighters. Or maybe I'm a wimp, and I need to suck it up, get over myself. I can accept any of those truths, because I haven't got a clue. I don't know where the anger begins and ends. I know that I feel like I'm losing my mind. I know I want it to stop. When anger makes me angry, it's the epitome of a vicious cycle. I know that autism at our house means rage. If you took the anger out of our autism equation -- if my son never screamed and howled and attacked and raged -- we wouldn't have much diagnosis left. We'd spend a lot less time in therapies. We'd have an elementary schools and summer camps willing to take us. The rooster came out of my womb pissed off, and at that moment things came full circle for me -- born into an angry family, raising an angry family. I am not my parents. My father, an alcoholic, cheated and scammed poor people, cheated and scammed my mother, defrauded the government, and ran for the border. He was a mean drunk. I don't drink, I hate cheating, I over conform to rules, I give to the poor, I do not drink. My mother was a co-dependent, self-loathing, bitter woman scorned the first 18 years I knew her. I married a kind mind whose only addictions are James Bond films and me. My parents believed in spanking to teach a lesson, and I believe that hitting your child teachers your child to hit. So why is it my home today reminds me of the home I fled growing up? It's loud, it's full of conflict, and it makes me angry. When I was a kid, everyone I knew seemed to have a nicer family than I had. Now that I have kids, everyone I know seems to have happier, sweeter children than I do. That's not a pity party talking. That's my fury. Right now, I'm seething. Seethe. Seething makes me sick.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/anger-managment.html", "title": "\nAnger Managment\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 2, 2009", "body": "\nHappy Autism Awareness Day. The happy part of my day came when I got home and opened the mail to find a \"stunning\" (this is my kids' favorite word of the week, thus the quotation marks) tie dye shirt sent to us by  Kyra  and Fluffy  at This Mom. I got so excited I yanked off the shirt Rooster had on and oohed and  aahhed  over his blue and purple shirt of love and hope and inclusion. I can't wait for tomorrow for him to wear it to school, and I sure hope people ask me about it... they will, because Fluffy did a fabulous job with his mom. Thanks, friends! Don't know about the tie dye shirt project inspired by Alex Barton? Well,  here is the low down from This Mom . Now, WHO NEEDS A SHIRT?  I need to get five in the mail asap... so comment or email me already. First come, first served... and I will need your snail mail address and size please. Another nice thing about  AAD ? While I didn't spread around as much awareness as I might, while working hard to just scrape by, people close to me reached out to share or boost their own awareness. A friend and colleague stopped by my office just to hear how things are going, and I flooded the room, and she gave me a big hug. Another friend and colleague sent me a great article about autism, filled with hope and possibility. She also sent me a link this week for great looking  gfcf  baked goods... (several of my friends have been watching our backs with these yummy leads.) The Rooster's wonderful first OT dropped me a note just to check in on \"our boy\" today, even though she hasn't worked with him in two years, and in fact isn't doing the same work at all anymore. It felt good to be reached. The rooster finally made it through a day of school this week, but by the skin of his teeth, and the grace and kindness of others. For that, I am grateful. I managed to take both kids BY MYSELF to a healthier version of a fast food restaurant for some  gfcf  dinner on the way home tonight, and we survived. We didn't go unnoticed, but we survived, and filled our stomachs. A new bulletin board went up at my school today representing multiculturalism. A mom made it with lots of pictures of our kids expressing \"hello\" in many different ways. Two glorious pictures show my boy and a sweet girl friend of his bowing to one another, all smiles. As I walked past it, two people commented on the beauty of the image. I found out today that I have more sick days left than I thought I did, and a few vacation days left too. In honor of Autism Awareness Day, since I'm  toooooooo   tireeeedddd  for advocacy, I thought I'd tell you all the good stuff I could. I want to finish with a Notable and Quotable. Nurse to Rooster: You did a great job today! What a good patient! Rooster: I'm adorable! Stuart Little (on  cd ): See that boat? I just HATE that boat over there. Peaches: That man sounds just like you, mommy. Me: Why do you say that? Peaches: Listen, he's saying mean words. Just like you say mean words. Rooster: Mommy, can I have my Easter matzoh now?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/", "http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/the-tie-dye-t-shirt-project-update/"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/autism-awareness-day.html", "title": "\nAutism Awareness Day\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 4, 2009", "body": "\nThis month, as we give extra attention to autism, I thought I'd write for those people who read this and wonder, \"What is it like having a child with autism?\" FOR US, and  I only speak for the rooster clan over here , where we have a son with high functioning autism and possibly ADHD, this is what it's like: - We've never left newborn mode in some ways. Oh, our boy has grown, and he can feed himself, do some of the dressing and undressing tasks, and talk a mile a minute when he chooses. But, just as when we brought him home from the hospital, he has a sometimes strange sleep schedule, wears diapers, and cannot be out of our sight for more than a minute or two. This last fact makes us quite weary, and even if you think you can imagine it, it would be pretty hard to do unless you have a child on the spectrum too, or unless you spent 24 hours or more in a row here. We invite you to do just that; we'll be at a Holiday Inn! :-) - Priorities shift. Educational priorities, financial priorities, scheduling priorities, personal priorities, social life, career plans, future plans... time... everything has a new slant, for us. Autism is NOT the focus of our lives, but, like our son, we never let it completely out of our sight. It's an added prism on the lense, for sure. - Sometimes I feel like we found ourselves dealing with autism at a particularly odd time,  a coming-of-age kind of awareness time of a sort. The media seems to be waking up to autism and the spectrum it encompasses, not just this month. I keep having startling brushes with the word lately. I go to throw a magazine on the recycling pile, and it falls and flips open to a story I had missed about autism. I turn on the DVR of Sesame Street and one beat before the too familiar music begins, I get the tail end of the autism commercial. It's there when I sneak a second of NPR before the kids insist on their cds; it's referenced in the parenting listserv to which I subscribe; it's the charity receiving funds from the store I shopped in today. GREAT that finally this issue, which I knew so little about before our diagnosis a year ago, finally gets important attention, which boosts support for families, education, funding, research, and more. But the attention comes with its costs, too. For one thing, I have to admit there are days I wish I could escape the word, which seems to want to take over my life at times. It's not denial I'm talking about, it's breathing room. It's balance. For another thing, all those things in the media everywhere? None of them sound like my kid. Sure, people reference the spectrum, but they tend to describe finite shades of that spectrum. Sometimes the stories are sensational, sometimes stereotypical, sometimes just narrow... I've read libraries full of stuff about autism in the last year, but only once in a while do the behaviors described feel like what I see at my house with my child. Finally, there's backlash. Certain lame comedians not worth naming use the hot topic to garner attention for themselves while exploiting vulnerable families, for instance by claiming our children don't have autism, they're just stupid. Lame, and decidedly not funny, but painful too. - Awareness. I can't believe how little awareness I had about ALL THINGS special needs before my son's diagnosis. I am a teacher, 14 years and counting. I have a Master's Degree, I am well read, I pay attention. I knew little about autism, and less about sensory processing disorders, aphasia, apraxia, DS, CP... I knew nothing about IEPs, IHHS, Regional Centers... I have learned so much. And in learning, I have grown. The awareness is one of the things I'm grateful for, along with the relationships I've forged with people whose lives and careers are about helping those with special needs. If I could do things all over again, I might have chosen OT as a career path -- though, come on, we all know I'm not coordinated or patient enough. - Defensiveness: For me, I feel the invisible shoulder pads and helmet I put on each day before venturing forth with my son. I know I'm too sensitive, and I'm likely to encounter many prickly situations throughout the day, situations where I feel compelled to repeatedly apologize, or thank profusely, or explain, or cringe. I told my husband I need a shirt that says THANK YOU on one side and I'M SO SORRY on the other so I don't lose my voice repeating myself all the time, and for those people who don't find that enough I can always use some universal sign language, if you know what I mean! But, again, I know my projections are often the problem in this scenario, and I have become less sensitive over time, as I adjust to our situaton and grow more comfortable with our family's place out in the land beyond our home... - Finally, the writing... I've written things for as long as I've known how, starting a diary as soon as I could spell the word diary, and it's been for me everything from a release to a joy to a profession, but now writing saves my sanity. It is the ONE and ONLY thing that makes me feel better when I get the autism blues. Oh, if you are thinking that sounds sad, and wonder don't my friends and family make me feel better, then maybe I need to explain the autism blues. For me, the blues come when I feel like autism gobbles up our lives and leaves me scared, lonely, afraid, desperate, lost, isolated. Then, I write. That helps me find my way back to my friends and family, helps me reconnect with my priorities... and, the best bonus in the world, it allows me to connect with the blogosphere, where people I know and people I've come to know offer me support, love, and ear, wisdom, reminders, information, love. This blog is the best medicine for what ails me. It is the ONLY thing that helps me sometimes... the writing, the connecting, the reading, the writing -- it always comes back to the writing. The writing gets me through the tough spots. The writing is something either autism gives me, or something I give myself, or a gift I rediscover because of autism... but whatever, it is the good thing, the salvation, the life boat. It's the way I breathe again, the way I release the toxins, uncurl my fists to make some room for hope. And that, my friends, is what it is like for ME, and only me, as I raise a little rooster who, among many other things, has autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/04/on-our-corner-of-spectrum.html", "title": "\nOn Our Corner of the Spectrum\n"},

Each time we have a regression of any sort, my resilience feels less and less. But each time I learn something, too. For one thing, without sounding like I've attended too many technology workshops or read too many books by \"futurists\" (which actually I think I probably have), there really is something to this concept of \"crowdsourcing\" and the wisdom of the collective intelligence. This blog is all the evidence I need. Those of you who comment and email and call: you all are a WISE crowd, and collectively you are my map and compass. And also: my boy, the rooster, is a finely wired little guy, easily short-circuited. Turns out that this week he had some food infractions we didn't know about. Yeah, AHA is right. I will say it again: I didn't believe in the GFCF idea before we tried it, I don't know why it helps the rooster, I don't believe it helps everyone, I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to do it, but it blows my mind; I am converted. For some reason, you give my kid something with gluten in it, and, shazam, coherent dialogue disappears. Ta da, nonsense words and heightened ggression show up out of nowhere. This week he was saying, \"shundundeenduh\" over and over, in a mocking tone of voice, and screaming, \"You're the MEANAGER, the MEANAGER\" as he antagonized his littel sister. It's been a long time since we've seen this, since my son could only point to tell you what he wanted, since he answered every simple question (\"What did you do today?\") with the same one word non sequitirs (\"Chanukah!\") In the last couple of days, he's jumped off the back of the sofa several hundred times, jumped onto the coffee table several thousand times, and torn apart his room several dozen times. Just as I was about to check myself into a hospital, we figured it out: those are not gfcf tortillas. Goodbye new tortillas. Hello, rooster. Now we're talking, if you know what I mean. This makes me happy and sad. Hallelujah, we're going back to our tolerable level of misery, instead of the apocolyptic level. But, man, how much does it suck that my son crumbles with something as small as freaking TORTILLAS?! How on earth will we manage to keep them from him forever? Forget forever, how about when he goes to public school in the fall, and isn't at school with me to watch out for him? Surely someone is going to give him a tortilla here or a french fry there, and HE'S not going to say, \"No thanks, that is not on my diet!\" And then also this, this so important question plaguing me: What else? what are the magic triggers we don't EVEN know about? I mean, I cannot for the life of me guess how the very first person discovered the gfcf diet, but it probably took a lot longer than the whole apple falling from the tree hypothesis, and maybe 20 years from now we're going to find out he was suffering from... I don't know... laundry detergent intolerance, or that all he needed was to sleep facing South or something... and I wish I knew all the answers now, all the solutions to help my boy, all the magic and good mojo and voodoo and all of that, because what if he feels as trapped by all this misbehavior as we do? Wow, I realize all that sounds like I think he's lost and needs a cure and all that, and as I've said before, that is not my take on autism. Really I'm not talking about fixing the rooster. I'm talking about removing the things that hurt him, because I am here without any scientific credntials to tell you that gluten and casein turn him into a tempestuous, tantrum throwing wreck, and I think he hates it almost as much as we do.

{"date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "body": "\nDo all autism moms get asked if they think of themselves as a Mother Warrior? I've been asked a few times, and I always find myself first experiencing an unwillingness to enter the fray. I don't really care about all the political drama, I just care about my son, and about the struggle of all families like ours. Why should I have to take sides? But once I get past my discomfort with the question, with the controversy, the answer bubbles to the surface each time: No, for me, \"warrior\" does not resonate. This is not a political statement I'm making, this is me putting maybe too much stock in words, but needing to find just the right meaning if I'm going to describe my job as Rooster's mom in a metaphor. I am not about war. Without sounding like I'm going to break into song or anything, what I've been searching for is peace -- for my child, for our family, for families like ours. I read today someone who said that we are all on a spectrum of autism -- no one is entirely without some of the traits that qualify someone for the diagnosis. That did resonate for me. I don't want to war with the parts of my son that are autistic. I want to help him make peace with himself and the world. That is hard, because my son is a fighter. But I don't want to be that kind of fighter. Yes, we try biomedical interventions, and medical interventions. We aren't looking for a \"cure,\" I am looking for peace. Our whole family needs more peace, less war; more hugging, less fighting. I admire warriors, both in the literal sense and in the autism metaphor. I admire people willing to fight for their country, their beliefs, or their values, when fighting is necessary. I'm Jewish -- surely in WWII I would have been a warrior. Perhaps if I couldn't reach my son at all I'd be at war with what kept us apart. He is a willful, challenging little boy, but he is right here, with us, and I connect with him every day with love. So I'm not at war here at Rooster Calls. But I am out in a field of land mines. I do like metaphors. And so I decided that before I could write about why I'm not a warrior, I had to find the metaphor that fits for me. And I have. And I'll tell you what I am... will you return the favor and tell me what you are? (My pal Kia would call this your homework, but I'm a teacher and I find that word kind of a downer, so I'll call it your mission, should you choose to accept it.) I'd love some comments about your metaphors. As lame as it might sound, I think of myself as Sherpa. Sure, laugh. Autism Sherpa would never sell a book, I know it. But for me the metaphor means that I have to navigate difficult terrain with the responsibility of getting my party safely to a remote destination, and few others are qualified to carry the load against such natural and unnatural barriers along the way. I chart our courses, pack our loads, set a pace, and haul a**. I encourage the team to keep up, and I try to keep us all together. The thing is that real Sherpa have done it many times, guiding their charges up Mount Everest. I have never done this autism expedition before, and I don't have a great sense of direction. But all Sherpa had to start somewhere, right? I'm an Autism Sherpa novice, I guess. Many of you are my Sherpa trainers. Thanks for helping me find my way. Now, I'm looking forward to those comments...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/03/give-peace-chance.html", "title": "\nGive Peace a Chance\n"},

You might expect, for instance, pangs of remorse when I am moody or grumpy, but sometimes I can  harumph  around without a bit of guilt about it, full of myself. Today I should have felt guilty when I lied and told Peaches I would cancel her birthday party if she didn't go to bed and stay there, but instead I just felt relieved when it worked. Really, the guilt comes during happier moments. This is hard to admit. Sometimes I feel like an  impostor , and I feel happy, and I feel guilty. Today, for instance. The rooster stayed home sick, and so did his dad. Rooster is getting over a strep / sinus infection, and his dad might have an infection too -- his allergy to doctors prevents us from knowing (my diagnosis). So, Peaches and I had a RARE opportunity to go out after school, just us girls, before heading home. A kids' boutique only blocks from our house has its annual sale right now, so we hit the half price rack and scored ourselves a great pop-up princess palace for the backyard to use at her little party this weekend. We cheered when we found it, we held hands when we bought it, we chatted as we walked down the street, and she, without her brother around, behaved like the model child for many minutes. I even dared to take her afterward to a store for grownups two doors down -- a beauty supply place -- where I purchased conditioner and she flirted with the proprietor, who offered me a lollipop to give her (out of her earshot, thank goodness, as I said NO). All the while, I had this feeling Peaches and I ought to confess... \"We aren't real happy people,\" I thought we should admit, \"and our family isn't typical. We are just pretending. Don't expect we'll ever be here like this again, because we won't; the clock is about to strike twelve and we'll be pumpkins again.\" Hey, I have confessed worse things here, but I wouldn't blame you if this gave you the worst impression yet of me. My heart, my brain, and my soul don't always listen to each other. But by admitting it, I can learn from myself, work on myself. Today, I felt guilty because it was good to be just two NT  chicas  shopping at the sale rack. And I felt guilty because I was happy, and guilty because it was only a surface happy, and guilty because I'm not happier, and guilty because I waste too much time on guilt. I love my son. As is. So big. Forever. But I'm not always good at being his mom.

The content of the  unusualness  ever-changes, but you can count on each day to have its share. So today I thought I'd share a Typical (not) Day in the Life of a  Roostery  Family, tentatively subtitled Fun (not) with  HFA  in  LaLa  Land. Today we arrived at school, dropped of Peaches in her classroom, and ran across the street for OT at the public school we hope the Rooster will be able to attend in the fall if Open Enrollment and the  IEP  work out right. Our new OT person seems wonderful; he provides an additional 30 minutes on top of the hour Rooster gets from Fabulous Miss O each week. He did a great job today in spite of the Rooster seeming off to me, and I am loathe to stereotype, judge or in anyway harsh on Mr. OT. I will say, though, that he is full of character, unusual unto himself, and worthy of his own future post. He fits in fine in this tale of the Usual Unusual in  Hollyweird .  Oooh , maybe that's a better title... After crossing the street and returning the Rooster to his classroom, I paused for a moment to think of how a web site I read yesterday had described our school: Liberals with  Limousines . Now, I'm prone to balk at that stereotype, but today I had to laugh. Today my school hosted a function for a group of our kids as well as kids from a public school substantially lacking resources. The person responsible for the day was... well, I shouldn't say. I will say this: she not only rocks, but she rocked heavily in the 80s, during my teen years, and in fact could be described as an 80s rock icon. She and her people had a project idea to bring together these kids to write a song, and to have each child write a letter to our president. My job? To help with the writing lesson, assist with the technology, and shoot some photos. Good stuff. Really, if you combine writing, technology, kids, hope, change, collaboration, and community building into one soup, I'd gorge myself on it if I could. It seemed to GO. It seemed to WORK. Plus, a writer I revere came out to cover the event, and I got so flustered I couldn't get my hands to stop shaking long enough to get the lens cap off my camera. Three hours into it, I had a lunch break, and I went to check my email. The Rooster's teachers felt, too, that he was \"off.\" He had been cycling through  moods, acting out, crying, and misbehaving, and he needed to go home. I picked up the boy, confabbed with teachers, had him checked over my our excellent school nurse, and called my husband for ideas. Taking Rooster home didn't seem an ideal option yet; Peaches still was at school, taking her nap, and it's a schlep. J doesn't work too far away, so he said we should come meet him for a late lunch to figure out our next move. At lunch, the Rooster had some tummy issues. Aha, we figured. Mystery solved? A trip to the loo and some good healthy food later, he seemed better.  Sorry if that's  TMI . I loaded the Rooster back in the car planning to drive him and let him sleep it off, then pick up Peaches after nap time. We kissed my husband, and he headed back to work, trying to make a deadline.  Ten minutes later my husband calls me. Deadline,  schmedline . The skyscraper he works in needs everyone out -- as do the nearby buildings -- on orders of the Secret Service, because the president is on his way to the neighborhood. J sweetly offers to come get the Rooster to give me a few minutes to myself before I need to get Peaches. By now the Rooster is out cold, though, so I whisper our location to my husband, who comes and finds us, and we switch cars. I head to Whole Paycheck...er, Whole Foods, and get one bag of  gfcf  bounty for something in the vicinity of a C note. Queasy at the price, I head back to school for the fourth time of the day to get Peaches. My friend/soul sister tells admits that the day with rock idol culminated with an amazing singing performance by the children and the rocker, and too bad I missed it all, but thankfully someone got it all on video. This was not a bad day. In fact, I kind of liked this day, and my husband is home early, so the night doesn't stink either. I even get to blog BEFORE bed time. But I'm dizzy from it all, really. And tomorrow is lather, rinse, repeat, but most likely minus rock stars and presidents. Ah, well.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/03/typical-not.html", "title": "\nTypical? NOT.\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 16, 2009", "body": "\nQuotables: Me: Rooster, do you like your hornet shirt? Rooster: Yeah, it's cool. Do you know what letter h-h-h-hornet starts with?\" Rooster: YES! Me: What letter? Rooster: Bee! Rooster to Peaches: Peaches, do you want to be my best pal? Peaches: Yes! Do you want to be my best pal too? Rooster: OKAY! Peaches to me: When will I get blue eyes so I can look exactly like you? Teacher: Last week when I asked Peaches where the rooster was since he was not at school, she said, \"Rooster is at home with my mother's husband!\" The Good: I found more GFCF sources for \"treats.\" They don't all taste like sand, either. Maybe that is why they cost as much as an entire aisle of cookies at Costco. It made me smile to see Rooster and Peaches sharing them happily. One of my best friends bought a surprise for Peaches for her upcoming third birthday party: a fairy princess costume, in her favorite shade of pink. She's going to love it. Another of my best friends is about to adopt a baby, following many years of working toward growing her family. She expects his birth to take place April 6, and I have her and her husband in my thoughts every minute. I actually went out for a little while Saturday night, attending about 90 minutes of a wine tasting party thrown by a wonderful woman I met at a mom's group right after I had the Rooster. I almost didn't go, for many reasons (having left the group long ago, feeling out of place since I don't drink, knowing I'd get there later than everyone since I need to tuck in the kids, looking horrible with my pink eye, sounding horrible with my cough...) but I am so glad she urged me to attend. I had a lovely time talking with women about food, weddings, travel abroad, everyone's careers... lots of stuff other than kids. And when autism came up, I felt so supported and encouraged. I hope I will maintain this reestablished connection. It fed my soul. It felt like blogging, only I couldn't wear pajamas. My pink eye is nearly cleared up. My cough sounds less ominous. Tomorrow is Tuesday. The bad: Monday. You know, I think Monday sucks at our house quite differently than it does at the homes of many of our friends and neighbors. Really, I look forward to going back to work. I dread Saturdays more than Mondays in a lot of ways. And yes, I hate how that sounds, and no, I do not want to spend my time away from my children, and I adore my children. But Saturdays are bills and chores, too many cartoons, speech therapy, unstructured time, fighting, \"shoulds\", and exhaustion from the week. Sundays are often a little better, and sometimes I even like my Sundays, especially when no one goes to the ER or has pink eye or anything. Mondays suck because they are the called-on-the-carpet time for what I did not accomplish all weekend despite feeling like I worked pretty (expletive deleted) hard. Didn't buy enough gfcf groceries in my three market runs for all the necessary school lunches and snacks? UH OH. Didn't fill out the sheaf of paperwork for school for the kids? OH NO. Didn't fill up the gas tank or stop at the atm? Run on fumes and skip lunch, because the children don't tolerate extra delays on the commute. Mondays mean I carry two giant sacks of goods to school: the changes of clothes, the diapers, the wipes, the snacks, the lunches, the required backpack, the clean blanket, the clean sippy cups, and hopefully my purse. Mondays the rooster has OT before school, so either my husband or I will be late for work. Mondays the rooster's shadow usually \"doesn't feel well\" and I can expect to scramble for a sub. Mondays the rooster doesn't transition all that well so I brace for the report. Mondays my colleagues tell me about their weekend adventures and lament coming back to work, but the good news for me on Mondays is I don't miss the weekends much.  Today I spent my lunch checking out another option for a school I'd heard about. I must have misheard, though. This school is a NPA, and it offers class 8-12:30 M-F in an old, run down church building in Koreatown for $25,000 a year. That does include OT and speech. That does NOT include the fee you pay to attend the mandatory parent meetings every Wednesday from 8:45-10, to sit with other parents and a psychiatrist and observe the children on a web cam. That costs $5000 more. Yet, that adds up to $30,000, a nanny, and a s***load of time away from work, 20 minutes away. Scratch it off the list. So, that's the good, the bad, and the Monday over here.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "body": "\nLet's just say you need to work, financially speaking, and for your sanity, your insurance, your general well being. Let's say you're a teacher. Okay, now let's say you have two kids. Maybe one is on the spectrum and one not. So, your child on the spectrum tried going to the school where you work, and it didn't work out. He needs to find a place to go. Where do you send him? Do you try to send him to the highly rated public school across the street from where you work, where he can get OT and inclusion services through pull-outs? If this sounds ideal to you, geographically, bear in mind: this is not your home school district, so your child can only attend this school as a work permit child, since you work across the street, or through open enrollment, and these stipulations mean he must be in general ed in order to qualify. BUT, you seriously doubt that your child will make it in general ed kindergarten due to his behavior issues, though cognitively he might be fine. AND, let's say your child isn't potty trained yet, but he better be in the next three months if you plan for him to go to this school. If he is tossed out, it means special ed, at the school near your home, as long as they still have the space. Ah, the school near your home. Do you send him there? It is only about a mile down the road, has special day classes, and he is very unlikely to be thrown out there. You know this is what the  pre -k supervisor will offer at your  IEP . BUT, this school is very poorly rated by the state. Few of the children speak English as their first language, and your son has lots of language issues. And, let's say you have a neighbor across the street with a child on the spectrum the same age who said she would send her boy there \"over my dead body.\" This school is at least 35 minutes from your work, farther from your husband's, and you will need a nanny for after school until you get home from work. Let's say there is an amazing charter school that would be a wonderful compromise. It's an inclusion center, dedicated to a mix of typical kids and those on the spectrum. Let's say you get in on the lottery to go there, BUT while you cross your fingers for acceptance, you also doubt you could figure out how to get your child there and back safely and still work, as this dreamy school you're not even in yet is close to an hour north of work for you and your husband. Let's say they also expect lots of parent involvement at this faraway campus. Okay, I know, you think, I'd look for more options. Good! Good! Let's say you search high, low, all over. Let's say one person you respect suggests a non-public agency that they think would be a great match. It costs a minimum of $25,000 a year, and you still need the nanny for an hour or two after school. But the next highly respected person you ask about it says, \"No, I'm kind of ambivalent about that place, and I think you should look at this other place.\" Let's say that other place is one with a web site, so you look it up and this $40,000 school is for emotionally disturbed kids. Let's say you have never had a diagnosis suggested of Emotionally Disturbed for your four year old yet, and this school suggestion gets you thinking. You start asking all the  ists  and experts and people who know your child what they think of him and his school readiness. Let's say you get a very mixed bag of comments, maybe something along these lines: \"Whatever he is, it's mild. The diagnosis is autism, but it's high functioning. He's come along way. Sure he scratches kids sometimes, but four-year- olds  do that even when they are typical. He's mild!\" \"He's not going to make it in general ed. He is going to scratch a kid or two and he's going to get sent out. Then, what do you do? Back to square one, and with more transitions.\" \"I don't want to see him in a situation where he's the very best of the bunch, because we've seen he doesn't do well like that. We have seen that he does best with good models around. Look how far he's come in a mainstream setting! He needs the least restrictive environment, but one where it requires the least correction.\" \"You can't possibly send him to school on a van far away! Can you picture that? No way!\" Let's say every where you turn people suggest you get a lawyer. Let's say you and your husband talk it over, and you think you can find the money and time if necessary to get a lawyer. What exactly is it you want the lawyer to do? This is really my question. A serious one. Let's say this is your child. Let's say you are willing to do whatever it takes to get him into any of these schools, whichever is best for him. Where do you want your child to go to kindergarten? What is the right place for your verbal, affectionate, irritable, impulsive, beautiful,  immuno -challenged,  GFCF  eating, hard-to-transport, moody, sometimes aggressive, well-loved, word-salad-talking, spectrum  kindergartner ?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/03/lets-say.html", "title": "\nLet's Say\n"},

You make me angrier than his education \"plan.\" After all, at least he's hopeful, working hard to make change, and tackling big stuff (albeit misguidedly with a woefully ignorant idea about standardized testing and teacher \"rewards\"). You, on the other hand: 1. break your promises 2. dwell on the negative, showing little or no sense of perspective 3. are mean. Someone needs to put you in your place. Let's start with those promises, shall we? Perhaps you might recall early fall of 2003. I know I do. You were pregnant, and you had some spotting. You negotiated passionately with the universe: if you could just have a healthy baby, you would do ANYTHING, accept anything, work so hard... well, you got a healthy baby. Yes, maybe he grew into a child with autism, (possibly due to either choices you made -- the article on the risk of too many ultrasounds struck a nerve, no? -- or through your own genetics that you've always known to be suspect) but you have a child who can enjoy the world in his own ways. And do you try to enjoy him as much as you should? No. You got what you asked for, and you didn't live up to your end of the bargain. And do you remember the next fall? When a beautiful little girl you loved from a family you love left us all forever? And you promised to always cherish your family, to make the most of every day, to appreciate what you have? PROMISE BREAKER. I know you remember these things, but you sure don't act like it, do you, Mrs. Pity Party? This dwelling thing -- OH, don't get me STARTED. I am so FURIOUS with you. This morning your little boy woke up, came to you, and pulled you down the hall, saying, \"Mommy, come check out my room.\" You, in your typical fashion, asked what thing he'd done to his room, assuming catastrophe. Instead, when he opened his still dark room to show you the constellations all around from the two night lights he put on together for the first time ever, you had the best morning surprise ever. When he pulled you down into his bean bag chair, you should have felt enough goodness to get you through MOUNDS of crap later in the day, even the week, the month. A morning under the stars with your beautiful child should have put enough in your stamina bank at least to cancel out the calls to and from schools and ists, the kids melting down at the end of the long day, and the bumpy ride home. That is, it should have been enough for a good mom. You, however, were just MEAN, and that brings us to my third point. Since when have you EVER thought it okay to mutter under your breath negativity about your children in their presence? And do you really think it's okay to have contempt in your voice when your child struggles with potty training problems? Let me tell you this so maybe you get it, toots: He. Has. Autism. Yes, he knows how to use the toilet, but that doesn't mean you can expect him to just do it. This could take a mighty long time, and longer if you keep failing the way you did today. Autism, babe, deal with it. It is what it is. It might be someone's fault or no one's fault or society's fault, but surely, surely, surely it is not your child's fault, and when you freak out over this toilet business, it not only does not help him, it probably HURTS him. Chill OUT, and fast. Or I am going to stop being your best friend. And let's face it, you need me.

For another, I want to let everyone who reads this know how powerful it is to get a special surprise from someone you treasure. Thank you so much for being my friend, P. Today when I got home, I dragged through the door, hauling two heavy bags of kid stuff and the mail that I snatched from the box just before my kids closed the front door on my arm.

You meant it as a picnic blanket, but for us it's an everything blanket. Every time I'm sick, it's the first thing I want. When it's cozy cuddle up time with the kids, that quilt is always shared among us. The kids feel it -- that blanket is love. I must fold it a hundred times each week.

I read it aloud to J, and of course my voice cracked all over the place and I had to wipe my eyes. I don't know which part makes me feel more special and appreciative -- that your gift to me was the first thing you made on your quilting weekend, or that you said you made it just to make me smile. P, I hate that we live so far apart, and that your kids and I don't know each other. But I treasure knowing that distance doesn't change the connection I feel to you. I get sad and lonely over here, but it helps to know you are out there and you care about me.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2009", "body": "\nI am going to confess something to you, and I admit I'm worried how you will react. In fact, I play it through in my mind, imagining all the outcomes, full of fear and guilt and anxiety. Here are some reactions you have in my mind in the various scenarios I play out: A. Oh, for God's sake,  ghkcole  you are so pathetic. Get a grip. Enough already. I am taking you off my reader.  Sheeeeeeeeesh . Whine, whine, whine. You big stupid baby. B.  Ghkcole , stop being so naive. Duh. That's life. Grow up. C. I am calling social services to find a better home for your children,  missy . They deserve better. I could do better for them with my blog tied behind my back. D. Welcome to my world. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair, you know. Come walk a mile in my shoes and you'll learn a thing or two, dummy. E. Oh, well, we knew that already. I mean, that much is obvious. Next? F. For a while, I liked you,  ghkcole . I thought I could relate. But you know what? I am nothing like you, and I'm really glad. Okay, before I am consumed by this imagining, I need to be done with it and get it off my chest. The thing is this: I really don't enjoy my children these days. I love them, deeply, every second, and I think I show that, but I'm not having fun with their childhood. I spend large swaths of time wishing to get to the next thing, futilely. I adored my newborns. And then I couldn't wait until we got some sleep. I'm still waiting. I thought I'd feel better, happier, if we could get them to play together and entertain each other sometimes for a bit. Still waiting. I thought I'd find everything a little less arduous when they got potty trained. Still waiting. I thought maybe when either of them could be trusted to play out of site of us, say in the next room, then I could enjoy some one-on-one time with the other. Still waiting. So I still spend every minute of time that I am with them in constant, endless, management, trying to please, appease, predict, prevent, mitigate, comfort, heal, beg, urge, endure. And I don't like it. Most of my life feels like one giant chore. Carefree fun and special conversations and endearing moments don't come along nearly the way I'd expected. I'm not finding their childhood any more pleasant than my own, which totally sucked. I hate that this is true, and I know you think I suck and that I'm doing it all wrong, seeing it all wrong. I watched two moms with one year  olds  talking in the hall today. They looked how I never have. They knowingly held their happy babes while managing a complex conversation with one another. I've spent five years in fight or flight mode, and now I look back and can't figure what I missed or how I missed it, and even sadder I realize I'd probably be willing to miss a bit more if we could just fast forward to a time, if there ever could be one, when my kids are still kids and I enjoy them both. So, which letter are you feeling toward my confessional? I expect some people will feel as disgusted toward me as they are to that bachelor guy who asked for his ring back.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-confess.html", "title": "\nI Confess\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 2, 2009", "body": "\nWhen the Rooster was only a few months old, one day I suddenly realized he kept looking to one side. When it dawned on me that he refused to turn his head in the other direction, the alarm bells in my head nearly made me drop him. WHAT? Just one word... countless implications. WHAT? WHAT? I ran frantically around the house as that word spun this way and that through my head. The pediatrician saw us and told me not to worry about the new word in our vocabulary:  torticollis . He told me, No Big Deal. I wish I had fired him then and there. Instead, I tried to believe him when he told me that physical therapy for babies was a racket, a waste of time and money, and that we could help our baby all by ourselves. When I came to my senses and listened to my intuition a few weeks later, the rooster began therapy for the first time, and we began our very long journey toward the kind of help our boy really needs. We have moved twice since then, and changed resource providers and had a  jillion   ists , but sometimes I wonder if those early helpers suspected what we now know. What I want to write about tonight is how good it is to get the RIGHT help for your kid. When it fits, you feel it. When it doesn't, you feel the absence, the void, the lack. One thing I KNOW for sure from firsthand experience: one good physical therapist or occupational therapist does more good for our son than a hundred of our first pediatrician. We have had many good therapists, and we watch with our own eyes as they help our son grow, change, develop, improve. Every Monday since the school year started, the rooster goes to OT in one of our district's large therapy rooms. For many months now, he has worked with Miss O. When I first met her, she was just  ist  number 96 to me, and I wouldn't have minded if she smiled occasionally. J and I took turns taking the rooster to all his appointments, and often OT fell on J's turns, while I ended up more often at the pediatrician appointments or the developmental pediatrician's office. I asked J, \"How do you think the rooster is doing in OT with Miss O?\" He said, \"She's STRICT.\" I often think of that word more positively than J does, I being the teacher, and J being somewhat allergic to authority. But I took the rooster to OT one day and found myself thinking, \"She is so hard on him! She doesn't understand how hard it is for the rooster.\" Well, of course she did. She is an OT. She knows exactly how hard it is for him. She knows so much more than I gave her credit for, and I have been thinking a lot about this. I think the reason I didn't give her more credit is because at first I assumed she didn't have kids of her own. Miss O has quite the baby face. I would kill to look as much younger than I am as Miss O does; I found out recently that she has a child of her own, and that if anyone underestimated another person's challenges, then I am the guilty one. Miss O has a baby born with special needs, too. Maybe it's completely unfair of me, but it definitely increases my trust of her and how she works with my son. I want Miss  O's  daughter to gain strength and be well and succeed, and I wish she had not been handed the challenges she has, but she definitely has the right mama. Because Miss O  IS  strict. She doesn't have a ready smile, she demands compliance, she gives consequences, and she sets high goals. If it's hard? Good. Do it again. If a little boy whines or shouts, she stares him down, frowns and says, \"Excuse me, that's not okay,\" and that little boy gets redirection with a firm hand, and time outs as needed. But you know what? Miss O got the rooster to put on his own shoes. Miss O got the rooster to cut paper in a straight line. Miss O convinced the rooster he'd be able to climb. Miss O helped us realize the problems that the rooster's flat feet caused. Miss O looked over the rooster's  IEP  and realized we didn't get certain hours we'd be promised, and she made it happen. Miss O made sure we could extend the rooster's hours when he needed more. And when the rooster managed to get his shoes and his socks on all by himself today? She did indeed smile. I am bothered by my bias toward doctors and  ists  with kids, especially toward people with special needs kids, and I want to work hard to remember that everyone has a story... everyone brings something to the table... But at the same time, knowing that Miss O has taken her seat on both sides of the  ist  desk gives me a sense of confidence in her empathy, a feeling of kinship, and less of that bitter reflex to say, \"You don't know what it's like...\" I've written many times about my fantasy dinner party attended by the special needs  blogosphere  mamas who inspire and support me, and now that it seems some version might really become a reality sometime, I have embellished the fantasy in my mind, and I've added a seat at the table for Miss O. I will lift my glass to her and thank her for being strict and for helping my rooster. Then I'll try to talk her into writing her very own blog. You will love her. She has a really beautiful smile, even if she does save it up for special occasions.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/03/ists.html", "title": "\nIsts\n"},

Life is complicated. The author, despite how it might seem, does NOT watch much TV, and realizes that television does not represent real family life. Or real anything. *** I grew up, like a lot of people, watching The Brady Bunch, wishing I could move right in and have Alice bake me some cookies after school. But if I could have climbed in my television and walked away from my real life forever, I probably would have chosen Little House on the Prairie for my new home. Sure, you're thinking I'd have been dead in ten minutes with my \"constitution\" in the days before Urgent Care, but I'm not here to write about REALISM today. If Michael Landon had called me Half Pint, I thought I could have died happy. Although I'm not on the spectrum myself, like my son I sometimes \"scripted\" from television growing up, because I hoped in vain that the happy endings would unfold if only I cried, \"Oh! My nose!\" With my alcoholic father, depressed mother, and aggressive brother, and with more than my share of dysfunction all around me, you can't blame a girl for trying. These were my elementary school years, and during that time my father fled the country with the Feds on his tail. I imagined that if I could just re-cast my life, things would work out so much better. My teen years found me parked in front of Roseanne. I shared the angst. Darlene felt like a kindred soul. The ubiquitous hostility at the Connors house felt familiar to me, and I felt we - the Connors and I - had a shared knowledge that the Bradys were full of crap. Still, I liked how you could tell that the parents really loved each other, and that they loved their kids, and so I could laugh, cry, and aspire to meeting a Dan one day if not Pa Ingalls. Up until Roseanne jumped the shark with the whole lottery-winning-it's-all-a-dream fiasco, I felt like Roseanne looked like a reality tv show, and I would have gladly cast myself as the lone Jewish Connor if they would have had me. Okay, so fast forward to my adulthood, and I meet my husband. Whoa, hold the phone! Better than TV! This guy? He could be Father Knows Best or something. And I told him I'd marry him if we could make a family together, because I just KNEW with his gentleness and my insightfulness.... yeah, right, I know... are you cracking up? Ta-Da. Fire me as casting agent, I just realized that maybe the problem is me. Sure, my kids aren't perfect, but it turns out that even if you give me EXACTLY what I asked for (amazing husband, interesting career, home, two kids, no alcoholism), I still live in a house with shouting, grumpiness, depression, and aggression. I am not Florence Henderson. I find this realization of the obvious rather upsetting.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/02/getting-with-program.html", "title": "\nGetting With the Program\n"},

What are the 10 things: You are seen as You are supposed to be You are afraid of becoming You Are. His observation, which I have been pondering, is this: The first and last two lists make you unique. If you handed your seen as and are lists to the person on your left who knows you well, they should recognize you. The middle lists, what we think we are supposed to be, and what we are afraid of becoming, are universal. Pass them to your right and the person who reads them will shout, \"Me, too!\" What does that say about us? That we are all unique in spite of our universal fears of inadequacy?

{"date": "Thursday, February 26, 2009", "body": "\nFebruary 20th marked a year of blogging for me, and I accidentally missed it. I take that as a sign of improvement, don't you? When I started this blog, writing in it sustained me in a way that nothing else could. I came to blogging as soon as I realized, through reading so many other blogs by mothers of kids with autism, that I belong here. (Of course, it's the club you don't want to join, right?) Uncertainty had come from doctors, evaluations, conversations, books... many denied my fears and no one could tell me what the deep concerns I felt meant, or where to begin helping my little boy. Luckily, when I sought information online, I found more than just information, more than just commonality. I found help. Love. Reassurance. Hope. HUMOR. Friends. Attitude. Engergy. Belief. Comfort. Home. I found, among so many other, MOM-NOS, Gretchen, Nik's mom... I found a writer and artisan mama at Monkey and Me who I haven't heard from in a while, but still think of often... I found mom and expert Jordan, I found anecdotes and resources... and I told my husband, \"See? Hear? This? Them? Us? I think the Rooster does have autism. And I'm scared. But look. I think these people can help us and guide us and have some answers and ideas and help and support...\" The year has been hard. Harder than steel and rocks and diamonds and my head. The year has hurt. More than broken bones and child birth and stomach flu and needles all at once. The year has been busy. Busier than subways and stimulus planning and the 405 freeway at rush hour. The year has been complicated, worse than astrophysics and my tax forms and that guy I dated a long time ago and billion piece puzzles. I freely admit, as always, that I drink too often from the pity party fountain, and I own wholeheartedly that while I have two of the poorest behaved kids (and one we believe to be NT) in the greater metropolis (if not the cosmos), things could be worse. And, I concede there might be some truth to my husband's assertion that I am somewhat prone to exaggeration, but only just a titch. None of these things have changed in twelve pages of the calendar. But at last the year is behind us, and despite some staggering losses, it hasn't been all bad. The rooster has made progress this year. And I have found a beautiful community. I started my blog by  Searching for the Rooster , and I admitted from the first post that maybe I was searching for myself, too. But, in a backward way, I thought I would find our twins out there, and that was how we'd find ourselves. Hah! I know - I know - we're snowflakes, aren't we? What I learned instead is that you find yourself WITHIN yourself, and you find your child by being WITH your child. Thank you for teaching me that. (Joey's mom especially helps me with this lesson all of the time, and I am so grateful for that.) When I forget in the future, will one of you please smack me? Gently? Thank you to all who stick by me. Happy Anniversary, Rooster Calls. Thanks for being my blog. Thanks for giving more than you take. Thanks for the life rope. Thanks for the friends. Thanks for the family. I am sorry for missing the anniversary, but glad to need you less desperately than I did one year ago. Here's to another year of growth and learning, for the Rooster and for all of us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/02/happy-anniversary-to-rooster-calls.html", "title": "\nHappy Anniversary to Rooster Calls\n"},

Conversation today: Rooster: I'm annoying! Me: You're not annoying,  Roo . Rooster: Yes, you are. Frustration one: The first week in January I splurged and hired a personal trainer.  A cheap one -- I got a deal. It's the second week of February and I've gained two pounds. Do not dare talk to me about \"muscles versus fat.\" I'm serious. Do NOT do that. I usually publish all comments, even if I disagree, but this time I give you warning... I told my husband that first my fancy blue tooth device disappeared from my car and now my phone charger, and I suspected a crook. He scoffed, offered suggestions where I might have forgotten to have put them. Today he got in his car and his charger was gone. We have to start locking our car doors. We had stopped locking one of our cars because, really, would it be so very terrible if someone took that one? (Sorry car, you've been really great all these decades, and we do still love you.) But my blue tooth? That was practically brand new, and pricey, by my standards. (Yes, the standards of a woman who has been driving the same Saturn  SL 1 -- with manual locks and windows and a cassette player -- since 1996 might not be the same as your standards, but my blue tooth was a Razor, a really good one, and I miss it.) TMI  alert for those who want to stop here. We have a potty trained child! Alas, it's not the Rooster. Peaches, nearly three, makes us proud and a little sad as she passes the rooster on meeting this milestone. So, I've been loathe to go here, again but can someone please explain the potty training thing to me again? Rooster is 4 and 3/4. His  IEP  is coming in May. We understand that his school placement recommendation is being heavily influenced by not being potty trained yet. The school psychologist asks if the Rooster KNOWS when he needs to go the potty, as in does he get the signals. I think he must, since we all know, we all get the signals around here... he goes to that certain spot in the house when he needs to go. And, more than two years ago, he used the potty chair for the first time a couple of times all by himself. Sometimes we have had some success. But mostly he tells us he does not want to use the potty. He will say nothing more than, \"I don't want to.\" Well, he more than says it, he screams it. Yet, at other times, he expresses frustration and upset that other kids tease him. He has issues about the whole thing... emotional? Psychological? ... that go beyond his ability to verbalize. He brings up potties  wayyyyy  more often than we do, in all kinds of contexts. His first year in preschool, when he was three, we never used any techniques except encouragement and letting him know to let us know when he was ready. As I said earlier, he had spontaneously had success even before that, so we figured it would be easy. That's when he started telling us that, \"Potties are nasty.\" We let that ride and hoped he'd get ready in his own time. When he started round two of preschool this year, we bought every program you can name, read every book, got him books, got him videos, tried sticker charts, implemented rewards... nothing. Now we have a ABA person on the job. The first night of trying it, SUCCESS! We thought, \"Well, here we go!\" Almost a month later, we've not made much headway. We have tried ten trillion tactics, and I've done mighty mountains of laundry. I just can't wrap my mind around what the issue is for him. I know, I know... you can tell me all kinds of wisdom about how this too shall pass and not to force things and how hard it is for him to process a  jillion  things and the need for control and on and on... I'm just still stuck wondering about how his mind works and how to HELP him. I know... I hear you... but still. I'm stuck. I want... I wish... you know? I mean... if only... and with school... and socialization? And.... you know? I mean, I know you know... I know, you're right... but... and... Did anyone else read that depressing book about the boy who loved windows? And if so does anyone recall that exceptionally weird part about how she learned to massage her kids palate and then he miraculously potty trained himself practically overnight? Makes absolutely no sense. But I've been trying to get my finger inside Rooster's mouth lately... your desperate  bloggy  friend, signing off.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/02/random.html", "title": "\nRandom\n"},

If I could, I'd tell her that looking at my nails makes me happy because: - when a girlfried treats you to a manicure, she's saying, \"I want you to feel special. Let's hang out and take good care of ourselves because we ARE special.\" - when you have dear friends you've known for 27 years, you can't really dwell in the land of the pity party 24/7. - when you get a manicure, you get to sit still and be pampered. - i didn't think about autism every waking moment, though my friends tolerated way more autism talk than anyone should have to on a weekend. - I, if you can believe this, relaxed. -  my friends are beautiful people, and I love them.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 3, 2009", "body": "\n PixieMama  made me so happy today, just because she mentioned me and called me friend. Honestly, I've said it before but it's worth the repetition: I frequently fantasize about dinner parties (or picnics or cocktails or barbecues...) with the other special needs mamas (and a few dads, too) out here in the  blogosphere . I can almost see it like it already happened and I am looking at the photo album -- Drama Mama gives me makeup tips, Mama Mara makes me laugh,  Nik's  Mom breaks into song... the fantasy is that vivid, as is my longing for some fun. Let's call that fact #1 of this list of 25 things just about my blog, inspired by my friend  PixieMama . 2. I started my blog like many others -- after reading and researching to figure out life with my child -- and I felt like writers such as MOM-NOS and Gretchen gave me a lifeline to hold on to when no one else possibly could. 3. For a long stretch, I reached for blogging almost nightly the way some people run toward that cocktail, pill, or cigarette. It was the ONLY thing that took the edge off my pain. 4. But, sometimes it doesn't. 5. I blog on an old IBM  ThinkPad  that gets too hot and burns my thighs, and I think each and every time that next time I'll sit at a desk. Never going to happen. I blog sitting up in bed, and I think of the famous literary figures I studied in college who had their writing rituals in bed, and how I wish I had some of their genius instead of just a litany of complaints and burned thighs. 6. When it's a choice between blogging and exercise, I blog. 7. At weddings they give prizes for the guest who came the farthest distance. I ought to give a prize to my friend  Gwyneth , who reads my blog in Malawi. Her life is so incredibly more interesting than mine that I'm blown away whenever she comments. (Hi, Gwyn!) When I read about her work in humanitarian aid, I can't help feeling ashamed of my whining ways. If you want to read just one more blog, and one not about special needs kids, you should read hers -- it's fascinating. 8. I never care what my blog LOOKS like. It would seem wrong to skip showers, abandon makeup, have hair bigger than  Chaka  Khan's, have hair of epic proportions that gets all frizzed out, and then dress up MY BLOG. 9. I rarely edit. I'm lucky if I take the time to spell check. I just rapid fire, publish post, sleep. 10. I read my own posts often. Not recent ones, older ones. It helps me. 11. I have been looking for an EASY (read: fast) way to print out all my blogs, maybe in a book-like format. I want to give it to my son someday. 12. And I'm terrified of my kids reading my blog someday, too. 13. A lot of people doing searches for content about actual roosters stumble onto my blog. It's hard for me to imagine that people want to have rooster-themed birthday parties, but apparently they do. 14. Sometimes I read my blog aloud to my husband, especially if I've written something funny. I like reading it out loud, and it always makes me wonder what it would be like if we all  podcasted  our blogs. Who has a Southern accent out there? Me! Can you hear it through my text? 15. When I worry about people I know reading my blog, it spoils my ability to write, so I have to put that out of my mind. 16. My favorite thing about blogging is the community. And yet the truth is the process helps me so much that I'd do it even if no one read anything I ever wrote. 17. I am disappointed in my self- centeredness . I wish I had more perspective, more literary style, more worldliness. But at the same time, I don't write my blog to be  writerly . I write it for survival. 18. My favorite posts I've ever written are ones about my grandma. 19. The morning after I post, I always look for comments as soon as I wake up in the morning, before I'm even out of bed. Aren't  iPhones  great? 20. I got accepted into an educational program last year that I  reallllllly  wanted, and I deferred until next year because of the rooster. Now, as I contemplate doing the online program next year or just dropping out altogether, I find myself listing in the \"drop out column\" this reason: I don't want to give up my blogging time. 21. Before I travel, I feel a pang knowing I won't be able to blog. This weekend I'll be out of town. I'll miss you! 22. I don't have any tattoos, and always swore I'd never want one. Now I know, though, what I'd get if I ever change my mind: a rooster and a peach. 23. I have a  stat counter . Isn't that funny? Why do I have one of those? 24. I'm jealous of people who grow up blogging. If I'd had blogging growing up, wow, things would have sucked much less. 25. It's a stretch to find 25 things to say about my blog. Who knew?

When you are 16, this is more than a little \"geographically undesirable.\" For this and other reasons, I told one of my best friends that I wanted her to come with me on the drive to visit Karl, because I planned to break up with him. Of course, you probably guessed this already: when we got there, Karl broke up with me before I could even get the words out, and it STUNG. I cried on my friend's confused shoulder all the way home. Wow, how much that pain caught me off guard. When I was still in the early days of dating my husband, I spent a day with a friend from work, and we both wondered, in case we ever had kids, if we would want our children to go the school where I still teach. I remember saying something like, \"Only if I have a really smart kid who feels comfortable at the school. Otherwise, what would be the point? Already my child will be a faculty child, not in the same socioeconomic demographic as the other kids, let alone in the same neighborhood, and, let's face it, ain't much chance I'll have some athletic super star. Maybe I'll have a smart kid, and he'll be happy in his own skin, and fit right in, but if not, I'll be happy to send him somewhere else.\" Well, again, you see where my assumptions land me. It stings to get the letter in the mail about my daughter's  reenrollment  for next year, and not get one for my son, even though that has always been the deal, ever since his diagnosis last year and the decision to let him finish preschool there before moving on to public kindergarten. It does help to know the rooster will do better if we can find him a more specialized environment, and is sure helps to know that certain pressures will be off me in terms of feeling like I daily walk on the razor's edge, waiting for a call to come. But it only helps just a little. When Karl dumped me, he didn't do it because of the geography, he did it for a busty girl named Trish, or Tricia, or whatever. Vainly, I felt all the worse for not having a guy waiting in the wings to replace him, too. The kid who will take the rooster's coveted slot at my school will be NT -- we have a waiting list overflowing -- but, for now, we have no right place for my boy to go.

Today my two year old daughter explained how I could handle my son's naughty behavior  more effectively. Today I read articles about  Strattera . Today I arranged to get a sitter for a few hours this weekend. Today I took away my son's  popsicle  because of how he acted. Today I drove too fast, until my daughter admonished me from the back seat to be careful. Today I listened to the same book on tape I've heard 76 times and realized I don't know what happens; I zone out each and every time. Today I washed my hands to avoid the circulating flu until they dried out and I wondered if they might begin shedding. Today I gave and got many kisses from two short people. Today I enjoyed reading about my friends on  Facebook . Today my son told me he scratched a classmate on the face and made her bleed, and I've been worrying ever since how to deal with tomorrow.  Today my son told me he scratched a classmate on the face and made her bleed, and I've been worrying ever since how to deal with tomorrow.  Today I got a pimple.  Ick . Today I didn't get a shower.  Ew . Today I woke up tired. Today I go to bed weary. Today is a lot like yesterday, but hopefully not too much like tomorrow. Until then... How was your today?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/01/today.html", "title": "\nToday\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 25, 2009", "body": "\nI started this post a few days ago, and I, professional technology user, managed to lose half of it into the ether. Alas. I've cobbled it back together as best I could, because though it lacks some flow, can you believe this  roller coaster ? I can't: So, on the one hand, we have the rooster. He has special needs, and he keeps us hopping. Sometimes he has good days. When he does, though: bang! Instantaneously, Peaches seems to know it, and she takes over where he left off. Peaches, on the other hand, has what I guess you call typical needs.  Hmmm . I looked up typical and either we all are or no one is, but let's just say that our Peaches has become a budding control freak. She often tells us what to say. Random things. Yesterday? \"Say, 'Blue square, 5 triangles.' Say that.\" She also tells us what to do much of the time, and plays the favorite parent game. \"No, MOMMY DO IT,\" she screams at my poor husband. So, yesterday, a decent day for the rooster, Peaches decided to take it up a notch. When my husband insisted on changing her diaper because I already had a few chores on my hands, she flew into such a rage that she actually took off the clean diaper, went to the garbage can, dug out the soiled (and I don't say that word lightly) diaper, and tried her two-year-old best to put it back on her bottom. Call her what you will, she ain't easy. I guess the up side to all of this can't-catch-a-break-one-way-or-another business might be that their bad days alternate. Sure, now that I just said that, tomorrow will be the double whammy. To follow up on the osteopath business, we had brunch today with my sister-in-law, a pediatric oncologist, and I asked her what she thinks about osteopathy. \"I worked with some osteopaths,\" she told me. \"They had the same training as the rest of us, but then went on and did some specialized training. Most just practice the same regular medicine as everyone else. Some do this thing called manipulations, but I don't know what to think about that,\" she said. I told her our story, how our osteopath vibrated the Rooster one day, and he seemed to improve at school the next. \"Hey,\" she said, sitting to my right, \"whatever works!\" To my left sat the rooster. He cheerfully sat through a LONG brunch at a fancy gay-bar-meets-West-Hollywood-brunch-spot, not misbehaving once until the bill took too long to get paid, at which point he began screaming: IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE PARK,  NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW . And, yeah, actually, it was. No, I'm not chalking the Rooster's better days up to anything, yet. I'm not a scientist, but I do understand the concept of numerous variables, and we have a long way to go. I do have to report how well the park trip went, though. Whatever the factor, I don't care... as  pixiemama  pointed out, \"A good day is a good day.\" So the Rooster's daddy takes him and his sister to the park so I can pay the long delayed bill without scaring away too many other patrons. I arrive ten minutes later to find my husband talking to another dad I know from school, the dad of a boy the teachers have said, \"is not the best match for the rooster.\" Seems these two boys provoke each other, bring out the worst. I hold my breath and run toward them. Quickly, I can hear the rooster shouting. I am leaning in... what is going on? Seems the rooster has met a stranger, a third boy, and now Rooster is trying to WHAT? He's trying to introduce him to his classmate! I nearly fall down. The rooster shouts joyfully, \"Tommy*! Tommy! Do you know Tim*? He's the boy in the blue shirt. Let's play!\" I thought if I described this scenario, this appropriate  reciprocal  language, this good behavior, this social engagement, to his teachers, they would never trust another word out of my mouth ever again. But it did happen. The osteopath called today, saying they have an opening tomorrow.  Hmmm . It's short notice and both J and I have a lot on our work plates, and have done a number of appointments in the last week. What should we do? As we mulled it over, we revisited again the question: do we believe that, er, um, manipulation, can help our boy? J said, \"I believe that sometimes ideas work ahead of our understanding of the why or the how.\" I said I don't know that any of this stuff we do works or fails, I don't know how things would be the same or different if gave up OT, speech, behaviorists,  meds , shadow teachers... but if something doesn't hurt him, and we can provide it, I want to try. So did we grab up the opening at the D.O.'s? No, but we did schedule for a more convenient time next week. I'll keep you posted. In the  meantime , after one year of lobbying, seven thousand phone calls, and 16 hours of parenting classes, we finally qualified for an ABA specialist in our home. Yes, Mama Mara, we are calling him our own Whisperer. He already came once and gave us PLANS. I, for one, love nothing better than a PLAN! J thinks it's a four letter word sometimes, but since this one does involve potty training, he can probably appreciate this is some good sh**t. (Sorry, I couldn't resist. Next time I'll try to keep it clean.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2009/01/when-i-say-osteo-you-say-path.html", "title": "\nWhen I Say Osteo You Say Path\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, January 22, 2009", "body": "\nAt the risk of sounding like I just fell off the turnip truck, we didn't have no doctors the likes of these here where I grew up! Okay, so really I was born with pretty strong grammar skills (despite my passion for ain't and split infinitives, I DID teach language arts), but I would like to convey my natural twang here, let you know I'm from the rural South, and explain how deeply foreign some treatments we've explored for our son can feel to me at first blush. Maybe to you more worldly folks this is all a matter of course, and you'll think I am quite some country mouse, to which I say, Yes I Am, thank you very much. Sometimes, I can almost FEEL my Peeps 3,000 miles away rolling their eyes as I call to order some herbs from a specialist whose title I honestly have a mental block on learning on the grounds it is too  multisyllabic  and, well, goofy sounding. I am NOT without an open mind. I am also not some easy mark who buys every gadget sold on infomercials. I am just a mom in Los Angeles trying to avail my son of every possible resource to help him with his health. And his health ain't great. Anyway, yesterday we tried the osteopath. Sure, I could analyze the word and figure out the meaning of osteopath, but I promise you can't find one within a hundred miles of where I grew up, and I had no idea what to expect. We found this doctor because I tell anyone who will listen that I will take any and all referrals they might consider offering that might have a decent chance of helping the rooster overcome his snot affliction. Sorry to get graphic, but the child needed his nostrils plunged immediately after birth, and possibly every ninety minutes since then, for almost five  goopy  years. When our outstanding, grounded, and articulate OT told us how very much she respects her osteopath, and knowing that my  OT's  daughter has made significant developmental gains under this doctor's care, I thought I needed to get an appointment. Yesterday, I picked my boy up from school after nap time, during which he had not napped, and found him to be in, as my mom likes to say, rare form. The teacher let me know while handing him off to me that he scratched the face of a classmate, unfortunately the daughter of Beverly Hills dermatologists, and they had to do an accident report since he drew blood. He cried and kicked most of the drive across town, then spent forty minutes trying to dismember the waiting room. I liked the waiting room - it seemed medical and professional enough, and despite having to wait forever, we were the only patients there. When does THAT happen? When we left the waiting room at last, we left my realm of experience with medicine. The doctor took us to a room much like the one my tax accountant has, which is to say, a very Los Angeles feeling space, not far from the ocean, with many fragile things my son should not touch. And some toys that didn't really interest him, since instead he saw so many fragile things he should not touch and desperately needed to break them. The doctor  proceeded  to talk to me for quite a while, stopping to warn the rooster that, \"Hey, that's expensive, don't break it,\" and asking me all seven thousand questions I'd just answered on his book length form in the waiting room. I  enumerated  our many concerns:  hypotonia , fine and gross motor issues, allergies, poor digestion, poor focus, aggression, pragmatic language deficits, scripting, mitigated  echolalia , mood swings, drool, memory, motor planning, impulse control.... and I told him our whole Rooster story. At last, the doctor removed his glasses, looked up through his inordinately bushy eyebrows, and asked if I clearly understood my child exhibited all the hallmarks of BIRTH TRAUMA. Well, sure, I could tell we were going that way, as he'd probed into how long, how well, how adequately I'd nursed my child, what drugs I'd allowed the hospital to foist on us during delivery, and any number of other guilt inducing inquiries. I nodded. Okay, birth trauma. I said, \"And he has an autism diagnosis.\" He nodded. It was just a nod, but I had a nagging feeling he thought somehow I did an awful job giving birth, so now of course my son has autism. Finally it was time to actually examine the patient if we could wrangle him onto the .... ... table? More like a little bed. The rooster climbed up and let the doctor... um... feel him; where I am from, people thump melons and such in much the same kind of knowing manner. The doctor spent a lot of time wrapping his hand around the rooster's calf, in particular, cocking an eyebrow, muttering, and running his fingers up the back of rooster's neck. The rooster, rather than getting upset, cracked up completely. He wasn't mocking alternative medicine; he just felt ticklish. The diagnosis? The rooster has, um, crooked legs. And, uh, his chin is kind of small, which could someday wreck his posture, which is, er, systemically bad. And his  vertebrae  are sort of compressed. His neck is too tight, which we've always known related to his  torticollis  and  strabismus . He has poor binocular vision. And he is very, very, ticklish. All but that last part I think comprise his BIRTH TRAUMA. (read: dagger to my guilty heart. Hey, what about MY birth trauma?!) But, I had to interject and ask, does this, uh, affect, like, his general health? Oh, the doctor said, as directly as if the Donald was firing me, YES, without a doubt, it  most certainly  does. The remedy? The doctor proceeded to take a, um, thing that vibrated but that I am loathe to call a vibrator, and ran it up and down the boy's body. After quite a long time, I suddenly looked at the clock, and upon realizing we'd now been there over two hours, announced that we'd have to leave soon to pick my daughter up from school. With great sincere dismay, the doctor proclaimed: \"Well, I have to FINISH, or else he won't be EVEN.\" He, um, vibrated the rooster a bit more, gave me a referral to an 82-year-old nutritionist he said could prescribe things to us by phone, and then told us to come back. With several more intense, er, sessions, he expected mild to moderate improvement. I had to know. Improvement in what? In his BEHAVIOR, he said.  That'll  be $175. We got the discount. And, no, silly, this is not an insurance kind of place. See you soon! Or not, I thought; we'll have to think more about this whole business and do more fact-checking, call our friends in medicine... you know, the FAMILIAR kind of medicine, the kind where they give you some MEDICINE instead of a vibrator... Cut to today, when I go to pick the rooster up from school. He is in after care, and when I walk in, and I am not thinking at all about the osteopath. I am realizing that the daughter of the dermatologists wants to talk to me. She makes a bee-line for me, and I hold my breath, praying her mother won't arrive at this very same moment to hear whatever woeful tale she has to recount today about my guy. She looks up at me and says, very adult-like for a four-year-old wearing Valentine pants, \"Rooster had a better day today! He was nicer.\" Yes, the rooster corroborates, it's true. I take his hand and Peaches' hand, and the three of us walk to our car, peacefully. A FIRST!They behave so well I give them lollipops for the ride home. We listen to books on tape, and the don't fight, even though they are sitting next to each other for a change, since J took the car with the third row today. We get home, the kids eat their dinner, watch Sesame Street, and let me play a few rounds of Scramble on the laptop. Huh? J arrives. The rooster lights up with engagement. He initiates all kinds of conversation with his daddy. \"Daddy, do you remember when...\" and \"Daddy, do you know dinosaurs are  STINKED ? They are not alive. Not anymore. They are  STINKED .\" I don't know when I last saw J laugh so much or have a better time talking with the rooster. Suddenly, the osteopath comes to mind. And I realize I need to write a blog post. This one. I need to reconcile my Southern roots and my Angeleno lifestyle, and I needed to explore my beliefs and my hopes, my uncertainty and my questions. All this rambling (forgive me, I have a horrible virus, my throat is on fire, and I'm on  MEDS ) is to tell you this. I ain't got no clue what to make of this osteopath business. Maybe by coincidence the rooster just happened to have a better day today. Maybe not. Maybe if I lived on Mars then suddenly landed in my internist's office, I'd go, \"This crazy chick thinks if I urinate in a cup she can tell if I'm sick! She pumped my arm with air in a sleeve and called it medicine! BAH, Poppycock!\" There are many ways to look at it, and I surely will research more. But here is what I know: the rooster and I, and as many increments of $175  as it takes, will drive across town again to lie down in the bed and vibrate, and maybe when we do it enough, the rooster will no longer need to break all the doctor's expensive equipment anymore, and we will graduate from alternative medicine with our melons intact.

She expressed her gratitude for the meaningful things in life, and asked why we are all grateful. Funny she should ask. Just today I told my husband, much to his astonishment, that I feel really grateful that a few weeks ago, a box fell off a high shelf and hit me in the head. You see, today the Rooster got sent home from school early for biting his teacher. He did a poor job apologizing, a worse job listening to my attempts to help him learn from the experience, and followed it all up by fighting with his sister more than usual and writing on the wall with (Harold's?) purple crayon. So I am grateful that the toy box crashed down on me as I sat on the playroom floor a few weeks ago, because otherwise I never would have seen my boy run to the bathroom, grab the stool, drag it over to the fridge, climb up and get me the booboo bunny ice pack from our freezer, and I'd be sitting here thinking my boy doesn't yet have a single inkling how to empathize. He does have the good in there. I know it is, because I saw him leap to my aid when I nearly brained myself. I have this experience to tuck into my locket and open up when I need something to get me through. And I need something to get me through after my son bit a grandmother, my friend, for the second time in a week and got sent home from school. Like Jordan, I am grateful for my family, our strengths, our home, healthy food to eat, work. But next to Jordan, I am a needy, whiny girl, and I am going to put an SOS out right here right now. Forgive me for it, please. But I am feeling desperate tonight, and I know that you are a networked, savvy, communicative, connected bunch, you readers out there, and I want to know if you can give me a little hookup: Is there anyone out there whose child at age 4 1/2 behaved much like the rooster (aggressive, noncompliant, hyper, willful), and then things improved? If so, please, oh please, please, please, can you get me in touch with them? Sure, I would love to know how things improved, and when, and why, and all of that, but just to know that they DID improve would be a much lovelier way to hold on to hope than to have to drop boxes of wooden erector sets on my head.

{"date": "Monday, January 12, 2009", "body": "\nI can already tell that the funny will not translate, but I find the story irresistibly  tellable . Try to listen to your sense of humor when you read this one: My kids, for whatever odd reason, like to pull old yearbooks off the shelf and ask me to identify the faces. Sometimes they know the people -- teachers or kids from the school where I work and they attend. Sometimes the kids in the pictures long since graduated. This is my 14 th  year there, after all. As I was showing Peaches, our two-year-old, the album from 2001, I found myself realizing she'd asked me something, but I had zoned out remembering people, marvelling at how some people had changed, feeling sentimental about the passage of time, thinking about how in 2001 my husband and I had not even yet married... I scrutinized my younger face, of course, and missed it in all it's smoothness, and remembered how then I wasted time missing some yet even younger self, while my then-boyfriend warned me, \"Enjoy your  vigors !\" Meanwhile, earth to mommy! Peaches demanded to know, \"And who's THAT one? That one? That one right there?\" After a while, and several deep sighs, I told her we needed to brush her teeth. She paused en route to the bathroom in front of a photo I have framed of my mom at about age four. I love the black and white photo because my mom looks so happy and so very fresh and young, because my grandma cherished that photo, and because I know the whole back story of my mom's fancy cowgirl ensemble. Peaches (remember, she's two) pointed to the picture and said, \"That's Grandma.\" I concurred -- that IS grandma. \"She doesn't look the same.\" I concurred again -- barey recognizable. I told her, \"People change.\" She stared me down a moment, very eye-to-eye, and sighed knowingly, sagely. As she turned on her heel to go brush teeth with her Winnie the Pooh toothbrush, she lamented forlornly, \"That is SAD.\" See, it doesn't read funny. But I can barely stop. She just cracks me up. Thank goodness. If not, how ever would I get over myself? We're trying to enjoy all the  vigors  over here. I suggest you do the same.

{"date": "Sunday, January 11, 2009", "body": "\nAnother year, and the story grows older. I'm thinking about giving up parties as a New Year's resolution. I actually love parties. I just can't handle taking my kids to them. When the rooster was 23 months old, we took him to a birthday party at a park. Already we told anyone who would listen that our boy seemed more challenging to contain than every other child we knew, more willful, less engaged, somewhat dangerous, and we were well-aquainted with the scoffing, dismissing, mocking, and eye rolling. We meaning me. Of course. Anyway, so we go to this party, disheveled and disoriented from not sleeping for two years and from managing constant, willful energy, and with a brand new baby as well. We lasted about three or four minutes maybe of niceties, and the rooster was off and running. Literally -- he ran in enormous circuits through fields and around the park. Poor J had the job of corralling him, or chasing him, or just making apologies to the picknickers and park visitors that the rooster overran, because I had a 5 week old baby with me. We used her as our out and left as early as possible, overwhelmed, scared, freaked out. By we I mean me. Of course. I remember getting in the car, and asking J, \"Did it sort of blow you away to see all the other kids sitting on the blanket quietly, happily eating snacks, seeming so... nice?\" J looked at me with some of that scoffing and dismissing I referred to earlier. \"NO, honey, come on. Our boy is almost two. Haven't you heard of the terrible twos? When all of those kids are two they'll probably do the exact same thing.\" I didn't know the right way to say this to him: \"Uh, J. Those kids? They are all two.\" Our friends are Korean. J just looked at me. \"No they aren't,\" he said. \"They were just itty bitty little kids.\" But it was dawning on him, I could see it. I hated breaking it to him. \"J, just because they don't look like our pale, blonde, 95th percile-sized child, doesn't mean they aren't two. I know for a fact that all of those children are his age exactly.\" We rode in silence for a while. We have remembered and recounted that day many times. Today we went to a little girl's first birthday party at yet another park. This is actually our favorite park, so we figured that would work out nicely - it is one of those built for all abilities, a highly accessible park where we've enjoyed several recent successful outings. It was a lovely party and I tried extremely hard to just be in the moment, enjoy, and not compare. How well do you think I did? This little ray of sunshine turning one year old beamed at her party. She had a blast. She didn't need to be held, she walked with confidence, she smiled at the camera, she clapped for herself when she got her cupcake and people sang. Wow, nothing like either of my children's first birthdays, though both were held at similar parks with similar guests and similar food. That was almost enough to bum me out. But much worse: the rooster ran in giant circles through this park today, trying to lose us, ignoring our words, screaming, and he eventually hit another boy in the face because the boy responded to the rooster's nose-to-nose demands to play together by saying, \"No, I don't want to play with you, you are a stranger.\" And no, I am not comforted that the Rooster initiated play with the boy. Not comforted. He hit the boy in the face. Peaches, for all her NT ways, didn't behave much better, trying to pry the cupcakes from the box from the moment we arrived, and throwing a screaming, spitting fit when I took the rooster to the restroom for a diaper change and -- God forbid -- left her with daddy, and about two dozen friends for five minutes. We hightailed it out of there. My husband, who sees all things as brightly as I see them dark, who cannot be brought down, barely had the car in reverse before he said, \"I just want you to know. I am grumped out. I'm sorry, but I am. Sometimes it just all hits me, you know?\" He said part of his grumpiness came from thinking about his coming work day, but as we talked, what kept coming up was the struggle we have dealing with the challenges facing our family. I completely understood. When we came home, Peaches asked to see photos of her from her own birthday parties. I pulled out the albums. We worked our way backward through time, starting with her second birthday, then going all the way back to my baby shower when I was carrying the rooster. Who was that young, bright, shiny girl?!!!! Wow, I like her hair, and I wish I had it now, but I don't think I knew it at the time! Her skin looked nice... The only way I'm going to make it to any more birthdays is to find a way to connect with my sense of gratitude and joy. So, in an effort to do just that, here is what I'm grateful for: - The rooster's language continues to blossom in astonishing ways. Hard to believe that in the spring we wondered if he'd ever ask or answer questions. - Peaches gives the sweetest kisses in the whole world. - My friend S just had a very scary operation. She rebounded like a super star! She'll be on bed rest for a month, but I saw her and she looks amazing. - I have the sweetest husband in the entire world. We cooked breakfast together today. Eggs and gfcf waffles. He made sure I had time to jog, even though it meant he didn't get time for a haircut. He compliments me wildly. I love him. - My mom sent me my grandma's flatware. While it is not something we ever would have picked out, I love eating with it. I grew up eating with it. It feels like having her here. I think she got it in the forties. It's a collector's item. I love having it. I put it in place of our stuff today and it felt right. - Today I downloaded a free app on my iPhone so I now can listen to my local NPR station on my phone. I jogged today and never even got bored! NPR! I love it! Oh how I've been missing it as we've listened to all the rooster's books on tape! - Did I mention I started jogging again? A woman 25 years older than I am passed me, but hey, calorie burning is calorie burning, and I need to burn me some calories. It's time to lose that 10 extra pounds I've been dragging around for almost three years, and it's good to be jogging again. - My friends are very cool.

Those of you who have been writing about  GFCF ? Questioning and trying and wondering and looking for input? I've loved your posts, admired your efforts, and understood your doubts. I just say to you: it FEELS like it helps our boy, and so that makes it good for our family. Sure, it's hard. Hey, special needs, right? But if it helps your kid, or helps you feel like you help your kid, than I say hang in there. And if it doesn't, then save your energies for more productive paths. But, if you're on the border, and you're looking for encouragement, here is some for you: Google. Find the best stores in your area. Read  GFCF  blogs. Buy the Kid-Friendly  ADHD  & Autism Cookbook. If you have a Trader Joe's, get the awesome mixes. Make a bazillion waffles or pancakes with  gfcf  (Enjoy Life) chocolate chips and freeze what you can't eat. Order stuff online.  Have a  GFCF  party and invite friends. See how many cool things you can put on rice cakes. Email me. We'll swap tips. 2. I'm fantasizing about relocating to Albuquerque. Now, it is HIGHLY unlikely that we will do this. But I'm curious; anyone know anything about life --- special needs life --- in New Mexico? 3. If I owe you a thank you note, PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I've never had a harder time facing that task. THANK YOU. 4. The rooster discovered puzzles finally. I watched him today, and marvelled. Now, it's hard for me to gauge how he was doing since I all but burned all those stupid milestone books years ago. But at his first evaluation, more than two years ago, when he charmed the team into believing I was the one with special needs, the one task he refused to do was a puzzle. (I was glad at least that they caught a glimpse of the noncompliance I had described so that they didn't think I was just the moron Dennis Leary thinks I am.) I blogged about this before, but it warrants retelling: the teacher on the team asked if he had any special interests, and maybe she'd have the right puzzle to tempt my boy. I said animals, so she brought him a horse puzzle. \"Rooster,\" she asked, \"do you know where the horse's head goes?\" And he knew alright. He said, \"The horses head goes BACK IN THE BOX.\" He was 2 then, he's more than 4 1/2 now, and he's avoided puzzles like they might bite ever since. Today, though, Peaches had out a  Scooby   Doo  puzzle  for ages 3-7 that she got for Christmas, and when she turned her back, the Rooster took over. He put together 8 pieces, six in the right place, and remained utterly engaged until it was time to head out the door. It delighted me. He's also started drawing, which is another task he responds to with surprising and unusual distaste. 4. We started a B vitamin cream after the lead reports caused concern. We rub lotion on his back each night -- it's been about 4 weeks now. When we went to OT, the therapist who we hadn't seen in a while due to holidays asked, \"What's different?\" She found him more compliant, and his fine motor skills improved. He cut paper, held things with a decent grasp, did well on some large motor things too, and got along with another child in the room who isn't usually there. Could be a coincidence. Could be B? Wow, this actually turned in to a real post. Of course, I've been writing it on and off this whole day long instead of my usual quick, healthy feeling purge, but sometimes it's hard to work out when you haven't in a while, and you need to do a little at a time. Happy New Year wishes to everyone. And I want you to know how glad I am for you all. To the other  bloggers  -- I've been thinking of YOU and your kids a lot lately -- sending get well wishes to you-know-who-you-are (ykwya), house sale wishes to  ykwya , voodoo power to Mama Bear  ykwya , and I've been desperately curious about the romance of  ykwya ...

He followed directions written in drawings to cut out ornaments, and cooperatively hung on them on a tree. It was his last therapy at this place, so I didn't want to bust their bubble and tell them we're Jewish! And, remember, for a Jewish girl, no one loves Christmas more than I do. We get our own tree tomorrow. It'll go right next to our fireplace, where the menorah is on the mantle.  J completed his required parenting class hours today, meaning that California's Regional Center system will soon provide us with some ABA support for our boy. J felt the classes were worthwhile. I only wish they hadn't kept him from spending time with my mom and stepdad when they were in town, but I am excited by the prospect of having a behaviorist come help us in the evenings with the Rooster's more problematic behaviors.  Miss M came to babysit. We ADORE her. If we win the lottery, we will beg her to quit her job and come live with us and raise our kids for us! Miss M was Peaches' daycare provider when she was a baby, and once in a while she comes to babysit for a few hours. When I got home, the Rooster refused to let her go until she finished one last story, and then he told her, very sweetly, \"Goodbye Miss M. See you next time. Have a good vacation. At the Egyptian Pyramids.\" He made that last part up, but we all agreed it was a nice touch. Peaches said, \"I love that Miss M!\"  I found some holiday presents to give teachers that I think work. I don't know that the recipients will love them as much as I do, but I found gifts that are handmade and the money goes to a charitable foundation that supports women who are rebuilding their lives after overcoming personal tragedies. What could make for a better gift? If I'd gotten these gifts when I was in the classroom, I would have thought, \"How cool!\" So I bought them.  I ate dinner with J. We ate warm food in a quiet place and maintained a thoughtful conversation. I really love that guy. He's pretty wonderful. (And did I mention that he's gorgeous?)

It's better to cheat than to repeat. But if you get caught, it's your own fault. Now bend yo' head, and smell some lead.\") Yesterday I decided to give Positive a trial run. I've heard so much about the concept, kind of how I kept hearing this annoying tale of kids on gluten free diets struggling less with language and behavior -- I didn't like the premise because it didn't make my life initially sound any easier, but for a payoff, I could experiment with it for a day. Well, I don't know about anyone else in the world and gfcf, and I surely don't know the how and the why -- the  science , if you will -- but about 30 some hours after removing g and c from the rooster's diet, we whipped out the video camera because suddenly for the first time ever he and his sister had a conversation. He's not perfect. He has many language and behavior miles to go before we sleep. But that first day made a huge impact on us, kind of like yesterday did on me with the whole, yes, I do dare say it, Positive experiment. Yesterday, I decided to test the much publicized hypothesis that when grumpy people go on a negative free diet, they actually improve their language and behavior too, and that many unexpected rewards can follow. Huh. So yesterday I flew in the face of the deities to see if I'd be killed. Unscientifically, I posit this: I think maybe I'm still standing today. More positively: I had a good day yesterday. Even though I said I thought I would. I put out good energy, smiled extra, and avoided kvetching overly. And? Work was okay, the kids handled an unexpected/unusual trip to the Farmer's Market, J helped me arrange it so I could attend the work holiday party for an hour or so, and a friend volunteered to babysit for me soon. Not too shabby! So we stuck with the gfcf thing, knowing every day would not be perfect, and sometimes we question if the diet is really helping, but infractions and their consequences make us believers, make us think the hard work is worthwhile; and I plan to give this Positive thing more time, too, despite how it goes against my nature and my cravings. And my writing style. So please bear with me. Thank you to all my role models in the land of Positive, and to P for perfect timing of support, and to C and E for sharing the journal and the shirt with me. It helps ease my fear of the deities.

A Dean's List student, I had to flirt with classmates so that they would tutor me enough to help me maintain my C average in the two science classes they made me take en route to my BA. Call me Mrs. Right Brain, and forgive my poor explanations below as I tell you our good news (and, being me, still find a way to complain a little from the completely overwhelmed place I seemed to have moved to this last year). At great long last, the doctor called to say that the second lead test was okay. OKAY! She said it wasn't perfect, but it was not enough to freak anyone out and take drastic action. Hurrah! So did that mean the first test that showed high levels was wrong? A fluke? She said she doesn't know, but she wants to try to get some lead out of our boy's system through biomedical intervention. My weak interpretation of what she explained to me six ways from Sunday is this: based on two different methods of testing, she feels that he might have more lead than is healthy, and she'd like to raise levels of good elements in his body -- B6 and calcium, for example -- that either help him shed some of his lead or prevent him from absorbing it into his vital organs -- like his brain. She does not have reason to believe that too much has yet found its way into organs, and she does not think lead caused his challenges. Therefore, she is not at this time suggesting true chelation, or drawing out the metals through more medical means, as she says she does not feel this is warranted, though we may get a second opinion. Of course, we are thrilled that the latest test came back with better news, and we remain concerned about our son having lead in his system, and we will do anything we can to help him. I asked the doctor, as I always do, \"What side effects or down sides should we expect from your treatment plan?\" She said, \"It isn't cheap.\" What is? \"And me might not like it.\" Ah. He never does. We can work with these side effects; we know them well, and they are certainly the lesser of many evils. The Rooster will be getting B6 cream. If you feel even tempted for an instant to say that doesn't sound bad, I say poo poo poo to you. Kia might say, \"COME ON, the kid has SPD, dooodz.\" But okay, I will figure out a way to rub lotion all over him every day without either of us getting hurt. And he needs calcium. Um, yes, this we always knew, and for almost a year we've tried a bagload of (costly) for that. Yes, we've already tried the chocolate liquid from Kirkman and mixed it into pretty much anything you can name. But we'll make it work. At least I just read about a new GFCF coconut yogurt that Whole Foods carries -- thanks, blogger, for posting that. (I'd link to it if I had enough memory, energy, and laptop battery; maybe later.) And, he's going to need some new pills, too. Well, sure. While he's getting more pills, I hope that someone gives a few to me. It already take two adults 20-30 minutes each morning and each night to administer the medicine he already takes... If it sounds like I'm not elated that, after worrying for the past two weeks, my son's test did not show lead poisoning, just know it's because of my sketchy relationship with the universe, not a lack of gratitude. Call me superstitious, but know that inside I, for one, am definitely feeling a little less toxic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/12/this-is-good-news-but-you-know-ill.html", "title": "\nThis is Good News - (but you know I'll still complain)\n"},

Whoa, the opportunities for reflection. For us, going to a party doesn't ever just happen. We plan as if headed overseas. Doesn't matter, though; surprises are in store.\u00a0 So, this time we headed to the first birthday party of an adorable little boy in childcare with Peaches. His mother and I work together. She knows the rooster well, and asked how she could make things go smoothly for him. I LOVE HER. I brought her a stash of gfcf candy for her to use in his goody bag, and she assured me she planned to stock the kids' table with fruits and juice boxes my boy could enjoy. I packed my own bag of treats, too, of course, and baked gfcf brownies in case we did not manage our escape prior to cake.\u00a0 We drove to the birthday boy's grandmother's home, quite a distance from our own, extra early in hopes of managing naps en route. Peaches collapsed, but Rooster asked over and over, \"Are we there yet? Tell me when. Now? Tell me when.\"\u00a0 An adorable little puppy greeted us. With a child allergic to everything including air, we've had surprisingly few physical reactions to dogs, but behavioral reactions make up for that. Squealing, lots of squealing, from both boy and canine.\u00a0 Of course, we knew several of the guests, other teachers from school and their kids. But, this was no small affair. I mean, these people know how to throw a bash -- complete with a deejay, chafing dishes full of delicious food, a pirate theme to the nth degree, organized games, and tons of people -- alllll kinds of people.\u00a0 I am not sure how many times the rooster covered his ears and asked to go home, but for each of those times, he subsequently asked to stay and play more. We paid careful attention to his cues and I think we managed to leave at the right time for him, but we also stayed almost two full and mostly successful hours.\u00a0 At one point, my sweet husband watched the rooster play while I watched Peaches. Later, my husband, J, commented how he felt a tug seeing our boy walk up to children and shove a toy in their faces, not knowing how to appropriately initiate. Then, he looked over to see a severely disabled girl, probably more of a young woman than a girl, really, being held and kissed and fed by her parents. This girl could not communicate. My husband felt all kinds of tugs then, and a longing to know the best way to reach out to her parents.\u00a0 When the rooster approached familiar kids, they gave him latitude. Probably their parents have helped them understand our boy better. We gave rooster some scripts to try to help him approach new kids at the party, and it helped some, too. Suddenly a sweet blonde child in an adorable skirt didn't bother to wait for his approach. She immediately wanted to play with the rooster! He struggled a little in the beginning, and whether I should have or not, I found myself saying to her, \"He just sometimes can't quite find the right words he wants to say, but he's trying to play with you, so if you want to play with him, that's great.\" Neither the rooster nor this darling and highly verbal girl, E, seemed to mind my little coaching. She showed him to the pirate mast where they could poke their heads through and have their photos taken. She asked him to -- can you believe this? -- dance! They danced! Neither of them yet five years old, they had some serious moves! They all but held hands! When the rooster freaked out over the little puppy in front of E, she calmly told her about her own dog. He listened. He responded. Appropriately. Together they moved away from the puppy. They volleyed like conversation never stood in the rooster's way before... for a few minutes. When words failed him, he gazed at her adoringly. I did, too. I practically offered her folks a dowry.\u00a0 Then, they started the balloon game. I think I've written before that the rooster obsesses about balloons, and that we used to have to read him Jamie Lee Curtis' book on the subject (Where Do Balloons Go When You Let Them Go Free) about 20 times each day. If he sees a balloon, he wants it. If he gets it, he wants to set it free. Then, he wants it again.\u00a0 Ah, autism. When it goes partying, things get interesting.\u00a0 So every child received a balloon, followed by some horrifying instructions to pop other people's balloons, and I didn't catch the rest of the details because it was too late. E popped the rooster's balloon, literally, metaphorically, completely. I think \"bereft\" describes his reaction. She, for her part, had no idea why he reacted as he did. She sought and received confirmation that she did just as she had been instructed. So of course she felt confused; darling E didn't see the rooster's autism, so his reaction puzzled her. Clearly she wanted to make amends for upsetting him even though she had done nothing wrong, so she reached in her pocket and pulled out the M&Ms she'd squirreled away, and held them out to him. To which, of course, I had to intervene and explain he has \"allergies.\" On the way home, we all munched on gfcf brownies and celebrated the successes of the evening. We all enjoyed ourselves for a while, we let our guard down some, we left on decent terms with everyone. The rooster and E made their peace, if not reconciled completely. And at least we didn't have to shell out for a dowry.\u00a0 I haven't had as much fun at a party in five years.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/11/when-autism-goes-partying.html", "title": "\nWhen Autism Goes Partying\n"},

It has been about a month since the needle only moved as high as \"bad\" on the miserometer. It started when we got home from school/work, and the rooster's voice seemed to shift from his tirade tone into distantly familiar, somewhat likeable intonations. Sure, there was still combat to do, screamfests with his sister over TV, toys, touching, and turns. But some reason mixed in, too. The Peaches seemed less two, too. And her cough subsided to where she doesn't seem like you need to wear a mask to be around her. But she ought to quit smoking, that's for sure. Now, I tell you this in FULL cognition that have I invoked the hex of the spirits who despise me, but I also know that I wasn't going to get two days in a row of just plain bad, anyways, so I figured, as Kia would say, whatevs, people.

But the sound of the Peaches shrilly screaming for Daddy to COME BACK and tuck her in a fourteenth time doesn't bring me to my psychological knees this time. Why? Because we had merely a bad night. Remember, for us, read \"bad\" like this: good. On our scale, bad is okay. On our scale, bad is what you shoot for a lot of the time. Our scale goes like this: epic warfare horrible, awful, like that kid's book about the \"no good, very bad day\" bad sort of fine So, on a day in which we had additional lab work to look into possible lead poisoning, had to pull the car over multiple times in traffic to stop the children for harming each other on the commute, talked to the school psychologist about the difficult recent days in class, worked hard at two busy jobs, handed down multiple time-outs, bribed our rooster to take his medicine with an hour-long and messy smoothie making session, still haven't managed the final tuck ins, and found out we'll be sleeping on the floor for another 5 nights, I say we have landed only one step away from our highest pinnacle of familial positivity -- we are bad, and within spitting range of sort of fine.

I was sure she'd say, whoa, bad mercury levels, how COULD you have gotten a flu shot while pregnant? Well, not exactly, but my guilt button was on high alert even though, as I said, I have no reason to believe anything other than genetics necessarily \"caused\" the rooster to have autism. Well, the level for mercury was far to the left, like several other levels, clearly in the safe zone. Then, about four zones to the right, LEAD. We have to have more tests. Add a trip to Children's Hospital to our imminent itinerary to the pediatrician for a physical, the dentist for torture, the OT, speech, and the eye doc. Then, the results will indicate our course of action. Might be okay, might be able to give him more iron, calcium, B6, and eliminate potential sources of lead in our home. (Read: expensive repiping coming soon to a home near ours.) But, then she said, if the tests don't come out looking good, we will have to talk. We will need to discuss chelation.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/11/lead-balloons.html", "title": "\nLead Balloons\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 18, 2008", "body": "\nI slept about four hours last night. Three of them in a row. All of them on the floor. None of them after 4.\u00a0 A healthy, rested, balanced person could do this, at least once in a while. I am not healthy, rested, or balanced, because I've been doing this too long.\u00a0 She has a cough. She wet the bed. He heard her cough. He had a dream. Four on the floor of the playroom, never settling in, never back to sleep. And now I'm supposed to go to work and be extra efficient to make up for the day out yesterday. Or just finally give up?\u00a0 A major problem with this continuous sleep deprivation is the vicious cycle of it. Once you fry me to a certain point, I don't stand a chance at doing lots of proactive things when the next evening rolls around. I am way too tired to think of duct taping the diaper so it doesn't leak, or buying the special organic turkey the rooster can eat to fill him full of Thanksgiving drowsiness, and you can forget soothing lullabies and warm baths just before bed. I am barely able to function, as in bathe, drive, work, feed and clothe them, administer medications, keep them from ending up in the ER. And with the rooster up at all hours, he will be a joy if he goes to school. It's my husband's turn to miss work, and so I guess he will. He will give the girl her cough syrup and the boy his constant, unwavering, necessary supervision, and we will hope sick days will still be left over for when surgeries and emergencies come again as they have the last two years. We are not rich -- there is no nanny waiting in the wings.\u00a0 They call it beauty sleep for many reasons. I look like I could be my own grandmother. I don't wear any makeup, but I'm realizing that needs to change. And if beauty is as beauty does, well, let's just say I'm haggard inside and out. As you can surely tell, I'm wretched. How you are still reading is hard to grasp... In no way am I trying to make a religious proclamation; I don't ever really want to go into that private realm too deeply in the blogosphere. That is not my topic. But in light of the sleep torture, I have to confess this: In my stupor, I regularly picture some all-powerful being, up above me, watching, and he HATES me. He TORTURES me. I ask myself if it's punishment, or just a malicious game. I wonder if I did something terrible in a previous life. Or maybe because I cheated death as a child (that is another post), this is the consequence. Maybe it's because I have NOT connected with a deep and abiding faith as I would really like to do. Maybe I am in a movie like the Truman Show, only it's the Rooster Show. Maybe someone cast a curse or hex on me, or has a ghkcole voodoo doll. Maybe I'm just a melodramatic, fried human being -- yes, yes, absolutely that must most likely fit the bill. Nothing can truly be as draining as I perceive this to be, it's just life, and I've gone soft. But I do sometimes throw my head back, and shout up at the sky, \"Well then I hate you too!\" This will cost me some of my readers, but maybe instead of despising me, you could pray for me. I am not good at doing it for myself, and the whole family here, including the two small innocents, would forever appreciate your prayers for a little rest, and a little balance, and a huge dollop of perspective.\u00a0 Please, though, whatever you do: don't send me solution ideas. Tried. Did. Done. Can't. Already thought of it. Moving on. Really. Puleaaze.\u00a0 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to start my day.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/11/zzzzzzzz.html", "title": "\nZzzzzzzz\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 17, 2008", "body": "\nMy husband and I have an epic To Do List that has gained serious weight over the last five years, but lately I am most concerned over our lack of a will, or whatever legal document you need when you have little wealth and two children to leave behind if something unexpected happens.\u00a0 So, just in case, I thought: why not blog some \"last wishes\"? I mean, we hope to take a little getaway soon, and we have no intention whatsoever of making it permanent, but it could be or first time flying together without kids... Plus, when you live in Southern California, you have plenty of reminders to contemplate your mortality, you know? \u00a0 So, for the record:\u00a0 I've never wanted a funeral. Not to say I wouldn't want a gathering, but a party would be my preference. A party with LOTS of food, nice words, many photos. The more stories, the better, but nice ones -- here or gone, I don't want to be roasted! And I surely do NOT wish to attend the party -- I don't want anyone looking at me then, so I hope to be cremated.\u00a0 All my stuff should go to my kids, of course (and my mom and stepdad), but the real question is where do my kids go? Naturally my husband and I have discussed this about a billion times. When the rooster was born, we even asked my brother-in-law and sister-in-law to be godparents. However, they didn't have kids then. Now, they do. And we didn't know the rooster had autism then. Now, we do. Since our original conversation, they've moved to a new city, started new career journeys, started a family of their own, and learned about the roster's challenges. I call that a game changer. I know they'd still want to help, but I don't know that it would be the best thing for everyone.\u00a0 When I hypothetically try to imagine J and I gone, I immediately feel an urgent need to think that the Rooster and Peaches need to stay together. And let's not kid anyone: they are undeniably adorable, but no easy package. It takes more than just love to raise them. It takes fortitude. Stamina. My grandparents played a major role in raising me, but the most aggressive thing I ever did was clutch my novels too tightly. And yet what about how much my folks and my inlaws would want proximity to the kids with us gone? Yet they live 3,000 miles apart. My family lives in a place practically foreign to my kids, and my in-laws live, as I do now, in a state I myself hope to flee before the kids reach their teen years.\u00a0 There really is no perfect answer to this dark question, and my planning instincts feel thwarted when I try to puzzle out a possible solution. But here is what I hope in any event: - I hope that my children always live in a place where they feel accepted and loved.\u00a0 - I hope that they always have each other. Peaches is the best gift we ever gave the Rooster, and no one on earth will ever have her back the way that he does. Sure, he pounces on her back every chance he gets (and steals her snack as soon as she looks away), but if you dare so much as raise your voice slightly when addressing her, he will go all Brother Bear: \"DON'T you DARE talk like that to MY SISTER!\" - I hope that my children live somewhere that feels more like a village than like a bonfire of the vanities. I hope that they have plenty of exposure to arts, culture, diversity, opportunity, and very little exposure to drugs, materialism, excess, and violence.\u00a0 - I hope that my children will always hear about their parents' love, and have tangible proof of it all around them.\u00a0 - I hope that my children never feel like they represent a burden to anyone.\u00a0 - I hope that whoever raises my children feels lucky, grateful, and blessed. I know I do. This blog might not always show it, but I do. Beaten down as I am, thrashed and contemplating my possible demise, warped and skewed, I am grateful nonetheless.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/11/unwilling.html", "title": "\nUnwilling\n"},

But I get worse.\u00a0 My city is on fire, and instead of spending more time contemplating what those fires have cost in terms of lives and homes, I thought, why me? Why is it my kids can never breathe well, sleep well, rest... why can't we go outside? Friggin fires. Why do we have to spend the weekend indoors with towels around the doors and the air purifier and the humidifier and hot showers running...\u00a0All weekend, I thought, make it past this meltdown the kids are throwing, this tantrum, this fight, this mountain of chores, this endless To Do List, and please, please, please, please, let it be Monday soon. I need a break from my real life and I want to WORK, where things feel reasonable and sane.\u00a0 Not to excuse myself, but we have been sleeping on the floor for almost a week because the mattress that we ordered was toxic. Last weekend we spent all throwing up and worse. The weekend before I spent sick as a dog with fever and chills. This weekend my husband was out of the house a lot, so it was just the kids and me, locked in away from the smoky air, and I was counting down. Desperation. Facebook games alone got me through a rough evening patch, the way you hear someone stranded for days lived on Cliff Bars.\u00a0 Now, my daughter is really coughing, having trouble, in distress. When this happens I run to her, and my heart is full of concern, and my words to her full of love and reassurance, and I call the doc, and we get the meds, and I kiss her little face while we nebulize her with the machine that was a ritual for the rooster every day for over a year, and I can be in the moment, real, engaged, loving, ME, but then when I lay her back in her bed for the eleventh time, I am horrible again -- resenting that tomorrow I will not go to work, but spend yet another day with ... do I really say this with dread? -- my kids.\u00a0 People, all I ever wanted was my kids. I treasure them.\u00a0 But some days, I do decry, COME ON, one is autistic, one has the terrible twos, they have egregiously flawed immune systems, we have no family nearby, and I get a good night's sleep once every 14 to 21 days. Going on five sleepless years. COME ON. This is not family life. This is TORTURE. What am I doing?\u00a0 So yes I am horrible. But here is another horrible confession. Sometimes I worry when we finally come through this to any kind of \"other side\" -- like maybe when my two kids are old enough that they do not require heightened constant vigilance at every single solitary moment -- that I will be too old to enjoy any of it. I'll be like the bitter wife going through a divorce to the guy she put through med school screaming, \"I gave you the best year's of my life!!! And now this!!!\"\u00a0 These are my horrible, dark thoughts, that for some reason I feel compelled to spew in cyberspace. Guilt and insanity, I guess. I am going to donate to the Red Cross, get the news update on the fires, and try to stop thinking like an asshole. Wish me luck.

My husband ordered a new mattress to replace the 11-year-old one that sags miserably and hurts his back. The new - expensive - set came. It is toxic. I'd rather sleep in the Rooster's bed during his stomach flu, it smells that bad.\u00a0 And, don't think I didn't notice, there was a presidential election. I did, I swear, do my best to bask in it. I had all four computers in the house on abc, cnn, npr, and msn, and stole all the glances the kids would permit. I turned on the clock radio in the bed room and snuck in there each chance I got. The rooster, of course, did not allow me to watch any tv, but when I tried we at least had a moment of levity. He pointed to the screen and shouted, as he does on Sundays when I try to catch a Redskins score, \"I DON'T LIKE FOOTBALL!\" I told him, \"Son, that is not football. That is about the president of the United States.\" I pointed to the screen, where images of both candidates looked back at us. He stamped his foot and proclaimed, \"WELL, SHAME ON HIM!\" And he turned it off. Fine, I have an iPhone, and his bedtime is 8, so eventually I got to bask some. Everyone else in the blogosphere wrote about the magic and power and significance of the night so much better than I can, but I shared the goosebumps, the tears, the \u00a0chills -- and this was not about my infection or flu.

{"date": "Wednesday, October 22, 2008", "body": "\nIf you have a low threshold for potty talk, perhaps you should wait til my next post, and I won't blame you one iota. Personally, I'd rather talk about, read about, almost anything else, but I'm starting to panic that my 4-year-old, who TOTALLY understands what to do, who has done it on occasion, who has memorized the Potty Power song, really wants to keep his diapers, because he says he just doesn't like potties.  Potties , he tells me,  are gross .  Hmmmm .... what does he think DIAPERS are? Wet, soiled, disgusting, diapers never bother him, unless they are being changed. He has actually screamed at me, \"I want to  keep  my  poopy  diaper!!!!!!!!!\" Today I picked him up from the  afterschool   multiage  daycare room and he told me, \"Chris* says I'm stinky. Those are not nice words. I don't like it. He calls me stinky, mommy. Tell him I don't like that.\" I assured rooster that I certainly would have done that if Chris hadn't already gone home, and I certainly will talk to him about it, because those are not nice words. What I didn't say is that sometimes they are accurate words. Chris said it, but I've thought it.  Peee  ---  eww . Just like with all the other behaviors that trouble me, I do the guilt check -- you know the drill -- to see how my boy's latest issue stems back to my own failures. Is it because I tried too early to train him, or didn't try the method the neighbor swears by, or because I went for a long stretch not even bringing it up at all (waiting until he was \"ready\"), or because when he redecorated his room in brown  (YUCK) quite a long time ago I completely lost my marbles and perhaps traumatized him more than he traumatized me? Really, on this one, I don't care as much about the why of the issue anymore as I do about JUST GET THIS KID POTTY TRAINED ALREADY. I am bribing, and I mean  wayyyyyyy  beyond the candy bribes. I'm bribing like that book Eat Your Peas. (If you haven't read it, I have to tell you it's my fave among the  kiddy  books; the mother has  poofy  hair I can relate to and a familiar look of exasperation as she offers her kid candy factories, rocket ships, and a free lifetime pass on bathing if the kid will just eat the stupid peas.) I have made it clear I will take the rooster to Disney Land AND Lego Land AND buy him the remote control toy he wants if he uses the potty every day. The every day part is essential in reminding him of the bribe, because otherwise he screams at me, \"I ALREADY DID USE THE POTTY.\" Yes, rooster, you have used it four separate times over a course of a year. I want to scream back, but obviously don't, \"NORMAL PEOPLE USE IT EVERY SINGLE CRAPPY DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Yes, this is not a constructive thought, or a very nice use of the word \"normal,\" but that is why I tell  you , and not him. And you know what he retorts when I offer him every single thing he has ever said he has ever wanted? \"I don't like that toy, anyway. I like diapers. I don't want to go to Disney Land. I like diapers.\" A former doubter and skeptic, I have been converted to belief in unusual therapies since becoming a spectrum mom, and yesterday I skimmed through a book called (I think) The Boy Who Loved Windows (or something like that). In it, I read a mom's description of how a therapist showed her to rub her son's gums, palate, and teeth just so.  Shazam , within weeks the preschooler could dress himself and suddenly wanted to be potty trained. Cut to: Me, daring to stick my hands in the rooster's little maw, to no avail. At least this was cheaper than the three potty chairs I bought (free, in fact, as it was a library book, and the rooster has not bitten me or caused me in any other way to need medical assistance - YET) and didn't take my whole exhausted weekend before it failed. You see, I'm getting desperate. Don't tell me your techniques, just send your best voodoo magic. I'm too tired for techniques, and I'm all potty partied out. (I'm a party  pooper ?) Kindergarten is around the bend, and I need this boy wearing the forlorn pirate underpants crammed in his top drawer before he pops right out of his 5T  pullups  and I become the one redecorating the (padded) room in brown.

On lucky days, I squeeze in a shower, while the kids sit on the bath mat watching, commenting unfavorably. (LOOK at your TUMMY!) On unlucky days, I throw on whatever and barely manage brushing my teeth before I dive right in to the rituals:\u00a0 make sure I have one humongous-eater lunch and one gfcf (read: EXPENSIVE) lunch packed, along with daycare snacks (always red organic seedless grapes or the world will stop spinning) make sure I have the backpacks with requisite supplies (pullups, wipes, changes of clothes, blanket, MORE SNACKS, etc.) diaper and dress two unwilling participants who ought to be using a potty by now; then re-diaper them after they digest breakfast feed two demanding eaters eat my own breakfast, sharing bites with Peaches, who considers it tragic if I eat my own food alone brush teeth of slippery eels by coercion\u00a0 put shoes on children no fewer than four times Around 7:15, the arduous car loading (Where is my BATMAN? NO, I NEED SPIDERMAN!! GET HIM!), then commute begins. This is an exercise in juggling and magic. It is my job to distract, distract, distract. If I deejay just right with Beezus and Ramona on tape and Joe Scruggs songs, keep one finger on the wheel as I dole out MORE food, and anticipate arguments before they begin so I can head them off at the pass, maybe, just maybe, no one will bleed en route to.... 8:00 School. Okay, use your imagination. The dropoff at school is too painful on typical days to write about unless you want me to sink into deep depression. And I work there so I'm not allowed to curse at my children in the process. In fact, I am expected to smile at least a little. Never do I feel less dignified. Oh, except at the end of the day.\u00a0 8:20-4:30 I spend working, but on lunch and other breaks on typical days I call insurance companies, therapists, doctors, and pharmacies. I occasionally look through the viewing windows into my kids' classrooms to see Peaches playing doll babies and Rooster knocking down another child's Magnatiles construction or being carried away from circle time in a tantrum. I wander the halls carefully hoping no one will stop me to tell me what issue my child had just this morning in class. If my phone rings and I see certain extensions are calling me, it is gong to be typically BAD DAY. Otherwise, I just enjoy working really hard.\u00a0 4:30 The Peaches is tired, the Rooster is overtired, and, while carrying two backpacks and lunch boxes, I sign them out and lure them away from their play with promises of popsicles at home should we ever make it there. As we leave, several small people try to stop me, wanting to tell me how the Rooster upset them during the day, but my hands are too full to pay adequate heed, and thus I am even less dignified then I was in the morning, hastily dashing off apologies, dragging my kids, begging for cooperation. It takes an average of 23 minutes to wrangle the tornadoes to the car. You could make the trip without them in about 3 minutes. En route, we pass at least one or two of my dear friends/colleagues, whose warm good night wishes to the kids earn snarls and yelps in reply from the Rooster, and hiding behind my legs from Peaches.\u00a0 By 5 we are in the car, and by 5:45 we get home, having stopped the car at least 3 times on our 9 mile journey while I threatened to put them on time out on the side of a freeway. The rooster is not entirely to blame for this. He used to be, but now that Peaches is two, she has some terribles to get out of her system. Either one, two, or three of us have tears and snot flying by the time we make it to our driveway, and the floor of my Saturn has a new layer of filth that soon will make for a creative foot rest for the short people.\u00a0 by 7ish, daddy is home. Before his arrival, I have fed the kids, emptied and repacked their lunches, tossed in a load of dirty clothes, emptied the dishes that he ran before work in the morning, handled mail and bills, and we are deep into an episode of Sesame Street on DVR.\u00a0 It is time for my own dinner. Cereal? PBJ? Or microwave some chicken teriyaki? I ponder the exercise bike taking up all the breathing room in our bedroom. I am weary. Daddy will have to fend for himself for food. First, though, he's going to pour himself a cocktail.\u00a0 By 7:30 my husband and I have done medicines, diapers, toothbrushing, humidifiers, book reading, melatonin, vitamins, and behavior management. We have toyed with the concept of baths and resigned ourselves that this will wait. We make plans to divvy up the rest of the week's therapies, phone calls, and extra chores. We briefly wonder when we will look at potential schools for next year, decide about vaccines, replace our broken down car, and see our faraway families. We vow that soon we will see our own doctors and take care of our own maladies. We add more papers on the piles. We argue a bit, make up, sigh heavily, and probably I will cry just a little. At least once I will say, \"I miss my Grandma.\" At least 30 times the Rooster will have jumped from furniture. At least 10 times the Peaches will have tried to negotiate to stay up longer. The names they will have called each other range from the jargony made up ones (You're a DATCHER) to the gross (You POOTER), and their assault on one another will include poking, pushing, shoving, biting, spitting, grabbing, kicking, taunting, and screaming. We will tuck the children in with lullabies once or twice or thrice. They are, at last, lovely, beautiful darlings, and I kiss their foreheads repeatedly. Mmmmm, sweet foreheads.\u00a0 8:00 I will consider any number of useful activities I could do VERY QUIETLY (TV is OUT), and then end up playing a few quick rounds of WordTwist on Facebook before reading blogs and writing a post like this one (well, hopefully better than this one). I call this Therapy Time. It keeps me going. Really and truly, it is not optional. Once in a while this is a time to sneak in that shower, but on a truly typical day, my husband is soaking in the tub with the lights off nursing a headache, so I'll make do with a quick wash cloth and some extra Secret.\u00a0 9ish Make to do list with grand intent, with things like Send Birthday Card to Loved One, Change the Oil, Deposit Paycheck. Cram it in the overstuffed purse with the others.\u00a0 9:30ish If my eyes still hold themselves up, I will remember that I must do the right thing and close them, because 2:30 will be here soon, and I better be ready.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/10/day-in-life.html", "title": "\nA Day in the Life\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 20, 2008", "body": "\nPeaches is two and a half years old, and I think some law somewhere says that entitles her to a few free passes on behavioral expectations. As in: her reign of (near) saintliness had to end some time. And end it has. She asked for a cup of lemonade, and then proceeded to dump it on her head, for instance. Don't think for a minute I'm letting her just get away with it. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I have been reexamining closely my expectations for my NT child, and how they might reflect life with a kid on the spectrum. I don't know how many times the presenter at one of our school's inservice days used this same line in his speaking engagements, but I know 6 years later I still regularly think of him saying, \"Fair doesn't mean giving each child the same thing, it means giving every child what they need.\" I think this needs to be in the teaching Pledge of Allegiance. I don't have a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching, so I can't see having one to parenting, either. I expect different things from Peaches than I do from Rooster. It's not really quantifiable in terms of MORE or LESS, but it's certainly different. When Peaches poured lemonade on her head (and, consequently, the kitchen floor), I put her little butt on time out, loudly. What would I have done if Rooster had pulled the same stunt? Hmmmm. Hard to trust my hindsight, but I doubt I would have had the same level of reaction. The rooster doesn't have more trouble regulating his behavior because he's a BAD boy, but because his physiology plays a big part in it, and he can't help that. He, also, doesn't get a free pass that says AUTISM across it. But would time out HELP him? Not a chance. It helped Peaches -- she won't pull that stunt again -- so, to me at least, what might look like a double standard, seems fair. I bet some of you will disagree. I'm open. If I'm doing it all wrong, help me learn. Today one of my best friends left a gift in my mailbox at work: adorable little t-shirts, leggings, a skirt, a dress... all size 3T for my little Peaches. If you read this blog, you are expecting this part: I welled up when I read the card, saying Peaches deserved a Just Because gift. My guilt kicked in for a split second: did everyone think Peaches gets the short end of the stick at our house, with so much attention on the Rooster? No, it's not easy having a sibling on the spectrum, just like it's not easy having a child on the spectrum, but it has its gifts, too. And I'm not just talking about cute pink outfits, either. I hope that the Peaches will learn from her brother as much as she teaches him, that she will grow stronger and wiser, more patient and tolerant because of him, and that they will become friends in a way my brother and I never did. Mostly right now I hope we all survive the terrible twos and preschool.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/10/too-two.html", "title": "\nToo Two\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 27, 2008", "body": "\nThe Rooster began asking me in September: Is it Halloween yet? And, sadly, it still is not.\u00a0 He points to the neighbors' decorations, brightly lit up across the street, unmistakable from our naked windows -- five of them of them across our living room -- and pitches his frustration at my ears' pain threshold: YES IT IS HALLOWEEN TIME, LOOOOOOOOOK. IT IS IT IS IT IS. IT'S HALLOWEEN. I want to go get CANDY. NOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW! This is our first Halloween post autism diagnosis, and our first Halloween gfcf. Now, before I explain to you what a giant pain I find this in my giant rear end, let me tell you my little back story.\u00a0 I love holidays. Love em. You never saw a Jewish girl get Christmasy like I do. Oh, I don't go over the top with decorations or anything, I just get all drunk on symbolism and hungover on high stakes emotional expectation. Even I can't believe how quickly I turn from cynical pessimist into a drippy glop of mush shelling out $30 for every ugly ornament that says, \"Baby's First Christmas\" or \"2007: Our New Home\" and weeping over Passover stories on NPR. \u00a0 So you're wondering if you stumbled on to the wrong blog? Revising your whole mental picture of Rooster's mom?\u00a0 Even farther back in the back story: My childhood sucked. My dad got the very literal kind of drunk every holiday eve and puked all over symbolism. Then he fled the country and my mom worked every holiday eve, and spent every Christmas morning refusing to accept my thanks for the gifts she gave me, insisting on apologizing nonstop for not being able to buy me expensive clothes and jewelry I never wanted in the first place. Then, she met another drunk... When I left for college, I EMBRACED celebration. I considered myself all grown up and in charge of my own holidays, and I. Did. Them. Up. Right. I remember a particular Halloween dorm party where I met a cute cyclist named.... but wait. I digress.\u00a0 I couldn't wait to have a family of my own with HOLIDAYS. I do not discriminate about holidays or worry about such nonsense as whether or not they match my religion or whatever: my rule says that if food is involved, I will celebrate. Ramadan, not so much. Chinese New Year? Now you're talking.\u00a0 And now, in the face of the holiday season, I feel a little slack in the ho ho ho, if you know what I'm saying. I'm concerned how my family's EPIC sweet potatoes will turn out without the essential stick of butter this Thanksgiving. And Halloween? It's looking pretty scary.\u00a0 So this is what I did. I got online and ordered a gajillion dollars worth of gfcf candy, which got me about 14 servings, and then paid double for shipping. I have stuffed these sugary gems into environment-killing baggies, and tomorrow I will add to these baggies a note to our neighbors. It will beg them to give an atypical family a break. It will request that, when my kids say \"Trick or Treat\", they will hand them these organic gummy whatevers instead of the good stuff they hand out to the NT masses. Wednesday after my husband comes home, I will sneak out and reverse trick or treat down our little street, leaving these baggies at the houses with the inflatable ghosts and the static cling bats where I feel most likely to catch a break.\u00a0 It's a risky plan, and I doubt it will work. But I have to at least try. It's that, or go all bah humbug, and give up my Fa la la la las. Maybe by the time we're looking for gfcf fruitcake and gelt, I'll raise the white flag, but for now, I'm setting out to get our whole family drunk on all-natural gluten-free casein-free soy-free gummi bears and good times.\u00a0 Wish me luck.

Is he that stupid guy who thought he could do football commentary?\" No, that is the other aging Dennis Who Once Was Funny. So Dennis wrote a book, and he knew that his mother couldn't buy enough books to keep him in the lifestyle he assumed he deserved, so he thought he'd stir up business by stirring up the rancor of two people, minimum, per 150 births these days. He knew he could gain a few minutes attention with his comments, and then a few more with his (lame) apology (read: excuse).\u00a0 So I say he is smart, even if he is NOT funny. \u00a0From what I hear, when he IS funny, he has stolen the material, and is widely believed to have stolen much of it from a former friend who died of cancer. Classy.\u00a0 So I think Dennis probably knows a lot about brattiness and laziness - he seems like he has firsthand experience. Which, despite having kids, I don't think he has with actual parenting.\u00a0 Okay, so Dennis smart. But let's be smarter. Let's bury his name with this post. Let's not read him, or his book, or watch him, \u00a0or discuss him, let alone buy any of his recycled schlock. Let's not even Google his name, which, by the way, is NOT spelled Dennis. I just always get a tiny rush of pleasure from misspelling the names of people who otherwise make me sick. And as the (hard working, attentive, noncompetitive) parent of a child with autism, I need all the little pleasures I can get.\u00a0 By the way: I LIKE dark comedy. I don't think topics are \"off limits.\" I can make and enjoy good jokes about just about anything, including the dramas I live through first hand. I just have both a good sense of humor and a good sense of taste. Some of you blogging moms who are reading this now? You make me snort; I have sprayed my Coke all over my monitor sometimes while reading your posts. (Thanks for that Kia and Mara; what a mess.) You'd think professional comics would get what we all do: funny things have a grain of truth at least -- that's why we laugh.\u00a0 Dennis, you can kiss it.

{"date": "Sunday, October 26, 2008", "body": "\n Pixie Mama  wrote something today that struck so close to home I feel inspired to use this brief respite (the kids went for a ride with daddy) to blog instead of doing the other hundred things I claimed I was going to do.\u00a0 Pixie Mama said, \"I can't remember a time where I actually felt qualified to raise my own children. More often, I feel seriously  under  qualified.\" Me, too, Pixie Mama! Now, neither Pixie Mama nor I have degrees in special ed, neurology, psychology, or any other -ologies. But I do have a fair share of teaching credentials, and a Master's in Education, and I am starting to think I could teach a few -ists a thing or two.\u00a0 Before I hand out my wisdom, let me say too that my family has some absolutely wonderful helpers in our lives. I am grateful to every resource who has helped us learn and grow, and I always make that clear to them. But, like Pixie Mama, we've had our share of false prophets, too.\u00a0 So, inspired by Pixie Mama, here are five things I have learned from teaching -- things that I wish more experts in many fields knew: A child is an entire person, and you can't help part of my child if you forget about all the rest of him. Notice that if I teach your daughter literature, I don't tell you that her emotional well being, her vision problem, her math giftedness, her passion for violin, her chicken pox, your divorce, or her stutter are not my department. Nope, teachers care about all of that, care about your child as a whole package, see everything as relevant, incorporate it all into the process, because the process isn't really about LITERATURE, the process is about LEARNING.\u00a0 Giving directions or instructions is not the same thing as teaching. If you want to teach a person something, that means monitoring for understanding, readjusting as needed, welcoming exploration, and taking in to account the learner's needs. This is particularly true when you are dealing with grownups, and those of us with special needs kids sometimes have full, weary, aging brains. If you care that we get what you're saying, you might have to do more than talk; Notice that when we have a parent-teacher conference, I ask you about how things are going at home. I don't just launch in to a list of my expert insights into what you and your kid ought to be doing better and how I think it ought to be done. Giving directions or instructions is a one way street that might or might lead to a destination, but teaching is an infinite circle of possibilities.\u00a0 Kids don't have one way of behaving that never changes no matter where they go. If your son shows tremendous independence and initiative when he comes to my computer lesson, I don't assume that my four and a half hours with him in a week represent his entire personality, or that he dives in every pool without any support. When you tell me that the boy you've raised for many years actually tends to operate cautiously in your experience, I assume you know things about your child that I don't. I set out to teach the whole child, but I recognize that I only get a narrow slice of his or her time, and I can't become all-knowing in a semester.\u00a0 As a teacher, I view myself as part of a team. My teammates include my students, their families, their other teachers, and the administrators. We all have the same goal. We are not in competition with each other. If the kids succeed, we all win. If the kids struggles, we all need to pull together more. Key word: together.\u00a0 Finally, there is more to life than just what I teach. Whether I'm teaching writing, math, computers, or anything else, it isn't the be all, end all, start and finish of the universe. Sure, those subjects matter, but so does family time, so does rest, so does joy. Homework can be valuable; so can homeplay. (How cool is it when they both seem like the same thing?) I might not actually have had this realization from teaching. This one I think I learned from parenting, but I will not forget it ever again as an educator. I don't want every moment I spend with my child to feel like a therapy session that never ends. Sometimes \u00a0I just want to be a family.\u00a0 Since being a teacher has helped me parent, and being a parent has made me a better teacher, maybe it's no wonder I've come to prefer -ists who have kids of their own. Similarly, I've sought as friends people who know how to teach me things. \u00a0Like Pixie Mama, who is eminently qualified.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/feed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fimapixiemama.blogspot.com%2Ffeeds%2Fposts%2Fdefault"], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/10/everything-i-need-to-know-i-learned.html", "title": "\nEverything I Need to Know I Learned From Teaching\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 18, 2008", "body": "\nYes, I'm still trying to size things up. My mom can meet you for five minutes, not see you for six months, and pick out your wardrobe for a year without getting a single size wrong. She can hang out in your house for an hour and months later talk you out of the hutch you point to in the catalogue: \"You'll be sorry if you get that one; it's about six inches too wide and it'll always feel like it's in your way.\" My mom knows how to size things up. Also, she is not known for worrying. Most things I worry about make her say something like, \"A few years from now you will look back and this will just be a little thing you hardly even think about anymore.\" I do not take after my mom much. I still struggle all the time to judge the proportions of things. I struggle with sense of scope and scale. I go in the dressing room with sizes 6 to 14, never sure if any of them will fit. I do look back at some things I worried about five years ago and wonder why I lost so much sleep, and I reluctantly have to admit that mom was right. And I look at other things and wonder why I didn't think to worry about them more, as if the worry might have helped. (Mightn't it have?) When I was about 10, my mother left my father, my father left the country, I moved away from my home and school without saying goodbye, all of our money was gone, and the FBI wanted to have a few words with us about dad's \"business.\" I thought it was the end of the world, and anyone who met me that first year could tell it. I wasn't sure I'd ever make new friends in this small and insular town,  that  I'd ever forgive my parents for their secrets and deceptions, or that I'd ever go to college with my suddenly penniless mother having to work for minimum wage. It made me angry when my mom said, \"You'll get over it.\" I don't know how over it I got, but I made friends, even with my mom (who I adore), and I had more happiness at college than ought to be legal. When  I left my ex for his  infidelity , I thought I'd ruined my life by choosing a bad partner and wasting five years with him. I thought I'd never \"catch up,\" have true love, make babies, have the kind of family my parents couldn't give me. All wrong, of course. On the other hand, you don't want to hear all the things that I thought would be small problems, that turned out to grow and grow and grow. This time, I have this gnawing need to know: HOW BIG IS IT? This Autism Thing. It dances in front of the fun house mirror, and I don't know if it's a 6 or a 14, how much it's going to get in our way. I know that I don't want to waste too much time worrying about the small stuff, but nobody believes it's really ALL small stuff. I know that I don't want to overlook things that need taking care of. It's a conundrum. I know I have never worried as much about myself (and clearly I've worried plenty about my self) in the 30some years before kids as I have worried about these little people in the last five years. I know if, before kids, I had truly, completely understood how much and how deeply I would worry, I would have chickened out. I could not have gone through with it. Really, my perspective problem is at the heart of many of my problems. I read so many blogs by smarter, stronger, healthier mamas, and I envy those with the sense of proportion I lack.

When people have wanted to talk to me in the last month about my \"depression,\" I admit I have been defensive. Depression sounded like a condition I didn't want to have, another diagnosis to add to the heap around our house. I could almost agree with saying I \"feel depressed,\" which sounds so much more temporary, but still I wanted to bark back, \"OF COURSE I FEEL DEPRESSED, haven't you been paying any ATTENTION? YOU WOULD BE DEPRESSED TOO if you spent a day in my shoes (which, by the way, I DON'T THINK YOU COULD!!!)\"\u00a0 And I would say for the zillionth time to my husband, \"It isn't really about things being worse, it's about...\" And he would finish for me, \"...the war of attrition.\"\u00a0 \"Right,\" I would say. \"It's cumulative.\"\u00a0 \"Right,\" he would say. \"We're fried. Completely fried. And you are depressed.\"\u00a0 Okay, okay, so alright already. I have been depressed. I haven't had the energy to brush my teeth sometimes and my stomach has hurt a lot and it turns out medically speaking I'm fine, so I guess I've been depressed. Why is it I feel a need to justify it? Why is it I feel like saying, \"BUT...\" and describing the last five years, as if to defend my right to my sadness?\u00a0 I don't think there is anything bad about a person being depressed. Depression is not something to be ashamed of; it's something many people I love have battled.\u00a0 Maybe it's guilt. So many special needs parents out there handle harder circumstances with more grace. Maybe it's denial. I have been known to reside in the land of denial before, and as they say, it ain't just a river in Egypt. Maybe it's the exhaustion, though. I truly have felt like I don't have time to do anything about depression. Recently a friend asked me why I wasn't blogging, and if I was doing anything else for an outlet. I so appreciate that. It came from love. But, at the moment that I read her words, a whole rant erupted in my mind's blog: \"I don't want to DO anything! That's just it! I don't want to DO therapy or DO drugs or DO depression. I've been busy, I've been TIRED, I've been DOING autism, its therapies, its drugs, its endless DOING. And working. And parenting. And being a wife. And not feeling well. I DO every minute of every day and I don't want to DO depression. I am DO-NE.\"\u00a0 And when I listened to my own thoughts, I thought: Well, aren't I ironic. Better get up off my depressed butt and roll up my sleeves.\u00a0 So here I am again. Back to my \"outlet.\" Hoping some of you are still out there.\u00a0 Here's what I'm wondering:\u00a0 If you have a special needs child, or if you don't: Have you ever been depressed?\u00a0 And, if you are a special needs parent, how do you find balance?

{"date": "Tuesday, September 16, 2008", "body": "\nI admit with great shame how little I know about the hurricanes that hit our country, or how those of you in the affected areas are faring. (Though I have been sending good thoughts, of course.) What I know, I learned from the blogs I read. I wouldn't be able to name a movie made in the last year if I didn't drive down Billboard Strip on my commute, where the titles and the celebrity likenesses loom large enough that the Rooster points them out to me. I heard about the bum call in the Chargers/Broncos game from lunch room talk and thought I'd Google for the full scoop, but haven't had the chance. I just have precious little contact with the outside world. But two stories have penetrated my bubble, capturing my attention, and I'm dwelling. About the first -- the Sarah  Palin  story -- I am at a loss for words. But the other -- the train wreck in Los Angeles -- brings me to this blog to write tonight when really I should be sleeping, because I need to process it here. I live not too far from that terrible train wreck. In case it didn't penetrate your bubble, a Metro train and a freight train collided, killing and injuring many people. Now, if we turn on our only television, it's almost always for a Rooster to get his daily fix of Curious George. He doesn't really allow us to watch \"Mommy and Daddy TV,\" and we don't want the kids to see the news, anyway. Car time means kids books on tape. Internet time means blogging and email. But I have  snuck  a few minutes here and there to find coverage of this train wreck. Today, although I never had time for an official lunch, I dropped by the lunch room to find the newspaper. I have no idea why I feel so compelled to follow the tragedy, when I avoid tear- jerker  books, close my eyes during sad parts of movies. But today I read about how at least two of the victims in this latest train crash also had been victims of the previous worst Los Angeles train crash. One of these two men survived both crashes; he has terrible injuries, but he will leave the hospital in time. The other, a hero who rescued others during the first crash, did not make it this time. A tragedy. Reporters asked the man in the hospital: Does this make you lucky, since both times you survived, or unlucky, because twice you found yourself in train crashes. The question itself stopped me in my tracks for several moments as I thought about what my answer would be before I let myself find out his response. What do you think he said? What would you say? He said: Only time will tell. Sarah  Palin . Autism. There are a lot of things that fit that man's description: only time will tell. There are all kinds of train wrecks. There are all kinds of tragedies. The wife of the man who perished said, \"Last time, my husband came home.\" Such a tragedy. And yet I read someone who talked about why that man had continued to ride the train. Didn't he get scared from the first wreck? No, it said. He didn't chose to live that way. He liked his commute, liked the  camaraderie  of the train, didn't believe in living in fear. The person quoted said that if instead of dying in this second wreck, the man had lived but lost his legs, he would have wheeled himself on to another train to commute to work. I guess I'm thinking a lot about perspective. I am thinking about the perspective I have versus the perspective I want to have. I am thinking about tragedy and triumph, fear and courage, train wrecks and survival. To me it feels tragic to read of that hero dying in this latest crash. It also feels tragic that my grandma is gone. But which is worse? Would that man on the train have preferred the route my grandma's life took, at the end, or would she have preferred his ending? We all die. My initial reaction to that thought is a feeling of grief. But maybe I just need to work on my perspective. Yes, there are train wrecks, and yes, they are tragic. But maybe not everything is a train wreck. Maybe sometimes I make train wrecks out of little fender benders. Okay, I'm tired and I'm making exceptionally weak metaphors here, but what I'm processing here is what I have to learn from those two men who had been in both crashes. For one thing, the both kept on riding. They refused to let tragedy stop them. And the man in the back brace recuperating for a second time makes a good point; you can't have perspective on good luck versus bad luck so soon after the wreck. Only time will tell.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/09/wreckage.html", "title": "\nWreckage\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 10, 2008", "body": "\nWhat would you say if your doctor said, \"Tell me about your stress\"? When mine asked, I told him I didn't have a clue what to tell him about my stress. (Why didn't he just say, \"So, summarize the encyclopedia for me\"?) He wasn't taking no for an answer. I went in to talk about tummy troubles. I wanted to talk about my symptoms, and possible solutions. Again, as I am feeling worse and worse. I was a little annoyed at how much time he wanted to spend in chairs, blah-blah-blahing when I have been telling him for MONTHS that I have some issues going on. Physical ones. \"Tell me about your stress.\" So I told him, \"I have a lot of it.\" He said that is why he wanted me to tell him about it. What would you say? I mean, really, what would you say? Picture it. Your stomach hurts, you are not sleeping well, it's your third visit to this office, which means it's the third time you've dashed away from work, at this rate parking fee will hit the $14 max, and this guy has barely ever touched the  gizmos  in his little black doctor's kit. You're still sitting in chairs; you haven't even crinkled the paper on the exam table yet. He wants to chat. About your stress. I thought I felt my anger flare. But then I heard myself say quietly: \"My son is autistic.\" And my eyes welled up. \"My son is autistic, my daughter is two, my husband and I have demanding careers, we don't have family nearby.\" The anger seemed gone, and I felt very, very tired. \"I understand,\" he said. \"So what do you do for yourself to deal with this stress?\" And the anger came back again for a flash. \"Did I mention my son is autistic?\" He got me a tissue. Now, stress is NOT what is making my stomach hurt. It surely does not help, it may even exacerbate the problem. But I do have some medical issues going on, and eventually this guy got to that. He is a good doctor. I probably sound like I have an axe to grind with regard to doctors, and that is not true. I know some amazing doctors, women and men who I hold in the highest esteem. This doctor cares, he listens, he pays attention, and he offers solutions -- he might go about it a little slowly, but, hey, it beats the bum's rush. It is good -- no, it is  right  -- that he looks at his patients holistically, that he appreciates the role that emotion plays in overall health. What surprised me today is how I reacted. It's been months since our diagnosis, and I freely talk about my Rooster's struggles. I didn't realize I would still get annoyed by people hinting at my need to take yoga or get massages for a little  me  time that just doesn't jive with our reality. I didn't realize it would still make me well up to say, \"My son is autistic.\" I have often replayed in my mind conversations I've had, wondering how I might have done them better, what I might have said. I have thought a lot today about my answer to, \"Tell me about your stress.\" My own answer still shocks me on some level. I am sincerely curious: If the doctor said it to you, what would you say?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/09/tell-me.html", "title": "\nTell Me...\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, September 9, 2008", "body": "\nJ is one of my two favorite letters in the alphabet. J starts my husband's name, and it also comes first in the names of many amazing women in my life. Today, I struck gold with  Js . I love many things about my friend long-distance friend J, but one thing I particularly admire is her faith. I never feel comfortable talking about that subject -- faith -- here on this blog, and as a matter of fact I don't have a lot to say about it right now. I'm still swimming. But I do feel comfortable telling you about J, as I have a lot faith in -- her faith. It's powerful. It amazes me. Very early this morning, a difficult morning for many reasons (only one of which related to autism, if you can believe that), I opened my email to find kind words from J. I really needed it, and when she closed by saying she would pray for a bright spot in my day today, you know of course that I couldn't stop the tears of gratitude. You'd think I would have found a moment to write her back today, but life slammed me, and the first time I have had for writing anything came right now. Hopefully she's reading this (because, J, I know you'll approve of me flying in the face of my infamous bad-luck \"deities,\" and telling everyone about the bright spot you sent us). The bright spot brings me to another amazing J, the one who watches my rooster for an hour every day after school at the daycare program. In my opinion, this J has a tough job. She watches kids age 3 to 12 for two and a half hours after school each day. She supervises their play, feeds them snack, manages their comings and goings, coordinates their study activities, and deals with their parents. Needless to say, it can get chaotic in daycare. But J handles it with grace. She has excellent experience; before she came to work for us, she worked with special ed kids in the public school system, so she has learned patience and creativity, and she also is the sister to one of my former boyfriends, so I  KNOW  she can handle challenges! (Just kidding, R.) Still, mixing in my wild child, still in diapers and exhausted by 3:30 each day, well, where I come from down South, people would say J \"has more than she can say grace over.\" Once in a while she needs to call me early to say the rooster can't quite handle the whole hour of daycare, and I appreciate that. If J says it, I believe it. She doesn't pull any punches. Today I walked in to the daycare room a few minutes early. I didn't feel well, not well at all, and I wanted to get the kids in the car as soon as I could and head home for some medicine. When J saw me coming, she got  the look  on her face -- the look that says, \"I need to talk to YOU.\" I suddenly felt much worse. Very sick.  Oy . I thought about telling her, \"Sorry, can't talk, not well...\" But you can see the bright spot coming, can't you? She wanted me to know that a new boy came to daycare today, a boy the same age as the Rooster. The two came in hitting each other, which is not okay. But then the other boy wanted to play cars, and there were none left. He grabbed one from another child, but J made him give it back. All of a sudden, the Rooster says, \"Here! I have two. You can have one!\" I waited. J's lips had stopped moving. This story did not sink in, did not add up, did not seem complete at first. An awkward pause lingered. Maybe she didn't know how to say the rest? I said, \"And then he grabbed it right back again?\" \"No!\" J  laughed . \"Look! They are still sharing!\" My poor iPhone. I used up the entire battery clicking pictures of the Rooster with his... with his... oh, I am sorry long-distance J, I haven't come as far as I thought. I can't put all the good words out there. After all, we still have to survive again tomorrow in the world with all our  dysregulation  and  idiosyncrasies . But let's just say I got some good pictures of the Rooster with his ... NOT ENEMY (YET). I send good thoughts out to all of you. If you want to send thoughts of us, please make them for  more bright spots . We would be ever so grateful.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/09/light.html", "title": "\nLight\n"},

If you don't let me know how, I will research and find out, and I will pass along the information that you did not let me know along with the rest of this letter. It might not be effective, but writing it and sending it are the only satisfaction to be had when dealing with your dreadful organization. I am writing to tell you why you have not JUST lost my business permanently online and in your brick and mortar store, but why I will share my story with everyone I know, just as I used to tell them how convenient I found your service. What I hope that you learn is that you clearly do not understand your market. It really should be obvious that people use your online service because they can't get to the store, and they NEED what they NEED as conveniently as possible. Why on earth would you have a \"no  substitutions \" option on your grocery order form and then repeatedly insist on sending substitutions anyway? And why on earth would it be that my complaints by phone, online, AND in person to the driver do not one bit of good and only waste my precious time? I have been reassured repeatedly over a period of months that my account would be marked \"absolutely no substitutions.\" This is not about me being a difficult customer. As I have explained to no avail, this about me being a working mom to an  autistic  child, and when you substitute the gluten free items I carefully select with garbage he can't eat, it infuriates me. YES, I had developed the habit of checking my groceries as they arrived, which is a CHALLENGE I don't want or need, but last time you delivered I had a babysitter so that I could attend a meeting at my child's school, and I came home to find bags full of gluten filled  Snappea   substitutions  and other JUNK that we can't eat and I don't have the time to return. I don't have the time to write this letter, in fact, but I will make time, just as I will to find your corporate headquarters' address, spread the word to all I know through my blog, and find the time to shop at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and any other store but yours. Your customer service people are rude and ill-named; there is no service there. You are a failure at all the reasons why I choose to shop online - convenience and time savings. I hope whoever is responsible for the shambles there spends some time needing help from  DMV  in the near future; you need a taste of your own medicine.

{"date": "Saturday, September 13, 2008", "body": "\nDear Hotel Manager, I decided to write to you because I knew if I tried to explain this to you aloud I probably couldn't get through it. My husband and I live down the street from here, about 1.25 miles. We admire how beautiful this place is, and when my mom comes from the East Coast I am hoping she will stay here. We have two beautiful children who we adore, but, honestly, look at us -- we are a wreck. Now, I know probably a lot of people feel this way! Lots of families never get enough rest. But I think we might get fewer hours of sleep than most. Our oldest child, who we nicknamed the Rooster, has autism. He keeps us going a million miles an hour all day, but then he doesn't rest well at all at night. He has to take herbs to try to help him sleep. We call him our Rooster because we awaken to his crows. And our youngest, our 2-year-old daughter, has started waking up several times every night. For three and a half years, we never got a whole night's rest. Now it's better than that, but not what you would call  normal ... one or two nights a week, we might both get a good seven hours of shut eye. It takes its toll, physically and mentally. Eventually we run out of the necessary steam we need to run a home with two working parents, two high maintenance children, and autism. None of our family lives here, but we are very lucky we do have someone who knows our children well, loves them fiercely, and once in a while can  babysit for us. We have her for four hours tonight, Hallelujah! Some people would go out for a fancy meal, a movie, or a show. Those things sound wonderful to us, too, as they are not part of our lives these days. But what sounds better to us? A nap. Blackout curtains. Fluffy pillows. Maybe - but not necessarily - a soak in a warm tub. We came to rent a room. For just a few hours. Can we? We have heard that your hotel doesn't do that -- I assume that is about illegal activities that might happen when people check in for a few short hours. I can promise you this: the most excitement that will happen in our room -- if you agree to let us book one -- will happen in our dreams, because we really don't have the energy for real life  excitement . We would be the easiest guests you ever had. Please consider our request. We aren't rich, and this isn't a splurge we could ever do on a regular basis. And we wouldn't even ask if we didn't feel desperate for the sake of ourselves and our kids. Please will you let us get the break we need so we can go back and be able to successfully meet the needs of our challenging family?

They need me to tell them that something - anything - got better here. They love me, love us, enough to call, to ask, to listen, many times over, and I understand their support fatigue.

{"date": "Monday, September 1, 2008", "body": "\nWe got a babysitter. For three hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now, it might be my journalism background, but usually overuse of the exclamation point offends my sensibilities. Just like huge fonts in banner headlines, it must be justified. Let me assure you, the punctuation is warranted. We had. A. Terrible. Terrible. TERRIBLE weekend. Three days of terrible, of LABOR, thanks for nothing federal government. Today? ROCK. BOTTOM. Very bad. The brink. You could sense the hopeless by NINE A.M.  yesterday, with still a day to go. And we are morning people. By ten, I looked at my husband and said, \"CALL THE SITTER. Text her. Tell her we'll take ANYTHING. We'll pay ANYTHING. Beg, if you must, but please CALL THE SITTER.\" He  texted  her to keep from frightening her with the combat noises in the background and negotiated enough to arrange for her to come today at 4 p.m. We quickly did the math and realized we had a long way to go, so we tried all our best tricks. By today, I had such an upset stomach I considered going to the E.R. But four finally came. In the last forty minutes, I managed to hide most of the evidence...er, clean up a little, make the kids' dinners, lay out their supplies, write the sitter a note, prepare Peaches to like the sitter who had only  previously  watched her brother alone, pack lunches for tomorrow, and take off the filthy clothes from spending a day with snarling beasts...er, my kids. Four came, and so did the sitter. I warned her, I thanked her, I prepared her, I encouraged her, I told her she was saving our lives, not just our sanity. I promised to be home on time, seven sharp. I admitted we had no idea where we would be, just OUT, and I promised to have cell phone in hand at all times. I kissed the snarling... I mean darling... children, and I ran. The cell phone rang after an hour. It rang as we sat eating cheap comfort food that was too spicy for my still knotted, rotted, throbbing belly, and I knew when it rang who it would be. After all, most of our friends have all but given up on calling me. I knew who it would be, but still I had a shock in store... The sitter called to say: he fell asleep. The rooster went in his room and put himself to bed. At six p.m.  Right after biting his sister -- hard -- on her hip, he took a bath, got out, and cratered, completely unprompted. She wanted to know: should she wake him? Good Lord, when the child who never slept for the first three years of his life VOLUNTARILY goes to sleep, I imagine he MUST BE TIRED, so I said thank you, thank you, no. Please let him sleep. I knew he'd wake before we returned, and then a little Melatonin would help him get even more rest. At seven, we walked into some strangers' house. Looks like ours, but quieter. Subdued. Like ours, two kids live there, but these two clean smelling souls wearing matching pajamas spoke to us quietly before politely saying goodbye to the sitter. The sitter, by the way, thinks I'm just a crazy drama queen. I actually love that. Otherwise no way on earth could I afford her. It seems both children slept a little in our absence, and it had done them a world of good. (We tried so hard to get them to nap all day that we even drove them up and down the freeway -- forgive us, Earth -- in holiday weekend traffic in one of the most  trafficky  cities in America, with books on tape and everything short of a swinging pocket watch, to no avail.) With three hours of normalcy, of being able to look one another in the eyes and be a couple, of being able to debrief and comfort one another, of being able to BREATHE, my husband and I also came back a bit restored. At seven, we all settled down together for story time. The Rooster's scary voice had been replaced by the voice we cherish, and after Peaches showed us her bite  booboo , everyone seemed mollified. We got through the nighttime routines without blood shed. So what I'm telling you is, we made it through another day. I can read the words of wisdom in the comments and in my email and feel the welcome support and contemplate facing another day again tomorrow. I'm not looking for an open window... Because WE GOT A SITTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now, you go get one too, you out there who needs one. Sell something on EBay if you have to, but get out for three hours. And keep passing open windows.

{"date": "Thursday, September 4, 2008", "body": "\nWell, today the teachers described the day as \"Bumpy.\" I always appreciate this euphemism they use. It evokes, for me, the image of a rash, or knots forming on recently bumped heads, or sandpaper, and it really works better than the words I use when people ask me about the weekends. Those words I can't print here - this is a family show. So, the school day was bumpy. Then, I heard my name paged a half hour prior to when I usually pick up the rooster from daycare. Rooster's AMAZING teacher needed to let me know that he melted down completely after knocking over a child's construction and then refusing to apologize. She wanted to know: Could I come? Yes, bumpy. But once I picked up the rooster, I expected things to go downhill quickly. I figured picking up his sister would take things from bad to worse, and I braced for more. We found Peaches playing with one of her new teachers in the gym, which was other unoccupied because after school activities don't begin for a week or so. Peaches and her buddy IF were racing around the empty space playing with balls. Rooster ran in, ready to steal away the cool new shiny soccer ball, but did I mention Peaches' new teacher is young, fit, smart, savvy, and rides a motorcycle? She immediately sensed the situation and managed to subtly tweak it to get the rooster and IF involved in what could look for all the world like a game of soccer. A game. Together. On the same team. Within 30 seconds she manipulated them into cooperation like a snake oil salesman. It was beautiful. I truly almost cried for all manner of reasons as my boy managed to just barely keep up with a child half his age but together kick the ball into the net. To. Geth. Er. I walked up to hot new teacher and asked, \"Do you have experience working with special needs kids?\" And she said, while still managing six kids age 6 months to 4 1/2 with one other teacher, \"Well, just a little working with a couple of high functioning autistic kids.\" I just pointed at the Rooster, who has barely met this teacher. She and I both knew as we watched him that he'd love to steal the ball, knock IF on his face, and run for the border, but she continued to pull the strings and work the magic of at least the appearance of kiddy cooperation, and no one got hurt or sad. She said, \"Yeah, I kind of just started to get that vibe when you guys came in, I mean, like, I worked with boys who were super high functioning and all, but like the Rooster they weren't so good at... well, what is the word I'm looking for?\" I wanted to buy her presents and hug her for her generous way, for her skills and her comfort in the face of discomfort. She was still running the game, watching the babies, checking on the other teacher... \"Socialization?\" I offered. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Thanks. They just needed help with socialization, with playing well with other kids.\" All of a sudden the rooster knocked down little IF in a calculated move to make it look like an accident. The teacher never missed a beat, \"Wow, IF, great recovery, that was great. I think the rooster is going to pass you the ball now so you both can score! Great, you guys, run! Run! Run!\" And they ran. And the ball. Went in. The goal. And the boys. Were happy. Both of them. For over a minute, no less. I wasn't taking any chances. Desperate to leave on a high note for once, I grabbed my kids and dashed to our car, promising popsicles at home for everyone doing soooooooooo well in the gym. Tired, they barely tried to kill each other in the car. They actually stared out their windows in silence once in a while, and no hostile words were exchanged until the last few blocks of the drive. And so we survived the second day of school. With only one more day to go, some would call this a short week, but they would be wrong. It is not a short week. The way I see it, it is the bumpy start to a very long year.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/09/bumps.html", "title": "\nBumps\n"},

We have a sliding scale here, and low standards. Or, to get specific, this is what passes for a banner day for us (and I know without any doubt that we are unlikely to have more such days in our immediate future): The blood tests the Rooster needed got him to school less than an hour late, and his father took him this time. The third shadow assigned for fall actually showed up for the first day of school only half an hour late, but had a good excuse and seemed like she might really work out and actually have a commitment to showing up on a regular basis. Though she has to leave early every day this week. The consultants coming to my important meeting for work showed up 35 minutes late and kept my bosses and me waiting awkwardly, but they had good ideas and showed real potential. I just don't think we'll be able to afford them. Balancing my mommy job at school and my school job at school did not keep me from eating real food during a real lunch period. Someone even shared their fruit tart with me for dessert. So much for dieting. The biting incident that happened in Rooster's class DIDN'T INVOLVE HIM. (For this, I did a happy dance.)

And by the way, I'm craving more, so look out,  Wawa .\" If special-needs-parenting blogs had caloric content, I'd need gastric bypass tomorrow. It looks like this. Any time I am not at work, I have my husband's laptop, my kid's desktop, or my own iPhone open to Google Reader. There, I pull in about twenty-some blogs about autism (and about education). When I have read them all, I begin to read their  blogrolls . When I have read all the blogs by the  bloggers  followed by the  bloggers  I follow, I Google for more. What on earth is it I'm trying to find? On the face of it, it's a mystery. After all, twenty-something blogs I read provide me a healthy diet of what I have needed, wanted, sought. I read the blogs of smart, caring, wise, intuitive moms who face daily challenges and serve as a good example to me. You'd think I could read them once, digest, feel satisfied, grow. I care deeply about so many kids I've never seen, and it's a huge blessing. I also gain tremendous friendship,  camaraderie , community, and have no excuse for feeling lonely. But beneath the surface, maybe I'm doing more than comfort binging? Maybe I still think, okay, autism, but what else? What else are we dealing with in our Rooster? Okay, he's autistic, but he's also so freaking DARK. The darkness doesn't show up much in my reading. In fact, I read so much LIGHT. It can't just be that all parents BUT ME are able to see past the dark and write only about the goodness, can it? Am I that skewed? Maybe my  blogmarathon  means I'm trying to figure out if that is the situation, or maybe I'm trying to diagnose this darkness, or, forgive me if this offends you, cure it. The rooster is so angry all the time lately. He scares me. I scare me. What I see of me in him scares and depresses me. It's the rage. This rage. We all have bits of it in us, don't we? I have always thought of my bits as healthy bits, of expressions of not settling for less, of fuel I can use when I need to fight. I don't watch movies, don't like them, but a friend told me once that my occasional anger reminded him of the film Red Dawn, when one character says to another (something like): \"You got a lot of hate in you, boy.\" And the ME character replies without missing a beat, \"Keeps me warm.\" Maybe my own rage is more of a problem than I realize. Maybe it's bigger than I thought. But I'm more worried about his rage than mine. Lately the rooster is on fire. Just like when we first floated the autism question, I scoured the Internet for proof, found blogs, dove in, felt kind of at home. But the truth is, I never found the Rooster's rage described in the autism  blogosphere . Doesn't mean he isn't autistic. Just means maybe there is more. Yeah, I've started reading bipolar blogs, too. I think soon my husband is going to snip our wireless router. And, again, I don't like movies, but I remember bits of an old movie called What's Eating Gilbert Grape. I can't remember much about Gilbert except that he had special needs, but I can tell you this: I am feeling a lot like his mother these days. If I remember right, I think she ate so much and grew so large she couldn't leave her house. Sure I need to lose ten pounds, but I feel just like her on the inside lately. The way I remember it, Gilbert Grape's mom was looking for something she couldn't find. Keeps me warm.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/09/binge-and-purge.html", "title": "\nBinge and Purge\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 29, 2008", "body": "\nMy husband and I try to remain equally present in both of our children's lives. We alternate turns at doctor's appointments, teachers meetings, and therapy sessions whenever work keeps us both from being there together, and we trade off with the kids, in our quest to keep things as balanced as we can. I may not be all that great at balance, truth be told. (As if you couldn't tell.) Earlier this week I found myself in a strange place -- at the orientation for Peaches' toddler program. Yes, my two-year-old starts school this coming Wednesday. I know I mention this a lot, but I work at the school my kids attend. I work there, and yet somehow it never really hit me that my daughter would officially become a student -- move from the faculty childcare center to an actual classroom -- until I found myself sitting across from her teachers, my friends, and listening with the other incoming parents to them talk about the curriculum. Curriculum. I heard them announce that the children need to come with backpacks and my mind temporarily spun into another orbit, sought to recalibrate for the sudden gravitational shift. I looked at my name tag for a moment, and it helped me catch my bearings, help me assimilate the knowledge that I sat in that meeting as Mother of Peaches, new student, and I began smiling thinking with some excitement of back to school shopping for a fancy new pink backpack. Not long after I started to breathe normally again, the president of the parent association gave her welcome. This is where I lost all hope of balance. After describing her role as parent association president, she announced that she had once been the classmate of one of the toddler moms in the room, and that the two of them met for the first time when they were two years old. A dad in the room spoke up that he is an alum. Everyone began to get very  Kumbaya  on the topic of embarking on lifelong relationships, and how our kids would start together in the sand box, and then someday attend one  another's  weddings. I couldn't believe it when I started to weep. No, I didn't get swept away by the presentation or in the beauty of the journey Peaches would begin in a matter of days, though I know that is probably what I should have done. Instead, as I'm sure you can guess, my involuntary reaction had to do with what my rooster will miss. My rooster will not graduate from this school. We are lucky to have him there one more year until he is five and public school can offer him full day classrooms that can meet his special needs. The parents in his class and I will not sit next to each other at Winter Sings and Open Houses and Secondary Schools and reminisce about quickly time passed since our kids rode trikes and sang Wheels on the Bus together. And that isn't the end of the world. The rooster will find a right place somewhere, somehow, and form connections of his own - I have to believe that. And I can't let every typical event for Peaches turn into a  grievathon  for my rooster. But in that moment, what should have been Peaches' celebratory moment of entering school, I fell once again into the abyss of fear for what this year will bring for my Rooster, just one classroom away, but worlds apart. He will have outstanding teachers again this year, a rich curriculum, and a cool Diego backpack, he will be supported and nurtured and loved, but we are planning this year as the end of his journey at this school for typical students, not the beginning. He did not move on with the kids he started with last year, but is repeating the three-year-old program, a head taller than some of his new classmates, yet teased by them because he still wears diapers, and when this year ends, he will say goodbye to his current class, he will say goodbye to the school he shares with his sister and me as our second home. Right now I have no idea where he will go next, but what I hope for most of all is a place where he can learn how to be more comfortable in his own skin. A colleague and friend sat next to me during orientation; she is also the mother of Peaches' friend and classmate. She looked at me in horror when my eyes welled up, and I'm sure she thought I'd become overly sentimental. \"Are you crying?\" she asked. I think I nodded. \"The rooster,\" I whispered. She looked at me, got my meaning, and said, \"But you need to be happy for Peaches.\" This is very good advice. It's true. I know it. I am happy for Peaches. We bought that Tinkerbell backpack yesterday, and we celebrated, just Peaches and me. But I also can't seem to help worrying about when she might leave her big brother behind, and how he will feel when he understands that we can't all be together anymore.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/08/pre-school.html", "title": "\nPre School\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 28, 2008", "body": "\nDear Teachers, When I sat down to write to you a little about the Rooster in preparation for the coming school year, I realized it might seem a little lame to you at first, as you already know him and have worked with him. But then I realized just how much I have learned about him just in the last couple of months, as well as how much he is changing, and I hoped maybe you'd find reading this helpful. Or, maybe really I just needed to write it for my own self, my own way of facing the transition to another school year with my little guy. While I admit I had moments in the beginning when I doubted the diagnosis of autism, I don't anymore. (Believe me, I always knew we had issues! I just wasn't sure the right name for them.) I don't think I understood all the faces that autism can have. In fact, now that I've read countless books, articles, web sites, blogs, I still don't see that many autistic kids who seem to match my boy, but I also understand the concept of a spectrum much better than I used to. You can have 30 kids with ASD in a room, and they can all be different from one another. Spectrums and continuums have a lot in common, which is to say that they have infinite variations. What does autism mean for the rooster? Language delays, and pragmatic weakness. Disregulated behavior. Sensory challenges. Digestive Problems. Health Issues. We had him on some medicine that seemed to help a lot. Great, right? Well, no. You see the medicine had side effects. Those side effects had the potential to seriously impact the rest of his life. We knew the chances of side effects were slim, but once we saw that our boy began to show signs of them, we knew we could no longer take any chances. He is no longer on the medicine. Yes, that makes him harder to work with. And that makes me sad. However, I have to think that having been on the medication allowed him to show what he is capable of, and somehow we have to access that stronger, happier, better adjusted boy through other creative means. It is not easy. There is no one I have more faith in than all of you. There is no one I have more gratitude for than you. I know we are on a team to help the rooster overcome autism, and so I want to help in any way I can. Language delays, and pragmatic weakness mean that the rooster might have a plentiful vocabulary, but putting words together is so hard for him that he often makes up his own words (jargon, like \"eeling\" or \"floppydodah\" or \"durst\"), or he \"scripts\" from books or television. He tells stories that sometimes seem plausible but are entirely made up, cobbled together from a cartoon he saw, a story he heard on the radio, and the book he heard at bedtime. I don't know how many times people come up to me and say, \"Hey, I heard all about how you....\" They think we went to Disneyland, spilled ice cream all over the kitchen floor, got a new dog, and none of that happened, except on Nickelodeon and in Fancy Nancy and in our boy's imagination. That is the cute part of his language issues. Of course, you've seen the uglier parts. He doesn't always know what people are asking of him, and he pretends like he does, and then his temper rages. Or he feels a frustration he can't articulate so he screams, pushes, or shoves. Or he wants to play with someone and can't figure out how to ask, so he gets in their face. This is not an act of aggression as much as it is his compensation for deficits, language deficits and social deficits. Lately we've been trying to give him \"do overs\" -- if he screams, \"Get away!\" to his sister, I will say, \"What you meant to say is, \"Please don't touch my Legos, I'm still using them. Then I know your sister will say, 'Okay, I will play when you finish.'\" Sounds obvious, but I admit it shocked me how well he took to this strategy, and how well it was received by his sister. Disregulated behavior. Well, doesn't that just sound overly euphemistic?! I know, sometimes I just feel like screaming at his bad behavior. It scares me sometimes and angers me frequently. But I have to keep remembering that the experts in the field all tell me that his behavior is a way of telling me how he is struggling, and that the best strategy is to prevent situations that rile him up rather than trying to put out fires. We put up a rope swing in our yard and bought him a sit-and-spin, and getting him to do this helps with his behavior at home, but nothing works all the time or one hundred percent. I also have learned that autism cannot be cured with discipline. Time out means nothing to him, though we use them to give us a minute to cope! Sensory challenges. The rooster never saw without double vision until last year, plus he was born with low muscle tone, and these things clearly have contributed some sensory problems. He also cannot gauge pressure. He hugs too hard, holds crayons too tightly, etc. He used to scream if anyone touched his head, but that stopped when he had eye surgery. He really seeks pressure, loves the sensation of spinning, and craves being in water. Sometimes when he seems aggressive, it turns out one factor has to do with these sensory issues. Sometimes it's a complete mystery to me, but a mystery I hope some day to unlock if I am patient. Digestive Problems. Now, I don't want to give you too much information here and gross you out, but the rooster has never digested well. Turns out that this is a huge commonality among kids on the spectrum. Dietary interventions make a substantial difference. This is NOT the only reason we do dietary interventions -- we do it because he is SO ALLERGIC and we see a cognitive benefit from the diet, but more on that after this digestive issue. I want you to know that for a period of many months we wrote down every single thing our boy ate, how his health and digestion were, and how his language and behavior seemed. This was tedious, but worth it. Turns out that when he's not digesting well, his behavior worsens. Makes sense, of course, but still helped me understand him better. We are so grateful for your support adhering to his diet. Health issues. This little guy saw so many doctors and specialists, had so many prescriptions, suffered so many infections, that we felt that he needed to go live in a bubble. My journal indicated he got an infection before he was six months old, as well as exhibited allergy symptoms, and about two and a half years later still seemed like neither had never gone away, only worsened. Two surgeries, several blood tests, three allergy panels, 11 doctors, and endless allergy-proofing later, we decided on our own to try that wacky diet business we'd heard about and poo-pooed because there was nothing left to try. Guess what? He has not had a SINGLE infection since the day we started, SIXTH MONTHS AGO. I have to eat my Jenny-McCarthy-bashing words; diet is amazing. Sixth months without an infection feels to us like a miracle. Again, though, nothing is perfect; even with vast improvement, I would never call him the picture of health or anything. So what is this diet all about? It's about keeping our son breathing and thinking, and it's hard work, but well worth it. He is on a gfcfsf diet. It's free of gluten, casein, and soy. That means he can't eat pretty much anything you buy in the ordinary grocery store except for raw fruits and vegetables, juices free of artificial ingredients, steamed rice, and certain meats. We avoid everything artificial and buy as much organic as we can get. We will send in everything he needs to eat, and he's usually pretty happy with his choices, as he adores sweet fruit and crunchy organic veggie snacks. He's a good, healthy eater. Yes, it's hard when he sees a cupcake with sprinkles he can't have. But we are ready to do what it takes to get him specialty treats when he needs them. He can have popsicles that have all natural ingredients, and those usually win a smile from him. How I wish they -- or anything -- provided a good bribe for my boy, something that would encourage him to do any of the trillion things he refuses (brushing teeth, potty training, changing diapers, cleaning up, taking medicine, sharing, etc), but so far I have found him entirely unfazed by carrot or stick; what drives him is, I think, far more chemical or neurological or just plain hard wired than it is rational enough for bribes or threats. He is a complicated little guy. He has been since the day we met him. Even then, he didn't want to cooperate, born late and requiring a vacuum assist 32 hours into labor, stuck because he had his small fist raised to his face as he howled his way into the world, and within hours in the nursery the nurses asked us to take him in our room as he kept waking all the other babies. But he also loves fiercely, and he loves his school, loves his teachers, loves being a part of his community. He can't always tell you himself, but I can. We all walk around the house singing the planets song, we all enjoy seeing the handmade treasures from your class around our house, we all value your wisdom and your kindness, we all start this school year with thanks, respect and warmth, along with our anxiety. I don't know if this letter helped you at all, but I know I feel better. Happy Fall.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/08/back-in-business.html", "title": "\nBack in Business\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 29, 2008", "body": "\nI screw up this special needs parenting thing a lot. Probably every day at least once. But I know for sure I am not a total failure. At least, I know my son feels my love sometimes, that something of it gets through, that he feels much more than just anger toward me. Here's how: One night months ago, the rooster got sick late at night. He threw up. I got him clean and stripped his bed and gathered the things he needed, then we went to our leather sofa together. I propped him on top of my body so he could sleep almost sitting up, and I put a trash can and several bags on the nearby floor. Every time he felt sick, I helped him, held him, hugged him, whispered reassurances. \"It's okay, rooster, it's okay. I'm here, I can help. You'll feel better soon. I love you. It's going to be all okay soon. Don't worry, baby, I've got you.\" We'd sleep an hour, then repeat, all night. Lately, the rooster is  disregulated  much of the time. He contorts his face into hostile expressions and  juts  his neck toward us and snarls, \"I'm ANGRY!\" For a while he will be fine, especially if he's listening to a book, watching TV, building, or playing outside. But even then he can change his mood unexpectedly. He hits, pushes, pulls hair, pinches, spits, sometimes with no explanation, sometimes just after smiling and playing. I admit sometimes I overreact, sometimes I cry, sometimes I get upset. This does NOT help, of course. But after an episode, if the rooster seems to feel how much his rage shook me, he sometimes climbs on my lap to talk. No, he can't explain what just happened, and he doesn't apologize. He doesn't particularly want to talk about it. I can't always figure out what he wants to tell me. But sometimes it is in these moments that I know he feels my love, that some things are getting through. Sometimes what he says is this: \"Remember I  throwed  up? Remember, mommy? Remember us on the sofa?\" I say, \"Yes,  Roo , I remember.\" And sometimes he says, \"You helped me  throwed  up, mommy. You did that.\" And I say yes, \"Yes,  Roo .\" And he puts his head on my chest. We have this little routine we do, when the Rooster feels amenable. Peaches does it too. I say, \"How much does mommy love you?\" And the kids' line is: \"So big!\" Then I ask, \"For how long?\" They say, \"Forever!\" Finally, I ask, \"Who loves you more than mommy does?\" Every time they shout, \"NOBODY!\" it makes me smile.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/08/so-big.html", "title": "\nSo Big\n"},

{"date": "Monday, August 25, 2008", "body": "\nThis is the last week of summer vacation for my rooster, and the last week of my head in the sand. I share the collective ulcer with many of you dreading a new school year. The only acid relief I get comes when I write. I've been working on a letter to his teachers. How weird is that? I mean, he will be in the same room he was in last year, 2 of his 3 teachers have known him more than a year, and one of them has known me for about 14 years, and I'm writing them letters to explain us... but alas, it's all I have by way of medicine. Today was the last time babysitter A could watch my boy this summer. She is one of our blessings, one of the super stars we've lucked into. When I got home, and told rooster to say goodbye to her, he didn't understand it was her last day. He told her, \"Tomorrow, A, let's go on a date!\" She laughed and told me they had watched Rachel Ray on TV talking about \"date night\" and he'd been asking her out ever since. Tomorrow the Rooster will have a sitter we got by referral. She watches kids up and down the street. I interviewed her, my husband checked her references, and she has special needs experience. Sounds good. But all the rooster's other sitters knew me before they knew him. We felt connected. This time, I'm hiring someone. It's a job. And I feel anxious about it just being that. I adore my rooster -- I see all his sides, good and bad, and I love the package. But if I only knew him as someone I got an hourly rate to watch, I might have a lot harder time gathering the patience. I might find the diet an enormous pain, get annoyed with him, not feel like reading him a trillion books, feel frustrated with his outbursts. I might. I wonder if babysitter J will. I guess I need to take a leap of faith. So many of you are so much better at faith than I am, maybe you could lend me a cup? And so the summer ends; I can't tell if I'm more anxious about one more week of the rooster at home, or a year ahead at school.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 19, 2008", "body": "\nYou know Mom Eyes? It's like how, before you have kids, you might have a dark and cynical sense of humor, and then after, you weep at diaper commercials or photos of Boy Scouts. Mom Eyes, in my experience anyway, often leak. Also, Mom Eyes open wide with awe at certain things. Say, a grocery cart brimming over with food and toddler while guided down aisle after aisle by a  man . Other eyes might overlook this magical sight completely, but not Mom Eyes, or at least not mine. In no way do I presume or assume that Mom Eyes have superiority over other eyes. Mine, I know, do not. I do not ascribe one trait such as compassion to all mothers or lack of it to everyone else. I am only saying that when I developed Mom Eyes, things shifted. Not better or worse, just a little softer on the focus, and with some strange zooming habits. Mine zoom in rapidly on dangers, bargain toys, potential babysitters, all things autism, and family stories unfolding, just to name a few. It's like that time I flew back from a conference, and my flight got delayed by like a jillion years, and I got rerouted, and then after having an empty seat next to mine in which I could belatedly but blissfully sleep off my sullenness, I saw a flight attendant escorting some tall, smelly guy my way. Or at least that is what I saw at first. Then, shift. Click. Mom Eyes kicked in with the zoom feature. I saw the soldier coming back from Iraq, and when he told me he had been flying \"home\" for over 30 hours so far, I saw in a flash his wife, his kids, and, most of all, his  mom . As he kept subtly putting his hand gingerly to his knee, which had shrapnel in it, for some reason my Mom Eyes pictured him as a little boy who hurt himself on a playground. The image made no sense, but my mind's eye went there anyway. When he talked about his wife having to drive the kids an hour or two out of the way to pick him up due to our rerouting, I had to close my eyes tightly for a few moments so that I would not cry, sensing that crying would not be doing this strong, worn out warrior any favors. I knew without a doubt that my eyes saw things differently on that airplane than they would have about five years before, and I knew that it was because I too looked forward to going home to family I had missed even over the course of just days - home to J and the rooster. In fact, I was carrying Peaches then, in my second trimester, and you know what hormones do to vision and perspective. I have to say, it can burdensome, but I also count it a blessing, having my Mom Eyes. I got a call not too long ago from my mom back East, telling me she had heard on television the name of a boy I knew in high school. I sort of dated this boy, sort of befriended him, and we helped each other out with this and that. This boy had been at war once, too, serving in the Gulf while I went to college, but he had left the Marines only to be shot, it turns out, on home soil this summer. According to what my mom heard on the news, a girlfriend shot him and put him in the hospital with serious injuries. When my mother first said his name, it put me back in high school mode for a minute. The concept of what she said she heard on the news at first sounded so preposterous, so surreal, it seemed for an instant like a joke. Of course, injuries are no lauging matter. But my knee jerk reaction had been to think, \"Oh, that M. Such the flirt/lady's man/thrill seeker. This must be quite a sexy story.\" Then I Googled it, and sexy it was not. Tragic. Heart-breaking. M is still in the hospital, in a long-term acute care rehab facility now, and the woman who shot him took her own life, according to the local newspaper where M now lives. I've known just the sketchy details of all this for about two months and I have thought of it often with great sadness. I guess due to the distance and the high school connection, and my inability to find out more information, Mom Eyes didn't kick in; I sent plenty of good thoughts M's way, but that re-focus mechanism didn't jar me into that acute, exquisite sense of vulnerability until today. My dear friend, C, a doctor in our hometown, texted me to say that M's mother is her patient. She also wrote that M's rehabilitation is \"slow.\" M's mother is devastated, a wreck, heartsick, scared. Click. Shift. Of course she is. This is no longer a one paragraph news story onto which I can project a simple resolution; I can see the tragedy vividly now. C also texted that she conveyed my concern and good wishes, and that M's mother remembers me from way back when. With this, the leaking. And so I guess my point is this: My Mom Eyes see and remember that we are all someone's child. M is. So was the woman who put him in the hospital. A blessing and a burden, this perspective. Shift.

{"date": "Friday, August 22, 2008", "body": "\nUsually I blog in the moment. Feel it, write it, push publish, done. Once in a rare while I \"work\" on a post, and some of you can tell, I think, the difference. The ones I work on make worse reads. The post below I wrote in the moment, but not today's moment. I needed some time to sit with it, even though I haven't changed a word. And I wanted to get the approval of my dear friend N to tell her story here. What I mean to say in this intro paragraph is something I hope comes across in the what I wrote below as well: I remember. Time marches on, but I remember. In the quiet, in the chaos, always. Thank you, N, for letting me remember in this way, and thank you for all that you share with me, especially friendship and love. Thank you, Vicki, for sharing your son with readers like me. I never met Evan, but I knew him still, and your family means so much to all of us out here.  I will always remember. Remembering... Before my son, my eldest child, turned six months old, I went to the hardest funeral I've ever attended. I went to the funeral of his very first playmate, the little girl with whom he shared his first play date, the child of my dear, dear friend, a child whose birth had brought such joy into my heart. The pain engulfing my heart on that day defied measure, and my poor spastic brain could think of nothing else but the fearful echoing question, \"How can her parents survive?\" Her parents. Her mother had become my close friend through a writing group around the time when we both were engaged. We had nothing in common except all the things that matter to me, and we forged our friendship within a smaller group of that writing circle. One day after we'd both been married about a year, she called to ask if I could cover a writing workshop for her, and during the conversation we found ourselves giddily confessing our early-stage pregnancies to one another. Later, while home on maternity leave, my giant ankles propped on the coffee table, I got another call from her: \"Guess what I just did?\" I thought she had a funny story to tell me, maybe something like the goofy things that I kept doing and blaming on my \"pregnancy brain.\" But no. \"I just had a baby! Two hours ago!\" Somehow, she made it sound like she just baked a cake or something less physically exerting. Even through the phone, her love and joy radiated, and pain didn't make it to the top ten list of things she wanted to talk about. I admittedly felt scared of delivering my baby, and in fact had asked her months earlier, \"Aren't you scared of giving birth?\" She laughed. \"No,\" she told me, \"it's the part that comes after that scares me. I am much more worried about raising a child than having a baby.\" You will rightly snicker at what I replied - I clearly overestimated how I would handle the challenges facing me as a mother. \"I feel like that part will come naturally,\" I said. My dear friend has always, and I mean always, had wisdom I envy, and I am sure she rolled her eyes on her end of the line, though she didn't let it show. She is an amazing, graceful, gracious, wise woman, and a mother to two darling little boys. But I never forget that she is also the mother to a beautiful little girl, a treasured girl, a child we said goodbye to only months after we said hello. I had no idea how she and her husband got through the several services, the video tribute, the readings they both gave, the goodbyes. I was not sure how to get through it myself, and it was not my child, my grief, my place to ache so deeply. I know that the loss of that child changed who I am as a mother and as a person. I also know that my friend has taught me more about mothering than she realizes. Among the substantial proof that my friend has more wisdom and strength than I may ever attain, she often sought to help me understand how her faith guided her after her child died. We cried together, and she spoke to me of her belief system, and of her hope, and the belief within her that she must pick herself up and live her life passionately no matter what. At the funeral, I remember fearing that she would not want to be my friend anymore, that my child and I would remind her too painfully of her loss. But that is not how my friend lives, loves, believes. Those fears I felt reflected my own darkness, and my friend does not live in darkness. With the recent passing of Vicki's son Evan, I have felt almost afraid to type either of their names. This sentence and the previous one have taken me longer to write than all the paragraphs leading up, because I feel like an interloper, like by writing of them I show some kind of disrespect. And then I remember what my friend has taught me, I remember her wisdom, her strength, her light. Several months ago, around the time that her daughter would have turned four, I went in on a gift for my friend, a necklace with three hearts representing her three children and her love for them all. I remember feeling anxious about giving her that gift. Would it seem too bold? Would it require painful explanations? Would she feel hesitant to wear it in public? Would it seem presumptuous of us to bring up her loss? Would it seem like dwelling on sadness? When she opened it, the other gift-giver and I exchanged glances, and I think I held my breath. Of course, I needn't have worried. With her first look at the necklace, she understood the love we and respect we meant for it to convey, and she said how much it meant to her that we recognize the important milestones when so many others do not. We celebrate the beautiful baby we knew as well as mourn her loss. I am grieving these days. There have been losses near and far, losses I've written about and losses I haven't, and I am not a good griever, if there is such a person. I am not as strong as I'd like to be. But I know this. I am more prepared to learn from life and loss and death than I used to be. I am stronger and more committed to light and hope than I thought I could be, because I have known, read, connected to women of strength and beauty. My friend has taught me that there is no choice but to go on, and so you do, and that no one corners the market on grief. My friend has taught me that everyone has the right to live, love, and grieve in their own way, but that sadness is not a competitive sport. I have a lot to learn, but I take it one step at a time. I am blessed to have wise teachers in my life.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/08/remembering.html", "title": "\nRemembering\n"},

Even I, the eternal pessimistic, the pregnant mama who fully expected  curve balls  and struggles, even I had unrealistic expectations for my relationship with my firstborn, my boy, my rooster. See, I grew up pretty much without a father. He didn't officially run off for good until I was ten, but even in the decade of his presence, his absence was frequent. When we saw him, he was angry, or drunk. Not both, usually, as drinking made him seem as happy as it made the rest of us sad, at least until he passed out. So given the lousiness of the father/daughter thing, I think I had subconscious dreams of \"a do-over\" in the mother/son department. You don't really get a do-over with childhood, though, do you. And if you did, it certainly wouldn't come while you are parenting -- which is SO NOT child's play. Another thing I've come to realize about my own misguided assumptions is this: by marrying a man the polar opposite of my father, a man as gentle and mild-tempered as my father was volatile and acerbic, I did not guarantee myself anything. I did not guarantee myself a placid boy. You can marry a saint, but when the genes do their little Bingo Ball spin, you get who you get and you don't get upset. As a matter of fact, I myself am not as placid as a mother as I would have liked to believe. It turns out? I yell. Wow, I never expected to be a parent who yells. I, in fact, HAD and DESPISED parents who yell. And still I yell. But I am working on it. I the \"working on it\" list these days, you will find, along with 250 household topics (like fixing the sprinklers broken for almost a year), these parenting items: - yelling less, breathing more - modeling the gentleness I hope to instill - putting aside those romantic notions, and dealing with reality head on Wish me luck. These, too, may be romantic notions... only time will tell. (PS Thanks to those of you sending the good emails, thoughts, comment lately. Sorry I'm in email hibernation.

Other people talk about these things, people a generation ahead of me, and my ears perk up. I feel myself registering kinship the way I used to when I first moved to LA and someone in the doctor's office would begin to describe their recent arrival from Back East and how they still had not adjusted completely.

He first started telling me this when I used to fret over our age difference. After years of dating older men, I married a guy thirteen months younger. A silly 13 months! Ha! Why should it matter? It doesn't. It surely didn't change anything, and it certainly didn't keep me from marrying him. But lately this old feeling has me acting a little differently.

Not even 32 hours of labor deterred her; she refused to be sent home for rest. He was the first child she ever watched being born, though she'd gone to celebrate many a new baby in the family. The rooster will know that his great grandmother bought him his crib for his first gift, and she sent a check to open his college savings account. He will know how she treasured gifts of love and symbolism, of support and of encouragment. He will know how much she treasured cards more than gifts, how she read her cards so carefully and chose them with such love. He will know that photos of him, of Peaches, of all her family adorned every shelf and covered her refrigerator. And he will know that she sent the cutest little outfits ever because she just loved to see kids look \"darling.\" I tried calling him \"darling\" today so that he would hear that loving word as I did, and it make him laugh. It made me cry. The rooster and Peaches both got as much from their great grandma as she could pack into her short time with them. I will make it all last for the rest of my lifetime, through the stories I will tell them, the photos I will show them, and the videos we will watch. They will know her funny Brooklyn-meets-Southern accent, the way she crooked her finger, and the very best sentence she ever gave me, \"I am so proud of you, I could bust.\" I will infuse their lives with this sentence as she did mine, and hope that it makes the same kind of through line for them, inspiring them to be their best. But I admit that I am heatbroken that they will not eat turkey dinner at her table. That they will have no more of her kisses. That the photos cannot convey to them how her eyes twinkled with glee or mischief. That they never tasted her pie. That she cannot hold their hands when they too have children. She had the most beautiful little hands. Strong. I close my eyes and I concentrate hard. I can hear her. She taught me well, I listened carefully, I cling to the lessons, I still benefit from her reassurance. My grandma did not know that the rooster has autism. In some moments, when I panic right now, I feel a desperate and selfish need to talk to her about this, about everything. But the truth is, if I remember to concentrate and listen, I still can hear her. She doesn't care what you call the rooster, she just loves him. Here or gone, she just loves us. It is a love too huge to die.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/07/lost.html", "title": "\nLost\n"},

Not a spare moment for blogging could be seen for miles. But the truth is, I have not felt like blogging. Sounds funny, because I found myself saying at my conference, and back East, and to my dear friends, that blogging serves an important  therapeutic  role in my life. (C then handed me an article she'd clipped for me about the mental health role of the  blogosphere .) Sounds funny, too, because I have had much material all around me, and certainly could use a mental health boost. But maybe I didn't want a boost. Maybe I haven't wanted to feel better. Maybe I knew I'd have to write about my grandma --  too hard  -- or  not  write about my grandma --  too hard . Maybe blogging about her -- or not -- seemed too much like real life marching on, moving away from the time when my grandma was still here, a phone call away, ready to reassure me, to love me, to  understand  me, to be my grandma. Maybe blogging feels like living, and I've wanted to be in limbo. Really, I've been too busy to blog, and I've been glad of it. But really I'm too busy to blog tonight, too. And here I sit. So what does that mean? I don't know. I'm not feeling particularly insightful. But maybe I've had this nagging sensation in my heart of someone reassuring me, loving me, understanding me -- someone nagging me out of my limbo, back toward life. I'm trying. I really am.

{"date": "Thursday, June 26, 2008", "body": "\nDon't think I didn't whine BEFORE I had a special needs kids. Much of the time, I wallowed in good things, turning my intensity toward the positive end of the continuum, embracing all things mushy in my relationship with my husband, diving headfirst into my career in education, immersing myself in creative outlets like writing groups. But I also spent a chunk of my first ten or 15 years in LA whining about feeling homesick. Not homesick for any actual home, but maybe for the East, or the South, or the smallness and community I found in the Southeast. My refrain: One more year, and I'm out of here. My real issue: I'm too small a fish in too big a pond, i.e. I don't feel the love here. Now, I came straight to LA from idyllic college life at a smallish (and beautiful) school with a tight knit department in my major, and I wept so hard at my college graduation I am surprised they didn't videotape it and use it as fundraising fodder. I knew I was leaving the land of constant community and endless bonding opportunities for the cold hard reality of the real world. Having previously been all too aquainted with said real world, I had zero desire to return. Give me dorms, clubs, and advisors, give me friendship, challenges, and rewards, give me intellectual debate and stimulating discussions, but don't, whatever you do, drop me in the land of commuting, competition, traffic, isolationa, and urban sprawl. I recognize the irony that I hate how much lonelier I can feel in LA than anywhere else I've lived when in fact I live in LA because the man I love is anchored here. But let me stop there with the LA bashing, as the purpose of this blog is not to continue the whining (I've actually grown quite fond of Los Angeles in many, many ways, and will definitely blog sometime about its wonderful qualities), but to reflect on how and why my perspective has changed since my kids came along. Even though I wouldn't mind moving back to my roots (girlfriends back East, I miss you at least as much as ever!), I don't feel as lonely here as I used to. First of all, I find it impossible to have children and feel lonely. This began with conception. I could sit alone for impressive lengths of time while pregnant and talk to my belly and not once would it occur to me to feel bored or lonely. I can't say I have even had the time or energy to be bored one single time since giving birth to my oldest. Even when the rooster and Peaches are terrible company, they are still good company, too. For another thing, when you have kids, you have community. Oh, sure, schools and playgroups are built in community, but what about just the fact that you can exchange meaningful smiles with another family as you walk down the street pushing your separate strollers or through the aisles of the grocery store? Before kids, let me tell you, I never once got the warm fuzzies in a Los Angeles supermarket. And, of course, you knew this came next: the blogosphere was born after my arrival in SoCal. It's not that I never feel homesick. I regularly fantasize about living across the street from my East Coast buddies, buying a reasonably priced and sized house with a yard big enough for my kids to go exploring, in a town small enough for my kids to go exploring. But I'm not whining about it anymore. I've got bigger things to whine about, and, finally, some community (both locally and virtually) that cares enough to tolerate and support me through it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/06/cheese-and-whine.html", "title": "\nCheese and Whine\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 25, 2008", "body": "\nNext month I will turn 37. As much as that number  surprises  and daunts me, it mostly reminds me how much I've  been dwelling  on being 36. Almost like a mantra, I have thought countless times this past year, \"I am 36 and my mom is 63. Opposites.\" Yet never have my mom and I shared more in common. This year my mother and I, from 3,000 miles apart, shared similar  caregiving  struggles. I called her often to help me find my way through the rooster's autism diagnosis, questions about medication, frustrations with the medical world, concerns about his behavior, fears about his future. On her end, mom dealt with my grandmother's failing health, sometimes inadequate medical care, confusing behavior, emotional outbursts, poor prognosis. And we wished we could be there with each other; I wished I could help my grandma (who is also my hero, my heart, my cherished dear grandma), and my mother wished she could help the rooster (the first baby she ever watched be born). We shared the internal struggle of not being able to travel easily, of having parts of hearts beating in beloved family members in crisis across a country but not knowing how to go to them. My mother and I talked to a lot of doctors this year. We stood in many pharmacy lines. We cried. We worried. We struggled. We lost a lot of sleep. We cursed. We aged. We aged way more than just a year's worth. We had a lot in common in that way during this inverse, backward-forward,  mirrorlike  year, 36 and 63. But that doesn't tell the whole story of my preoccupation with age 36 and the mother connection. My mom's 36 th  year happened to be a milestone one in my both our lives as well. That year, my mother finally decided to leave my father after about 16 miserable years of marriage, and to start a brand new life with my brother and I far away from the wreckage; we left just in time to narrowly escape the implosion of my father's fraudulent business and the arrival of the authorities. I didn't know about any of this before it happened. I simply went to school as usual one Friday, took a social studies test about explorers, and rode the bus home eager to show off my A. My mom would not have really cared that much about my A, as she let it be known since kindergarten that she had no interest in talking about school related matters, but surely my perfect score never came up after I arrived home to find our valuables loaded into two cars and my grandparents ready to escort us out of the city to our new lives with them. The year my mom turned 36, I absolutely could not stand her. In my young mind, she ruined everything. And, she didn't seem to care one single bit. Selfish, cryptic, uncooperative, angry, unwilling to talk to me, loudly talking to everyone else, my mother seemed to me to represent the single great flaw in my life. I wanted to know what just happened to me, and why, and when she would fix it, and how I was supposed to survive never seeing my old school and old friends again. I wanted to know why she brought me only clothes, but not prized possessions, and what happened to all of our stuff. I wanted to know if this meant we were poor now, and if I'd ever see my father again. But my mother wasn't talking to me. If only my grandma had been my mother, I thought. It didn't seem fair, in all my  Pollyannaish  overachieving  goodytwoshoesness  to have a rebellious teenage-like mother, darkly tangled in a shameful mess with my no good father. I resented her for making a mess out of both of our lives. I resented her for telling everyone within my ear shot not to worry about me because kids are \"resilient.\" Since turning 36 myself, I have often wondered what it would be like for my mother at age 36 to sit down across the table from me and have a heart to heart. This kind of time-warp imaging is something I confess I am prone to, and something I think you should try if you never have. More often I have pondered talking to my grandma during her youth, because grandma, the person I've always identified with most, always seems to have so much to teach me, such wisdom to reveal, and I have always wished I could have had more time to spend with her. I know if I could borrow Michael J. Fox's car back in time to visit only one person, I'd go find grandma, probably circa 1956. But over the years I've come to realize that my mother has her own wisdom, and in this past year my appreciation for her strength has grown; I know for sure that my mom knew a lot more at age 36 than I gave her credit for at the time. If my mom from 198 oish  sat down across from me in my living room right now, I'd want to ask her very different questions from the ones I had when I was in fifth grade. I would start with, Are you scared to raise these two kids without a husband? Are you happy? What makes you happy? Why don't you get along better with grandma? What is it you are searching for? Do you like the 10-year-old me? Why don't you talk to me more? I might even ask her if she liked me, the grownup, and if we two 36-year- olds  could be friends. But then I'd want to know about her past: How did you survive taking care of a baby with such severe seizures that she almost died? How long did it take after I started having seizures before you learned to sleep again? Did you watch me breathe all the time? Was it hard to let the doctors prescribe such strong  meds  for me? Did it make you nervous when you gave them to me? Was I a nice kid when I was ten? Did you resent me for being so different from you? Were you hoping for a mini-Me? I've asked her these things already of course, squeezed a few answers out of her, but I'd like to get her age-36-perspective nonetheless. I'd like to see not just what she'd say, but how she'd say it; would we sound at all alike? Would we, both 36, enoy one another's company? We are friends now, but it took a long time to get there. My mother and I have opposite ages right now, but we're more alike than we've ever been. The shift started happening gradually after I moved to the West Coast in my early twenties. My mom had just met and married a wonderful guy, the first nice guy I ever knew her to love, and she started shocking me on the phone with comments like, \"Did you see Martha Stewart on  tv  today?\" After I got over thinking aliens abducted my mother, I began to get used to her  newfound  passion for gardening and her forgiveness of pastel colors. I actually got her to send me some family recipes. I leaned on her through some difficult times, including a bad breakup of my own, telling her how  un -resilient I could be sometimes (with scars dating back to that fateful year of my childhood), and her support across the miles solidified the reparation between us. I briefly considered staging a late rebellion of my own in my twenties now that mom had normalized so much, but, nah, I was too set in my boring ways. My mom and I talked more and more as the years passed, finding more and more common ground (not only as she changed, but as I grew less judgemental and stubborn), and now, here we are, 36 and 63. Opposite. But the same. Two moms doing the best we can; two daughters, doing the best we can.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/06/motherhood.html", "title": "\nMotherhood\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 21, 2008", "body": "\nThe first time a doctor (offhandedly) described my son as \"special needs,\" I began weeping. She had been telling me about summer camp options nearby, and I'd been listening attentively, nodding, taking interest, knowing on some level of course we were talking about special needs camps, but once she said it, my ears collapsed. I could take in no other words. I wept. I practiced saying the words later that day. Special needs. Of course, I already knew it! But knowing and saying it can be dissimilar. Special needs. Special needs. I needed to say it, repeat it, own it, get over it, demystify it, take the sting out, find my comfort spot. Special needs. Today we went to a pool party I had learned about online for spectrum kids in our area. So, did that make it a special needs party? Okay, I guess so, whatever. All I know is, I wept just a little bit today, and it felt so good. For one thing, my boy had a blast in the water wearing his floaty suit and playing with his daddy. I thought they looked so beautiful in the water together that I snapped over a dozen photos just of them. For another thing, I never once felt I needed to preempt, apologize, explain, or worry. The rooster didn't stand out not one single little bit, and everyone just had a good time, despite the mercury rising WELL above 100 on our first day of summer. The funniest thing? PEACHES was the difficult one! She grew anxious around the dog, obsessed on a little Buddah she found inside the hosts' home, and became clingy when children approached her. It was great! I didn't preempt, apologize, explain, or worry about her either. I just WAS. We were just a family meeting new friends at a party. Monday morning will be the rooster's first day of summer camp at our mainstream school, intended as a transition to the next grade of preschool, only he'll be transitioning back to the same grade again with a new crop of kids younger than he is. I feel the knot that lets me know I'm not as ready for it as I've been pretending. I feel the concern about the challenges he'll face, and the need I will feel to preempt, apologize, explain, and worry. This is what lets me know for sure that the rooster IS a special needs kid. The truth I can't deny is that sometimes I forget. Sometimes I kid myself. Sometimes I let the denial win.  Sometimes I replay the positives in my head like a hypnotic phrase, wallowing in the successes, lulled by progress... Today, when a mom asked what exactly were the rooster's challenges because she couldn't tell any of them, I felt the siren call of denial... Perhaps the rooster is growing out of all his challenges? But the reality is that he has plenty more challenges, not ones that necessarily show themselves when he's blissed out in a swimming pool on a Saturday in June! The reality is that, after preschool, I will almost definitely need to find a good special needs environment for my boy in public school, because he will have gone as far as our \"typical\" private school will allow. My boy has special needs. Well, okay, he is a special boy, and I vow to do all I can to figure out what those needs are, and find a way to meet them. After all, don't we all have special needs? I love my rooster.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/06/special.html", "title": "\nSpecial\n"},

But here is what else I understand from our conversation. You are young, tactless, and you clearly do not have children. Now, for what I do not understand about our conversation.

Put the emphasis on whatever word of that sentence you want, it sounds just as lousy. THAT was what you wanted to tell me? That was what you WANTED to tell me? All I could muster in response to your tone, your comment, was, \"Oh.\" To which you responded, adeptly, pointedly, \"Yeah.\" And then you said a formal rejection would come by mail, and goodbye. Of course, the form letter hasn't come yet, but I'm sure it has ten times the warmth that you do. How could it not? Let me be clear: it is not what you said, it's how you said it.

{"date": "Saturday, June 14, 2008", "body": "\nThe reason I like to blog has almost nothing to do with being read. I think one reason I left journalism almost immediately after studying it for about 5 years is that I don't often care that much about being read. It might seem like a contradiction, but the potential for a readership (especially a kindered one) enables me to write in a way that I enjoy, yet if hardly anyone ever reads me, I'm okay with that. I am all about the process. Writing is an exercise I crave, but having readership is usually just a bonus. Lately I started noticing several of my favorite writers in the corners of the blogosphere where I lurk referring to the size of their readership. These writers who kept track of hits to their page also didn't seem to me to write FOR an audience, but to benefit from one in the same way I do. It got me thinking. A curious still-somewhat-newbie, I looked around to find out how you even go about keeping track of such things, and next thing I know I have an invisible hit counter on my blog. A couple weeks into it, I still find myself trying to wrap my head around it. For one thing, more people than I guessed read what I write. Not droves or anything, but at least enough for a heck of a party. It makes me sad how many of us share this common enterprise, raising a child on the spectrum as best we can amid the struggles related to education, finances, stigmas, expectations, safety... I have always been amazed by how many of those who with plates AT LEAST as full of mine have had space leftover for guiding, comforting and educating me by sending me comments and emails, but some people, it seems, must be coming to read and relate silently. As another blogger I respect put it, I hope some have found here something of what they came here needing. It also shocks me that people I know who don't have special needs children come here repeatedly to find out how we're doing; I'm not sure I'd keep coming back to hear me kvetch week after week if I were in their place. Clearly the frequent readers who knew me before I had kids have a lot of patience and generosity, and I owe a lot of people a round of drinks. For another thing, it surprised me to realize I feel a little self-conscious to know the scope of people reading me. Should I be putting on my best face, if a crowd is coming? Hmmm... I surely didn't start blogging to make a good impression! But I hadn't thought beyond pure survival when I started medicinal blogging. Now I'm hooked, but starting to worry a little about keeping up appearances. What if I embarrass the rooster? Or my husband? Or Peaches? Or myself? After gulping hard looking at the numbers, I actually considered going back and deleting posts that might come across as too critical of anyone in my family. Bur I remind myself: I need to write this for me, because this is my process, this is how my personal autism therapy looks, and as I help the rooster, I need to take care of me, too, in this way. I don't know why I can't believe how connected we can be, but I admit that I am hugely blown away by the concept. Sure, I'm on Facebook and MySpace, I met my husband online, I got my Master's Degree from a university without a brick and mortar campus, but nothing has made me feel more powerfully connected to a sense of community and belonging that this thing called blogging. If you read me, thanks.

Two weeks into summer vacation, these are some of the words I have heard people use to describe the rooster. Sometimes I hear this in conjunction with, \"When we're just one-on-one,\" or, \"As long as he gets to decide what we're doing...\" But still. Those words feel to me like fancy spa oils, soothing my dry, tired abrasions. The rooster IS developing and growing, but it's not so much that he's made a recent radical change into a more charming guy. As much as he likes school and misses it, he just loves this time off, loves getting one-on-one attention from his amazing caregivers, setting the agenda, and avoiding too many rules or expectations. I know I have much to learn from this, and I plan to think hard on how to take what I can extrapolate from it to find ways to make the school year more successful.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/06/summer-lovin.html", "title": "\nSummer Lovin\n"},

It's not something I think he has the development to control just yet, or that I can force through my own control. I am surprised to have an aggressive kid, and I'm surprised that I've learned to roll with the punches, so to speak. I understand people who say they have a zero tolerance policy for hitting, because I sort of thought I would, too. Hitting? Consequence. Consistency. Zero tolerance. Every time. Eradicate hitting. I'm a total pacifist, and I'm a teacher, and I'm from a family that hit too much when I was a kid. But that is all about me, and parenting my special needs rooster turns to be more about who the rooster is than who I am. Once the rooster came along, so did the eventual realization that his nervous system does not work like mine, or yours, and consequences don't have a chance of chinking the ism. Don't get me wrong; we don't allow hitting! We don't condone it or give the rooster a free pass. We don't make or take excuses. It's just that the tolerance level needs to be a tad higher up the scale than zero for a boy who doesn't always even comprehend why he's hitting, who he's hitting, or what consequences mean. Sometimes he gets lost in his fear, his panic, his frustration. Sometimes he's had it with therapies, medicines, doctors, sleeplessness, diets, ists and all. After an excellent day in which he managed his first dentist appointment, a consultation with an herbalist, potty training, visiting the neighbor, and all the usual business of life, he got grumpy toward his sister this evening. Some pushing and mild misbehavior ensued in a struggle over toys and turn taking. I intervened, but on the gentler side, cutting him the kind of slack that seems appropriate to me in situations like that. I separated them, talked to him about his behavior, distracted him a little from what seemed like his impulse to follow his sister back out in the yard for round two. While he took a chill on his bean bag chair, he started to talk. He said, \"I have words stuck inside me. I don't know how to get them out.\" Now, this is the rooster quoting a book, or \"scripting\" or echolalia if you want to talk on autism's terms. But the rooster knows whereof he speaks. Sometimes he hits because he doesn't know how to find the words. Sometimes he finds the words from his memory bank full of books. So sometimes he acts out and I don't get all drill sargeant on him. I don't always know if I'm doing the right thing or not. But sometimes I do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/06/sometimes.html", "title": "\nSometimes\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 8, 2008", "body": "\nUsually when I come to this space to write, I have some point or idea or through line on my mind. But right now I find myself wanting to just capture the weekend. It's a very different feeling; usually, I come to blog not to tell anyone anything, just to work out whatever happens to be chewing on me. It's how I process. But today feels more like the desire to scrapbook, only with words. Today is my sixth wedding anniversary, so perhaps that's what has me in this frame of mind. Come to think of it, the weekend was full of more milestone-y events... Friday marked the last day of work for all the teachers at school, and while I work year round with a handful of other folks, we all participated together in closure activities, including breaking into small groups to get to know one another on a more personal level. My small circle of eight included an age range of probably around thirty-five years, different races and countries of origin, and represented vastly different jobs within the school community. Nonetheless, we found by answering simple questions pulled randomly from a bag that we have a great deal more in common then we guessed. We ended up in tears, and I left remembering how fortunate I feel to have my children in this community with me. We spent Saturday at a baby shower, celebrating the cousin-on-the-way for the rooster and Peaches. The rooster struggled to regulate his behavior in such a grownup environment, despite having a pack of kids around him. Other kids came to let me know about the various tangles and turmoil, and I felt frustrated with my boy for repeatedly breaking rules and getting aggressive, but then my smart husband pointed out that for the first time ever we managed to sit and eat some food and let both kids play for at least a couple of minutes here and there... there is progress, and I am glad he reminded me to appreciate it. After a long day, we enjoyed having our fantastic sitter (waving hands in the air to dispel bad luck that she will move away or refuse to sit for us ever again) come so that we could go out for an anniversary dinner. at six We went to a place we've been many times, not fancy at all, and we loved it. Three minutes before nine, we pulled back in the driveway, too lame to even know how to stay out any later. Today we had friends over for a little barbecue for the first time since we bought this house last July 28. Wow, it was wonderful to do that and to see them, but it's clear why it took us so long. We had a good time, but clearly my husband and I are not good at this. We were sloppy and unorganized hosts and we didn't do a very good job of serving, or really of anything. I think the food turned out well, or at least I assumed it did because my husband does a good job with the grilling usually, but I don't know for sure because I didn't eat much other than corn on the cob. I loved seeing my friends, but it's hard for me to see our rooster upsetting their well behaved kids, and I feel like I'm on secret service duty with him in a way; vigilant. There were five kids here, and five adults, but my how outnumbered I felt in some moments. As they left, I had this urge to apologize the whole time. And yet, I loved having them here. It was a joy, and I think it's why I'm blogging tonight. I have friendship afterglow! People I really care about came to my home. I would rather have hidden our many foibles, but alas, I guess if you are going to show your foibles, who better to show them to but the people you trust? It is a happy anniversary. I am a slow learner, this is readily apparent to all. But during the evening I admitted that I thought by now things would have gotten a little easier. One of our guests, CM, said it so well. She said, \"Really? I don't know why you thought that! I knew you before you had kids, and so I really don't know why you thought that! Let's have this conversation again in ten years and then see what you say!\" It reminded of my friend C again, telling me that if it weren't autism, it'd be something else; overwhelmed is who I am. Also tonight CM said that it's important to remember not to live for someday when things get easier, but to be here right now and make things good and enjoy them, because these are supposed to be the good years. I have smart friends. If there is a point to this blog, I guess that is it.

Do not ask me to divvy up the check because numbers ain't my thing. For me, the inability to communicate important emotions, events, or ideas feels rather like a physical amputation. Sometimes, you must keep your mouth shut. A promise, ettiquette, the law, privacy, whatever. And I am an excellent keeper of secrets, as long as they are someone else's. For me, I have a no secret policy. So when it's my kids, who are NOT me, but as close to me as not me gets, the secrecy policy gets muddy. And as I work that muscle that keeps everything inside, and I wrestle with the uneasy quiet in the place where resolution ought to be, I think about kids who want to talk but cannot, for whatever reason. Or kids like my Rooster who can talk, but can't get out what he means, and so despite his best efforts, his emotions and ideas stay secret. What must that feel like? Not everyone is a wordwallower like me. Perhaps some people are born with the hardwiring to divvy up the check, and the inability to share does not feel like a constant throb of loss. I hope. I always welcome anyone at the table who just tells me what I owe. Sure I've had to exercise my left brain enough to get by over the years, and I needed more time than others to master the basics perhaps, but when I go through long stretches of number silence, I feel no loss at all.

{"date": "Thursday, June 5, 2008", "body": "\nYesterday was the last day of school. I see milestones at every corner. First, I need to celebrate the joy of growth. And then, to lick a few wounds, too. In September, I drove to same school I've driven to for almost 13 years, but for the first time, I wasn't alone listening to NPR; I had the Rooster en route to preschool, and Peaches on her way to our brand new child care center, so we were loud in stereo with the broadcasting of early childhood. When we got to school, I took their photos, took a deep breath, took a leap of faith. When I picked them up at the end of the day, mentally, I checked it off. \"We made it through day one,\" I thought. WHHHEEEEW. We had plenty of bumps on day one, but I vividly remember when the Rooster saw me across the yard after school. His eyes flashed like diamonds catching the sun, and he took off running in his steady, disconnected gait, full speed toward me, screaming joyfully, \"MOMMMMMMYYYY!\" As I scooped him up while he said, full of sincerity, \"MOMMY! Thank you for the preschool mommy!\" On the other hand, Peaches missed the place she'd always gone, her familiar teachers, her adored \"Miss Mayra.\" She wanted me to know: I don't know these people, and I don't trust them yet. On the last day of school, I look at the photos of Rooster from September in wonderment; those clothes long ago made it into the share pile to pass along. He has grown so much. How does this verbose boy resemble the child who could not have a conversation? Well, he still says thank you for the preschool. By the skin of our teeth, he'll be able to return for another year, repeating the program for 3-year-olds, even though he is four. And Peaches? She too grew so much, her hair getting long, her smile getting more and more grown up. She came to love her new teachers, talk about them all of the time, and feel right at home at the school we three share, and yet on the last week of the regular school year, both her teachers left our community, and once again our wary girl will need to transition, to adjust, to develop trust. I am weary. Perhaps at year end, this is to be expected, but I am not in a conventional teaching position, and I work year-round. I don't have time for weariness. Perhaps the biggest milestone of the year, more than 100 days have passed since a doctor told us, \"This is autism.\" I am getting better at saying that myself since then, even though half the time I'm still not sure what it means. More than 100 times, I have checked myself in to the Zen mental spa I call my blog to catch my breath, seek solace, find peace. Another school year has come and gone.

I blog just so I can get it all out, and every time I push the publish button, I feel like I lose a few pounds. For me, it's not even about being read or heard. It's about release. The rooster likes to let balloons go free; I send out thought balloons. So I'm a complainer. And, philosophically, I'm cool with that! You can tell me to my face, \"Girl, you are such a COMPLAINER.\" I won't get upset at all. I'll say, \"Yep. Good for the soul. Does a body good.\" You go ahead and complain, too. I'll listen/read. For me it's a little vicarious release. You might not hear me saying, \"Amen!\" But I'm saying it. All hail the absence of festering! I will likewise cheer vociferously for all the good news you share, too. I don't think less of complainers, including my own self. But the other day my husband says to me, half joking, \"Want me to find you a cross to carry around, too?\" Ha. I didn't like that. I like to COMPLAIN, not BEMOAN. Certainly not whine, wheedle, or wallow. I just like to complain in what I think of as kind of a productive way. Not competitive. Certainly, in the world of special needs parenting, I don't think I win any awards for carrying the heaviest loads or doing the best job, or having the most interesting perspective, and I know that there is always something harder, just as there is always someone to envy. That doesn't interest me, though. I am not into one-ups-person-ship. I just like to talk; that means rejoicing in the good, and complaining about the bad. So my husband said I had no sense of humor regarding the cross comment. But I do. For instance... My in-laws were over last weekend. I told them a story about my aunt, the one who suffered a terrible injury in a car accident but NEVER mentions the serious chronic pain that comes from having metal and screws holding her neck together. I said, mid-story, regarding her stoicism, \"She's my aunt by marriage; clearly we are not blood relatives!\" And then I snorted! I cracked up completely, and my inlaws laughed too in agreement that I am many things, but a silent sufferer is not one of them. But I really don't think of myself as acting all martyr-ish. And if you disagree with me, then I am really sorry, because I don't want to come off like that.

Grapes are surely his favorite food, but he ate meat yesterday.) His favorite animal? GIRAFFES! (Went to an exhibit this weekend with giraffes!) His favorite toy? KITES!

When I was a kid, my mother didn't want me to drown, or even, truth be told, swim. I had ear tubes and six hundred fifty ear infections, and she wanted me to stay healthy, because even your average cold tended to escalate for me and next thing you knew I would end up in an ambulance or something. So my mother told me that if I ventured into the water without her, the Under Toad would suck me under. And. I. Would. Never be heard from AGAIN.  Okay, maybe she said undertow, and I heard Toad. But what I heard loud and clear? DANGER, DANGER, DANGER -- listen to your mother or ELSE! We lived inland -- five hours to the ocean, I guess. When my mother told me to stay out of the water, she meant any water, as large as lakes and as small as bath tubs. And it worked. I do not know how to swim. And I swore up and down... And so will my kids. Shame on me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/05/under-toad.html", "title": "\nThe Under Toad\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 18, 2008", "body": "\nTomorrow, the Rooster officially turns four, but we celebrated today. Despite the dozen or so meltdowns, he had a great day. Are you surprised? Well hold on, there's more. We went to an amazing museum exhibit -- all completely hands-on and participatory, and he laughed, climbed, touched, pointed, described, and PLAYED.  Afterward, we had a lunch that -- despite being entirely  gfcf  and eaten in outside in ovenlike heat -- turned out to be delicious. Who knew you could buy cupcakes made without anything that sounds remotely pleasant and actually lick your fingers in delight? Guess they were worth the thousand bucks they seemed to cost for a box of six. Another big surprise hit: Rooster's Grammy and  Grampy  gave him a puzzle, and he LOVED IT. If you didn't read some of my earlier posts about noncompliance, you might have missed the fact that my boy has a zero tolerance policy for puzzles. When pressed during an assessment to please show horse's head belonged, the Rooster articulately let the persistent diagnostician that the horse's head belonged right back in the box from which it came. (I dread how he might phrase that when he gets a little older.) No horses in this puzzle - this one had brightly colored dinosaurs. We all spent quite a while working on it together, having a blast. His daddy gave him a \"enormous\" (the Rooster's own word) toy snake that he loves so much he made it his namesake. His Grandma in Virginia sent him a giant bouquet of balloons that mark a milestone: these are the first balloons ever that he has not insisted on \"setting free.\" The environment and I are thankful. (The rooster is quite the Jamie Lee Curtis fan, and her picture book inspired his passionate catch-and-release balloon policy.) The Peaches, of course, got a few balloons of her own, to keep peace in the family, and she and the rooster have actually been marching around the house together having a balloon parade.

{"date": "Friday, May 9, 2008", "body": "\nMy friend C and I go way back; no one has been my friend longer. This means she can read my handwriting, remembers my first boyfriend and my birthday, has loaned me clothes, has heard me snore, flies in for a visit now and then, knows how to make me laugh, has mopped me up thousands of times, and watches my back. It means I can confess to her with only mild embarrassment that I've read (and enjoyed) all the books in the Traveling Pants series, and that she would be in my sisterhood if I had a pair of magic jeans. So I asked her recently why I tend to need the mopping up part so often. And I also asked her why I have such trouble measuring the size and scope of problems, especially ones that start with \"A\" and end with \"ism.\" I asked her, \"What is wrong with me? And with my sense of perspective?\" C shoots things straight. I know it; that is why I asked her. Her answer shocked me, even though it didn't. Don't we all have those moments? Her answer reminded me of who I am, and made me realize that I do forget sometimes. Click; focus restored. I have been thinking often of what she said. It was late and I was tired, but my version of what she said goes something like this: \"You know, G, I think if it weren't an ism it would be something else. I remember when you thought you'd fail Spanish in high school and you went a little over the deep end. And you didn't even fail Spanish, did you? I think that's how you're wired. Sure, the rooster has stuff going on. Last summer I saw him have some ugly night terrors and things like that and I knew there was stuff going on that wasn't entirely typical, so I wasn't completely shocked by his diagnosis, but if you weren't freaking out about that, you'd be freaking out about something else. You're G. That is what you do. I'm not sure why, but it's kind of who you are.\" C is exactly right. It is  soooo  C of her. That is who SHE is. The smart one. The calm one. The doctor. Had I been born  Doogie   Howser , medical genius, I would refuse to practice. I never want that kind of responsibility. The only worse job I can imagine involves air traffic control while managing nuclear power plants. C drove an ambulance before we graduated high school; I sometimes have been known to check three times to be sure I'm in park before I get the kids out of the car. I make my husband dispense all the medicines around here; if I so much as give them Tylenol, I can spend as long as half an hour later worrying if I measured out the right dose (and our boy's medicine record fills 5+ pages at the doctor's office). I left a job editing because it gave me ulcers to put an issue to bed because putting it to bed meant I approved it as done and accurate, and I would wait in agony for corrections and complaints to arrive in my inbox. My head throbbed to the beat of, \"WHAT IF I MADE A MISTAKE?\" So how on earth did I end up a teacher, let alone a parent? I am ill suited to the pressure of either sometimes. But far as I can tell, few good paying or rewarding positions call for  neurotic , oversensitive, sentimental creative types with no tolerance for having the buck stop here. When I look at the rooster, my eyes play tricks on me all the time, as I see him one way one minute and one way another, morphing fun-house style. He's tiny and twisting all around, he's giant and scary, he's something in the middle and shining, he's changing again before my eyes, he and his isms... And the whole time, I'm staring, and hollering, \"HELP! I HATE FUN HOUSES! I'M SCARED!\" What C said reminds me that I built this fun house, and I am the one tormenting myself. I know what I should do with that information, of course. I should stop. I should dismantle the fun house and shatter the mirror, and I should stop staring at the rooster all the time. But there is a little relief in knowing that I am just G, this is just what I do. It's my own ism. I take some strange comfort there. I might not be able to change the thing about me that has always been skewed, but that has always been -- well, ME. But I can use this self-knowledge in my self-talk, when C is 3,000 miles away and the time difference is working against me and I panic. I can translate what she said into, \"Calm down. The rooster is uniquely challenged in his way, and you are uniquely challenged in your way. That means things probably are not as bad as you think they are. You got a B+ in Spanish. The letters to the editor were all good. The car hasn't rolled away yet. Go to bed.  Hasta  manana. No  te   preocupes .\" Thanks, C. I've got your back, too, sister. Maybe when you come  visit  in July we can buy some magic pants.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/05/magical-realism.html", "title": "\nMagical Realism\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, May 11, 2008", "body": "\n In about a week, the Rooster turns four years old.  Each birthday for my kids, I find myself feeling like it's my special day, too. After all, their birthdays also mark the anniversaries of my two biggest accomplishments ever.  When the Rooster turned one, I organized a giant party at the park across the street from our first home. Our first home, which we bought on a tight budget, took forever for most of our friends to get to, but that didn't keep them away, nor did the inferno of global warming that seemed to descend upon us that hot May day in the park. Fortunately I had rented a tent, and everyone endured and even seemed to have fun -- except, notably, the birthday boy. He seemed overstimulated and a little on the miserable side. The photos of him that day might as well have come from one of the detainee prison camps.  By the time the rooster turned two, we had moved closer to civilization, and we'd also given him a sister as an early birthday present in March. We decided to splurge on his party since his sister had been stealing most of the spotlight, and we had a Gymboree party. About 20 kids loved the games, songs, and activities, but once the Rooster discovered the bowl of strawberries on the food table, any mild interest he'd shown in socializing vanished. He spent almost the whole party shoving red heart-shaped treats into his mouth, and crying when they ran out. No matter, Peaches entertained the guests. A majority of the photos we printed from that party are of her; we got a couple cute ones of him, in his shirt stained with juice.  By the time Rooster turned three, we'd attended enough other kids' parties that we had really started to recognize how he stood out from kids very close in age. Honestly, I think birthday parties gave us our first meaningful insight into his developmental issues. I remember at one party, he spent the entire time running in huge circles around the opposite side of the park from where the other kids sat happily rolling balls around and eating on picnic blankets. He had no interest in engaging with them, beyond asking for cake and trying to grab another kid's cool toy. He just wanted to run, to shriek, to chase birds. We decided to opt out of throwing the Rooster a party when he turned three, and invited family only to join us for a trip to a train park, where you can climb on old trains and go to a train museum. The Rooster loved the trains! He enjoyed the day, but had no nap, and seemed tired and wired, and by the time we went out for a family dinner, he behaved so badly he had to leave the pizza restaurant before food came, and I spent the dinner hour driving him around and getting him to sleep off his tantrum.  This will be the Rooster's first birthday post diagnosis. I struggled with the right way to celebrate. Should I have a party, because he had such a good time in the bouncer we got when his sister recently turned two? Or should we just rent the bouncer and not bother to invite anyone?! He likes kids more than he used to, and he's showing that he's learning to play with children his own age, but the kids in his class don't exactly flock to him, and conflict would surely ensue.    If I threw a party, would I really be throwing it for myself, or for him? Likewise, if I decided to skip the party, whose best interest would I be serving?    I don't know if I made the right choice or not, but doesn't that go without saying every day of parenting, multiple times a day?    I opted out of the party; we are taking the Rooster, Peaches, Grammy and Grampy to an exciting museum exhibit, then pigging out on the most expensive (gfcf) cupcakes you ever saw. We will have balloons, candles, singing, presents, hugs and kisses, but no noisy crowds, no onlookers. No friends. I know it's his birthday, not mine. But when I light the candle on that six dollar cupcake, I will be making some wishes nonetheless.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/05/four-birthday-wishes.html", "title": "\nFour Birthday Wishes\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 6, 2008", "body": "\nWell, it's been a week. C, the dear friend I've had longer than any other in my life, is a doctor in the small town where we grew up. She moved back there about a year or two ago and has seen my mom and my grandma in a professional capacity. I asked her a while back to call me and tell me to come home if she ever thought I might miss the chance to say goodbye to my grandma, who is also my hero and like a mother to me. Early last week she gently let me know it was time to come home while my grandma would still likely know I was there. I always knew, even at 10 when we were in fift grade, that C would be a doctor, and I warned her even then that I'd probably call her for lots of help, but I don't think either of us realized how far I'd take it. So far she hasn't charged me a dime, but I know I owe her more than I can repay. Before I talked to C, I was struggling with the rooster, worrying, feeling sorry for myself, mired in muck. But once I heard that my grandma needed me, I got my self-pitying ass in gear. I booked two of the most expensive domestic flights you ever saw for Peaches and myself, bumming hard that in the last two months Peaches stopped being a free lap baby and Airbus went belly up (goodbye $75 flights), and I tossed the necessities in carryon bags. Not everything in the whole wide world can be about the rooster. Life goes on, autism or no. Other priorities also need their due. I made my plans in such a way to minimize the disruption to the rooster's routine, and I worked hard to make sure he'd have what he needed in my absence, but I had to go, and I went. And so I have been out of touch for a while, having a smidge of Internet withdrawal a couple of times. A few of you wrote to find out how I've been, and I will be honest: I've been better. But I've also been worse. It's been complicated. It's been... life. My grandma is an amazing woman, a crucial force in my upbringing, and I cherish her. She stayed strong and well into her 80s, until after the passing of my beloved grandpa. The day before I arrived back East, she had slipped into a semi-coma, she was having \"episodes\" and needed medication, restraints. The day Peaches and I arrived, I don't know what changed or why, but I do believe our visit could have helped her some. All I know is that she was happy to see us, she was up and dressed when we arrived, and she wanted to go out for Chinese food. We put her in the car, drove about a block down the road, and watched as she chowed down on shrimp in lobster sauce. My grandma has diabetes and arthritis, but that's not new, she's had those a long time. My grandma had breast cancer several years ago. She had a flesh eating bacteria that nearly cost her an arm after that. Recently, my grandma has also developed congestive heart failure and some dementia. I understand all this, but it often feels so incongrous with my grandma as I know her... it just seems impossible is all. But it seemed especially impossible as we sat around and had a perfectly normal conversation. Sure I could see how much she'd aged since I saw her last summer, and I know all that she's dealing with right now. I know I don't get to keep my grandma forever. But as we visited, she commented how much Peaches looks like \"that actress\" from 24, and she told us how happy she felt to see us, that we were blessings. I watched her shake her head, staring at Peaches, repeating, \"I've been so blessed, more than I ever expected.\" We reminisced. She remembered coming to be with me in the delivery room when the Rooster was born (she stayed for all 32 hours of my labor), and shortly after Peaches was born, too. At the end of our visit, I took a picture of Peaches and Grandma together, and my mother took one of me with them as well. My husband called me in Virginia several times to let the Rooster talk, because the Rooster really missed us, and he felt sad. I talked to him and told him I loved him. I didn't freak out about it; I remained focused on my grandma. Peaches travels about as easily as any two-year-old ought to be expected, but getting to my crazy hometown ain't easy... it's a schlep from our school (so that we could drop the Rooster off there Friday morning as usual) to the airport, an hour flight to Chicago, an hour layover (that turned into a 4 hour layover on the way out due to weather), another 4 hour flight, and then a 75 mile drive across the state line. We left our house at 7 a.m. Friday morning and got in to grandma's house at nearly 2 a.m. Saturday. Walking through her empty house, knowing I would sleep in her bed while she slept in a hospital bed, knowing my grandpa had been absent from the same bed for several years now, nearly did me in, and I wandered in circles around the home of my childhood, weeping, opening and closing doors and drawers, coming to grips. We spent Saturday and Sunday visiting Grandma and spending time with my mom and stepdad, as well as C, and stopping in to see my high school boyfriend whose 8 year old son has issues not so very different from the Rooster's. (He wisely told me not to compare, though. \"You can spend your whole life looking at other kids for a match, and you'll never find one. Your son is your son, and there is no one else like him. You just have to let him be who he is, and wait and see who he becomes.\") Peaches didn't sleep much in Virginia, disrupted in her routines, and so I didn't either. Together we stayed up past midnight every night. Then, we got up at 4 a.m. Monday morning so we could arrive back in Cali in time to pick up the rooster from school at the end of the day. I knew that I'd said a goodbye to my grandma that might not happen again, and that going home might not ever be the same, but I am awash in gratitude that I had the opportunity to spend that time talking to my grandma and telling her I love her with all my heart. She said, \"Maybe next time I'll come see you in California.\" We got home yesterday, and when I called today for update, things had turned bad again. More problems, more drugs, more drastic measures and nighttime sitters in her room. My mom and stepdad have their hands very full, their long days punctuated with decisions, challenges, emotional ups and downs. C tells us that my grandma might have more good days again, and she might not. I tell her how happy I am that she called me when she did. My grandma gave me gifts while I was there. She gave me her good days, her smiles, her love, her time, her words. Going there also showed me that I could; it is a gift to know that I could do something other than worry about autism and the world could keep spinning. I told my husband that I still need my grandma so much, and he said that he knows what I mean, but that I don't need her the way that I think I do. He tells me I'm all grown up now, and that is largely thanks to her. He thinks she did a good job with me, and that I have learned how to not just take care of myself, but to be a good mom. I hope he's right. I have never had the opportunity to tell my grandma about the rooster's diagnosis. To have reached the point in life that I don't share my troubles with my grandma boggles my mind. She has lifted me through more than 30 years of tough times, and cheered me through an equal number of happinesses. I guess she's helped me so much, that I will always be able to call upon the help and still feel it now when I need it. My favorite thing my grandma says is, \"I'm so proud of you, I could bust.\" I think of that all the time, and I know she would tell it to me now if she knew how hard I'm trying to help the rooster. And I know she would say it to him, too. Oh, how I wish I could hear that, other than in my mind and heart. But for now, I guess that has to be enough.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/05/still-standing.html", "title": "\nStill Standing\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, April 27, 2008", "body": "\nTonight, I just want to quit. I want to call up the autism boss and say, I Have Had It. We are done with this whole mess. Really, I want to FIRE autism. Autism? You hear me? You are out of here. The thing is, I don't think we're even getting autism right. I have bought a trillion books and joined fifty dozen web sites and our ism is the sore thumb. Don't read this that I'm saying there is no ism here; surely, beyond any doubt, things here ain't as they should be. BUT. I am so confused and tired and SO TIRED OF BEING TIRED and confused that it stymies me. As soon as I got a little used to the improvement (it took getting used to because it meant that the painful diet and other measures were working and needed to become a way of life) and the good news from school, now of course it's all negative. I can't even call it regression, really. We don't do anything as clear and obvious as that. The rooster's language continues to be more clear and focused. He rarely says much that resembles a script, he's using less jargon, and he isn't  perseverating  around me at all. His sentence structures are more complex and he can use more abstractions. He initiates friendly conversations with people he knows and strangers. The one thing I have to say that is clearly wrong with the rooster is this: He cannot regulate his behavior. His behavior is utterly  noncompliant . He is only happy and getting along with others when the agenda is wholly under his control. And I want to fire whatever it is that causes that. I want to evict it. I want to give it a piece of my pissed off mind. The rooster has a great heart. You just have to get beyond a mile of bullshit to see it. The rooster gets upset if I am hurt. He hugs me tightly and kisses me sweetly and tells me how much he loves me. He makes sure his sister always gets a turn at anything good, unless it means he has to wait or give anything up himself. He says thank you and please almost all the time. He delights in showing me cool things. He beams with pride when he does something well, like dressing himself today. The rooster loves to say hello to people and ask them to play. These are good things in my little boy, almost four. But. Holy cow. Holy cow, holy cow. A weekend is a tough sentence. I mean to tell you. NON COMPLIANT. He is the King of  NONCOMPLIANT . The poster child. We could make a video. We could knock the Super Nanny on her butt. Our days are wall to wall struggle. And I have no idea how to tackle it. I STILL have no idea which approach or method or treatment or therapist or book or what will help, or how to decide, or where to begin. We will get a classroom shadow in the next few weeks, and that might help, I have no idea. Reading about it until my eyes fall out has enlightened me exactly NONE. We only can tell you what doesn't work, and the list is long, filled with things everyone else seems to find effective but us. The rooster is one of a kind and has an iron will, a bad attitude, and too much power. He is seething mad but does not know why, and he's ready to fight more than 99 percent of the time. I freak out over how much time has passed without any interventions, but then when I realize the strides he has made on his own that makes me pause, too. If he'd had help over this time, isn't it just possible that he would have made exactly the same progress, all of which we would erroneously chalk up to the  ists ? It's just a question with no answer that runs often through my mind; of course I know we still plan to get him all the  ists  we can get him. We're on every waiting list and have calls out all around town. This is an endless job among endless jobs, lost in a maze, buried in a conundrum, dark and murky, and there are times I just don't want to work this hard. Doesn't sound like me -- I LOVE to work hard -- but I'm about to fall over. And yes, we even got a baby sitter this weekend, so all of you who tell me to take a break can be assured I try to, but I need more than a break, and even at getting a break I'm doing the best I can. Or at least I'm doing the most I can. I don't know if that's the same or not. Rambling isn't pretty, but neither am I. Thank you for reading my drivel. I would say you might not see me for a while, because I want so badly to turn my back on autism entirely, but you'd know that would last 10 seconds.

I looked in ever stroller, bouncer, tent, nook and cranny I could find to see if I could spy a single other meltdown in progress over the course of about two hours. Only my children needed to cry and scream and flail about on the lovely and meaningful walk on a beautiful day to fight against autism. But my inlaws joined \"The Rooster Team\" for the walk, making it the four of us against the two of them, and so we did manage to make it to the finish line. Not a minute too soon, but we made it. Yes, I know: a parable for sure. We need all the extra hands we can get on Team Rooster to make it to water finish lines exist in the long walk against autism.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/04/walking-talk.html", "title": "\nWalking the Talk\n"},

I press the cell phone to one ear and plug the other ear, shouting, \"Hello?\" over the shrill screams of Peaches and the rooster. We are outside and they are pretending something I am too old to decipher. \"How are you doing?\" he asks.

It's ridiculous on a lot of levels. For one thing, my hair is huge, and I doubt anyone spends much time noticing the white sprouts amid the gigantic auburn explosion all over my head. (Let's just say I fit in perfectly for a brief moment in the 80s in the South.) For another, I don't much care about how I look, as evidenced by the lack of makeup, haircuts, showers, and decent wardrobe. Surely I have bigger battles and more important things to do. Why on earth do I have this vain and pointless habit? The big irony: I squint when I pluck out those hairs, and the squinting is giving me some obvious wrinkles between my eyes. HAH - now  that is  going to make me vain and self-conscious. And you can't pluck a wrinkle. Okay, so you realize that my bad metaphor du jour is coming next, so I hope you're going to duck. My rooster has his own set of gray hairs of a sort, and I don't know why I pick at them sometimes. They aren't important enough to fret over. Yet I do. But if I don't stop I realize I'm could leave some lasting marks. Does it really matter right now in the context of everything else going on if the rooster gets potty-trained right now, or if his hair grows as long as the girls? Do I really need to force him to sit when he watches Sesame Street if he really wants to stand? Does it make any difference to the big picture if he insists on pushing all the buttons on the elevator? Or does it matter that we all get a little respite now and then from the struggles? Shouldn't I prioritize, and let go of the small stuff? I'm planning right now to spend more of my stuck-in-traffic time looking at the kids in the rearview mirror and less time giving myself wrinkles unnecessarily.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/04/mirror-mirror.html", "title": "\nMirror Mirror\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2008", "body": "\nSome of the women who teach the rooster have known me a long time. One has known me through my FOUR -- count 'em -- last names. (Don't ask.) We have had lunches together, gone to  inservices  together, attended meetings together. I really like these women, and it feels awkward to know that I have the child who sends them home completely spent each day. On the other hand, I know that they care about the rooster in a way that they wouldn't -- couldn't -- without the connection I share with them. Even though the classroom has a one-way viewing window, I don't hover much. I pass that window on my way to do legitimate stuff, and I don't always stop to look for the rooster inside. Of  course  I do  sometimes . But usually I know what I will see -- 21 kids behaving, one rooster bouncing around like the pinball in the machine that just got a good flick. I'm not too masochistic - I rarely like to watch myself bleed. When I see the teachers in the hall or lunch room, though, I often feel compelled to ask, \"How is the day?\" Almost always, the answer is \"bumpy.\" I can't tell you how many times I've considered the kindness of this word. It's so much more generous and descriptive than the word I use when people ask me how my days are with the kids. \"Awful.\" \"Impossible.\" \"Long.\" Today was bumpier, I think, because daddy drove the kids in, which usually never happens, but I had a breakfast meeting and needed to leave the house around 6:20 a.m. This, of course, played through my guilty-mother-mind when I'd crossed paths with a teacher by 10 and found out about his bumpy morning. But with bumpy, there are ups and downs, and the word itself has a playful, innocuous sound, and so, knowing that my only other choice meant worry and self-flagellation over something I could not have changed or done differently, I decided to let it go, and tell myself tomorrow would be another day. After school, the daycare teacher we all adore let me know that the rooster is nearly out of his beloved snack -- grapes -- and we all know that could spell disaster for tomorrow. So, on the way home from the endless day, I took the kids with me to a health food store to buy more. The store is tiny, with carts to match, and both kids begged to sit in one of the single-seater mini carts -- a physical impossibility for me while navigating seven or eight tiny aisles alone. I encouraged, begged, tricked, urged, and prodded the rooster to walk, and I grabbed grapes and some  gfcf  snacks as quickly as I could, at last plopping him briefly in a cart at the end as we stood and contemplated the health food store's version of the impulse buy rack near the registers. From there, we encountered a darling 7-year-old who wanted to chat despite the rooster's failure to live up to her conversational expectations, a bizarre and surly customer who clearly resented our existence, and a cashier who left mid checkout for more than five minutes without so much as a word to us in order to take a phone call. I thought about writing about our grocery store trip tonight, and I felt tempted to describe it as a long and awful trip for grapes, but why put anyone reading this through that? Really, we just had a bumpy time at the grocery store.

{"date": "Sunday, April 20, 2008", "body": "\nI am not writing this for anyone to read, and I don't need to be told how awful I sound. I am fully aware of how awful I sound. Likewise, I already know that millions of people could outdo me in chronicling the awfulness around them but choose not to do it because they are better people than I am. Great. Now, I am going to write this anyway. It's my process, and it's for me. It's like sticking a fork in a potato to release the steam so you can swallow the food without burning away your insides. It begins with a typical morning here, actually even a better one, but for us good is still bad and easy is still hard, and our \"normal\" with Rooster, 3, and Peaches, 2, is like a bad day of Jon and Kate Plus Eight with two 6-year- olds  and six 2-year- olds . 5:30 Peaches screams, \" MOOMMMMMMY !\" I leap from bed in fear she has the stomach flu from which I am 90 percent recovered and which has kept my husband up all night. Nope. She just wants to start her request list. \"Pancake.\" she demands. We are out. \"WAFFLE!\" she yells. I make her one. She shreds it up and flings it on the floor. \"I don't like that. I want PANCAKES.\" Yes, I have rules and discipline, but my husband needs some quiet in his post-agony and the rooster is still snoring his miserable, adenoid thick snore. I serve Peaches  conciliatory  snacks and let her accompany me to the one clean bathroom. God forbid I pee alone. She actually climbs on my legs in the process. 6:00 The rooster is awake, demanding TV and pancakes. Hugs? Denied. \"Not today,\" he tells me. 6:10 The week of stomach flu means no shopping, and the rooster has very few  gfcf  foods in stock, so I allow him what  gfcf  food we have on hand, ginger snaps, while I go find clean diapers and clothes for both kids. 6:12 My arms full of diaper supplies, I find the rooster crumbling ginger snaps  alllllllll   ooooooovvvver  the floor. He looks at me and screams. \"PANCAKES,  PULLLLEEEEAAAAAAAAZE . I made a cookie floor, see?\" 6:15 I am wrestling the rooster into a diaper, size 7, almost too small, as he constantly tries to walk away, while Peaches whines her mantra. The mantra. The  whinemantra . \" Pickmeupmommy ,  pickmeup ,  pickmeup ,  pikmiup ,  pimeeeupppp ,  UPPPPP ,  UPPPP ,  WHAAAA ,\" (repeat). 6:20 I am wrestling the Peaches into her diaper while the rooster runs around the room. \"I. WANT. PANCAKES.\" ( GFCF  pancakes we cook at home, in an expensive and laborious process, so that we can freeze them. Bisquick they ain't.) 6:30 Trying to teach the children how to clean up their own messes, we sweep up expensive  gfcf  ginger crumbs from the floor together (tedious process complicated by reminders not to hit, spit, scream, push or kick). 7:00 A deal is brokered: I will take you to the store to buy the greatly coveted STRAWBERRIES if you will brush your teeth, put on your shoes and behave. 7:30 Teeth brushing accomplished, but I am sweating, both their shirts are wet, and we have no more clean bathrooms. Mental notes: buy new toothbrushes, hire  toothbrushing  therapist, get nanny, win lottery. 7:35 He has one shoe on, she is crying, they are arguing. 7:36 He has no shoes on, they are fighting. 7:38 She has on both shoes and is repeating the mantra by the door. 7:38:30 They each have on one shoe. He is screaming, \"STRAWBERRIES, NOW!  AARRARAAAGGGG !\" 7:42 Shod 7:45 I load the angels into my filthy, condemnable car. My teeth are not brushed, my clothes are not clean or well fitting (shirt too tight, pants too big), I am not wearing my glasses. Oh well, I can see passably well out of one of my eyes, and those scratched up crooked glasses are at least a year past their prescription, so no big deal. 7:46 Backseat screams remind me I have not turned on the favorite book on tape of the week ( Beezus  and Ramona). I push it in for the trillionth time and we all chime it as it is now memorized. Mental note: Scour  ebay  for new books on  audiocassette . (No  cd  player in my 12-year-old basic model much-puked-in Saturn.) 7:48 I turn around and state my terms: Good behavior at the store equals ALL THE FRUIT YOU WANT, and maybe a toy, too. Bad behavior? Zero fruit, zero treats, straight home, no fun, time out. I can tell by their expressions that for once they hear me, they are hungry, and my terms are accepted. 7:56 We pull in not to the close grocery store, but the store where I know they have carts designed like trucks for two small drivers. We load up on fruits,  snapea  crisps, baby wipes, and Color Wonder marker sets. I cast longing glances at the dairy products and the alcohol aisle. It's early and not crowded this Sunday morning and so no one visibly minds my banshee truck drivers in the aisles. 8:06 Near the finish line, the rooster reverts to his ranting NO diatribe, so we try my new technique, a song I wrote during the previous day's MELT DOWN that actually works so far with the boy, a lovely duet that goes like this: Me: When I say no, you say Rooster: yes Me: When I say no, you say Rooster: yes Me: NO R: YES Me: No, oh, oh R: Yes, es, es Me: NO R: YES Me: No, no, no R: yes, yes, yes Sue me, but I get a twisted pleasure out of tricking him into so many  yeses . 8:45 We arrive home, unload our booty in the backyard, and eat and play. We are all perfectly content for NINE WHOLE MINUTES. Manna, jewels from heaven. Before 9 a.m. I am completely spent. I have made no major accomplishments, come nowhere near the urgent to do list on the breakfast bar, and the Sunday blues are looming large. I have been up for 3 1/2 hours and already I'm counting down to \"bed time.\" It's a long count... 11 hours to go. And then it hits me... the truth that calls out my bitterness. This, I realize, is one of our better days. I look inward and search for my sense of gratitude, and I come up empty. I think of those less fortunate... and can't seem to learn from that, either, I am ashamed (but honest) to say. I need to blog.

{"date": "Saturday, April 19, 2008", "body": "\nMy nephew, Little B, is my mom's oldest grandchild. I think he's eight, but my mom launched his presidential campaign several years back, and calls me regularly to describe his genius in great detail. I imagine my mom probably gushes about my kids to the rest of the family too, but Little B, her first grandchild, definitely hung the moon over my mom's house, and I get a full report on everything he ate, said, did, and played with, from every visit or phone call she's ever had with him. I am not complaining! I like this. It's cute. Her grandmotherly pride makes me smile. It has served to help me better appreciate my mother's maternalism, as I can assure you she did not behave this way over her own kids. I also don't think there is any favoritism about it. My mom adores the rooster and Peaches, too. They aren't as old as Little B, and they live far from her, so they don't give her as many bragging rights yet, but she dotes lovingly on all of her small brood.  I don't see much of Little B, though I love him and love getting the updates. My brother (his dad) and I don't speak, for a trillion great reasons, and his family lives on the opposite side of the country from mine. So my mother calls me the other day to let me know she revealed the rooster's diagnosis to Little B's mom. And I bet you guessed what... for my mom, it was an enormous shock that Little B might turn out to have some form of a diagnosis of his own. Of course, his history is not just like the rooster's, but he hasn't sailed through his development on the crystal blue waters my mom had imagined. Hmmmmm. I was thoroughly unsurprised, on some level, along with my mixed emotions. First, I am sad about it. I love my nephew, whether or not we have turkey dinners together, and I always will. I wish him all smooth sailing through childhood, and to know that he has had struggles akin to our own depresses me. It isn't right that so many kids face such great challenges. Childhood in today's times is just a wreck of a thing, isn't it?  But also, no matter the diagnosis or label or whatever, Little B is a smart and funny kid with hobbies and passions who wins trophies in martial arts and stuff. So, if Little B can do it, that is another hopeful reminder to me that in another five years or so, maybe the rooster will be in calmer waters as well. And then there is the whole genetic thing again. I'll repeat my mantra -- I have no way of knowing why the rooster is who/how he is, but he's always been roostery. And Little B? I think he's always been Little B. And they are bound by blood... For my mom, old school in so many ways, it was kind of an aha; \"I told you that the world has gone crazy trying to find every little thing wrong with everybody -- you watch, they'll grow up to be Einsteins.\" Mom has lent one hundred percent -- no, even more than that -- of her support to us, but you can tell on some level she thinks of autism as some kind of New Age Hocus Pokus Gobbledygook. Then there is the question in my mind about the \"secrecy\" about Little B. Was it secrecy? If so, why? And how do I feel about that? And how does the rest of my family feel with me being so \"out there\" about the rooster? And how will the rooster feel about it? About this blog? These are all just questions, no answers in the bunch. So what else is new? All I know is that Little B and the rooster might someday share a ticket, and that my mom will be more than happy to do their press.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/04/grandma-what-big-eyes-you-have.html", "title": "\nGrandma, What Big Eyes You Have\n"},

Instead, I'm thinking about work, which I went back to today. It's bringing up some metaphors for me... I have an interesting job, one that I love, one at which I work quite hard, one that I helped design. I think people appreciate the work I do, because they get the sense that I help students and teachers learn, and that I care, but I am fairly certain that not many people really know what exactly it  is  that I do. My title helps very little. On a regular basis I find myself fantasizing about making a little video or business card or poem or who knows what, but something that gives a satisfying answer when people say, \"So what do you do at the school?\" How much does all this sound like being a MOM? Imagine trying to define the word MOM. Or write the job description. Now imagine the same for a special needs mom. Yowza. So, I went back to work today, after being out for two days. Some people didn't even know I had been gone. Why not? Because those people have offices on the same hall as mine, but they don't work in classrooms, and I do, and that is where they rightfully assume I usually am when I'm not around. My desk is not where the bulk, or the substance, of my work is done -- it's done at other people's desks, and usually short people's -- desks with stickers and lollipop lettering. Other people had become acutely aware of my absence, leaving me emails, voice mails, little notes in my mail box. Most of the things they wanted my help with they can probably do on their own, they often just don't believe that they can. I am working on building their confidence, though I realize that might challenge my job security! See? More similarities. (I also had very sweet inquiries about how I was feeling, and many kind get well wishes, and those helped me so much.) So, maybe when people ask me at work what it is, exactly, that I do, it will help them if I say something like this... \"I work with technology, but I'm not a computer teacher. Instead I use technology like a teacher-slash-mother, to help in any way that helps people learn and grow.\" Nah, that sounds lame. But cut me some slack.

Still pondering this, I found myself laughing at so many things he said today, a mental list began to form so I could share with everyone. Among the quotables today...

Me: Do you need to throw up, Rooster? R: No, mommy, I am all done throwupping. Not today, okay? Me: Roo, do you need to take another bath? R: No, mommy, I don't want to take a bath. There is poopy in the tub! R: Mommy, your hair is beautiful! Me: Thank you, Rooster! R: Here, let me put a wipe in it! Me: No! Rooster, don't put the baby wipe in mommy's hair. (He does it anyway. At least the wipe is unused and clean save for pink finger prints --- he'd been drawing with pink earlier.) R: Now you are a Queen! Me: Rooster, why did you pull open that roll of film? (Editor's Note: Visualizing the unspooled film is important here. It's stretched out like a Slinky.) R: That's not film, mommy. It's a tornado. It's going to knock down my tower! So ta da, I put my finger on the subtle difference. It's the volleying. My turn, your turn, my turn again.

With these symptoms, she has gone from way too clingy for her age to way too clingy for a kid half her age, and has only left my hip long enough to devour the popsicle I finally gave her.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 9, 2008", "body": "\nI don't write much about anything other than rooster, and that strikes me as strange. I guess I should start by saying that my ability to write about the rooster  at all  surprises me, as well -- a lifelong dabbler at writing, I've never felt comfortable writing anything like first person, memoirish stuff. (As a journalism major, every time I ended up having to write the house editorial for my college paper, I tried to get out of it. I could write 3 play reviews, a news article, and a profile in the time it took me to scratch out a short editorial.) It's this strange new contradiction of an almost out-of-body variety that allows me to do this right now -- I feel constantly on the brink of embarrassment and shame as I write posts for this blog, but at the same time, my fingers usually seem to write faster than I even know what they are up to, and when I realize that I've clicked \"Publish Post,\" I always feel shocked, but better that I did before I started writing. But I'm often surprised but what I've written, as well as what I haven't written, and when I read my own stuff I find myself wondering why don't I write more about the other things going on in our family. Sure, I know this my Rooster blog, but we're all interconnected; even as I wrote about the others it would still relate to the rooster. So: I idolize my grandma. She is sick. See? Was the above a work of impressive blogging? This one is not writing itself. I'm facing long pauses here -- my fingers are not flying. I'm forcing this blog out. I had to slave for seven words, two simple sentences. But I have decided that maybe if I can eke out something, maybe it will help me, the way it helps to blog about the rooster. Okay, so I think what I'm trying to say, or trying not to say, or something, is that, for as long as I've been writing about my rooster's struggles, and my struggles with his struggles, my grandma has also been suffering with her own. I feel my concern for my grandma as acutely as I feel my concern for my child, but one gets a blog and one finds me nearly silent. My grandparents are the heroes in my life, heroes who treated me like their own child, saved me from all manner of evil, and remained youthful well into their old age. My grandpa passed away a few years ago, and that was very hard, and then my grandma began to age, and that was very hard. But my grandma was still strong enough about four years ago to fly 3,000 miles to be with me when the rooster was born. She and my mom both came, were with me when I went into labor, stayed in the hospital during my 32 hours of labor. My grandma, 80ish, breast cancer survivor, diabetic, flesh-eating bacteria survivor, spent the entire night in the waiting room, then made it through an entire day of waiting, until at last she saw her great grandchild born, the first time she ever watched a birth like that. Then she and mom went out to the deli across the street and brought me back more food than I could ever imagine eating... so like my grandma to feed me well. She said what she has said so often in my life when I needed it, \"I'm so proud of you I could bust.\"  But my grandma has been in and out of the hospital and a rehabilitation center for some heart problems and other ailments while I've been writing these blogs, and where am I? Not in the waiting room. And I feel terrible. I feel like I'm letting her down this time. Sometimes if feels like being pulled apart on a rack. I might not have written much about her, but I have thought about my grandma every single day. I think about her, and I think about my mom and stepdad who take care of her, every single day. When I get really scared, I call my dear friend C who I've loved since fifth grade, now a doctor in our home town, and she talks me through it, and stops in to see my grandma in my stead, and helps her more than I ever could, and then calls me back or emails whatever reassurance she can. I call my mom at least once a day for the updates, and to offer my support. If my mom - or C - ever tells me, \"Come now,\" I'm ready to go. But is that enough? Sure, of course, I absolutely know that my grandma probably wants me here, taking care of Peaches and Rooster. I can hear her in my mind telling me that I'm needed here. I know there isn't a lot I can do to help my grandma right now. I know that she might even improve, and that there might be a better time coming for a visit, and time when we might be able to say I love you eye to eye. I know that my grandma knows that I love her very much, that I adore her. But I feel as though I'm failing her right now. And I feel like if I go to her, I'll be failing my husband and children. Honestly, if my husband left me alone with the kids so he could travel, even for an important reason, I worry I'd end up needing to call 911. We haven't gotten far enough out of our rough patch, and we survive days by the skin of our teeth, nights by even less. So how do I go? And how do I not? Let alone the toll of it. Travel to my hometown to see grandma 3,000 miles from here involves  at least  two flights, at least an hour layover, and at least a 70 mile drive across the state line an through rural back roads after that, totalling about 10 hours of travel time barring anything unforeseen. It doesn't lend itself well to children, certainly not MY children, so I can't imagine taking the with me for this kind of journey. The rooster gets so sick each time we travel that last time we went to see grandma he had blood trickling out of his eye by the time we made it all the way there, and we were lucky to know a doctor who could treat him asap, unlocking his practice at night to get us what we needed. (Of much less consequence, I have used all my work time off for family medical purposes, and I continue taking unpaid time off for a slew of appointments that leave my calendar looking bloodied with red highlights.) Is this excuse making? Is it even right to put all this out there, knowing someone will reasure me? Please, no one reassure me. Please don't. Grandma, I am coming soon. I just don't know exactly when, but I love you, and I'm so sorry I'm not there yet. My heart is. It's in two places at once, but it's still full of love.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/04/grands.html", "title": "\nGrands\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 5, 2008", "body": "\nI think I might owe Jenny McCarthy an apology. And possibly a gluten-free,  casein -free lunch. When Jenny McCarthy went on the talk show circuit saying she cured her child of autism with this special diet, my most judgmental inner voice blurted out, \"Great, another B-List Celebrity hawks a diet plan, and this time kids are the victims. She ought to be ashamed. What is wrong with people? Her poor kid. What a load of garbage.\" That was ugly talk, and as tempted as I am, I will not blame my upbringing on my wicked tongue. I am judgmental and it's the thing I am working on hardest about myself. Now, that is not to say I'm writing tonight to take a stance, get political, persuade you the joys of the  gfcf  diet, or start a Jenny McCarthy fan club (I'm not only not a fan, I'm not sure I've ever seen anything she did). NOPE. I am writing tonight, for one thing, to say, in as low- jinxy  of a way as I can, that today was not awful, because those of you rooting for us (and holding us up with your strength and love) deserve to know that, and I am giving a bit of credit to diet. I have still not read Jenny McCarthy's books or even heard her spiel, more than a minute-long recap on the radio, so I'm not saying that we follow whatever it is she advocates, because I don't know thing one about her story. I also know that plenty of people have tried all kinds of diets as a means to help their children, and it didn't work. Diet clearly is not a one-size-fits-all sure-fire miracle. What I am saying is that I do know I am certainly learning -- in a way I never imagined -- how powerful diet can be to the human brain. (Are you thinking, \"No duh?\" I don't know why I never got it before, but I never got it before.) Now, we've made many changes in the last couple months, because we'd reached an unsustainable level of misery and we needed to throw the kitchen sink at it to get some peace. A  gfcf  diet (also no soy and very little sugar) is just one thing among many we've tried, so I can't say for sure how much to credit it with the rooster's better days. I don't know if diet played a part to somehow help rooster share his toys with his sister today, or kept him from  tantruming  on the long car ride (to pick up some  gfcf  supplies), or helped him blend in (when does that happen?!) at two birthday parties in a row, or inspired him to walk up to his daddy unprompted and say, \"I'm crazy about you, Daddy!\" Maybe his pragmatics and reciprocity issues seem better lately for a host of other complex reasons. do know this, though. My rooster's first cold happened when he was three months old. Every entry in my thorough journals indicates it's still with us, more than three and a half years later. But without a doubt in my mind, today he is the least sick he's looked in all that time. Furthermore, without giving you  TMI , our rooster is still in diapers, and the contents of those diapers have NEVER seemed healthy. Until this weekend. He looked better, he felt better, he digested better, than he ever has, and today was not awful, not even a little awful. We've been religious about the diet for several weeks now, and my gut tells me it is paying off. I can barely forgive myself for not trying this diet sooner. I was hugely ignorant about food. Even if you might find it understandable that I rolled my eyes at Jenny McCarthy before I knew better, I should have heard what Barbara  Kingsolver  was saying. I am a huge fan of  Kingsolver's  fiction, but I also read her memoir about eating locally. She made a point I think of often lately. She marveled that people who might not think twice about expensive travel or clothes don't want to spend extra on food in order to eat what is best for them. She said something like this: food is one of the three essential things that humans need in order to STAY ALIVE. Given that NO DUH fact, you would think that people would be willing to put effort and money toward eating right. Well, hey, I will be the first to say that I personally have all kinds of issues with eating, issues that go way back, issues that come from all corners and could support another whole blog, but I thought I was doing much better for my kids. Both of them have always been provided very \"healthy\" diets. I always thought I was providing better for them than for myself in that way. I just had no idea that for some kids on the spectrum, kids like my rooster, \"healthy\" is more complicated. Once again, I learn that he has special needs, but that we can find ways to meet them if we try really hard. So, anyways, I hope you heard this one thing amid all the other stuff I rambled about in this post: Today? Not awful. Really that's what I'm trying to say. Thanks again, everybody.

{"date": "Thursday, April 3, 2008", "body": "\nThe thing is, it's not like I ever even expected to have easy kids, an easy go of grownup life. I didn't! I promise. When it sounds like I'm full of sour grapes, please don't think I was expecting some Crystal Stair. Mostly I'm a realist, or I thought so until recently. Maybe I'm really a pessimist. Whatever I am, if you've read any of my other posts, you can probably tell by my now that optimism isn't my strong suit. When I met my husband, falling happened quickly, but I told him early on I needed to call the whole thing off asap if he didn't want a family. I knew with conviction that I wanted marriage, children. Without idealizing or fantasizing overmuch, I knew if I didn't at least try to have a family, I'd never feel content. I didn't assume that family would make me content, just that the absence of family would cause me regret. I don't do regret well. The family of my childhood didn't have \"happy\" in its vocabulary, and I served as peacemaker, problem solver, stability manager for two adults and an older brother from the time I hit preschool until our family crumbled around the time I hit double digits. Then I took over managing my mother's upbringing as she brought home a series of alcoholic boyfriends in a period I think of as the advanced juvenile delinquency of her mid thirties (my current age). With no such thing as blogs yet invented, I wrote in my elementary school diary how I would never raise kids the way my parents did. I ached to live in a home you could walk through without pointing at the broken things and describing them like this: \"this is where the chair missed my head but scraped the woodwork, this is from the coffee cup that she threw at him...\" So this is why I say I had no grand or naive Brady Bunch illusions about First Comes Love... I figured life would be hard, marriage would be hard, money would be hard, kids would be hard. I thought I'd been well acquainted with hard and spoke the language well enough to get by. I figured health would be hard, too. But the thing is, I've always  liked  working hard. I've always felt proud of rolling up my sleeves and using hard work to overcome the struggles, to come out on the other side. I've always been able to fight and work my way toward peace and tranquility, if that makes any sense. Maybe this is where the naivete comes in though: I think I thought working my ass off, armed with love, I could mother, and that would be enough. That I'd teach my kids to work hard, too, to feel the enoughness, the satisfaction, that comes from working hard, and they would feel proud and happy too, no matter how we might all struggle. It's a \"you-and-me-against-the-world\" camraderie I've always yearned for in my relationships; I love to be on a team, a mushy team with credos and ideals and common goals, even when we come in last place. I love the process, the journey, the always being prepared, together. I would have signed up for Brownies or Scouts, but my mother said they made her puke. I guess when I started my own family I made the same mistake so many parents make, assuming I'd have Mini Mes, kids who would similarly enjoy the process to struggle, conquer, overcome, revel in that success... I never stopped to consider that my kids would have anything in common with my own parents. I don't know why not -- I certainly always identified with my own grandparents, who often took over the parenting roles my mother and father didn't play. It feels like a cruel twist of fate sometimes when I do battle against my kids to give them what they need, and when I have no other choice but to fight against them for their own sakes. I long for them to be on my team, but we certainly don't have any rah-rah team spirit yet around our house. I think rooster would have the same puke reaction to Scouts as my mom (the mom of the olden days; un the end, my mom grew up quite nicely, around the time I graduated college. Today she could practically be a Scout Leader. Who knew?) Never ever for a single solitary instance do I regret having babies, these babies. They are hard, one clearly much harder than the other, but I love them in equal measures with every breath I breathe. The love is the biggest thing in our house, no matter how much hurt comes too. The love comes from all four of us, just in different ways.  But it sure isn't how I pictured. I guess I wanted to give my babies the childhood I did not have, and that maybe I selfishly hoped I could taste a slice of what I missed on my first go-round. I knew I would not put my children through the worst apsects of my own upbringing: hostility, rage, inconsistency, desperation, greed, yelling, screaming. It never occured to me that no matter what parenting I might do, that these things might find our way into our family by way of a suffering child. (Maybe I should have thought of my own parents as suffering children and it might have helped. I just didn't have the perspective -- I was, after all -- a baby, a child, too.) My long-time dear friend, C, grew up in the family I wanted. They spent their weekends painting the house together, they played board games in the dining room, shared clothes, helped each other bake cookies. They were not perfect, they just liked each other's company from the word go. It was as simple as that. C's dad invited me to join in their family outings, where I stuck out like a sore thumb, but loved every minute of the hikes, treks, trips I stunk at. C's dad listened to my family angst and cautioned me not to wish my life away, and to be careful what I wished for. I hear his voice in my head when I remember how I wished to have babies, knowing that the deities would never let me have any easy kids, but believing that we could just work really hard and overcome anything. Slowly I am learning that when my child rages, when it comes from his complicated suffering, I can try to help him find his way, but that I can not simply make it go away with super human effort. Sometimes the only effort that helps even a drop is the effort I make to be patient.  We do make steps forward once in a while, and things are improving in some regards. We are not entirely stuck. I love Peaches and my rooster with all of my heart, even though the family of my childhood dreams still looks like a fantasy.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/04/be-careful.html", "title": "\nBe Careful\n"},

Like the people who ask in a real way, \"So how are you, honestly?\" Because sometimes I tell them, honestly, I'm awful, and they tell me I'm not. I know where they come from, a good place, but the little angry shrew who lives inside me insists on speaking up tonight, and so she's going to write about (please don't read this) her awful truth: Yes, even if it's a good day, I mostly feel awful. There aren't enough of those good days, and they're sandwiched between tortures. I don't sleep enough, and I'll never ever catch up on the sleep I've lost -- I'm a hundred years old, based on how many hours I've spent awake. And it's not all the Rooster's fault. He's gotten lots better. Add to the mix a newly two-year-old with a thing for 3 a.m. contact, and I'm awful. I am too fat, and when on earth does any well meaning suggester fathom I might exercise? Puleaze. I look awful. Tired, fat, immersed in negativity, with nothing to wear and a bunch of miserable gluten free crap in the fridge. I hear the word \"no\" at least 60 times on the average day, and I mean a weekday, when I send them to school for seven or eight hours. Weekends? Awful. I hear the word \"want\" 200 times a day on a weekend, sometimes by dinner. Awful. And you know what I hate? While I drive with my left hand (I'm right handed) through heinous urban traffic, I serve food, manage requests like a book-on-tape dj, retrieve books, settle fights, hold hands, wipe noses, serve more food, clean up food, and... \"ANOTHER TAPE! ANOTHER TAPE NOW, MOOOOMMMMMY, NOW. NOOOOOOWWWWWWW!\" Awful. I complain, and that makes me feel awful. I hold it in, AWFUL AWFUL. Really AWFUL, like I'm decaying and putrid. I manage to find (by delaying the needed sleep a bit) only enough moments by myself each week to blog here, and NOTHING ELSE. I don't get haircuts, I don't see friends, I don't shop, I don't go to classes, clubs, meetings, nothing. I am never, ever alone. Not even in the bathroom. I get behind on paperwork and housekeeping so I can keep up on laundry, diapers-times-two, GFCF organizing, therapy hunting, and it's all worth it, it is all my choice, it is all for a family that I long prayed for and deeply adore, that was the only thing I ever really wanted, but I swear to you, there are sickly awful times amidst the gratitude, because it sometimes feels like there is no ME left anywhere in the whole world. My rooster can make it better with a hug and a kiss, and a moment of growth, of good pragmatics, of happiness, but the truth is that the vast majority of the time, the rooster's mood is one hundred percent awful, the kind of awful you would not tolerate in your friend, your employee, your boss, your boyfriend, your mother-in-law, or your hairdresser. But you can't break up with your Rooster. You have to take the awful and try not let it show. The Peaches can help with smiles and play, but did I mention she just turned two? Even if it isn't awful, it isn't as Peachy as one. Someone says, \"No, you're okay, you're doing okay, you really do seem okay.\" I have nothing left to say to that. I can just add that to the awful pile inside me. Yeah, okay, I might be dramatic and intense, I've been called that before, but I'm pathologically honest, and if I ever get checked into a padded room somewhere, I guarantee you no one will be able to say, \"Gosh, and she never gave us any signs that anything was off!\" In my family, the highest compliment I ever heard any of my elders bestow on any sainted figure goes something like this, \"She's been through thus-and-such, but you would never know it. You never hear a word about it.\" I know that I am an utter, complete, unmitigated failure at silent suffering, and therefore that black mark plagues me. It's awful. I can name 50 stoic friends and family who have suffered awfulness and never once uttered the word. I don't deserve to walk in their presence. They are good. You know exactly what I am, and the word good is not it. Plenty of times I manage to feel grateful for the big and small blessings in my life. I do. I really swear that I DO. I notice the good, I revel in what I can, I avoid keeping score. You might not believe that side of me, as I rant out of my head here in this space filled with my pettiness and greed, but I do seek the good and wallow in simple joy with abandon when I can. I'm sure you know the result of that: the Deity Smackdown, the one step forward, three steps backward dance. When I come back around to awful, there's nothing for it but to blog.

It may have been our first successful celebration in quite some time, full of good moods, probably because we kept things small, simple, dialed back. Some of the family members had not seen either of the kids in some time, though they've been hearing about all of our collective struggles and strides. They offered helping hands, such as taking the rooster for a walk with a plentiful cup of organic strawberries (his absolute favorite treat) at the perfect time so that Peaches could enjoy the verboten chocolate cake without hurting his feelings or wrecking the festivities. With spare offerings aside from fruits, veggies and cake, we explained to our guests our initiation into gfcf eating, and I commented how much healthier the rooster looks -- purple shiners receding -- without stopping to think, as you surely are now, what the deities would do with such brazenness. He woke up at 4 crying, a full-blown ear infection. So Augmentin does NOT fall under the whole careful diet, toxin-avoiding path we're trying to forge. One point for deities. But we turned down the meds for weeks when first one doctor and then another commented that he had a slightly red ear, that we could delay medicines  as long as he didn't get any worse . Once, LONG before we knew much about the spectrum or much of anything that would later come to pervade our lives, I felt uneasy about giving our boy another antibiotic, and I asked my sister-in-law, a pediatrician in another city, what could happen if we let the infection run its course without treating it with antibiotics. He might get better on his own, she said. He might get worse. Worst case scenarios? Hearing loss. Meningitis. Damage to his brain... Tomorrow is the first day back to school, and I'd been fantasizing that the rooster's teachers would notice an improved boy, well rested, better regulated, adjusted to his new diet, and ready to talk, play, listen, learn. Tomorrow will, though, also be his first day back to expectations, and he'll be 24 hours into Augmentin. So, I've cast aside my fantasies, and (DEITIES, hear me now) I'll be happy if we all get through the day. But deities can't move time backward, and they can't do a thing about the great day we had celebrating with Peaches.

Then, we met with the developmental pediatrician, who cautioned us that the environment at this special school might be too restrictive for our boy. His issues, though numerous and challenging, are never the ones that make the top 20 list on brochures and autism checklists, and he desperately needs to learn verbal pragmatics, so she told us that a social group of less verbal kids could result in the rooster actually struggling more to communicate effectively. So then we set about trying to figure out how to keep the rooster in place and cobble together a variety of pull-outs, after school and weekend interventions, etc. We made calls, researched our options, investigated. That happened just as the rooster began really deteriorating in his behavior, and he got sent home from school for losing his cool. So then we decided to go see the special school for ourselves. My husband told the tour leader his dilemma. \"This is a wonderful place, but our developmental pediatrician said the rooster is the kind of kid who needs the least restrictive environment so that he strives to meet his language goals.\" The woman giving the tour guide gently and kindly tried a little Doctor Phil, and while I'm no Phil fan, it helped us realize that it ain't working for us right now. She said, \"If your son has a really rich curriculum where he is, but he can't access it because of behavior is so disregulated, then it is not meeting his needs, is it?\" We still have many decisions to weigh and battles to fight, but I think we might have found a good place for our boy at this special school. Maybe not for always, but maybe for now. In some ways I can see where a special school could be \"restrictive,\" but in a way it also feels just the opposite, too. It could open a world of ABA, OT, and much more that he can't get where he is now. While on the tour, a boy with a roosterish quality caught my husband's eye and waved, smiled. He was having fun and learning on a typical school day. A teacher walked by pushing a cart full of drums, shakers, noise makers. The faculty sparkled with energy. Kids got their needs met. I don't know, but that doesn't sound too restrictive, does it? Does it?

You could not pay me all the gold at the end of the rainbow to describe the rollercoaster ride of THIS day. For one thing, all these lying memoirists making headlines will come to mind. You'll think I'm spinning some crazy yarn about the brand new babysitter who made sure the rooster's dad and I both took down her cell number, and then disappeared for the entire day with our son without answering the phone that rang with increasing frequency for the next seven hours, more and more after I got home desperate and frantic to see no sign of them. But for darn sure there ain't no way I'm going to tell you about how the rooster acted when he came HOME grinning ear to ear with the babysitter, who claimed he spent the day with her at the park WITH FRIENDS, having a BLAST. Nuh uh. I am from the South, and when I am adamant, I need the twang, and I reckon that only a FOOL would tell you how the rooster and his sister sat happily playing for more than an hour with little plastic cake decorating pieces from one of my baby showers. You could beg me on your hands and knees to show you the video we shot, so entranced were my husband and I, and I wouldn't let you see them on our kitchen floor, taking turns, or hear them talk about sharing the plastic baby dolls and pretending to feed them. No, I don't talk about these things anymore, I don't mention when the rooster of sweeter days shows back up at our house for a spell, and I don't tell tales about the excellent use of pronouns and question words and abstract language and referencing and reciprocity. Not for all the tea in China am I going to let the whole darn Internet know about the kisses and giddy laughs I got tonight, boy. And don't you try and get me to talk, either. You just hush right up about the whole crazy thing. Tomorrow is a new day, and when it really, really, really sucks, THEN you'll hear from me. I will have plenty to say about that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/well-shut-my-mouth.html", "title": "\nWell Shut My Mouth\n"},

But my pet peeve is when there are too many characters, and I can't keep them all straight in my head. I admit to putting down some books unfinished because the cast grew too confusing. There are too many roosters lately. They come and go, and sometimes change on a moment's notice. I can't even tell anymore which one has been here longest, or when I saw this or that one last. I am confused. Woefully confused. Tonight, the rooster sauntered in late with a babysitter (our school is on vacation, but I still work), after I got home, after I started to worry for the second day in a row, but how could I complain when I could see in the strut as he got out of the car and walked toward the house that the calm rooster was making an entrance? His voice, his mannerisms indicated green lights on all systems, so I made no fuss about their tardiness, I just paid the sitter and sent her quickly on her way so I would have a chance to play turn-taking games outside with my two sweet kids before the sweetness hit the road. We played baby basketball, we rode the scooter, we spun in circles, taking turns each time. No one cried. The rooster got out one Frisbee for himself and then made a point of getting the other one for Peaches. After I would push him on a toy, he would say, \"Now it's Peaches' turn!\" This lasted at least half an hour, but I think longer. Out of nowhere, he pushed her. Not hard, but she landed on her butt, and I know she had the same thought I did, \"Which rooster is this now? And is he staying?\" For a couple of minutes the rooster blew raspberries at us, ranted, and made little sense, in a major snit, and then, poof, he melted back. \"Let's go inside and play!\" he called. \"I'm ready to watch some Sesame Street!\" The variability adds painfully to the mystery of why: have dietaries changes helped? But then why the sudden outburst? Was he well pretty well regulated from a day of physical exertion and free play, but just not perfectly regulated? Is it any of the other many changes we've tried? Is this just part of the deal? Do not get me wrong:  inconsistency beats the heck out of consistent misery. I am grateful for each good moment. Living with our breath held feels a bit reminscent of growing up around drunks, but I can deal with it. It is easier, though, when I don't wander too far into wondering why...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/which-rooster-is-calling.html", "title": "\nWhich Rooster is Calling?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 23, 2008", "body": "\nThe developmental pediatrician phrased things in a way that struck me: she said she felt \"comfortable with an Autism spectrum diagnosis.\" It's just because I'm a word girl that I turned that phrase over and over so many times. Of course, I know what she meant. The doctor, like many, sees that the rooster's issues are atypical, even of atypical issues. Autism is like that, and so are other things, and so we're all \"comfortable\" with that diagnosis. And we're going to try to be hopeful, even in the challenging times. \"Even if I'm wrong, even if this is something else, he still needs the same therapies.\" Right. Exactly. The whole point is to help the rooster. Her advice: Rally your team. That, and \"Work your butts off right now.\" We need a plan for school, first and foremost, and she thinks the rooster will be best with an ABA shadow teacher. We will have to start by finding out if our school will allow that, and, if so, then find out who the district will give us, hopefully someone from the list of better organizations the doc provided. If our school says no, we need to find another school, and that moves to the head of the triage line. Next, we need all the OT we can get. The district will provide some, but we need to get back in to the Regional Center system for more, which means more evaluations, evaluations, evaluations, and more time. We also know we need language, both what the district offers and also someone with lots of expertise in unusual kids like our boy. We hear this \"costs through the nose.\" Lower on the list: considering floor time, therapuetic riding lessons, play groups, and support for the mom who lives on the brink of losing it. At least I can say rallying has begun. Troops are aligning. Thank you to those of you among the ranks. Today a wonderful friend and her husband came by -- they knew both kids woke us up a few times in the night and that we're fried -- and babysat for two of the fastest hours in recorded history. My guy and I just walked around a shopping area nearby in a bit of a daze and noshed and stopped in the used book store for reading material not about spectrum disorders. We got home to find the rooster sweetly playing ball and Peaches napping. On a good day, with the kids in two different rooms, primed for success, and the rooster getting undivided attention, my husband and I hope we look like overreacting parents with kids who seem like they are mostly doing okay. That would suit us just fine. My dear friend totally understands what we're going through, and she's seen our kids on good days and bad. I feel the relief of having left her with them on a good one, and I'm glad she and her kind husband didn't see them in action early yesterday morning. So with our \"comfortable\" diagnosis I reach the place in my blogging (at post number 50, I believe?) where the totally unfiltered disclosure begins to become gradually less comfortable. I don't know how to process this shift yet, or really any of the shifts. I just know that, while I live as open book, always have, I'm a big girl and can choose that for myself. He's a little guy, and I need to start considering if he'd really appreciate my endless full disclosure. The point of this whole process is about helping the rooster more than it is about helping me. Blogging often helps me TO help him. I will struggle to find the right balance, the one that feels most  comfortable .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/comfort-levels.html", "title": "\nComfort Levels\n"},

You see, there are some people in our school community who just DO like my son, and not because he is my son, but for himself. Forgive me, I know it's a shameful thing to say, but their affection for this boy often catches me by surprise. It is with painful candor that I own this:  I am the one  who likes my son BECAUSE he is my son, and sometimes that is all I can muster. But clearly these people have much to teach me, and I come as a ready and eager pupil. A close friend, who I am lucky to also have as a close colleague, sat down on my office floor yesterday -- A BAD DAY -- to check in on with the rooster as he sat in exile. She let him climb all over her, take the clip from her hair, and give her a whole new hairdo, with his hands still sticky from lunch. In my temporarily disconnected place yesterday, I couldn't muster much by way of thanks to her for that half hour generously and tolerantly taken from her day. Today, this treasured auntie told me she enjoyed it, that she likes to see my boy, and I could feel her genuine fondness for my wild child. She cares about my whole family, and I care about hers, too, and so I know that our shared history does make a difference. But what I could hear her say today was that she likes the rooster. She likes him? Yes. I know how Sally felt, that mix of surprise and delight. And then there is the library teacher, who came to our school only recently, who never knew me before I had kids. She has had to say goodbye to my book-loving boy mid lesson because he just could not handle library class, and he needed to be escorted by a classroom teacher back to the room to settle down. She did not look surprised to hear that he had been sent home early. Still, she stopped me in the hall today to ask how things are going, concern evident in her eyes, her body language. \"You know,\" she told me, \"when some kids act out, I have to remind myself to keep cool. But when others, sweet kids like yours, act up, I just feel so strongly that they can't help it, that they are so sweet inside...\" She was talking about my rooster? Yes, she  likes  him. And it isn't just the grownups. The second grader who lives down the street can approach our car at zero hour -- 4:30 in the afternoon, when I'm wrestling the two shrieking greased gorillas into their car seats after school -- and she can flood the back seat with love and goodness, and by the time we say goodbye, the gorillas have evolved, settled in, and resemble children again. Yesterday, she ran to the rooster on the play yard, where he was refusing to share with kids his own age, and trying to grab a child's cheese. She grabbed him and hugged him. He melted, but I know her, and even if he'd continued to sulk and seethe, as he might have, she would hug him again the next day. For some reason, she likes him. She really likes him. I won't go so far as to say he's going to win any popularity prizes or anything like that. He has plenty of people who shrink away when they see him coming. I live in fear that some members of his small fan club might switch to that approach if he keeps having more bad days than good ones. But, for now, I'm enjoying knowing that some people like the rooster. They really, really like him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/like-sally-field.html", "title": "\nLike Sally Field\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 21, 2008", "body": "\nSome people have asked, \"How do you find time to blog?\" I think most of these people mean it in an encouraging way, like, \"Wow, all that on your plate, and still you manage to blog. Good job.\" Sometimes I get insecure, and what I hear is, \"Aren't there more important things you should be doing with your time?\" Probably no one is even saying it even if I am hearing it - I, the consumate worrier. But if anyone ever did say that to me, I have an answer. Or ten, as is my way. First, never worry that I'm blogging when my kids need me with them. When we're not all at school together, or not all in the car together, we're all something else together, together.  I usually \"find the time\" to blog by trimming all the fat from my schedule in the hour after they are asleep and before I am. You know, like showers. Save the planet. And bills. I used to take care of bills and paperwork before bed time. Then I realized I could label three giant moving boxes from our garage SHRED, FILE and TRASH, dump most paperwork into the latter, and let everything else stack up on the kitchen counter for a few months while I blog my way back to enough sanity to manage a checkbook again. Which brings me to my second point... I do not actually find time to blog. It just happens. Unplanned, naturally, like growth. I am posting right now, but I swear I didn't set out to, I came to look something up online and tada, here I am. Third truth: I don't think I could have gotten through the last few months with as much of my soul intact if I hadn't found blogging. So, nope, there really isn't anything more important I should be doing right now. Like my mom's friend once said about the diamond tennis bracelet and red convertible she squeezed out of her cheating husband, \"It's cheaper than therapy!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/found-time.html", "title": "\nFound Time\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2008", "body": "\nThe rooster got in trouble today. Basically, he got the preschool version of being sent to to the office, which, since that's pretty much next door to my own office, meant I got sent home from the office, with one angry, aggressive little boy. We were out of there before noon. Anyone who knows anything about us knows why this happened, right? (And I'm talking the micro why, not the macro.) Yes, let's all say it in unison, now: deities. About 20 minutes prior to the rampage, (and I later heard that the administrator in charge of preschool offenders had been looking for me for -- YES -- about 15 or 20 minutes) I, knee deep in a research lesson with 60 delightful fifth graders, said, LIKE SOME DEATH-DEFYING FOOL, \"This is just about the most fun I could ever have at work. I love this project.\" The perfect signal to my exit from the project, would you not agree? What on earth is happening to my little boy? Up until about a month ago, he was difficult, but charming, and he saved most of his negativity and aggression for home life. Sure, his teachers dealt with a lot from him, paticularly that he could not share or handle circle time, and that he had terrible trouble communicating with kids. NOW, however, we have a boy who screams, \"AHHHHH! Ahahahaaaaa!\" at the drop of a hat. He grabs toys from others and taunts them by holding the coveted object over his (tall) head. He hit another child with a shovel. (Thank goodness it was a flimsy plastic one, but STILL.) Kids avoid him. He spits. That is so disgusting. I can't figure it out, I can't get to the cause, I surely can't stop it, and so I'm so freaked out that I've gone all ... detached. I'm not crying, I'm not aching, I'm not ... here. Not exactly here. Something inside got turned down way low, dialed back to inaudible levels. Of course, perversely, I like it, I relish the relief. But I am smart enough to know it's not a good sign. It's numbness, and that isn't healthy. It's the kind of sensation that finds me offhandedly commenting to my husband, out of earshot of the kids, \"So what time you think he'll get thrown out tomorrow? Because I really have important work to do at school.\" WHO SAID THAT? It might have been me, but it was not my real voice, if you know what I mean. I love my boy, so big, forever, but I've disconnected today, and I need to fess up to that right here and right now if I hope to reconnect. When I picked the rooster up, I tried every thing I thought was \"right.\" I told him that he couldn't play today, because he was hurting and scaring his friends, but that I know he is a good boy, and I'm going to help him feel better, so that he can make better choices tomorrow. Okay, I chunked it for him so that he didn't have to hear all that at once, and I repeated it infinite times, with lots of synonyms. I had him repeat to me several times why we were going home early. \"It's not okay to hit friends,\" was his general reply. I didn't want him to feel like a bad person, but I also made sure not to make the day too fun; I didn't want to make him hope for escape from school every day by doing the same actions. We checked out picture books from the library about anger, feelings, hitting. I asked him about his feelings. I gave him lots of love. But the whole time, as he alternated between more loving than I've seen in weeks and going full tilt mad on me, I was struggling to find me in it all... I wasn't really connected, no matter how many times I pinched myself. And nothing I did helped anyway - not for more than a few minutes here or there. And I knew it wouldn't. Which sentence that I just wrote is scarier? I do not know. The scariest thing of all is my innermost fear that whatever troubles the rooster is something worse than autism, something that will only grow as he does. The only thing I know for sure is that tomorrow will, without any doubt, be just as bad as today. Maybe worse. But, since I've already done a miserable job at parenting, let me at least do something for those fifth graders I had to abandon. They're all researching different topics, and it gives great joy to my inner geek. Some kids still need information, and \"experts\" they could interview would help a lot. So, dear blogosphere, if anyone out there knows about any of these topics, or could point us to resources, I'd LOVE to put you in touch with a darling researcher, age 10, by email or phone, at your convenience: Appalachian music and dance (West Virginia) blue crabs (Maryland) fluorescent rocks (NJ) Fairystones (VA) Salem Witch Trials Eli Lilly Robert Frost Texas City explosion\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/to-office.html", "title": "\nTo The Office\n"},

(A newbie, I found out I started one before by accident.) How does your car represent your life? I drive an old, tired, dirty, no-frills Saturn. It has power nothing. (How many bloggers crank down their window the old fashioned way?! I scraped together my pennies to buy it, my first car, 12 years ago, back when $250 a month scared me, but I scrupulously paid my loan off nearly a year early.) I remember the new car smell lasting longer than I expected, but car care took a back seat, no pun intended, once kids came along. Snacks, Disney audio cassettes, tissues, and emergency diaper supplies litter my front seat. Goldfish and raisins litter my back seats. I angled my rearview mirror for a slight view of the road, and a good hard look at the wrestling mats I call car seats. I am almost never alone in my car, and while I drive, I multitask. I spend most of the time in my car fulfilling requests and demands - for food, for toys, for stories, for intervention, for mediation. Like my life, my car gets too loud for my liking, and the crying jags inside take a toll on the shock absorbers. My car needs some TLC. It's always low on fuel, makes a few weird noises, and sometimes smells kind of off. Crayon scrawls decorate one door's interior, giving it a wounded look. I wish I could afford to trade in my car for something more fuel efficient, but also something roomier, more comfortable, more convenient. I have given up on style. Sometimes I am embarrassed by my car, but not in a status conscious way. My car might be kind of gross, but it's mine and I feel like I should be the only one talking smack about it.

Tonight my amazing husband came home from work, took one look at the scene, and scooped up our two children. Out they went on a stroller ride before I could so much as plead for my sanity. This is why I married him. Poor guy. I think before he met me, he went to theaters for drama. Now he gets plenty of that at home. I have this guilt complex about it. No, I didn't directly cause the dramas in the family we built together, and in fact I prefer romance over drama every day of the week, but I do come from a long line of drama, and so I'm afraid it might be in my DNA. Come to think of it, it seems brazenly naive that I ever presumed to make undramatic babies. My husband might have laid back genes, but they didn't stand a chance in the mix, did they? Clearly, drama is dominant, calm is recessive. Anyway, our first born has drama written all over him from the word go. He had quite an intense birth, setting records, even. My mother and grandmother came from the East coat for the big event and stayed in the hospital for all 32 hours of labor, including when my mom strayed in the wrong direction looking for a smoke break (I know, gross) and wandered inadvertantly into a gang pushing in to the ER looking for a shooting victim. No wonder the rooster didn't want to come out to greet the world! I had to push so hard that my mom, holding my legs, clenched her jaws and out came -- her filling. She cracked it. Finally the rooster decided to come out, too (once he was coaxed by a vacuum). And then came our departure from the hospital. I am not making up what I am about to tell you! Not a single word! Go ahead and steal it for your screen play or novel; just expect a speedy rejection from your editor, with this note: \"Not believable!\" So the rooster is two days old, and we get this little bundle of screams all checked out of the hospital, ready to go home. We get wheeled down to the hospital's front doors, and my husband goes to get the car. As I'm waiting for him, I notice the security guard sitting across from me gets a strange call on the walkie talkie and leaps in to action. Up drives my husband, and he loads us into the vehicle. We pull slowly out of the parking garage, and big gates come down behind us, closing the entrance to the hospital to all traffic. How strange! We are inching forward, nervous to drive with this red-faced, shrill infant hollering and flopping around in his too-big car seat. Just as we officially cross into the street, we are met by none other than the SWAT team, and what looks like the entire LAPD staring us down, pointing loaded weapons, yelling in to megaphones. \"You cannot drive here! Drive the other way! The other way!\" The other way means that we are being ordered to head the wrong way on a one way street, but, of course, we do not hesitate to do as we are told! At every turn, road blocks; we made our way home for the very first time by inching through a treachorous maze of drama, drama, drama. Took us two hours to get our baby home for the first time, just 15 miles from the hospital. Turns out that a gunman had fired at police, who had chased him, and he ran, armed, into the mall a block away, halfway between the hospital and the school that my kids now attend where I have worked for many years. If it sounds like a very dangerous part of town, you should know that, in fact, it is nearly in Beverly Hills.

{"date": "Sunday, March 16, 2008", "body": "\nDear Pediatrician, For months and months I have considered writing to you. I wrestled with the notion, I debated it with my husband, and worried how I would find the right tone and balance. Fortunately, in the interim I have discovered blogging. Considering is no longer an option; this letter insisted that I write it once I realized that I don't have to actually send it to you, except via Rooster Calls, my blog. We came to you as patients  desperate  for our child. Our first pediatrician, Dr. G, dismissed things we knew our boy needed - things like physical therapy, and we heard excellent things about you and your practice. Many people to this day express shock that Dr. G didn't work out for us, that he is a great doctor and has helped many families. Certainly when we interviewed him, we thought that too, but we hadn't planned on having a child with special needs. Dr. G sounds like he takes great care of children with typical development. We came to you because we needed more. And now I am sure people would be shocked to find out that we don't feel like we got more. Unfortunately, I feel like we have wasted some valuable time, precious time for our boy. I want to urge you, the next time you see a family like ours, to think of us, and learn from us, and get them the help that they need. One specific thing that I want to tell you is that I believe deeply that sleep is a medical concern. Do you? It brings tears to my eyes when I think that we came to you just a few short months ago having learned on our own through emails from other parents that we could try melatonin with the rooster. It took a few calls in to you, but finally you figured out a dose and gave us the go ahead. For the first time in three and a half years, we slept. It worked on the very first day. Every visit we ever had with you, I know I indicated crippling exhaustion. I never remember you even acknowledging this issue more than possibly putting it in your computer, but I feel sure you must know that sleep plays a significant role in cognitive development, that sleep has been proven to play a significant role in suicide. Melatonin helps us. Sleep helps us. I had reached a deep, dark place in misery from my lack of sleep, and while we aren't completely out of the dark, we are so much better now. I wish you could have given that to us years ago. I wish I didn't have to find it on my own. Next, I want you to know about autism. One day after I'd been trying for a few visits to talk to you about my concerns, you gave the rooster stickers, asked him to give one to his sister, asked him to give her a hug, and then told me, \"Kids with autism can't do that.\" Please don't ever tell that to anyone else. Inform yourself. If 1 in every 150 kids or so has a spectrum disorder, you're going to see those kids come through your practice, and you need to know how to help them and their families. You're going to have to do more than send them to that neurologist in Beverly Hills who charged us $200 to tell us television would make our son autistic, but maybe it might be \"the good kind. Like Bill Gates.\" I left her office feeling angry, confused, mistreated, another chunk of precious time wasted, and wondering if that \"doctor\" had been abusing substances before our visit. I know you sent us to her trying to help, but in the last three years, your referrals have cost us more in time and emotional toll than they have helped. There was the eye doctor who took six months to get in to see, but who always sent us away because our \"poor child\" always looked \"sick and contagious.\" (I found a new eye doctor by putting out a plea via email to other moms. He did our son's surgery, and for the first time in his entire life, our son can hold his head up straight, can see straight, and does not have double vision.) There was the  ENT  who told us our son needed surgery before he would turn three but that he cannot operate on children before they turn three, that we had come to the wrong place. At least he did know the  ENT  who could help us, so that only cost us two visits and  copays  before we found help. There were the allergists with poor bedside manner whose first control failed, and whose second told me this child with lifelong purple shiners under his eyes doesn't have an allergy issue, at a cost to our child measured in pricks and pains. We're still looking for a good allergist; it's on the short list, which actually is long. And what about the  xrays ? We had one round of  xrays  that showed that the rooster had previously had pneumonia, and we'd never known it. We had  xrays  for him when I was six months pregnant, and the radiologists were openly angry with me (\"Why did YOU come here? Where is his father?\") because being pregnant meant I could not hold the rooster down. When I called you to suggest you not use these radiologists anymore, as they also got into an argument in front of us about which one would get stuck holding my sick child (\"wrestling kids is not in my job description\"; \"But I had to hold the last kid!\") you told me that place was best because they had a relationship with your office. And yet when your colleague in your practice mentioned in passing at a drop-in visit when you were not there that she suspected my boy might have a rare and hard to treat problem called \"primary  ciliary   dyskenesia \" but that I would need to talk to you about it later, I was left to discover on my own that many people who have that illness have their heart on the opposite side of their body from what is normal, and I asked you, \"Does the rooster have his heart on the right or left?\" I think I had to ask you once in person and twice through email while you \"consulted your records\" and eventually told me you couldn't find any  xrays  in his charts. You know what I did? I put my head against his chest and listened. To my unskilled ears, I have to tell you: my son's heart is right where it should be. You suggested we consider doing a biopsy on our boy to find out if he has this rare condition, this  imotile  cilia disorder. I asked whether a definite diagnosis would impact his treatment in any significant way. You said, \"It certainly wouldn't hurt to have a definite diagnosis.\" It might not hurt you, but a sinus biopsy under anesthesia would hurt a little rooster. He's had surgery twice in his three and half years already, and if he's going under again, we need a good reason. The other suggestion you offered for my son's chronic health problems (and purely health problems seem to be the limit of your scope) angered me on a deeply personal level. How many times did you tell me that I should consider quitting my job and staying home with my son until he built his immunity? You never suggested it, I noticed, to his father, and we take turns coming to your office, so you had ample opportunity. Never would that have been financially good for us, but in light of the new possible causes for the medical problems, I feel like I have to point out that staying home would have been just another useless prescription among far too many. Another dead end, with a huge price tag. Recently, we got in to see a developmental pediatrician with an excellent reputation. I am a little cautious, a little wary - I have learned that reputation doesn't equal solutions for our family. But so far it seems that this doctor sees the big picture, she looks at the whole package, from medical to developmental, including sleep, allergies, hearts and all, and she promises to help us chart a path that will help our family. She cost a small fortune for our family, but for once it seemed like an investment in the future, and in hope - if so, it will be the best money I ever spent. I was surprised to learn from this developmental pediatrician that she knows your office so well. We found out about her, we got in to see her, without your help. I wish you had even told me that such a specialty exists. I had never heard of \"developmental pediatrician,\" but without using those exact words, I am quite sure I had begged for one. We have asked her to refer us to a new pediatrician for our family.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/doctor-doctor.html", "title": "\nDoctor Doctor\n"},

I fervently hope that some day not too far off I will make up for, pay back to, balance out the karma, and give the way I'm receiving. Right now all I can offer is thanks. This makes me feel frequently ashamed, but I guess that has to take second place until I can (soon, I hope) take better care of myself again. Emails sustain me. Calls support me. Strangers become friends, friends with ideas and empathy. A teacher friend gets an idea to ease the rooster's transition at the end of the day. Another offers to help me put the kids in the car after school. She gracefully turns a blind eye on the wreck inside the vehicle. Another comes by to give me an hour alone while my wild ones run loose in the yard. Handwritten letters and cards arrive, and it is not my birthday. One even comes with candy. Jokes!

{"date": "Saturday, March 15, 2008", "body": "\nToday I long for the days before the spitting. Rooster has never complied, but he used to subscribe more to a more passive resistance. When the rooster had his IEP with the first school district, right after his third birthday, he charmed them. They wrote up a glowing report about how this child needed no services, despite the fact that they noted delays across the board. They even seemed to enjoy his noncompliance. I think this example typifies the rooster's agenda of control: One of the five members of the IEP team comes over to me. \"He just refuses to do the puzzle activity, and we really would like very much to have him do it. Do you have any strategies that might get him to do it?\" This actually makes me laugh before I realize that I'm not being appropriate, and try to turn it into a cough. They try another approach. \"Does he have any high interest subjects, so that I might find a puzzle of something he likes? Does he like sports?\" So I tell them animals. One woman disappears for a couple of minutes and comes back with a box. \"Rooster!\" she exclaims. \"Look what I have! I have a puzzle of HORSES! Do you like horses?\" The rooster nods like a bobblehead. He watches intently as the woman puts together part of the horse puzzle. Then he scrutinizes her face, which, funnily enough, has an expression he has always loved to label, \"Puzzled!\" Looking at her, he puts his hand on his chin and rubs, just as he always does when he does \"puzzled\" face. She turns to reel him in. \"Do you know where the horse's head goes?\" The rooster nods. \"You do?\" More nodding. \"Oh, good! Can you show me where the horse's head goes?\" The rooster takes the puzzle piece from her hand. In a louder voice than he's used so far this day, he enunciates, \"The horses head goes BACK IN THE BOX.\" And the puzzles were, as he liked to say, \"All done!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/pieceful-resistance.html", "title": "\nPieceful Resistance\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 15, 2008", "body": "\nWhen the rooster was only about seven months old, we drove about 45 minutes south to see his grandparents, and we left him to play with them while we went out for lunch - a rare treat. At that time, it still made sense that the rooster spent almost all of his time with my husband and me, and we enjoyed that enough that we didn't actually find ourselves yearning too strongly for babysitters. After all, I had not been back at work long, and sometimes I secretly wished I could afford to stay at home for a year or two. In his pre-mobile, pre-verbal days, the rooster presented many challenges still, but he also melted me into a puddle; I could pass the hours just watching him, smelling him, tickling and kissing. And then, of course, my husband would say, \"Hey! My turn!\" And I realized we needed some date time. So after we went out for lunch that day, we stopped in a store and bought a birthday gift. We asked the sales girl a question about our purchase, and she said she would have to check, as she had not been in the shop for several days. Then she said something that stuck with me, that comes back to me often. She said, \"Work days are they days I'm at home with my children. This is what I do with my time off!\" I have written before about how judgmental I can be, and how I hope I am working on that. At the time, I considered this woman's comments and I judged her to be callous, insensitive. Poor kids, I thought. Ha! Perhaps I'm getting taught my lesson the hard way once again. On a regular basis, people tell me, \"I don't know how you do it, working full times, having two kids...\" They trail off, but the unsaid comments hang there anyway, of course. They know I don't just have two kids, but that I have a special sort of rooster. The truth is, I understand what the salesperson meant. I have long since stopped saying TGIF. Sometimes I dread the weekend. Some Mondays, when I am candid about what I did over the weekend, I say, \"I survived.\" Parents who stay at home with their children have my utmost respect, have my admiration, they make me realize my inadequecies. Could the rooster and I manage spending all our days together? I ponder this as we consider where there might be school that fits his needs, and what to do if we can't find one. Financially, this terrifies my husband and me. We rely on dual incomes to keep the roof over our heads. But we also know that we will do whatever the rooster needs, that all options remain on the table, and so the question begs revisiting. If the rooster and I could manage spending all our days together, would it help him, or hurt him? And what does that question say about me? About what kind of person I am that the question needs asking to begin with? I have a little routine with the kids. I ask them, \"How much does mommy love you?\" They say, \"So big!\" I ask, \"For how long?\" They shout, \"Forever.\" I have loved them since before I met them, I love them with fervor, but I know my love has flaws. My love is constant, but suffers from my mood swings. My love has no limits, but it does show itself darkly at times. I know what wedding vows say about patience and kindness, but boundless love does not make me perfect. It's hard to admit, hard to write about, but I don't know if all the love in the world would make me a successful stay-at-home mom to the rooster. Today is Saturday. So far we've been to the bakery, the park, and for a drive. We've played in the back yard, taken baths, eaten lunch. We've photographed precious moments, had hugs and kisses, we even spent a good fifteen minutes watching a squirrel steal an orange off our tree and eat it on the back porch. These are treasured moments. These are the ones that get me through the other ones, the ones I don't feel like writing about today, the ones that have me looking at the clock, calculating that bed time is still more than four hours away. Judge me, and I don't blame you. I deserve it.

My husband and I took the rooster to the homiest office you ever saw today, complete with doilies and a living room and the whole shebang, and I admit that I do feel guilt that we got the appointment only because a friend called on our behalf. Who did the doctor not have room to take as a result? I can't go there. I do know that the rooster needs the good doctor, and so it was worth the guilt, just like the cake I ate with a shovel. If you scroll through the D section of my cell phone's address bok, you might get carpal tunnel syndrome; we've aquired at least a dozen doctors in the last four years. So many have approached the rooster like the story of the blind men and the elephant until now. An eye issue, one declares. His ears! another cries. Yet another cannot get beyond his language struggles. After seeing the rooster both on and off his game during our two-plus hour visit, the developmental pediatrician really saw the whole package. And it was the rooster she saw, with only a few hints of the dark twin. But even on good days like today, the rooster lacks reciprocity skills. He can't take turns, he can't cooperate, he won't be nudged. He gave that office a bit of a beating and made the doc earn her fee. This is more or less how she put it, \"When the rooster sets the agenda, he can be charming! But when he doesn't, he can't function, and his behavior falls apart.\" And, of course, there's all that tangential language -- if anything, his language was the car that refused to make noises at the shop the way it would at home. But no matter; the doc put all the pieces together and came up with the whole rooster, and she didn't deny that there is OT, PT, speech, and behavior intervention in our future. So why did I leave the doctor's office today feeling like I'd gotten good news? Really, we had gotten no news at all. We still don't have a diagnosis. We go back in a week for the results of the evaluation. But for the first time, we got more then head scratching and a list of what our boy can't do. I am encouraged because this doctor offers us more than just a diagnosis when we go back, she offers the medicine that our whole family so desperately needs: a plan for intervention. So once again I find myself counting down the days until a doctor's appointment, and, if you still have any stomach for my greedy requests, once again I ask for your good thoughts.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/so-far-good-doctor-has-lived-up-to-my.html", "title": "\nMiracles of Modern Medicine\n"},

The rooster is back. He's back. Ask my husband. Transformation! Almost a week ago, the rooster disappeared like he'd been in the Parent Trap and had a twin. I was not nearly so fond of this twin as of my real rooster. This twin had a strange affect and body language, and spent all week spitting at people. Rage simmered under this twin's surface. I drove this twin home today. I can't figure out where he went, but I have a few theories. Please, I really need someone else's opinion. Last night, for the first time in about a month, we didn't give the rooster Melatonin. Could it have been building up to some side affects? And then when it got out of his system, the rooster returned? Could we have been giving him something that hurt him? I HOPE NOT. BECAUSE WE GAVE HIM SOME TONIGHT. AND I DON'T WANT THAT TWIN BACK TOMORROW. Plus, you could say, \"Well, just don't give him any more Melatonin.\" What I would hear is, \"Well, so what if you never sleep again?\" I mean, sure, we could do that. But let's look at our other choices, shall we? The rooster seemed like floor time set him off last week. Could it be that he just got around to forgiving us for it? I HOPE NOT. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING AGAIN TOMORROW. The rooster has had a snotty nose for the last 3 1/2 years, but sometimes it's worse than others. Tonight he seemed to be clearing up somewhat. Maybe when he feels better, he feels better, if you follow me? And diet -- what about that? Maybe it's a gluten thing, or a -- I don't even know what this word means let alone how to spell it -- a cassien thing? Or dairy? Maybe he had a sugar thing going on? Maybe he understood that we're going to see a doctor tomorrow and he wanted to make us look nuts when we try to describe the past week. \"I swear, Mr. Mechanic, it's made the terrible noise for a month now...\" Or, here is a theory. The rooster is a changeling. He's going to have ups and downs and good times and bad. Period. We had bad, really bad, and now it's easing up. Or, this: more than a few people who really know how to send good thoughts and vibes and prayers and all that great stuff have been pulling for us. Yep, I'm talking about you now. Maybe you brought the rooster back tonight. And if you did, let me tell you, I am baking you some kick ass cookies. Because I watched him skip down the hall. I heard him VOL-UN-TEER, \"Mommy, I love you so much!\" I looked at my husband, and he looked at me, and we both absolutely knew one hundred percent without any doubt that a different boy had been sleeping under our roof for the last week, but suddenly, out of the blue, mid conversation, over a bowl of messily slurped soup, tada! THE ROOSTER CAME BACK! I want to tell everyone! EXCEPT THE DEITIES WHO HATE ME.

Until I met my husband, this school was the only thing that kept me in this part of the country, thousands of miles from my family and friends. School became my family and friends, my safe corner of scary urban sprawl. I had a wedding shower here. I got my Master's here. I took a pregnancy test in the bathroom here. I had a baby shower here. His baby blankets were knitted by teachers here. The rooster came here to visit when he was 3 months old. I took his picture on the playground on the first day of school.

I called here to tell them the news of his birth from the hospital down the street before he ever had his first diaper. I felt like the school could help a tiny bit to make up for being so woefully far away from family. Everyone here is pulling for the rooster. Everyone here reaches out to him, wants him to succeed. His teacher's own son was in my class over a decade ago, and she wants to help my boy.

And other crap makes the buttercups bloom. We faced a tough call when we considered whether to accept our neighbor's generous invitation to share floor time again this Friday. The rooster had the worst week of his life, and for a guy born difficult, that means we truly almost needed a police escort home yesterday. In my mind, this crisis had to relate to last Friday's floor time. Yet floor time had also seemed to my husband to provide important tools for working with our boy. So he got the number of the floor time therapist and asked what to make of the rooster's rage. Basically what I gathered from her answer is that this shit we're in now is the good kind. It means floor time is probably helping the rooster to work out some difficult personal and interpersonal issues, like sharing, cooperating, and expressing his anger. But not to expect buttercups overnight. So we'll suck it up and tackle floor time again Friday, after The Appointment. Here is the other thing I got today, really seemed to get. Friday's doctor appointment will confirm for us that our rooster is autistic. While we're still kind of in shock about it, the initiated seem to have no doubt. The appointment needs to be about asking, \"So how do we help him?\" The rooster's autism does not come out in words or actions a heck of a lot like anyone else's we know of yet, but it isn't different, either. So the real spectrum I need to examine are the 31 flavors of possible supports to offer him. After all, there are only so many hours in a day, and I want to make sure there is room to just be, amid the PT, OT, speech, floor time, or whatever else it is that the expert can suggest. I know whatever we choose will have its struggles, I just want to know how to choose the best fit and how to find balance. I just want someone to help me know how to tell when something is right for my boy, even if afterward he seems more inclined to yank his sister across the back seat by her hair while she's still tightly buckled. And here is the other aha I'm getting: All the people who write to tell me it will get worse before it gets better make more sense to me now; I had read those more as warnings, but now I understand with an \"aha!\" that instead they were encouragement of a sort. You all meant that it CAN'T get better without getting worse first, that \"worse\" is the first step to better.

Chocolate cake helps, and we must have had five kinds at lunch today. I grabbed a shovel. Retail therapy helps. For a minimalist, anti-commercial kind of gal with limited resources, it shocked me to get a buzz buying a new knife block at Target when I really went there to get staples. You know the slippery slope; next I got giddy at Amazon.com and then splurged on a slipcover that cost more than the second-hand chair I've been meaning to spruce up for years. Help helps. A dear friend came over yesterday and played with my children for a while, and I got a much needed respite. I even got to cover that chair. Laughing helps. (Someone, please send jokes. I have not been laughing enough.) Hugs help. I collected them all day today. Work helps. Bury me in a research project and for a while I forget to fill every nook and cranny of time with worry. Calls help. My mom called today to say, \"So you find another school. Some people right now are trying to find a transplant or a transfusion or a ...\" You get the picture. I like to hear my mom say, \"So what?\" It always means love. \"So what?\" she said today. \"He is ours and we love him.\" And love helps most of all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-helps.html", "title": "\nWhat Helps\n"},

How do I keep Peaches safe from rooster attacks?

{"date": "Monday, March 10, 2008", "body": "\nWe reached an all time low tonight, and I wondered if we will hit even lower, or if this is rock bottom. It got me thinking about perspective. Perspective. The word kind of connotes math for me, so no wonder I find it a struggle. When I think of the word perspective, I think of art, space, measurement. As a word girl who cannot draw a stick person, find her way home from the mall, or guess your weight within 40 pounds, I would not consider perspective among my strengths, at least in that sense of the word. And my track record for estimating \"rock bottom\" wouldn't win me any prizes either. There were times in the BC ages (Before Children) when I thought I felt pretty low, sad or lost, scared or anxious. I grew up with an alcoholic father who ran off when I was ten (along with all our bank accounts), my mother brought home a few even worse boyfriends, I had a childhood seizure disorder, and in my twenties I got an anulment after choosing Mr. Wrong, all of which seemed massive at the time. These things still seem larger than getting gum stuck on my shoe, but in hindsight I would recalculate their scope as vastly smaller than, say, driving home from school today with the rooster. So I cannot help but wonder what, say in another five years, today will look like; pebble, or boulder? I asked the school psychologist, \"How big is this?\" Understandably, he looked confused. \"I have lost perspective,\" I told him. \"I need your help. When I go into a store, and I see a pair of pants I like, I have to take four pairs in to try on, because I cannot begin to tell which size will fit me. So you have to help me size up these struggles we're facing now.\" But, of course, he couldn't. In preparation for our Big Doctor Visit on Friday, I got out all of my rooster memorabilia. We have albums, baby books, day care journals, etc. There he is on a boppy, and here he does the combat crawl, and look - remember how much he used to tilt his head before surgery? And I had forgotten about that noise he used to make when he ate, but his teacher wrote about it, and I'm so glad she did. She also wrote about the rooster as a toddler loving to steal other kids' pacifiers, which I recall vividly. Which will today be? Will I have to look back at my ancient blogs a few years down the line to remember that the rooster went on a rampage in the car one hot March day when he was not yet four, or did he sear it into my consciousness until I'm so old that I can't remember how to make toast? After my bad breakup, and before my wonderful husband came along, I took a writing class that felt like the best therapy life could offer a word gilr like me in the pre-blogging era. I thought I was feeling pretty far at the bottom -- like base camp at the Grand Canyon -- and I wrote a poem about my hopes for the climb up and out. It's not much good, because I'm not much of a poet, and it's certainly self centered angst, but tonight seemed like a good time to blow the dust off it in my quest for perspective. It helps me count my blessings - my jumbled, messy, ordinary, extraordinary blessings, amid the pebbles and boulders on my journey, without daring to be too positive.  (And if you read my last post, you know I just waved my arms in the air. Wave yours for me, too - I think the deities might lurk around here.) Journey before I go there will be more pain I know there will be more pain before I go others will go first taking pieces of me pieces I need pieces I cherish they will leave me aching they will leave me to pay the steep fare for their journey away from me before I go there will be more pain pains that sear, burn, sting, throb pains that shoot and spread and torture my fragile flesh pains that humiliate before I go there will be more pain goings and comings and sunderings lovers that leave and friendships that fade and longings unfulfilled before I go there will be more pain I will stand alone and I will stumble I will err and I will wrong and I will change, and not always for the better before I go and that is certain but will there be more joy before I go? will there be wedding days and sacred vows and unconditional love both given and received? will there be babies healthy, strong and mine all mine to raise and love and teach and tickle? will there be snapshots taken and scrapbooks filled and will there be more joy? before I go\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/perspective.html", "title": "\nPerspective\n"},

This is my mantra, my MO, my core belief, and yet I still manage to screw it up all the time, and, whammy zammy, kaboom, the dieties smite me. So Friday the rooster had his first ever floor time, and it seemed to go well. My husband felt it informed him, he had stategies to suggest to me, and the therapist shared some valuable observations about our boy, who seemed to handle it in stride. It made me feel hopeful. A picture of shared floortime with Sweet D across the street began to emerge as a promising aid to our current struggles. AND THEN I WENT AND SAID ALL THAT CRAP OUT LOUD, AND RUINED THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. Let me put it another way: if you ever read anything I write and your inner voice judges me as a negative, self-absorbed cry baby, that won't bother me not even one single smidge. On the other hand, if you find yourself noting my remarkable air of optimism and faith, I hope you smack me when you find me, and you can probably find me hiding in a bomb shelter somewhere. Positive. Does. NOT. Work. For. Me. The rooster spent this weekend spitting, hitting, kicking, throwing, grabbing, taunting, screaming, insulting, refusing, demanding, struggling, battling, hurting. To me, all his signs read, \"DON'T YOU DARE THINK YOU CAN CONTROL ME!!!\" Floortime, sadly, had its blowback. I tried to love it out of him, and it didn't work at all. I tried to get tough, and that was as laughable as it sounds. I tried using \"techniques\" I've read about, and guess what. So now I will bow to the deities. My husband has long mocked this core belief of mine, this relationship I have with the spirits who despise me. He uses a mocking tone to ask me about \"the motes\" - but I've seen him once or twice make the same gesture I do to wave them off after accidentally saying, \"This is great!\" or \"I think they'll probably offer me the job!\" Deep inside I think he knows that it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you (I mean me). And why do I think I'm special enough to warrant my own diety posse? One theory I haven't ruled out goes like this: When I was little, I was sick a lot. (Big surprise, genetically speaking, right?) My mom didn't expect me to live, because the doctors told her not to get her hopes up. A couple of times she came home to find the sitter and me inside an ambulance, and one of those times, the paramedic said into his radio, \"We have an infant, female, dead on arrival.\" Somehow they revived me, and I'm guessing that the dieties are still pissed off. They said, \"Okay, go ahead. Live. But don't SMIRK about it.\" So. Deities, everything feels sucky right now. The days are long, the nights are long, rest time is brief and largely interrupted, and I am scared, scared, scared. J and I are lost and confused and overwhelmed, and each and every single day a new fear grips at us. We take a lot of abuse and have very little fun. Our confidence level looks worse than the economy. We are two intelligent, educated people without a clue. In four years, we've aged the way presidents do, until my reflection actually startles me most mornings, when I bother to look at it. We make admissions about our darkest feelings, and the bare truth burns me with shame. Our rooster can be a very hard person to like. Rage seems to smolder within him. I do not really want to get out of bed tomorrow morning. I do not really feel like I have what it takes to lather, rinse, repeat. I am here, but I don't know where. I hurt from the inside out.

I have caught myself complaining a lot over the years about how I'm a small town girl who got lost a very long way from home, that I need to live where people bring you food when you move in next door and you help them shovel their walk when it snows. Well, I'm kind of thick headed and stupid sometimes. The other day I counted, and I realized I've lived in 16 homes in 36 years, eight of them in Los Angeles. We moved to our current home late last July. Guess what happened? Of course. A woman who lives across the street stopped by, along with her dog Zipper, while we were still getting unpacked from boxes in the garage. She wanted to drop off some homemade jam for us. I'd shovel her walk if it weren't in Southern California. I feel a little lost in the less literal place where our family lives right now... the land of acronyms and neuroscience and spectrum disorders... but oh my goodness, I've never had so much jam from my \"neighbors\" near and far. This afternoon the rooster and his dad went across the street - and I do mean right across the street, about 150 feet at most - to try floor time for the first time ever with our neighbor, Sweet D, also almost four and on the spectrum. Let me tell you, sharing like that beats a cup of sugar by miles. AND, when I checked the mail, I found a package from a dear, dear friend who lives only about twenty or thirty minutes from me. I'd told her recently about the rooster's issues, the upcoming appointments and school decisions facing us. Inside the package, I kid you not, was a Cadbury bar and a card saying that sometimes kind words and chocolate help get us through. This same beautiful woman showed up at my front door not long after I had my second child with a healthy lunch, cookies for dessert, and the supplies I'd been weeping about running out of when I spoke to her on the phone that day (diapers for the rooster and breast feeding supplies), so I guess it shouldn't have surprised me, but I did admit without hesitation that I am kind of thickheaded. Tonight, I opened my email to find such warmth and responsiveness to my recent posts that it overwhelms me, and in the best possible way.

I leave it set anyway not because I have faith one day I'll sleep, but because I set it to NPR, and I love to listen, and I don't usually listen anymore with kids in the car. Today the alarm really went off. The latest autism vaccine story came on. I'm sure you probably heard it today. Now, I am pretty sure I have nothing left in my reserves for getting into any big frays; I have had little space in my heart for even examining the vaccine connection, as this life and blog really fill me to capacity. But one thing always resounded in my intuition, enabling me to avoid the question best: my rooster was born my rooster, same as the day he was born. As I've written before, he was born hard, he is hard, I love him fiercely and honestly. But. So. Only maybe about 45 seconds into the story, though, the alarms begin blaring through my head. It's an alarm I heard faintly before, today louder. The flu shot I got while pregnant. Not mercury free I don't think. Before I took it, I called the obgyn, I called my husband, I called my friend the doctor before and discussed the risk. I work in a school full of flu each year. I get sick pretty easily sometimes. Flu can assault a pregnancy. I got the shot. The rooster was born the rooster. But might he have been born less hard? Be less hard? Okay so does it matter now? I mean for me, for the rooster? Whatever caused his challenges, the why probably does little to help. Usually I am there. Today, somewhere else. Frightened. Blaring. Deafened. This morning something happened as I listened to the radio. I pictured the rooster well, my blonde boy talking comfortably, in the here and now, articulate and happy in his skin, amid a crowd of friends. Healthy. Unvaccinated. Unvaccinated in utero. For some reason, if there is guilt in me about shots, the guilt feels so much more horrific if I took those shots for myself, leaving him hurt. The alarms escalate as I write this. I think maybe you can hear them. Help! Too loud! It hurts! I don't feel too rational right now. I desperately want you to write me, anybody, and say, \"I did not get a flu shot while pregnant, so I know that your flu shot did not harm your rooster.\" Believe me, I know there are countless other things you could tell me - philosophical, political, scolding, remonstrative -- and that you might be right or valid about all those things, but in my panic, that does not sound to me like an off switch for the screaming sirens in my head AT THIS MOMENT. My first blog, this, dashed off in the moment of an experience, forgive the drama of it...no, I do not really expect you to write me reassurances. Of course not. None of this is really RATIONAL, it's just the thoughts in my head typed out loud, and isn't the solace of that process why I blog? Oh! My rooster is up now, running toward me wanting a few morning cartoons. I paused my writing and my panic just now to hug and kiss... interrupting my ocd-like mental scab picking... Yes, the sound is abating some. I KNOW that whoever the rooster is, he is my beautiful boy to embrace, and that I am lucky no matter the bad days (daze). I know. I know we do the best we can. I know we cannot go back in time, the waste of regret. I know we might never know about the vaccines, that it's a personal decision, that polio SUCKS. I know.

First of all, I went to a conference for work yesterday. It was exactly two work days after our IEP, so I was behind with my responsibilities (the IEP and related travel took half a day) so I considered bailing out on the conference to catch up on the avalance that is my desk, but then I figured a day of immersive learning would take my mind off things, especially the dark insinuations of that district psychologist you're probably sick or reading about. Right? So I'm in a software seminar with a professional development focus, and I'm loving not just the content, which is right up my alley, but the presenter, whose Southern accent comes from the same place I do. Suddenly, she sits down and says she's sharing her seminar time with a group that wants to showcase new IEP sofware, and I have been selected (by a pink sticker on my computer) to come up for a ROLE PLAY. I am told to do the IEP of a child who is having trouble getting along with classmates and who has oppositional behavior. I have been assigned the role of the school psychologist. The woman pretending to be the parent acts defensive. The man assigned to be school principal makes jokes. Everyone groans about how much IEPs suck. I am the epitome of the \"affective filter\" I learned about in education -- sometimes students can't really hear the message of the lesson when the emotional stakes feel to high to them for personal reasons that might be unknown to the teacher. I don't know about you, but the whole thing struck me as a weird coincidence. Not a good one. But to balance out the scales, it just so happens that our neighbors directly across and one house down have a little boy, Sweet D, who has a spectrum diagnosis. We found this out not long after we moved in about six months ago, and that was coincidence enough at the time (though we were as yet undiagnosed), but just the other day we found out that Sweet D, who gets OT and speech at home, and who also happens to be just four weeks younger than the rooster, needs a partner for his floor time and speech therapies. His mom offered, since the district covers the price for them anyway, for the rooster to come try out a little free therapy! And, it just so happens that the rooster has no school this Friday (parent conference day), so my husband was planning to stay home with him anyway -- the very day that Sweet D has floor time with the therapist. A plan is hatched. I think even the rooster will be thrilled -- Sweet D has a double swing set and everything. Weird stuff and gray hairs usually come to me in threes.

Really, there isn't much reading to it, since it's a book of very few words. The pictures tell the real story. Since things were going well with them both on my lap happily turning pages, and since I'd been reading up about all the cognitive and inferential difficulties the rooster might have with his still murky issues, I decided to let the language arts teacher in me out of her cave and I doled out lots of reading comprehension questions to the preschool set. And you know what? They nailed them. Peaches got the points you might expect for a gal not yet two, and the rooster interpreted characters' feelings based on facial expression, made predictions, answered \"why\" questions, the whole nine yards. Last night, when we read together, we were in \"It'll be okay land.\" It feels like it might as well have been a thousand years and a million miles ago now. Tonight, no bedtime story from this mama, who lost her mind before we even finished the 35 minute commute, who, by the time her little tantrum throwing darling finished spitting in her face, was screaming profanity like a very, very, very bad mother - the kind who is IN Hansel and Gretel, not the kind who does the readaloud in the arm chair with milk and cookies. How bad was today? Suffice it to say I just spent the last hour on Amazon loading my cart with books that are NOT fairy tales -- every title related to the spectrum that I could get my newly IEPed hands on. And the ones that seemed to focus on behavior? I considered next day Fed Ex for those. I have to admit something that scares me as I read blogs about other kids on the spectrum: the absence of the anger, aggression, violence, dislikability that I see, but haven't described until now, in the rooster. I am left to wonder/ponder, does the rooster have a mental illness, something darker and more devastating than being on the spectrum? Or do I simply lack the strength, patience, and understanding of any good blogger, let alone any good mother? If I were half of who I want to be, I'd be able to manage his outbursts, protect Peaches from them, ease the pain I know they must cause him too, understand them, reduce them, keep them to myself. But I can barely endure them. Sometimes I rage too. And then after I feel the guilt. It's so ugly, this process, this side of me and us. I can get very dark here, very doomed, very The Lorax. This is all scary stuff to admit, and I'm dreading the comments I'll get, but I've got some kind of drive to tell this story right now, and I almost can't seem to stop even if I want to. So badly had I wanted to blog about the triumph of last night's \"reading\" before the waves crashed upon it and washed it out to sea. Instead the context I have to offer is a contrast, a riches to rags failure. I let my husband tuck in the rooster tonight without so much as a kiss from me, and now that he's in bed I'm kicking myself, but yet I'm not about to risk waking him up and letting him take that job off my hands. Here is to better nights. Here's hoping for more stories with happy endings. Here's hoping I can keep myself out of the oven.

Things just never got any easier, and the reasons we gave ourselves (he's a newborn, he has  colic , he's had so many colds, he has the terrible twos early, now he's two, it's really the terrible threes) stopped being good enough when we really watched him with other kids his own age.

The nurses came running with our boy a few hours later to let us know he was keeping up all the other babies and pounding down formula like a frat boy at a keg party, so they were kicking him out. (I went on to breastfeed him for six months, the formula was because neither of us had had any nutrition in over 40 hours so they felt he needed some.) The rooster has never slept well, has never had good muscle tone, and has suffered a slew of issues his doctors refer to as a \"constellation.\" Among them he  struggled  with  torticollis  (head tilt),  strabismus  (lazy eye),  hypotonia  (weak muscles), chronic upper respiratory problems (vast quantities of boogers, and a cough that made doctors  suspect , before ruling out, cystic fibrosis). We visit the doctor so much they ought to give us our own parking space. Also, the rooster has been delayed - though often not by much - with milestones, he shows some very mild sensory integration issues (do NOT take this kid to a barber unless you know your wrestling holds) and his language is, to be purely scientific about the whole thing, WEIRD. Call him on the phone and try to chat with him if you think you can come up with a better description. Do you think vaccines caused the rooster's problems? I am going with no. Can't handle the regret of anything else. I reserve the right to revisit this, though because I'm woefully  underinformed . What interventions have you implemented? When he was tiny, we got him OT and PT for his  torticollis  and  hypotonia . That helped with sensory stuff too. He responded well. He's had  nebulizers  for the respiratory stuff and more drugs than Robert  Downey  Jr., but he still always seems sick, and the doctors have run out of ideas (except for one, which is a whole other blog I need to save for later). He had eye surgery in January, and for the first time in his LIFE, he holds his head straight up. The  IEP  was today, and they offered lots of choices, all crappy unless I quit my job and drive him hither and yon, so we're in \"recess\" while we figure out our plan. Is anyone else in your family like the rooster? No. I don't know of any  neurological  issues in my family or my husband's. But I didn't really know my father or any of his family, and my mom only describes them as \"impossible\" so who knows. Really, it would shock me if anyone else seemed much like the rooster. We have met with zillions of \" ists \" and I always ask them, and his teachers, \"Have you ever known anyone like our rooster?\" After the awkward pause, they usually say something along these lines: \"Not exactly. Well, no. Not really. I mean... but... no.\" You work at a great school. Can't they help? Yes, and no. They help a lot. My colleagues are my support system. They love our rooster. They just can't figure out how to teach him successfully. As the school district folks put it at our  IEP  meeting, \"He is not functioning in the classroom. His severe pragmatic issues especially stand in the way.\" In other words, rooster does not sing along to the songs, he needs a lap to sit on if he has any chance of making it through any amount of circle time, no way is he going to follow verbal directions, if you let him out of your site he might do something unsafe (like climb a ladder belonging to the maintenance crew), and the kids have no idea what to make of his attempts at conversation. That's a lot for a mainstream school to handle, even for a faculty child. Is there any good news? Well, you know I'm not a fan of \"bright  sidedness \" but I tell you emphatically there is good news about our boy. He is gorgeous, in my unbiased and humble opinion, with a smile that makes you want to giggle like Elmo. Give him a book and he can sit for up to 25 happy minutes, making up the story by himself if you won't read it to him. Many times when we despair that he simply cannot learn to do something no matter how much we practice (like ask or answer a  Wh  question), a week later he proves us wrong. He loves us and he says so in words, in bear hugs, in sloppy drooly kisses, and with squeals of delight. He's finally starting to get along with Peaches, and sometimes they play together happily before the crying starts. Though I fret a lot about his behavior, when you take him to a place with loud upbeat music activity, such as the drum circle we attend, he gets all blissed out, and he behaves beautifully. For about 45 minutes. I'll take it. I live for those times - for his rare successful outings, his relaxation, his ease. There are no \"normal\" days for us -- each one is a surprising new challenge -- but I treasure them all, and despite blog evidence to the contrary, I am very grateful - because whoever he is, whatever he's \"got,\" in the end he is my precious rooster.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/02/faq.html", "title": "\nFAQ\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 29, 2008", "body": "\nThe rooster went through a long and heartbreaking period of night terrors and nightmares when he was two, but he's only had a few of those in his three year old year. When he has them, I always find myself wondering if it's about something I did or could have controlled. Like after he had his tonsils out, and later when he had eye surgery, he had terrible sleep for a while, and maybe somehow I could have made it all less scary. Or maybe he heard something on the radio when I was listening to NPR. (I know segments about our president often give me nightmares even with my eyes wide open.) Or maybe he's replaying when I was just being an overtired *itch who sometimes forgets how hard things are for a rooster, who sometimes expects too much for a boy with few coping skills of his own. Last night I had some nightmares of my own -- another reflection of my guilt, the theme du jour. For about eight or nine years, I taught fifth grade. I stopped to switch to technology integration the year before rooster was born. I used to think I was pretty good at teaching fifth grade. What I think about now is that I shouldn't have been teaching fifth grade. I should have been teaching children. All night I had nightmares about the kids I might have reached better than I did -- NO, the parents of the kids I should have reached better than I did. Can you tell our IEP meeting is today?! There were a handful of kids I taught who, despite pretty successfully managing their issues and largely integrated into our community, I thought might be \"in the wrong school\" for their \"unique issues.\" HA - I know; are you throwing rotten tomatoes at your screen? Are you even still reading me? I remember ignorantly wondering -- can I really admit this on the web? -- if their parents ought to try harder to find \"the best place\" for these kids. Either their processing skills were painfully, painfully slow, a year or two or three behind their peers, or they could not put a pencil to paper to create a coherent sentence without substantial support, or some other such thing that I now realize was really just ... well ... what I should have been supporting them through without questioning their school placement. Now, while I am confessing my ignorance, please don't think I didn't do what I thought at the time was busting my butt to support those boys and girls. I encouraged, modified, supported, loved, cheered, adapted, struggled, and LOVED little S, SS, T, C, D, N, and O. Their self esteem mattered as much to me as anything else, and I sought to protect it as if it were my own. They did learn in my class, and they did struggle along the way. I have treasured cards and love notes they gave me in June. But I also sat in parent conferences and tried to gently (I thought) suggest that maybe the parents were not doing what was in the child's best interest by pushing them along in our competitive, intense private school. Now, I'm getting my own tomato. Young and foolish; is it really any excuse? To the parents of S, SS, T, C, D, N and O (all of whom graduated from our school): I regret ever judging anything about your experience, or making your school decisions any more challenging. Many of you said you appreciated my efforts, but if you wondered to yourself if I'd ever learn my lesson the hard way about how hard parenting a struggling student can be, rest assured. And know that I am not resting assured. If I could go back, I would do better. I hear a little boy waking up now after a good night's rest.

{"date": "Monday, March 3, 2008", "body": "\nSo I want to help you appreciate \"durst.\" You'll have to come with me into the moment, about 3 or 4 months ago. Okay, we're in the surgical center where the rooster is about to have eye surgery less than a year after having surgery for tonsils, adenoids and tubes that basically traumatized all of us and did not provide him much (if any?) relief from his medical and sleep issues. We're worried. We're second guessing the decision to do this. We're exhausted. It's 6:30 in the morning. Peaches is a cranky toddler upset at the early wakeup call. Even though I can HEAR just fine, I find it somehow nearly impossible to listen to anything except the scratchy static of fear in my head. I keep reminding ever nurse, doctor, hospital worker I can that our rooster has a lot of respiratory issues -- he needs special care while he's \"under.\" I keep smiling at him and doing an impersonation of a calm, sure mommy. I am not breathing enough. Time is scrambled. They give the rooster \"happy juice\" and oh how much I would like my own cup. (How very gladly would I have the whole shebang in his stead.) A beautiful doctor, Dr. R, with whom I've spoken on the phone several times comes to introduce himself. He is the anesthesiologist, and I've been told he's one of the three best in the country, but that seems like such an odd thing to calculate, and makes me question the whereabouts of the other two, and if maybe they could come along, too. The eye surgeon himself wrote the book on this procedure, and I'm thrilled to know it, but I believe that Dr. R holds the rooster's safety really in his hands. I wish I had baked something for him. I tell him we hear he's the best, that we are counting on this. He hears what I'm not saying as clearly as what I am, \"You better take care of my baby. You must treat him as your own son.\" He finds ways to tell us that he will with his soulful smile and a voice like a grandma's quilt. In front of him, I weep just a bit, but not so much that the rooster sees it. I must guard the rooster and keep him confident. I must impress importance upon his doctors. The juice kicks in! I am holding the rooster, because he is drunk and slurring now. When did he get so heavy? Dr. R says it's time to go, and he lifts the rooster from my arms. I am not in a good place. \"Durst!\" Comic relief, courtesy of the rooster! He cracks himself up, leans toward Dr. R to practically nose kiss. \"DURST!\" The doctor laughs. \"Durst?\" he asks. The rooster cackles, \"Dursty, dursty dursty, dursty durst!\" Drunk. And they are gone, for one very long hour. I didn't expect the rooster to remember surgery, but he had nightmares for a while afterward, and once said to me, \"Dr. W sticks a needle in my eye mommy!\" That was hard. Guilt is my nightmare. But clearly the rooster remembered the happy juice, too, and he uses \"Durst\" all the time. None of us know what it means to him, exactly, but his sister picked it up and uses it sometimes too. Our rooster has a lot of mystery about him, and I recognize that I'm being told now that much of this mystery lies in a place of struggle, difference, dysfunction. Okay. And I know his language separates him from us in a way that makes me feel like's he's trapped where I can't always access. But whatever his struggles, I see durst as not such a bad coping mechanism, really. Couldn't we all use some happy juice and a durst now and then?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/durst.html", "title": "\nDURST\n"},

They faxed over the 30 page document at my request so I could have it before we meet. I thought I was steeled, but still. Wow. Did they meet the same rooster I live with? I am the one who has been saying over and over that something is not quite right, I am the one who wanted people to help me figure out what that something is, but this report doesn't sound much like my boy at all. (In fact, in one whole section, they referred to some other kid. They called him by the right name, but last time I checked, he doesn't live in a Spanish speaking home with his mother and her adult male companion -- either my husband or I definitely would have noticed that, as well as the six year old they mentioned. I called to tell them they had the wrong kid, but they only changed that one paragraph, claiming the rest was really about the rooster.) It's all backward! I'm amazed! Shocked! Stunned! And I thought I'd prepared for anything. Ha. So, forgive my addled, overtired, punch drunk, frazzled inclination, but I've decided to blog tonight about alternative meanings of \"IEP.\" For fun.

Today, I'm in a place I visit from time to time, called Positivity Sucks. Now, before you go telling me about the power of positive thinking -- which is crap, and you know it -- let me explain that I'm not wallowing in negativity, I'm not itching for a fight, I only have one foot in the pity party, and I don't mean to offend anyone with the rant I am about to unleash on \"the bright side.\" Oh, sure, I'll take a \"It'll be okay\" any day. Those are always welcome. But, and I say this with all due respect, there are people out there whose \"bright side\" is just GLARINGLY artificial, like mall lighting. And I'm so tired, so tired, so tired, that I need to flip the switch off on those people just now. I did, after all, start my day at 3:30 a.m., and the bright siders, I feel confident, did not. Who are these bright siders? No, not you... of course not you. But the bright siders are a lot like us. Good people. Nice people. Well intentioned. I love them. But if I say that a pit bull latched on to my foot and so I'm going to have to have it amputated and the insurance company refuses to pay for anesthesia and my doctor speaks only Swahili so I'm having panic attacks so bad before the appointments that I'm on the other line with a hot line so I don't just end it all, bright siders say, \"Oh, isn't it just wonderful that you have another foot! I'm so glad. At least you have a doctor, not everybody has one. Thanks for calling. Thanks for letting me know you're okay. That's GREAT! Kiss kiss!\" I just sometimes need to say that what sucks, sucks. Yes, there are suckier things. Yes, other people have sucky and suckier things. Yes, I have good things, wondrous magical things too. I am appreciative, I am grateful, I am loving, I am passionate. And tired. False positivity is the salt in the cracks of a forced smile. If your preschooler is NT, the picture of health, and right now cheerfully coloring you a picture while singing \"If you're happy and you know it...\" but your husband forgot your birthday, your boss nixed your raise, your car broke down on the 405, and you're waiting for scary test results from your obgyn, I am not going to tell you, \"Yeah, but your kid is easier than mine is.\" Ain't got nothing to do with the price of tea in China. You are entitled to say, in my humble opinion, that what sucks, sucks. In fact, I'll just listen, read your blog if you've got one, and suggest you start one if you don't. I'll tell you two truths: 1. It'll be alright. 2. But it really does suck right now.

{"date": "Saturday, March 1, 2008", "body": "\nAMENDED:  BELOW, you'll read how I had an epiphany about Amelia Bedelia. I didn't by any means think it was an original thought -- I had a hunch that if I searched on Google, I'd find some funny but possibly obscure articles mentioning just the same thing I thought of, but it was nowhere near so subtle... practically ALL the kajillion hits diagnosed Amelia's ASD! So I'm late and learning as usual...patience, I beg of you... I've had many people ask how yesterday's IEP meeting went, and it's all too big to process let alone describe just yet. Maybe I can compare it like being a soldier returning home, \"So how did that war go?\" Well, there were a lot of battles... But here is the aha moment I had: I am thinking Amelia Bedelia must have been on the spectrum, and I never knew it. You remember Amelia Bedelia from your childhood; she was the little housekeeper who diligently followed your directions. You said dust the furniture, so she covered them with dust. I swear, I am going to put my Google skills to work when I finish this post to see if other parents realized that Amelia was on the spectrum after having their spectrum kid described to them by a speech language specialist. So the speech person at our IEP seemed to adore and pity our rooster in a way that melted and terrified me. She gently told me that, because he was so charming, and she was rooting so hard for him to succeed, that she tried about nine ways to get him to successfully answer the receptive language part of her assessment. He wouldn't or couldn't but definitely didn't, and had no real interest in trying except for his desire to please the nice lady. But he was in an unfamiliar room filled with books and toys, and he had his own agenda, too. She asked him to keep his eye on the puzzle, and this is where he turned all Amelia, didn't you guess. Yep, he bent down, and he put his face -- no, his eye -- on the puzzle. For a minute. Then he was off on more tangents. Oh, I know all about the tangents. I know about the made up words (\"durst\" is the most interesting, and I promise to post about durst later) and I know that despite having an age-appropriate vocabulary, it is an enormous struggle for the rooster to answer questions on topic, or have any kind of back and forth dialogue. But surely I should have noticed this literal aspect more. I guess it's true that when you are too close to something, you can lose your perspective. This language person was trying to explain that our rooster has a significant -- in fact, I think she said huge -- gap between his expressive and receptive language scores, and that it's hard to tease all that apart from his distractability to know what is going on, but it definitely, clearly does not bode well for his auditory processing. Of course, they are not allowed to \"diagnose\" auditory processing. But this team really seemed skilled at diagnosing lots of things with the caveat that, \"but we are not allowed to DIAGNOSE that, so we just use it as a DESCRIPTOR.\" Among things they liked to dangle at us, as they amitted having no clue exactly what to make of his unusual language, they threw in DESCRIPTORS such as aphasia-like, \"sort of like a person with a brain lesion,\" and -- can you hear my fingers wince on the keyboard -- \"schizophrenia-like.\" This last business was not from the language expert but from the school psychologist, who is no only not on my holiday card list, but looks like she and the grinch have the same hair dresser. Anyway, forget her. It was the speech person who seemed to best get the rooster and all his issues. She described him so well that there is no way her evaluation won't be useful as we schlep from -ist to -ist armed with the epic that is the rooster's file of documentation. I felt a physical sensation of pain everytime she pityingly gushed, \"He was clearly TRYING. Trying SO HARD. But his pragmatics just ARE NOT THERE.\" Who would have thought I would have a child with, of all things, trouble expressing himself? (Self expression might be my only strength in life! And his dad writes for a living!) Most people see his BLONDE hair, take note of the THICKTHICK dark auburn tresses that make my husband and I look like we could be siblings if we weren't spouses, and say, \"Where did you get this blonde boy?!\" I don't know why he's blonde or why he has hundreds of vocabulary words that he struggles to put together in any meaningful way, but I am going to put every word in my dictionary to work for our family to seek out help for him. I will ask and listen and read and learn, and I will talk and explain and beg if I have to. And I don't mean I'll do this with just the experts or with the doctors and ists or with the blogosphere -- I'll do all this with my boy as well. He really truly does have a lot to tell me. I just have to keep my on him, so to speak. DURST!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/03/amelia-bedelia.html", "title": "\nAmelia Bedelia\n"},

But, on the other hand, we can't afford to wait that long to help him.\" Quite a little conundrum, that. I fly at it all like some kind of corporate raider trying to sneak in fast and take over; the company is on shaky footing? Let me manage things and turn it all around!

Only rushing does no good; our rooster seems to be on his own unique clock. Sometimes I get rattled by the fact that my husband doesn't race around life at the pace I do, but in this case, I'm the one who is out of synch. He just gets down on the floor with the rooster, no matter what chaos has just taken place, and he slowly addresses it. No rush to judgment, no expedited fix-it plan, just good, calm, slow dialogue eye-to-eye with the rooster boy. I'm trying very hard to learn from this, though clearly I am a hard case, as I've had that magnet going on eight years now with no measurable signs of improvement. Yesterday, I lost my patience for probably the tenth time that day, and the rooster, who had been taunting his sister and stealing fruit out of the fridge after I'd said he'd had enough, came up to me with his preschool wisdom, plus some scripts he's picked up from two surgeries and four years of doctors. \"Mommy? You okay? You need to breathe deep mommy. Breeaathe deeeeeeep. You breathe? Ahhhh. Breathe mommy.\" What could I do? Both Peaches and I looked at him, and at each other, and we both followed along, and took some long, slow, deep breaths.

We talk through presentations, don't always clean up after ourselves, sometimes we have trouble sharing. But I want to break that mold. I want to learn about and from the rooster, and I want to practice what I preach: work hard, pay attention, and enjoy the process. Blogging might in fact be part of my sharing homework. L, one of my best friends who teaches at my school tells her students this when they have a tantrum over not getting this or that thing that they wanted: \"You get what you get, and you don't get upset.\" I think she makes them practically sing it - you gotta love that.

You might have had some image in your mind of the Mini Me you were hoping for, but whatever little swimmer matched up with that month's egg had final say. Boom - you get what you get.

{"date": "Thursday, February 21, 2008", "body": "\nThese days I'm worrying about getting old. In some ways, I have always been old! But when you look at the generations above you moving up the escalator just ahead of you, you can't help but think about your own journey. And when you have a rooster with special needs one step down, it seems even scarier. I remember as a child screaming at my mother that one day she would be old and I would NOT take care of her, since she had not taken care of me. Nice, huh? Well, we didn't always scream -- in fact, we could go weeks without speaking to each other much at all. In my teen years, it got worse; she would ask me questions like, \"Have you ever tried pot?\" and when I said no she said, \"You are not my child. Who are you?\" I managed our two-person household as best as I could while she hung out with friends, overslept, picked up guys. I seemed to be about a generation older than my mother, and from a different planet. We did not speak the same language, so it was best not to talk to each other too much. That started changing in my twenties, and really hit a turning point around the time that my mom fell in love with the first good guy in her life, and I fell out of love with the first bad one in mine. My mom started to grow up and settle down as I learned to loosen up and take some risks. She got married, and I got  annulled , but we were finally found our mother-daughter voices. I called when I was in pain, and she answered. I leaned, and she supported. Better late than never, my mom showed up to save the day. Now that I am 36 and she is 63, a shift: we both call with our joys and our burdens, which are similar in some ways now. We're both married to the right guys, we're both working hard, we're both tired. We talk a little more like peers. I find myself wondering how long this part will last, until we come back around full circle and once again I need to take care of my mother, as she is caring for hers. My grandma has always been my hero. She was the one I talked to when I was growing up, who understood my love of school, who celebrated my report cards, who proclaimed, \"I'm so proud of you, I could bust!\" She was a teacher, and she has always been proud that I became a teacher. (My mom, upon hearing I'd decided to teach, asked for the  umpteenth  time, \"Who are you? You are not my child!\") There were times I felt like my grandparents and I shared the job of raising my mother. In my most bitter moments, I felt that somehow some crazy, unjust generational goof had happened, and I should have been their daughter instead, and then I would have had the happy childhood that my mother ironically despised and rebelled against. My grandma stayed young well into her old age. When I left town to start my own life and my own family, she and my grandpa let me off the hook without a word of guilt or reproach, taking over the last remnants of supporting my mother, who has grown up considerably, but will never be June Cleaver or anything. It was only once my grandpa began to unravel, maybe just five years ago or so, that my grandma also found herself really aging quickly at long last, and my  mother found herself having to face serious role reversal. \"She just won't LISTEN,\" my mom will lament. \"I cannot get her to take her medicine, or get some exercise, or get a shower when she needs to. I just get so frustrated.\" I know exactly how she feels, and so I try to  commiserate . I can't get the rooster to do any of those things, either. I tell her that he's oppositional, loud, aggressive, messy, stubborn, and exhausting. She says, \"That's my grandson you're talking about! He's funny! He cracks me up! He's got personality! You can't get so upset. He's only three.\" I say, \"Grandma is in her eighties. You've got to cut her some slack. When you're old, it's your right to be ornery. Besides, she can't help it. And you'll be there some day, and it will be my turn to be patient.\" And after that, if I'm lucky, I will be the old one. And who will my rooster be then? It' an unanswerable question, like so many I have for the crystal ball when I think of the rooster. I look at my grandma, young for so long, now for the first time ever too old to turn to with my own problems, and I feel sad and wish that I could help her more, as she always helped me. I look at my mom, helping my grandma, and I see how it ages her as well to take on this  care taking  role. I look at my son and wonder: when I am at the top of the escalator, will he be taking care of me, or will I be worrying who will be left to take care of him?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/02/ages-and-stages.html", "title": "\nAges and Stages\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 22, 2008", "body": "\nWhen people ask me why we call our boy \"the rooster,\" I usually give the easy answer: he wakes us up at all hours. They laugh at this, but we don't, as we are too tired. The truth is, in fact, that the name probably evolved in some fatigue-induced haze during which we babbled a string of silly nicknames including Boonie, Roo, Roostie, Roostieroo, and, of course, Rooster. Don't quote me on any of this, as I cannot be held responsible for memory or accuracy - I have not slept in four years. Again, people laugh when I say I have not slept in four years. These people are off my Christmas/Hanukah list. These people use alarm clocks. Ha! What do these people know. I'm especially weary of hearing predictions about when we will sleep. These began while I was still pregnant and couldn't get comfortable at night. People warned, \"That's mother nature's way of training you, because you aren't going to get a good night's sleep for MONTHS.\" Then, in the hospital, the rooster kept all the other babies awake, so the nurses asked us to keep him in room, saying we might as well start getting used to it, as it was \"only the start.\" My doctor said three months would be the magic mark. A coworker said a year. Everyone suggested the Ferber method, and we tried, we tried, but alas only we parents cried ourselves to sleep. As all predicted dates for rest came and went, our pediatrician all but promised that the rooster would be sleeping through the night by the time he turned two. And that was a time when he began to sleep through SOME nights. Of course, that is also the year his sister, Peaches, was born. Soon the rooster will be four and Peaches will turn two. We did discover Melatonin a few weeks ago, no thanks to our pediatrician, so the rooster does GO to sleep now, and that is huge. But what does he expect me to say when he leaps into our room at 3 a.m. and says, \"MOMMY?! What are you DOING?\" It isn't every night he does this, but, for one reason or another, my sleep gets interrupted about 5 nights a week. Somehow he and Peaches must collude each night. Sometime between dinner and tooth brush time, they must make some plan; with their eyes they must telegraph, \"You get mom and dad tonight. Try the coughing thing. That one is good. Tomorrow night I plan to wet the bed, unless you want to lose your pacifier?\" Are my blogs awful? Depressing? The worst? I cannot tell anymore. I'm too tired to read them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/02/sleepless.html", "title": "\nSleepless\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 25, 2008", "body": "\nSometimes when my husband has both kids in his lap or arms, he joyously tosses back his head and proclaims, \"I have TWO  boosties !\" Don't ask me how we came to call them  boosties  -- I think I've explained often enough that sleep deprivation leads us to all kinds of weirdness. But does anyone forget I have two? I mean, does it seem like the Peaches gets overlooked for being  neuro  typical? (And should I knock on some wood or something? Because I know the deities don't like it when I assume a positive stance... maybe I should say that, so far, Peaches seems to our untrained eyes as being mostly  neuro  typical...) I adore my kids - BOTH of them. I spend equal time with them, make sure Santa doles out equitable shares from his big red bag, set the same rules around the house. I talk to them equally, but I realize I talk about them in unequal amounts. The rooster gets more. But the fact is it often seems like the rooster needs more. So is that fair?  I often come back to a speaker we had a school several years back, before I was married or had kids. He stuck with me when he said, \"A common misconception is that fairness means giving all kids the same thing. Fairness means giving each child what that child needs.\" I get it, but sometimes I feel guilty anyway. I guess it's a parent's job to figure out what each child needs. And to provide it. And to feel guilty. Peaches is home sick today. It is the first time I can remember that she caught a widely circulating virus BEFORE her brother. I kept feeling the rooster's head in disbelief. Cool as a cucumber. Peaches is the one with glassy eyes, a runny nose, and a warm head. Huh. I have to pay close attention when I go to get her some Tylenol so that I remember to administer HER dose, based on HER weight. The rooster went off to school with his dad, and Peaches and I are at home, a little in shock, secretly a little relieved at the prospect of getting some quiet time; we have slept even less than usual, and that is saying something. I am the youngest of two children, myself. I have an older brother with whom I have never gotten along, and I mean to tell you he has  abhorred  the site of me since I came home from the hospital, and 36 years later he's steeped in his complete contempt for me. I can't really say exactly why -- I guess only he can -- but I do know that I was a voracious reader from the time I was about four, and since he was nine at that time, he didn't particularly enjoy hearing all the adults remark, \"Look at that! She reads better than her big brother! She's so smart--  ahh , what a joy.\" I was the reader, and the writer - he was the fighter. It would certainly be hypocritical of me to assume my kids will become best friends, or even get along well, but while I'm trying to figure out how to treat them both fairly, I want to try to give them a fair shake at a relationship. I'm trying hard not to let them feel compared, I'm trying hard to reduce the sense of competition between them, I'm trying hard to resist labels that might become assumptions and pigeon holes. I have two  boosties , and I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm trying hard.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/02/i-have-two-boosties.html", "title": "\nI Have Two Boosties\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2008", "body": "\nI've been reading blogs for weeks now, and I think that what I've really been doing is searching for the rooster to show up in one of them, or maybe I've been searching for myself. Of course, we haven't shown up in any of them, because most people like us probably have the good sense not to advertise themselves; we are a wreck, and I must be masochistic to be telling you this. In fact, stop reading this right now. Please, I'm begging you. I am not writing for YOU, anyway, unless you are me, looking for your rooster to show up in a blog, or maybe you are me searching for yourself. Suddenly, belatedly, it hit me today that maybe if I wanted to find myself in a blog, I should write one. In most situations, I am a pretty outstanding searcher, particularly of the Internet. I found my husband online, no less. (Also, I planned our out-of-town wedding online, and found our first place together, our first house, several Craigslist furniture gems; did I mention I got my Master's Degree online and may have located Amelia Earhart? Well, okay, the Amelia part I made up, but if I find her I'll use Google Earth to make you a map -- I'm all about the Web resources, since that Master's Degree I really did get online was in educational technology.) But when I go looking for the rooster online, I'm at a disadvantage because I have no key words that fit just right. I've looked for him and seen his close cousins in Autismland, I've searched high and low among kin in territories of PDD-NOS, ADD ... I even scoped out something called ODD, and while the acronym and the words that comprise it sound like ones I use to describe my guy, when I read on, once again, I feel like we're a little out of place there, too. ODD is Oppositional Defiant Disorder. For a kid with a language delay, he mastered the word NO right on time, and it continues to be his favorite refrain. He hits, pushes, screams, refuses, argues, resists -- often. But does he have a disorder of defiance? I think you'll need to check back with me when he hits his teens, but for now I'm going to say it isn't a clear fit. The rooster also shares, hugs, kisses, jokes, laughs, plays, imagines, cheers, compromises, helps, apologizes -- sometimes. When it comes to autism, I am no expert at all; before the rooster was born, I only knew of core autism, and the autistic brother of my friend had no language whatsoever. Our rooster clearly does have language. Sometimes it's \"scripts,\" where he repeats what he's heard in a story, but usually the \"script\" is invisible, because what he is saying fits the situation. Only after rooster's developmental difficulties did I -- A TEACHER, no less -- set out to educate myself more about the spectrum, and scripting is something that fits on that spectrum - along with never sleeping (until we recently discovered Melatonin - hurray!), difficulty with transitions, social awkwardness, and getting stuck on certain topics. On the other hand, our rooster doesn't have some of the other clear red flags, like he doesn't line things up, require strict routines, have aversions to loud noises, avoid eye contact, flap his arms, spin around, use an unusual speaking voice, stay away from other kids, have particular requirements about his clothes, obsess about trains, freak out in public. He did, though, struggle to learn how to ask and answer questions, have trouble with pronouns... so I have no idea. He definitely has pragmatic language deficits and poor behavior at school. His teachers feel like he needs one of them with him all the time. Circle time? A nightmare. It could well be that the rooster is \"on the spectrum.\" We have an appointment with a developmental pediatrician next month to find out. I don't even know if the label matters much or not, except in terms of the resources it might bring with it. I just know that I've been searching, and searching, and searching... thinking to myself that if I can find someone else like the rooster, maybe I can learn from his or her story. Maybe I can invite him or her over for a play date. Maybe his or her parents can teach me how to survive, and with a sense of humor. Maybe we can have a little more sense of community, instead of too often hunkering down in our home, exhausted, scared, overwhelmed, unsure, unsteady, alone. Already I've felt less isolated with each blog I've read by parents, like me, trying to find their way. The worst thing I've learned from the blogs of moms I've read this month is this: everyone is nicer than I am, and more patient, and stronger. I'm trying to learn from your examples, you moms who go before me, but sometimes, as the rooster knows, the birds eat the bread crumbs. I don't know who my son, the rooster, is exactly. Neither do his teachers or his doctors, of which he has a zillion. (I don't think he's been healthy and well for longer than a couple days at a time since he was three months old, and surely that can't help a child's development.) We love our rooster, we enjoy him whenever we can, but we don't know exactly who he is inside those gorgeous eyes and under that thick blonde mop. So, I am now doing what I usually do when the resources on hand come up empty - I am broadening my scope, and seeking out community on the Internet. I have a strong suspicion that if I write about the rooster, someone reading it will help me figure things out a little better than I have so far. And I won't even rule out the possibility that I will be that someone.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/02/searching-for-rooster.html", "title": "\nSearching for the Rooster\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 23, 2008", "body": "\nWe don't have a diagnosis for our rooster yet, for what his doctors and \" ists \" call \"a constellation of issues.\" Today, we took Peaches and the rooster for a quick trip to  KMart  to buy some cheap spare sneakers for him, since he usually has a wet or dirty pair just when we need to go somewhere. Last time we were there we didn't manage to get the shoes because it was Valentine's Day and as soon as the kids spotted the balloons, we were done. We spent ten bucks on a balloon that sang, just to have the rooster insist we \"let it go free!\" as soon as we got home. (Anyone familiar with Jamie Lee Curtis' book \"Where Do Balloons Go When You Let Them Go Free?\" knows exactly where the rooster gets his inspiration.) Today, with no exciting holidays on the horizon, we went in and made a bee-line straight for shoes, but of course they were having a sale, so we were forced to pass by, of all things, you guessed it, balloons. These were just plain pastel ones on simple strings, so Peaches couldn't have cared less this time, but the rooster? Well, for some reason we decided to plow on. \"No, rooster, those balloons are not for sale. They are for decoration. Look at them and enjoy them with your eyes. Then, let's buy some cool SUPER MAN SHOES! OR, LOOK, SPONGE BOB SHOES! DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THESE SPONGE BOB SHOES?\" Just then, a woman tried to make her way down the aisle, between our two carts filled with our two wonderful offspring. \"Excuse me,\" I said, moving Peaches' cart out of her way. \"No problem,\" she said, smiling at the well behaved little girl, and then turning her attention on my inconsolable boy, still screaming his balloon demands. Her face the picture of disdain, she proclaimed, \"Is he spoiled or what?  Whooooheeeee ! Yes, you are SPOILED.  Mmmmm   Uhmmm ....\" and she pushed her way through and disappeared. As quickly as it played out, another mom's blog was reading itself aloud in my head, a blog I'd read a few months back by the mom of a boy she calls her monkey. She had written about the clerk in the grocery store who  tsked  at the monkey for standing in a cart. And there was another one about a boy on the spectrum getting dirty looks for listening to an i pod ... how many kids with special needs have received intrusive, know-it-all looks or comments from the ignorant people in their midst? So in one of the blogs I'd read, the mom said, \"He's autistic,\" and shut that critic right up. I had a split second in which I thought of this before the  KMart  Witch vanished on her broom stick, but no words came to me. None had the assurance or the diagnosis that packed punch; I don't think I'm ready to pronounce the rooster autistic before a doctor does. I don't know, does this sound like a snappy comeback to you? \"No, he's not spoiled, he's POSSIBLY-GOT-PERVASIVE-DEVELOPMENTAL-DELAY-NOT-OTHERWISE-SPECIFIED-OR SOME-OTHER-THING-ON-THE-AUTISM-SPECTRUM, now kiss my balloons, you witch!\" Hey, I understand and usually empathize when people lose their patience with the rooster. He's hard! But he cost her nothing, and the public finger pointing at our whole family certainly didn't make our daily parenting challenges any easier. To her, he was a  tantrum  throwing 3 and a half year old boy getting on her nerves. To him, he was being forced to sit strapped into a cart surrounded by his favorite objects floating just out of reach, while his parents insisted he look at shoes -- boring SHOES! -- while every urge in his impulsive body rebelled. We made it out with a pair of black pirate sneakers, some righteous indignation, and no balloon. We might not have a diagnosis yet, but there are a few possible ones we've completely discarded, and SPOILED is at the top of the list.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://roostercalls.blogspot.com/2008/02/unspoiled.html", "title": "\nUnspoiled\n"}
