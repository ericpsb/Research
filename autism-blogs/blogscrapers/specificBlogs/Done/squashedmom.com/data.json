But that doesn't matter. On her hundred and twentieth birthday, should I live so long, I will still miss her, mourn my loss. \n \nThe world is a poorer place without my sweet, saucy, loving, funny, brilliant mother in it. \n \nEven though she was barely there when she left. Even though she was a wafting wisp of her former self, I felt the earth sigh and plunge a few degrees colder as I watched her animating spirit vacate the premises, that wan day, two and a half years ago. \n \nI don't have time for this sodden mantle of debilitating grief. The boys' B'nei Mitzvah is a little over a month away, and I am frantically busy between now and then. Two school years starting, Dan traveling for work nearly non-stop this fall; and we're down to one viable, often already booked sitter. \n \nAnd yes, it's a joyous occasion we're preparing for. And yet the sadness keeps leaching in. There will be no grandparents present to dance the hora at their Bar Mitzvah party. No great aunts nor uncles neither. \n \nI knew it was nigh unto impossible for my mother to dance at their weddings, and witnessing college or even high school graduations unlikely. But for a while there, we had held out hope for her presence \u00a0at their Bar Mitzvahs. \n \nI would have asked the universe for three more years with her, if I could have. But I know what the answer would have been. Our time is our time. No more, no less. \n \nAnd for the rest of my time, I will miss her for at least a little bit of every day; and a whole lot more on days like this, her birthday, when she would have been 93 years young. \n \nIf only... \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sJ5Nw03uZf8/T7HojgiEBNI/AAAAAAAABhU/bvWtanSx5wY/s1600/IMG_2237.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2015/09/she-would-have-been-93.html", "title": "\nShe would have been 93...\n"},

{"date": "Friday, May 16, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Ethan, recently \n \nA while ago, Ethan wrote a lovely essay for school and I published it here:  Ethan takes over my blog today (the world tomorrow) .\u00a0 Ethan loved that I shared his writing with you all, and I promised I'd let him take over my blog again. \n \nWell, it's been two years, but he has once again written a beautiful essay for school (6th grade) and he is happy to have me share it with you here, today.\u00a0 The assignment was to write a personal essay, and start with the words \"I believe\":  \n \n \n Playing With Autism   \n \nby Ethan  \n \nI believe that when you help someone or cheer them up, it makes you feel good. That is what I do with my twin brother Jacob, who has autism. Autism means his mind works differently, especially around words. It\u2019s not really like having a twin. He is more like a little brother, even though he is bigger than me. \n \nPlay fighting is my brother\u2019s favorite game. His favorite place to play fight is in my bed. To him, a play fight is actually reenacting part of his favorite tv show, Dragonball Z-Kai. In mid-fight Jacob started quoting an episode from the show. Then he started making weird motions with his body then got right back into the fight. \n \nJacob doesn\u2019t know his own strength. I had to tell him to go easy, when he hit me so hard I could see the whole Milky Way spinning around my head! \n \nIt isn\u2019t easy having a brother so strong, who acts so young. It\u2019s like playing with Superman. He kept asking me to smack him harder, but I can\u2019t stand striking him. I did it anyway. He\u2019s not made of ceramic, after all. \n \nDuring one of our battles, I ended up riding on his back like a cowboy busting a bronco, tearing through the entire house. I got pretty good at it. Maybe I should take riding lessons on a dude ranch. \n \nJacob needs me to play with him because he doesn\u2019t really have any other friends. There is one girl from his school that plays on his special needs basketball and baseball teams, and sometimes they go to the movies on weekends, but that\u2019s it.   \n \nJacob says \u201cEthan, you\u2019re my best friend!\u201d and that makes me sad. I have lots of friends who come over to my house and we do all kinds of things together, but Jacob just has me. Jacob knows the names of all my friends and is always asking for them to come over. Most of the time they ignore him, but some of them will be nice and try to play with him a little, or answer some of his funny questions like \u201cWho is your favorite engine?\" \n \nHe is always asking me to play with him. \u201cPlay with me, Ethan. Play with me, now!\u201d Sometimes I feel like it, but a lot of times I really don\u2019t.  When I say \u201cno\u201d he keeps talking to me. \u201cHi, Ethan\u201d he will say, over and over again, even though we\u2019re still in the same room. So I put down my book and play with him for five minutes. \n \nWhen Jacob is grinning like a hyena, he looks so happy and I feel great. It is like his joy flows right into me. When I see him happy or just cute it makes me the happiest man on earth. Cheering him up cheers me up. There is only one thing better than seeing my brother, Jacob, happy, and that is  making  him happy. \n \n \n*~*~* \n \nPretty heady stuff for an 11 and a 1/2 year old, no? \n \nAlso, in the name of full disclosure, I have to tell you that this is written from, shall we say, Ethan's best, most idealized self.\u00a0 There are still plenty of \"I wish I didn't have a brother\" days, but there IS this kindness and empathy too, all mixed in.  \n \nThank you, Ethan, my lovely son, for your wise and loving contribution to my blog today. I can't wait to see what you will come up with next! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsiJACflVxw/U3HBF_QGGsI/AAAAAAAAEm8/QZUx0ZMApKI/s1600/IMG_8300.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2014/05/ethan-wants-to-tell-you-about-playing.html", "title": "\nEthan wants to tell you about Playing with Autism\n"},

And I can say that without sounding too self-serving because this year I'm \"just\" a producer, not also a reader.  \n \nI read two years in a row. It was a moving and fulfilling experience, but time to make room for new faces.  \n \nThe best part about not reading?\u00a0 No angst over what to wear, the spanx or breathe dilemma. Also, as I am working the front of the house - box office and business issues - I can sit IN the house and watch the show with the audience, which is a fabulous experience I am looking forward to.  \n \nAnd, as always, part of our box office goes to a charity that helps women and families.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Marilyn, 1958 \n \n \nTwo weeks ago, today, I buried my Aunt Marilyn, my mother's baby sister. \n \nAnd now they are all gone, that generation; down like dominoes within the span of a little over a year. \n \nFirst  my mother, last January . \n \nThen my dear  Uncle Walter , coming up on a year this May. \n \nAnd now, finally, Marilyn, passed, Sunday, April, 13th, though how she managed to live that long is anybody's guess. \n \nWe thought we had lost her three and a half years ago. And then again last fall, while I was in Raleigh, speaking at the ARC of North Carolina annual conference, telling my stories from the intersection between Sandwich Generation and special needs issues. \n \nInstead of having a fond farewell with the wonderful people who had organized the conference and generously invited me to come speak (and paid me!) I was sitting in my rental car in the hotel parking lot, sobbing while I fielded calls from the nursing home, the hospital, the funeral home and my cousins, trying to prepare for my Aunt's imminent demise. \n \nAnd then she rallied once again. \n \nBut not two Sundays ago. \n \nIn spite of the burgeoning spring, her funeral day was bitter, biting cold.\u00a0 Standing by my aunt's graveside for a brief ceremony, the wind from the nearby ocean snaked through the winter coats, hats and gloves that had been donned so surprisingly on a mid-April day. Marilyn had been a winter baby, I figured this was her doing. \n \nThere were such a paltry few of us present: my little family and my cousin Jessie's - minus Aaron, away at college; seven in all. Plus the guy from the funeral home, plus the rent-a-rabbi the funeral home sent -- who was truly much better than any of us had expected, setting just the right tone of simple sadness.  \n \nFor her passing was sad, but hardly tragic, more a blessing; a relief from a life she had relinquished all but the most tenuous hold to, long ago. \n \nI was so grateful to have my husband by my side, whose Hebrew is strong, a counter to the mostly mumbled Kaddish chanted along by the rest of us. \n \nWe all shoveled a spade or two of dirt upon a lovely coffin. My niece, Jessie's daughter Ilana had brought along some forsythia from her grandmother's yard, and that too went into her grave. Though Marilyn had brought her winter to us for the funeral, we sent some spring with her into eternity. \n \nSome more forsythia went on top of Walter's grave, atop a small pile of stones. His simple marker weathered now, nearly a year. Jessie and I discussed the stone that had been ordered, soon to come, and what to do about my mother, still sitting in a box on top of a bookcase in my apartment. She wants to be someplace I can visit her, so she'll be joining her sister and brother, mother and father on this windswept speck of flat earth, Long Island's city of the dead. \n \nAfterwards we drove along the south shore to Point Lookout, the beach community of our childhood. There was a clam shack Walter had loved in the tiny fishing village there that seems so much more New England than suburban New York. We ate and laughed and remembered their lives. \n \nThere was not a single car in the beach parking lot, not another soul present as we walked the wintery beach. \n \nNever underestimate the healing power of the great ocean. Or watching your children gambol upon an empty beach. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRest in peace, Aunt Marilyn. Finally, at peace. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xy9caYXhCRE/U1gTwwsEKuI/AAAAAAAAElk/gQGR_qUr9Mk/s1600/Marilyn+1958.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M-LRshpf3rE/U2ZiZVmY2vI/AAAAAAAAEmQ/H-DLXZUST44/s1600/IMG_8407.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2014/04/and-then-there-were-none.html", "title": "\nAnd then there were none\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 12, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Me and Mom on Mother's Day, 2012, her last \n \n \nI couldn't write on Mothers Day, the feelings too raw, the wounds still unclosed. Yes, even here, more than a year out and counting. So I gave myself the day to muddle through. \n \nI shined at breakfast - lox and bagels produced by my offspring and husband - but then faded midday. In spite of abundant sunshine beaming in through our windows, the winter's accumulation of grime rendering them near opaque white in the brilliance, I took to my bed in the early afternoon. \n \n\"Mom gets to nap on Mothers Day!\" I declared, making it sound fun. But really it was a retreat from the empty space my mother should have occupied. \n \nEthan was mad that I had slept though our potential stroll through the park. Instead we had a rushed half jog along Riverside to Jake's playing field, peeling off as we got there, me to accompany Jake to his weekly baseball game, Dan joining Ethan on the basketball courts nearby. \n \nI love my son dearly, but must admit, watching special needs sports is simultaneously like watching paint dry and having your heart ripped open repeatedly. The pace is glacial, the triumphs beautiful and painful. I sat on my blanket in the sun and baked myself into a semblance of peace. \n \nAfterwards, waiting outside the boat basin cafe for our table to come up and Ethan and Dan to appear (hopefully somewhat concurrently, and in the right order) Jacob befriended a dog named Sophie and talked to me about classical music. He picked up a stick and wanted to conduct violins \"like Squidward\" so I lazily googled \"violin concerto\" planning to let YouTube entertain my boy. I had forgotten the landmine there. \n \nMy mother loved music. My childhood home had been filled with it, from classical to folk to jazz and then rock as her musical taste evolved through the 60s and 70s. \n \nMy mother's amethyst and glass beads moved with a sweet heaviness around my neck as I swayed to the tinny Tchaikovsky pouring out of my iPhone. My mother also loved sunshine and the water, flowering trees and children. I was surrounded by the things she loved, as I often am, she who took such joyous bites of out the scrumptious world. \n \nThe rest of my boys arrived with perfect timing and we were seated at an outer table overlooking the sunset river, just as I had desired. Ethan was a bit grumpy surveying the menu, declaring nothing to be quite to his liking and questioning why we had to eat there. \n \n\"Because I love it here. It makes me happy to eat outdoors and by the water, and it's Mother's Day so I get to choose.\" I was trying not to whine. I really didn't want a scene. \n \nFor once he took my answer without a fight and resigned himself to a dinner of calamari and fries, supplemented with bites of everyone else's dishes. \n \nI then did something I rarely do, I ordered a \"Mommy drink\" something silly and frozen and alcoholic, because dammit it was Mother's Day. It came with three maraschino cherries on top which Ethan devoured with abandon, his first time encountering such beasts.\u00a0  \n \n\"Is this what they mean when they say 'and a cherry on top?'\" he asked. Yup.  \n \nWe walked back home through the park as the twilight thickened, the air heavy with the promise of a soon-coming summer. Up ahead the the George Washington Bridge's majestic sway cut through the haze, spanned over to the other shore. \n \n\"Look, Grandma's favorite bridge\"\u00a0 I pointed out. But I didn't have to.

Then children and menopause came around. So now, not so much so. \n \nIn fact, getting enough sleep is the bane of my life right now. I make a cranky insomniac, and though I tend to think of this as a new problem, every now and then I remember: I had a terrible sleep problem as a child. That was so long ago (I am OLD) and had been resolved for so many years, I'd nearly completely forgotten. \n \nBut yes, as a child of four, six, eight, ten, I would lie abed for hours, waiting for sleep to come, terrified of the night. And the one thing that would help? My record player. And my absolutely favorite album of all time? Pete Seeger's  Sleep-Time Songs & Stories. \n \nWithout even trying I can instantly conjure his voice, telling me a wonderful bedtime story. There's Pete now, talking and singing of the giant Abeyoyo, conquered by a mischievous fiddling magician and his son; or of Sam, the young whaler, up high in the ship's eagles nest, ever searching, until... \"Thar she blows!\" \n \nI was saddened to hear of his passing yesterday, of that chapter closing. But I also know, 94 is a good long run. And, as all the news sources said, he was chopping wood a scant ten days ago.\u00a0 I also know he passed surrounded by love and loved ones. He passed making his mark on the century that was, and on the future rolling ever onward.  \n \nPete Seeger was woven throughout my childhood in too many ways to begin to tell. My parents were lovers of folk music. In fact they met at  the Music Inn  in Lenox Massachussets, a wonderful place for lovers of folk music and jazz in the 1950s. A place Pete often played. \n \n \n \n \nI saw Pete play numerous times in my childhood, most memorably at some of the first Clearwater Festivals. I remember the sun sparkling on the Hudson River, the majestic old sloop, and Pete serenading me with \"Little Boxes\" and \"Roll on Columbia.\" \n \nAnd then, many years later, I was working video production at the Philadelphia folk festival in 1991, where there was a Seeger Family reunion concert that year. It was clear his voice was starting to fade a bit, but still lovely to hear him sing again, especially surrounded and supported by his talented, musical family. \n \nFinally, when my father died three years ago, an old Pete Seeger song kept playing in my head, over and over. At the end of their lives, my father and Pete looked a lot alike. (And I wrote all about that in a post, here:  Why, Oh Why? ) \n \nI am still spooked whenever I see a picture of him pop up on the internet, my first thought being \"Dad?\" and then, no, just Pete. \n \nSo sorry to see you go, Pete.  \n \n\u201cWhy, oh why, oh why, oh; why, oh why, oh why? \n \nBecause, because, because, because. \n \nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jRXeJyKvQCc/UujrNdiu37I/AAAAAAAAEkc/UwTl3N9Uh_U/s1600/Pete+Seeger.jpg", "http://www.musicinnfilm.net/index.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ymkhztu4RtI/UujxjrzvSZI/AAAAAAAAEks/2oobMCm-Jbs/s1600/Pete+Seeger+singing.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2014/01/goodbye-pete-seeger-goodbye.html", "title": "\nGoodbye, Pete Seeger, Goodbye\n"},

Though mixed and tumbled in, especially now, is the pain of those final days. \n \nI would never, in a million years, have not been present for my mother's final moments, have let her die alone.

As it wound down, I sat beside the waxy husk that had been my mother. \u00a0She had so clearly vacated the premises, but still I held her hand. \u00a0A body with the spirit fled is such a strange ghoulish thing, and yet there was also an odd comfort in sitting there. \n \nI said goodbye to the body that had been my mother, watched it draw its last breath. \n \nA year ago, today. \n \nMy mother is at peace. \n \nMe, not so much so. \n \nIt's going to be a busy day today, Jake with no school, Ethan a mere half-day.

(Thank you so much to all who have written words of encouragement whenever I have chanced to scratch out a post,\u00a0these past desert-dry months.) \n \nThis has been a tough year.  \n \nIn a little over two weeks, it will be exactly one year since I lost my mother. (January 17th, to be precise.) \n \nIt feels like both yesterday and forever ago that I held her hand, watched her die, wept my goodbye. \n \nI have been treading lightly on this earth ever since,  simultaneously\u00a0 here and not here, \u00a0Gratefully bound by love and obligation to those, my family (sons, husband, cat), whose need for my presence keeps me tethered in the now, I am nonetheless also floating in the ether, stretching out my open, empty hand toward my mother who keeps drifting farther beyond, never again to reach back and claim it. \n \nI know I need to return, fully, to my life; that this dual, quantum existence cannot spin on indefinitely. I am a paler reflection of my old, colorful self and my family deserves more. I deserve more. \n \nAnd yet I also know this mourning is a process that I need to go through to come out the other side. There is no around. No shortcut. No easy out. Only through. \n \nI am hoping the year's anniversary will spiral me upward, into a higher orbit, the next stage of mourning that spins me out toward the future. \n \n \n~*~*~ \n \nTonight I gave away my mother's beanie babies. \u00a0A woman of normally impeccable, modern, sophisticated taste, she nonetheless had a soft spot for stuffed animals in general, and beanie babies in particular. She thought them \"cute\" and had amassed quite a collection of them before, I believe, my father threatened (idly) to divorce her if she purchased any more. \n \nIn the many downsizing moves I had boxed them up, except for a few that followed her into the nursing home - a beanie cat perched here, a flamingo there - on her paltry few furnishings. \n \nI don't really want them (except for her favorite cat and flamingo) and yet could not bear to throw them out, so they became yet another box cluttering up our overstuffed apartment, the belongings of the dead commingled with the living. \n \nAnd then tonight, New Year's Eve, we had an invitation to a party,\u00a0for the first time in ages. A simple thing really, just three families, hanging out together, but so right for us. My friend who was hosting has three daughters; the middle one has a shortly upcoming birthday and loves nothing in the world so much as stuffed animals. \n \nAnd so it came to pass that in addition to the champagne, strawberries and sparkling cider we brought to the party, came an enormous box of beanie babies. \u00a0Watching the sheer delight wash over my friend's daughter as she unearthed bear after bird after kangaroo from that box made my heart flutter. \n \nMy mother loved children so much (I'm sure it was part of her attraction to the beanie creatures, her real baby having left home so long ago) and I know that nothing would have made her happier than seeing her collection lighting up the world of a little girl. \n \n \n ~*~*~ \n \n \nWe raised our glasses of champagne and cider to toast the new year as fireworks began to burst and boom in nearby Central Park. \n \nAnd so I raise my glass to you, my friends and readers.... \n \nTo a New Year, sweeter than the bitter one that has just come to its end.  \n \nMay there be joy for us all. And healing hearts. \n \nAnd fireworks, brightly hued and full of spangle; shimmering in the darkness, lighting up our midnights. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/12/of-years-old-and-new.html", "title": "\nOf Years Old and New\n"},

Again. \n \nI rushed to her side in the Long Island hospital her nursing home had sent her to; a cold, bleary ride in the pre-dawn quiet. \n \nAnother broken hip. A matched set. ( I wrote a post about it .) \n \nBut this time my mother was older, frailer than the last time. This time my mother had already been through the ringer, and unbeknownst to anyone yet - but soon to be quite evident - she was also becoming septic from an undiagnosed infection. \n \nA year ago today, my mother went into the hospital, and began the final, short sojourn of her life. She began dying. \n \nI was by her side nearly the whole time. \n \nI was with her when she passed, five days later, at 3:15 in the afternoon of January 17th. \n \nI have been dreading the return of these dates, these days. January 12th through 17th. \n \nThey were excruciating to go through last year, every moment both drawing out and swiftly fleeting, galloping towards that end. \n \nAnd when they are done, the wheel will turn; from first year to second year without my mother. It will be a different thing. And yet also more of the same. \n \nI know everyone's parents die, eventually; that this is the natural order of things. \n \nI know that ninety was a good run. \n \nI know I was lucky to have had such a loving mother. \n \nI know I was lucky to have had her for so long. \n \n \nI miss her every day. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3zBW1GbivYA/UQjJpFrkQ0I/AAAAAAAAEM0/TlxfifmZ1Rs/s1600/Mom,+January+3rd,+2013.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2014/01/one-year-ago-today.html", "title": "\nOne year ago, today\n"},

(But I don't have to like it.) \n \nEveryone who died was quite old, in their eighties and nineties. \u00a0They had rich, full lives, a long run, loving children and grandchildren by their side.

It was a lovely affair, the bride in her 20s, our friends - her parents, so proud and happy. There was food and wine and dancing.

{"date": "Friday, September 20, 2013", "body": "\n \n \nI know. \n \nIt's been such a long time since I last posted on my blog, something I never thought would come to pass. And yet as the days stretched on it became harder and harder to post. Once again there are a thousand half-written posts in my queue, ten thousand in my head. \n \nBut today, finally, I have pushed through the quicksand to bring you.... \n \nA recipe. \n \nWait... What? Have I lost my mind and suddenly turned into another person?  \n \nNope. \n \nI know you're thinking \"What about the end of summer and Ethan's camp and Jacob's camp and the annual family vacation in the Berkshires and my mother's birthday and back-to-school haircuts and back-to-school and the whole middle school transition thing and school bus nightmares and... and... and...?\" \n \nWell, yeah. I have all those stories, too. And maybe some of them will get to spill out here. But I can't keep going backwards, I can only slog forwards right now. \n \nAnd I have to start somewhere, and so that's today... \n \nAnd so here's my recipe for Banana-Cranberry-Panic Muffins: \n \nWake up at 5:30 AM \n \nTry to clean up as much of the kitchen as possible, unloading the dishwasher and reloading it, making a neat pile in the sink of everything that doesn't fit in, so that there's room to wash the strawberries and fill the filtered water pitcher. \n \nWash the strawberries and fill the pitcher. \n \n6:00 AM Wake up your autistic son for school, who is, thank goodness, in a very happy mood this morning, bouncing around and wanting to to talk to you about everything. Wonder if this is because you ran out of one of his medications and so he didn't get it yesterday. \n \nConsider whether there is a viable trade off here -- he is definitely more hyper/bouncy/distractable. Yet also happier and more related, talking and pointing and wanting you involved in everything he is thinking and doing. Great eye contact. \n \nMake note to call psychopharmacologist to discuss. Also his teachers to see if he drives them crazy today or not. \n \nGet your son dressed, fed, packed-up and on the bus. \n \n6:55 AM As you go over the morning schedule for you other son in your mind - early school day, as its the \"Back-to-School-Meet-the-Class\" breakfast in his homeroom this morning - PANIC as you realize that you are supposed to contribute baked goods to this breakfast and you forgot to buy anything. \n \nCalculate that there is no way you can get to the store and back and still be on time today. Also understand that there is no time to pick stuff up \"on the way\" and that there is no great bagel & coffee place right around the corner from his new middle school like there was at his old elementary school. Silently curse change again. \n \nHave a brilliant idea: it only takes 10 minutes to whip up muffins and they can bake while you get your son up/make his lunch/get him ready/get husband up/get yourself dressed. \u00a0And so maybe you'll be on time and with still-warm home-baked muffins in hand, and so his homeroom teacher will continue to like your son, and you will not fail the Mom-game today. \n \nRemember you have some frozen over-ripe bananas, so banana muffins it is! \u00a0When you open up the freezer to get them, a bag of frozen cranberries falls out and misses your foot by and inch. Kismet! Banana-cranberry muffins then. \n \nAnd begin. \n \n<*> <*> <*>  \n \nAs is usual with my cooking, I looked up a coupla-three recipes to see what the basic ratios were, what they had in common and any interesting variations, and then I winged it with what I had on hand. \n \nWe arrived (nearly) on time. The muffins were a big hit. Ethan said: \"Mom the sourness of the cranberries goes great with the sweetness of the muffins!\" And he ate two. Win! \n \nAnd so here, finally, is the actual recipe: \n \n Varda's Banana-Cranberry-Panic Muffins: \n(you can skip the panic if you prefer)  \n \n2 cups whole wheat pastry flour \n1 teaspoon baking powder \n1 teaspoon baking soda \n1/2 teaspoon salt \n2 really ripe bananas, pulverized \n2 eggs \n1/2 cup milk - Buttermilk would be nice, too. Or almond/soy/rice milk if you want them dairy-free. \n1/3 cup liquid shortening - I used coconut oil. You can use melted butter if you like. \n1/2 cup sugar - white or brown or combo is fine. I used raw turbinado sugar. \n2 tablespoons maple syrup \n1 teaspoon real vanilla \n1 cup cranberries \n \nMix dry ingredients together & set aside. (Most recipes say \"sift\" and you can if you want to. Me, I'm too lazy for that and besides, I lost my sifter two moves ago.) \nMix everything else except the cranberries together, well. \nFold the dry ingredients into the wet and stir until just combined (don't over-mix). \nStir in the cranberries. \n \nFill lined or greased muffin tins to just under the top. \n \nBake in 350 degree oven for approximately 25 minutes. \nNote: I made full size muffins. You can make minis or a loaf if you want. Bake time for mini-muffins is probably10-15 minutes, for a small loaf I'm guessing 35-40. You'll figure it out. \n \nNOTES: \nWhen my bananas get over-ripe I just pop them in the freezer, skin and all. To use, I microwave for 30 seconds, peel off the skins, remove any yucky bits and then microwave for another minute or so in a bowl until completely thawed. \n \nI used frozen cranberries that were a bit old and wrinkly - to restore them I just filled a bowl with hot water at the start and popped the berries in for the 5 minutes while I mixed the rest of the muffins up. When it was time to add them they were plump and thawed. \n \n \n<*> <*> <*> \n \nHey, that was fun! Maybe more recipes with stories to follow... maybe not. No promises, but let's see what the future will hold.  \n \n(And its nice to be back.) \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/09/and-now-for-something-completely.html", "title": "\nAnd now for something completely different...\n"},

I didn't know what.  \n \n\"Happy birthday, Mom!\"\u00a0he piped up, the first of many birthday wishes from him today.

Not my Uncle Walter, either. \n \nNever again. \n \nAnd yes I know it's just the price of growing older, of becoming the eldest generation, as countless families before me have so evolved. \n \nI don't like it. \u00a0I don't have to like it. \n \nBut it surely beats the alternative. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/08/birthdays-come-and-birthdays-go.html", "title": "\nBirthdays come and birthdays go\n"},

I have barely posted in the last six months. And while I am not happy about that, I also know I don't have the wherewithal to devote the same energy to my blog at this moment as I have in the past. \n \nAnd, truth be told, I'm still struggling with the emotional aftermath of my Mother's death. Ironic that this blog began as my father was dying, of my need to speak from all the jumbled pain therein. That opened the floodgates that fed my writing. \n \nAnd now the fallout from my mother's death has dammed up my words again. But not completely. A trickle is still flowing through. \n \nSo I am considering this: trying to let myself write really short posts for this month. \n \nAt our LTYM BlogHer breakfast in Chicago last Sunday, I was sitting across from Lisa Rosenberg (of the blog  Smacksy)  and when it became clear that another woman at our table didn't know her work,  Alexandra  and I fell over ourselves gushing about how much we love Lisa's blog -- how adorable her son is, how lovely the writing. Alexandra mentioned how refreshing it was that the posts were so short, just a perfect little slice of life. \n \nAnd it got the wheels turning... maybe I can do this... write short posts with just one thought, one story, while waiting for the longer ones to come. \n \nI have so, so many bits of writing sitting in my \"unpublished\" queue that I have been thinking of as \"half-written posts.\" What if I just call them posts (with a little polishing of course) - hit the \"publish\" button and move on? \n \nWould the world stop spinning on its axis? Unlikely. (But don't blame me if it coincidentally does.) \n \nThere is so much that has gone on this spring and summer that I haven't talked about yet here... graduations... rites of passage... summer camp... visiting cousins... Bat Mitzvahs... new babies...

I would say it completely dominated my life for the past month, but that wouldn't be quite true.\u00a0 It had a lot of competition from my Uncle's decline and  death  and Jake's IEP and Ethan's... well, you get the idea. \n \nBut it DID dominate the awesome in my life. And having something major and all-consuming to do on the first Mothers Day without my mother was, frankly, a godsend. I know I have just side-stepped the pain, that it will hit at some point, but if I can put it off just a little longer, that's fine with me right now. \n \n(I haven't even finished my \"first Mothers Day without my mother\" post which is sitting half-written on my computer. Every time I go to it and see the picture of the two of us last year on Mothers Day I just get too sad, and let myself get distracted by Facebook and the Twitterverse.) \n \nThe show was... well, it's hard to find words to describe it... wonderful... glorious... moving, inspiring, side-splittingly funny, heart-rending and thought provoking, all in turn and often simultaneously. \n \nAnd I can say this without seeming conceited because I was just a small cog in the great works of it all. What an awesome talented bunch of folks up there on the stage and behind the scenes. It was an overflowing vat of wonderful, all around. \n \nMy co-producer & directors -  Holly Rosen Fink ,  Amy Wilson,  and  Shari Simpson  - were amazing to work with. They all really carried the day when I was less than my 100% capable self, due to my  mother's dying  in January just as the production was ramping up. \n \nAnd the cast... well, you're just going to have to watch the videos when they come out on YouTube soon. \n \nThe experience on Sunday was lovely for everyone, in the cast and audience alike. And if you weren't able to be there, I hope you can come next year. And if you're not near NYC there's probably a LTYM near you - find it! \n \nAnd if you're one of my many dear friends who was producing and/or directing one of the 24 LTYMs around the country this year - yay! Can't wait to see YOUR city on video, too!  \n \nBut until then... here's a taste - what I read (an edited version of  this post  from last year): \n \n Planets \n \nTonight my son Ethan and I ran a little excursion after dinner. Just the two of us. When we walked out the door it was not quite seven o'clock. These days that means a sky full of light. \n \nAdded to the ridiculously unseasonable warmth, us stepping out on a March eve in mere t-shirts, and I was hard pressed to remember it wasn't a languorous summer evening, but yet a school night, and thus we had to execute our errand quickly and hurry home.  \n \nBesides, I had promised the upstairs neighbors with whom I had parked Ethan\u2019s twin brother Jacob that we'd be back within the hour, and I sorely did not want to abuse my favor currency with them. Friends who are comfortable taking on Jacob are few and far between, precious as diamonds. \n \nJake himself was delirious to be upstairs with the neighbors and their white terrier, with whom he is nearly as obsessed as he is with our cat. Jacob calls these animals 'my best friends' which, though it breaks my heart, is true. \n \nEthan and I were on a mission. \n \nWe absolutely HAD to go to the bookstore tonight because he had finished the last book of a particular series in our possession the day before, and thus we were now in the dreaded state of NOTHING TO READ.  \n \nEthan is in high, silly spirits as we walk the busy Broadway blocks to our local Barnes & Noble. He skips and darts around me walking down the street, as much crazed mosquito as boy. \n \n\"Look at all the people out in the evening!\" Ethan proclaims with wonderment, and I dive again into pointless regret that we are not living anything like the life I had imagined, filled with evening family strolls and nighttime explorations of the city. \n \nJacob does not like to leave home all that much, and to be out with Jacob and Ethan together is most often a form of torture. I must have some wealth of resilience in my bones, some stored reserve of calm and good mothering at the ready. \n \nThere are days when I can and days when I can't and today was decidedly in the impossible column. \n \n \n<^>^<^>  \n \nMission accomplished, book in hand, Ethan and I pushed through the store's glass doors into a city become night, the sky's blue glow nearly extinguished, the streets bathed in yellow-orange incandescence.   \n \nTurning west to walk the two short blocks to Riverside and home, the brightest of stars appeared in the overhead sky.  \n \nNot stars, planets: Venus and Jupiter blazing in the deep cerulean sky that slices between the high-rises, thankfully not obliterated. These two gods are in a much celebrated love fest this month, a rare conjunction. \n \nAnd yet, while they appear to be quite close, kissing distance tonight, they are in fact not truly crossing at all. It's just an artifact of our perspective, the way they look from here on our own mudball. \n \nThey are in fact deeply distant from each other, Venus, sunward, drawing us in toward the heart of our solar system, while Jupiter circles round us from the outside.  \n \nI do not like that my children are distant planets, each locked into their own distinct orbits, occasionally approaching but never truly crossing paths, both merely circling 'round me, their sun. \n \nHow I wish instead they were more like a double star system, like so many of the other twins we know: circling each other, at times closer, at times more distant but always in orbit, one about the other; connected, entwined, hurtling through space as one.  \n \nBut I must, as ever, resist the siren pull of the \"what ifs,\" of that dark matter that draws me to its crushing embrace. \n \nI must instead stay here, in the now, in the track of my actual sons. \n \nThe one who lives on planet Autism. \n \nAnd the one who does not. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qQ_SeEYzc5g/UZYQrXH3N6I/AAAAAAAAEg4/nxR3KzZA60c/s1600/LTYM+2013+outside.jpg", "http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc/", "http://www.theculturemom.com/", "http://www.whendidigetlikethis.com/", "http://dustyearthmother.com/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1O5nwrhkQwg/UZYQpLtpDiI/AAAAAAAAEgo/u-m9jW4Npx0/s1600/LTYM+2013+bow.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/05/i-listened-to-bunch-of-mothers-and-some.html", "title": "\nI Listened to a Bunch of Mothers (and some non-mothers and a cool dude) on Mothers Day\n"},

Now he's a man? I will be a man?\" (Right on all counts.) \n \n\"Daddy and Mommy get married?\" (Yes we did.) \n \n\"Get married you can kiss the bride?\" (smooching sound effect included) (Yes, we did.) \n \n\"I will grow up and be a man and get married.\" (Dear God I hope so) \n \n\"Yes, Jakey.\" \n \nAnd now, lately: \"Mommy I'm going to marry you!\"  \n \nAnd while I smile and explain that I'm already married to someone - Daddy - and he will have to find his own special person to marry when he grows up, I'm secretly glad he's said it while we're home. When he makes statements like this when we're out and about, I can see people doing a double take. \n \nUnless Jake's been especially flappy or grimacey, they probably haven't expected him to be anything out of the ordinary, \"passing\" as it were, until the oddness of our conversation begins to become evident. \n \nAlso I'm mentally ticking off that box in my mind on the page of developmental milestones: Oedipal age - check! \n \nIn a \"typically developing\" boy that comes on about age four, and I seem to recall Ethan having similar romantic notions about me 'round about that time. And it also fits with where Jacob is in a lot of other ways, \"socially/emotionally,\" as they say. \n \nI kind of forgot how completely exhausting four year-olds can be...\u00a0 the thousand questions, the need for constant attention, the wanting to do complicated things themselves, and then the tantrums when it doesn't work out as planned. \n \nThat all this four-year-oldness comes wrapped in the body of a 120 pound, 5 foot tall, near eleven year-old makes it all the more unsettling for strangers to witness. Though of course that's just normal for our family, things being other than they would appear to be at quick glance.  \n \n\"Blue Bear needs his family to go to bed with him!\" Jake firmly asserts at bedtime tonight. And so I round up the white, turquoise and sky blue bears that we have long ago designated to be his mother, father and brother (although sometimes it's a sister, depending on Jake's mood), tuck them in beside him, sing them all to sleep. \n \n\"Mommy, sleep with me!\" says Jake. And though I know I can't stay, that my presence will be too exciting, will keep him awake, I lie beside him for a few minutes as he recounts his day to me, telling the stories as he remembers them: \n \n\"Mommy and Jacob went to the movies and saw Turbo. We saw the credits and the music and it was 20th Century Fox.\"  \n \n\"And Jake and mommy went to the grocery store and bought three things.\" (More like 20, but who's counting.) \n \n\"And then I laughed too much and said the stupid bad words and Mommy got cross. I caused confusion and delay. Mommy is going to fire me.\" \n \n\"No Jakey sweetie, you needed to calm down because it was bedtime, and I'm not cross, not mad, you are NOT a bad engine, just a bouncy one. And you can't be fired.\"  \n \nI stroke his head, drop another kiss upon it. \"And even when I do get mad, Jakey? I never, ever stop loving you, not even for an instant.\" \n \n\"Know this: I will always be your mom, you will always be my son, and I will always love you, forever and ever. Nothing can ever change that.\" \n \nAnd we lie quietly for a moment. \n \nOne moment's silence. \n \nAnd then I kiss him again and ease my way out of the room. \n \n\"Goodnight, Mother\" he lofts at my back as I slip away. \n \n\"Goodnight Jake, I'll see you in the morning.\" \n \nAnd I will. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/07/telling-stories.html", "title": "\nTelling stories\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Mom & Uncle Walter, November, 2012 \n \n \nIn case you've been wondering where I've been lately.... \n \nThe day after my mother passed in January, my Uncle Walter got diagnosed with stage four, metastatic lung cancer. He was given a three to six month prognosis. \n \nLess than a week after that I was taking him to oncology appointments, visiting him in his Long Island home, spending time with my cousins - his daughters - as they cycled through town, coming in as often as they could. \n \nIn spite of how unfair this all was, in spite of his (growing) pain, in spite of his (very understandable) fear of death, he somehow maintained an upbeat, positive attitude throughout it all. He was magnificent, amazing.  \n \nLast Friday, he lost the fight. His daughters were with him for the last day of his life (I had sat vigil, awaiting their arrival).  \n \nHis funeral was Monday. Family, neighbors, colleagues, friends all gathered. The rabbi delivered a lovely eulogy. Jess spoke for the daughters (Annette was too overcome to go join her at the podium) and said so many beautiful true things about Walter. And I spoke too. \n \nIt was a beautiful May day at the cemetery. Afterward we gathered in the backyard he so loved and ate and drank and shared fond memories of Walter. He was much beloved by all who knew him. \n \nIn the coming days I will tell more stories from these last three months, but for now I will just share the words I spoke at the funeral, here:  \n \n \nWalter was my uncle. My mother's \"little  brother\" as she was so fond of calling him in recent years - and he was so UN-fond of hearing. Still, he put up with it with a grimacey smile because he loved his sister - his big sister Sylvia - so very much.   \n \nWe were a close family. Growing up, \"the relatives\" meant Walter and his family - my Aunt Eva and cousins Jessie and Annette who were truly my best friends. Besides my parents, the Heimers - as we called them - were my very favorite people, the ones I was closest to, knew I would be intimately connected to for the rest of my life. \n \nAnd we are.  \n \nI loved my Uncle Walter and am so grateful to have had the chance to spend so much time with him over the years -- and especially in this last year of his life which  my Mother spent in the Nursing Home just 9/10ths of a mile from his house (yes, I clocked it on the odometer). \n \nMy mother absolutely loved Walter's frequent visits. Sometimes I would also be there during them, and the three of us would hang out together in the courtyard. Walter always turned the heads of staff and resident alike - he was such a handsome man, such a dapper dresser, in his suit and fedora -and mom was so proud to tell everyone who he was - her baby brother. \n \n \n \n Walt visiting Mom at the nursing home \n \n \nEvery time I would come into my mom's room she was always showing me the flowers and chocolates he had brought her on his last visit. \"My brother is so good to me\" she would tell me, so grateful for his company, so much love twined between them. \n \nAnd that love has roots that go all the way back.  My mother often told me the story of going to see her new - baby - brother who had just been born. At that time they didn't allow children under 16 into hospitals, so my then 5 year-old mother stood outside the building, under Grandma Dunia's hospital room window - and she held Walter up for Mom to see.   \n \nRecently, at a family gathering, Jessie went to the basement for a bottle of seltzer and came up with an old journal of Walter's from 1941 when he would have been 14. (You never know what you're going to find in that basement.)  \n \nThis entry from February says so much: \"My older sister is a swell gal. My ideal. I wish she was born a boy then we could have some real fun.\" \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd in spite of her being a girl, they did have fun, throughout their lives together. In jazz clubs in the 1940s, at family holidays - always together, on vacation in Maine, hanging out in the lush backyard of Walt & Eva's Port Washington house..  \n \nThe other day I was rifling through my old photo box - you know why - and came up with a great shot of Walt & Eva from 1968. I showed it to my husband Danny and he commented: Eva looks great and Walter... looks like movie star! And indeed he did. \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \nEveryone thinks my own son Ethan takes quite a bit after the Heimer clan, looks a lot like Walter. He does. I can only hope he grows up to be a warm, loving mensch like my Uncle Walter. There's a good chance of it - he already has his huge - and not always appropriate - sense of humor. \n \n \n~*~*~*~  \n \nGoodbye Walter. You were loved. You will be missed. Keep my mom good company, Ok? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-piMJCXvcB5A/ULdBqZlRDfI/AAAAAAAADwM/yMeTR6gEayM/s1600/IMG_6253.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aFYNK5fKlkE/UGFuI6n45aI/AAAAAAAAC-Y/ciLm8OAL2xE/s1600/Mom+and+Uncle+Walter.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ej1L3a-usMQ/TtQXEeBRHiI/AAAAAAAABDg/jbJ2rl-rUE8/s1600/IMG_0263.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-z569lJTPv88/UYoZpiACF_I/AAAAAAAAEf4/M-bKfwfmOAM/s1600/Walt+&+Eva+1968.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/05/goodbye-uncle-walter.html", "title": "\nGoodbye, Uncle Walter\n"},

This is a detail from her door.\u00a0  \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>  \n \nMy walk through the city tonight feels like a stroll through a movie set. Here, a cafe where every single person seated at the outdoor tables is wearing a blue shirt, hues ranging from sky to azure to midnight. There, a blonde family of five - impossibly attractive and dressed to the nines for a festive occasion - pose for a photo as a man who can best be described as an African-American Gabby Hayes crosses the frame, fur lumberjack hat squashed down onto his head, pushing his squeaky wheeled shopping cart filled with dingy stuffed animals and dented soda cans. \n \nYes, this is my city. We all come out of central casting.  \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSunday, for the first time in ages, I stopped at Zabar's to pick up some lox, and had forgotten the artistry of the slicers there. While the stuff we usually get from our local bagel place is serviceable, this was a revelation: fresh, delicious and so thin you could nearly, as the saying goes, read the newspaper through it.  \n \n \n \nWhile I was watching the counter man slice, before I could stop it, the thought popped into my head that I should bring Walter some Zabar's lox next time I go see him, as it always delighted him so when I would arrive bearing real New York City appetizing. And then the sadness rushed in, a now constant tide. \n \n \n \n<*> <*> <*> \n \n \nJacob has now woken up at 5:30 AM for more than a week. \n \n \n \nThis usually means that he is about to undergo a big leap in growth and understanding, his brain too excited to slumber past dawn. \n \n \n \nIt could however, just be an attempt to get uninterrupted screen time on his own terms, no brother to share and negotiate with. \n \n \n \nOnly time will tell. \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>  \n \n \n \n \nToday I sat in the \"big yard\" with Ethan after school, eating our ice creams in a shady spot and watching the kids swirl around us, playing their hearts out. We are both still easily tired, the legacy of the stomach bug that swept through our household earlier this week, taking us down like bowling pins, Ethan the first to go on Monday afternoon. \n \nSo instead of jumping up to join the fracas, he sits beside me, in the quiet watching, rests his head on my shoulder, waves back at his friend's younger siblings when they spot us and yell hello. \n \nI look at the Kindergarteners among them, and then down at my nearly eleven year-old son, sifting through the years that brought him from that to this. I can't quite believe that he was ever that little. Or that his time here is soon to come to a close. \n \nSix years spent in these red brick walls. Now less than two weeks until goodbye. \n \nTonight is the 5th grade dance. The girls will dress in taffeta and heels. The boys will need to be persuaded to wash their faces and put on clean t-shirts. They'll arrive in groups, still separate; the boys here, the girls there. \n \nGrowing up. But not quite grown. Ethan's heart is mine for yet a little bit longer. \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI need to change the name of my blog. My sandwich is open faced now. Open to the heavens.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAlthough, needless to say, most days I am still quite squashed.  \n \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>  \n \n \n \nI thought we were finally done with Thomas forever... until Jake stared obsessing over him again about three months ago.\u00a0 Only now we have to discuss which season and which episode number and who the narrator is and what year it came out and is it a \"classic\" episode or a new one and does the narrator talk \"Americanish\" or \"Englanish\" and...\u00a0 (I say bomb Sodor back to the stone ages & be done with it!) \n \nWell, we did get a break from it for a while. Over the years, we have cycled through obsessions with Teletubbies, Batman, Bakugan, Blues Clues, Ben 10, Power Rangers, Sponge Bob, Dragonball Z Kai, Pingu, and - do NOT ask me why - old basketball games/teams. Specifically the 1974 Celtics for some reason - and we're New Yorkers! Some of these were a relief, while others made me long for the fat controller.  \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>\u00a0 \n \n \nIt has been a month since my last post. \n \nA month. \n \nI never thought I would lose my voice for so long. \n \nBut the other losses have been adding up, cumulative, weighing me down. The words swirl in my head, coalesce into nothing more than little jagged fragments. A sentence here, a thought there, an amusing facebook update at most. \n \nI write them down, thinking I will flesh them out into posts soon, but there they remain, dry bones waiting for life. \n \nI am tired of waiting. Of silence. \n \nSo I scoop my shards up, spread open my hands just a bit, so that they may waft out between my fingers, sprinkle down onto this page, and leave them there, where they fall, willy-nilly. \n \nNot quite a post, but not quite NOT one, either. \n \nA start. \n \nClearing my throat. \n \nMore to follow. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V6T1366h4w8/UbxB47qGUvI/AAAAAAAAEhI/wAFG4jKXmXw/s1600/Detail+from+my+friend%27s+door.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/06/fragments.html", "title": "\nFragments\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, March 28, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Jake and his Grandma, September, 2012 \n \n \nMy mother's memorial service, held,  finally , on Sunday March 3rd was beautiful; just what I needed. Although up until five minutes before it started I was feeling all jangly and out of sorts, grumbley about how it didn't feel right to be doing it at that exact time, a month and a half after she had passed. \n \nI had been up nearly all night finishing and polishing my eulogy, wanting it to be just right, to properly honor the mother I had so loved.  \n \nWhen I stepped up to the podium to begin the service, Ethan was standing right beside me. He had asked to do so, telling me he wanted to support me, to be there for me in case I was overcome with grief. Sometimes I am astounded by his sweetness and depth.  \n \nI welcomed the assembled guests, a mix of family and friends, including,  thankfully, one set of old, old friends of my parents, nearly the last  left standing.  \n \nI read my eulogy:  Some Heart: Sylvia Steinhardt's Eulogy  and then opened up the podium to everyone who wanted to speak, starting with Ethan. \n \nHe spoke about where he was when he found out his Grandmother had died and how he felt. It was spontaneous and heartfelt and lovely. Clearly there is yet another storyteller in this family. \n \nThen my brother Bruce spoke, filling in his side of the story of what it was like to suddenly have a step mother as an older teen, and how wonderful Mom had been, in spite of all the challenges. He spoke so lovingly of her, reminded me that I had forgotten \"seltzer\" in my list of things she loved passionately. \n \nThen my fourteen year old niece Greta (my cousin Annette's eldest daughter) read a poem she had written for my mom. I was awed by its beauty, and am sharing it here:  \n \nTo Sylvia \n \nMy most vivid memories of you \nare summertime; flowers \nstretching palms for sky, \na green new world \ngrowing into its skin. \n \nI wore golden, dangling earrings \nto go see you. \nYou thought they were beautiful, \nand you told me so. \nAgain. And again. \n \nYour memory was a visitor \nthat didn\u2019t stay for long, \nBut you knew who we were. \nYour hands were for holding, \nyour eyes were an embrace. \n \nI like to think  \nthat wherever you are in the universe, \nyou will continue to find \nnew stars in the sky. \n \n by Greta Wilensky \n \n(Now you can see why she's been winning poetry slam contests.) \n \nAnd then Jake, who had been sitting next to me, taking this all in, told me he wanted to speak too, and pointed to the podium... I asked him \u201cAre you sure?\u201d and he said \u201cYes.\u201d Firmly. \n \nSo up we went. I had absolutely no idea how much of what was going on he had comprehended, and what he was going to say. If he had recited a favorite scene from SpongeBob it wouldn't have surprised me. \n \nBut no. He stood there silently for a moment, clearly working hard to come up with what he wanted to say. \n \nAnd it was stunning and beautiful. \n \n\u201cI love my grandma\u201d Jake said. \n \nPause. \n \n\u201cI see her in the hospital\u201d (what he often called the nursing home, it being more like one than any other home of hers he had known) \n \n\u201c2012\u201d  (which was the last time he saw her) \n \n\u201cMommy loves Grandma\u201d (very true indeed) \n \nAnd he was done. \n \nMy heart just filled to the brim \u2013 that he had understood we were all sharing our experiences with his grandma and he had wanted to participate, to be a part of it, and then that he had found his own words to do so, not a scripted phrase among them. \n \nWell, I was floored, and so proud of my boy. \n \nAfter that, I honestly cannot tell you in what order people spoke. I  remember who spoke, remember their words, their stories, their love.\u00a0 I  deeply appreciated the tremendous amount of humor that everyone brought  to their stories of Mom, which was so fitting because she was such a  warm, funny, full-of-life person. \n \nMy cousins Jess and Annette spoke together, sharing what a warm and loving presence their aunt Sylvia had been in their life.  \n \nMy niece Rachel, my sister-in-law Bern, Jess's daughter Ilana, my friend Emma, my husband Danny all shared lovely memories of my mom. \n \nAnd my Uncle Walter? Brought down the house. He loved my mom, his big sister, so very much. Generally an earthy as well as intellectual man with a bawdy sense of humor, he has been ailing lately and may have been somewhat further disinhibited by medication he is taking. \n \nHe told more tales of Mom that frequently included phrases like \"and then she bedded the boss, and was soon running the joint.\" But as these were delivered in tone so clearly full of admiration for her, he had tears of laughter streaming down our faces as he filled in many details of her adventurous life, pre-Dad. \n \nWhen it was over, my friend Julie came up to me and said she absolutely wanted my uncle to deliver  her  eulogy, when the time comes. \n \nEveryone contributed their stories in what felt much more a celebration of her life than a mourning for her death. And that was exactly right. What she would have wanted. \n \nSo many people came up to me during the lox and bagels brunch in the social hall afterwards, telling me they had never been to a memorial service that was so funny, so haimish, so relaxed and enjoyable. Those that hadn't known her well - like some of my recent friends and my husband's family members - told me they felt they really got to know her. \n \nAnd that was just perfectly who Mom was: funny, warm, informal, wanting to know people and to be known.\u00a0 I feel we truly honored her that day, sharing her essence as well as her stories. \n \nI now carry this day around with me, along with all the other parts of my mother that live on forever inside me. \n \nMy mom is gone, but her love, and the love she continues to spread among those who knew her, lives on. As it should be. \n \nIt was a beautiful thing.  \n \n \n \n Mom & her brother Walter, October 2012 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MKLR_gojZoQ/UGpnAhkFadI/AAAAAAAADDU/k1U_2fz6KBg/s1600/Jake+and+Mom.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aFYNK5fKlkE/UGFuI6n45aI/AAAAAAAAC-Y/ciLm8OAL2xE/s1600/Mom+and+Uncle+Walter.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/03/a-beautiful-thing.html", "title": "\nA beautiful thing\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 15, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Baking cookies with Ethan \n \n \nYou would think from what I've written about them lately (not at all) that I didn't still have kids, so consumed has my blog been with my mother's death. \n \nBut it's perhaps because I do still have kids (two, in fact) and I so strive to be present and cheerful with them in my daily life, that I come to this space (my own) to let all the heaviness leak out. \n \nIt is nearly two months since my mother has passed and time has not stopped, not even for a second.  \n \nEthan is now in the final months of fifth grade.\u00a0 Each time I bring him to or pick him up from school, I look at the tiny kindergarteners swirling past and marvel that he was once so small and that we looked upon the \"big boys\" back then and found it unimaginable that our sweet little five year old munchkins would ever become THAT. \n \nHe is worried about the future, about middle school - both getting into the one he wants (a unique New York City problem, I know) and about what it will be like when he is actually there next year, with new faces and routines and a whole higher order of academic pressure. \n \nHe is sad that his Saturday basketball league is about to come to an end. And that the Knicks really suck right now. And that his grandma is dead. (And probably about in that order.) \n \nHe grew a whole inch in the last two months.  \n\u00a0  \nWe bake cookies together. A lot. I used to bake with my mother all the time. (Some of the recipes we use are hers.)  \n \n \n \n Jake & Belt at The Croods screening \n \n \nJake is a wonder. \n \nI went into his recent parent teacher conference with trepidation, knowing he'd had a hard time adjusting earlier this year, and what I heard brought tears to my eyes. Happy tears. \n \nThey said that all the trouble at the beginning of the year seems to be behind them. They haven't needed the behavioral plan. He doesn't work just to earn iPad time at the end of his day. He is calm, engaged, participating, and if he starts to get out of line (throwing the word \"stupid\" into every sentence, perhaps, as he is wont to do) all they have to do is threaten to separate him from the group. \n \n\"I'm sorry. I'll stop.\" he says. AND HE DOES. \n \nFurthermore, they all expressed their love for him so clearly. \"Some days I just want to take him home with me, I haven't had enough Jacob time!\" said his assistant teacher. That she already has a one year-old at home makes this doubly miraculous. \n \nJacob is having a burst of language and connection that is lovely to experience. \n \nThe other day he came into the room, uttering a very conversational \"Mom, can I talk to you for a sec?\" He stopped when he saw our cat lying upon me, purring. \"Cocoa loves you!\" he said. \n \nSO much going on in those three simple words: being interested in and observing his environment, correctly interpreting what he saw, understanding the emotions involved, and commenting on it, in original language. \n \nIf you know anything about autism, you will know how beautiful this was, indeed. \n \nHe is also actively seeking to participate in situations, after observing others doing the same. (Again, awesome!) \n \nWatching me, my friends and family sharing our memories at my mother's memorial service, he asked to go up to the podium himself, and then spoke a few very heartfelt, very appropriate words about his Grandma (more on that soon). \n \nThis past Monday I was invited to a mom-blogger family press screening of the new animated movie \"The Croods\" that Jake has been excited about since the ads and trailers for it stared popping up months ago. \n \nWe had a great time - it's a very enjoyable movie - and afterward there was a Q & A session with the\u00a0 writer/directors Kirk De Micco & Chris Sanders, and Catherine Keener - the voice of the cave-mom. After answering  The Moms'  questions, they invited kids in the audience to come down and ask some of their own.  \n \nJake and I were sitting near the back. He watched some kids ask questions about various aspects of the script or the production, he listened to the creators answer. And then he told me he wanted to go up and ask his own. \n \nWe made our way up to the front of the theater. Catherine Keener saw us standing by, and got up herself to hold the microphone for Jake as he asked: \"How did you get the idea for Belt?\" \n \n(If you want to watch Jake yourself, it's the bottom video  here  at exactly 10 minutes in. It may look like I'm prompting him, but it IS the question he told me he wanted to ask as we were waiting our turn. He just suddenly forgot it when the mike was in his hand, and I had to whisper it in his ear.) \n \nI was so proud of my (autistic) boy that day. \n \n(And every day.) \n \n \n \n Jacob, me & Catherine Keener at The Croods \n \n \nSo just in case you were worried that I had lost myself in grieving... I haven't. \n \nI try to leave it here. \n \nAnd in occasional tears on my pillow. \n \nI haven't forgotten that I have two wonderful, alive, full of life boys. \n \nAnd oh yes, a husband, too. \n \n(Hi, honey.) \n \nSo expect me to be bouncing back and forth here between mourning my mother and telling tales from all the other myriad facets of my life. \n \nI'll try to remember to throw in the good stuff as often as I can. \n \nAnd ask you to forgive if the tears outweigh the laughs for just a little while longer. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y4WKQx4DaN4/UPQP1yv77KI/AAAAAAAAEIg/_aRkYxtI5Ts/s1600/cookies.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r70uPgwgP7c/UUPsaOanzPI/AAAAAAAAEVU/2oid0YnDrMo/s1600/jake+&+belt.jpg", "http://themoms.com/mamarazzi-video-with-the-croods-and-catherine-keener/", "http://themoms.com/mamarazzi-video-with-the-croods-and-catherine-keener/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wzSO7r05WNE/UUP1zUxGeII/AAAAAAAAEVk/GGBdcZNG_uY/s1600/Jacob+&+Catherine+Keener+at+The+Croods.png"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/03/all-other-good-stuff.html", "title": "\nAll the other (good) stuff\n"},

I  almost feel guilty, so raw and fresh is my grief in having just lost my mother, that the pain of my father's passing - three years  ago - feels most pale and ghostly by comparison. \n \n \n \n Mom & Dad on his 89th birthday, 2006 \n Thankfully, the vivid memories of the horrible three months of his dying are fading, and what remains are wistful, warm memories of the loving father he was, my whole life. \n \n \n \n Me & Dad on my high school graduation day, 1977 \n \n Dad loved celebrating birthdays, and there were so many memorable parties. I traveled to Sarasota Florida for his 80th, a bash he threw at Pelican Cove - the retirement community my parents were living in. Dad was in his element, surrounded by friends and family, drinking champagne and telling stories.  \n \n \n \n Mom & Dad at his 90th birthday party, 2007 \n For his 85th, I couldn't travel - being in the middle of my pregnancy with the twins and grounded by my OB - so I threw him a party here in New York. \n \nThe cheapest space I could find turned out perfect - the local Hungarian Hall, as my dad was always proud of his Hungarian (Jewish) ancestry, even though the only words he could speak in Hungarian were \"Jo Istenem!\" (pronounced yo ishtenem, meaning \"Oh, my god!\") and something filthy taught to him by a Hungarian cook at summer camp that caused his mother to wash his mouth out with soap when he repeated it to her upon his return home.  \n\u00a0  \n \n \n Dad with daughter-in-law Bern and his 3 grandsons, 2007 \n One unfortunate consequence of having the generations in my family so  spread out, is that my children never got to know the vital, full of  life man he was, as his fading away began when they were toddlers still.  My kids' main memories of their Grandfather are of him sleeping on the  sofa through most family gatherings. Though in pictures there is  evidence of how much he enjoyed his grandsons' presence in his life. \n \n \u00a0  \nDad, you were a good man, a good father.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Me, Mom & Dad, Summer 2009 \n \n \nThree years ago, today, just after the 12th slipped into the 13th, my beloved father died. \n \nEvery year since then it has been a day of mourning and reflection for me, becoming a little less intense with each passing year, but still the ache remained acute. \n \nBut this year, today felt very odd, eclipsed by my mother's much more recent passing - nearly two months ago on January 17th.  \n \nMy mother's death still hangs over me, feels much more recent still than two months. \n \nIf I close my eyes and think of her, I am, unfortunately, transported back to the final minutes of her life. That moment when her heart snapped and everything changed is burned deep into my mind's screen, sharp and bright, hopefully to be fading in intensity over the coming years. \n \nBut for now I remain somewhat ghost-ridden. \n \nI regretted not being there, by my father's side as he passed. I had taken my first break in months, and many people told me that they think that allowed him to finally let go, that my absence was giving him permission to die. \n \nMaybe. \n \nHe managed to do it quietly, with no one there to witness.\u00a0 My sister Lois had gone to the bathroom down the hall, and said she felt a wave of heat and nausea pass over her, out of nowhere, at what she later calculated was probably the moment of his leaving, for when she came back into his room, he was gone, my mother unaware, fallen asleep sitting upright in the chair by his side. \n \nAt the time I felt like had missed out on something. \n \nNow I'm not so sure. \n \nThe look on my mother's face as her eyes popped open, bugged out, unseeing, as she huffed and puffed as her heart was literally bursting, is something that will probably haunt me for the rest of my days. \n \nI can talk about it most freely with my cousin Jessica, who, as an ER doctor, is no stranger to death. Other people I know I will creep out, make uncomfortable, so I hold this moment silently, in my mind and heart. But there it remains, indelible, most every day. \n \nEven today, when I feel I should be remembering, mourning my father, yet still, my mother and her death hangs over all. \n \nThough it is comforting to think back on the two of them at the same time, for they were such an entwined and loving couple. Fifty one years together.  \n \nI don't know where our spirit, our essence, goes when we pass. Truly I don't. I feel something remains, for I felt it leave my mother, witnessed how her body was just so much lumpen clay after it was gone. \n \nAnd so, in the not knowing, I can only conjecture and hope that whatever wisp of energy that was my bright mother has found my father's counterpart out there, in the ethosphere, and their stardust particles are swirling about the universe in tandem, dancing together once more, forever. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RwYo0Pp0vP0/TB7RfhyFZrI/AAAAAAAAADA/OlsL6LGhUo8/s1600/V+%2526+parents.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/03/three-years-and-nearly-two-months.html", "title": "\nThree Years (and nearly two months)\n"},

{"date": "Monday, February 11, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n Me & my parents, 1962 \n \n \n \n \nSecond time around and I'm realizing... each mourning is different. A mother is not a father, and the missing manifests  in different places in my body, in my life. \n \nAnd then there's the fact that it's both of them gone now, and as an only child I am thusly the sole surviving member of my nuclear family. The only one who knows, who remembers our own particular family's micro-culture... what we ate; what we sang; what we said to each other to greet the day, to bid goodnight;  what we liked to do on long summer days, on starry winter nights.  \n \nThe people that brought me into this world are gone. Elvis has left the building. And while it's ridiculous to think of myself as an orphan at 52, with all the attendant images of storm-tossed waifs and wide eyed boys in desperate need of mothering, there it is - that term - popping into my brain at odd intervals.  \n \n\"You're a member of the orphans club now... so sorry.\"  says my friend, softly. My dear friend, Rachel,  who I do not think I could have gotten through these three weeks without, is herself a long-time member, the edges of her pain blunted, but never quite extinguished.  \n \nAnd I don't know how this would feel if I'd had a conflicted, difficult relationship with my parents. My guess is both easier and harder. More relief, more longing, less simple loss and keen missing. But it's all conjecture.  \n \nI had these parents: a pair of interesting people who loved me much and well. They were kind and generous and  never withholding in their love. It was unconditional and freely given. I always knew I was both loved and accepted.  \n \nAnd now, of course, that spigot is shut off. Gone. \n \nAs much as my children and husband may love me - and they do, as much comfort as that brings me - and it does, it is not the same as the way my mother's eyes lit up as I entered the room, thrilled by my mere existence, my simple proximity to her.  \n \nAnd I know how lucky I am to have had that. I know far too many who have never known this kind of love. And I know that at times in my younger life I have felt burdened, smothered by this love, for yes there was some neediness on her part in there, too. But that has all washed out, years ago now, water long passed under all the bridges. \n \nAnd what I am left with is a wistful aching, memories that are both fond and painful because the wound of losing her is still so fresh and new. Everywhere I go, everything I light upon, I find traces of her. \u00a0And I find so much evidence that so much of who I am has come down from her. \n \nI am in the dentist's chair and the radio is tuned to the classical music station. \u00a0Beethoven's 6th symphony comes on (the \"Pastorale\") and I find myself conducting with my idle hands. \"Oh, you know this one?\" he asks, surprised, explaining that he usually has the radio tuned to classic rock but his previous patient expressed a strong preference for WQXR. \n \n\"Yes,\" I tell him, after I have spat blood and grit into the tiny sink, \"it was my mother's favorite symphony, she played it often in my childhood.\"  \n \n\"Sorry,\" he says, knowing my news, \"that must be painful.\" But somehow it isn't. It instead fills my heart to the brim with gratefulness that my mother passed on her love of music, that she shared with me, her child, the things that brought her joy, and that their beauty lives on in me now.  \n \nMy mother always liked the springtime best. Whenever I spot the first yellowing blooms bursting from the branches of the forsythia bushes that line Central Park's transverse passages, I am possessed by the urge to share this vision with my mother. Golden harbinger of spring,  forsythia made my mother deliriously, unreasonably happy. \n \nI am prepared for the mix of heartbreak and bittersweet pleasure this spring will bring, as each fresh round of blossoming unfolds. \n \nAnd now Mom has managed to derail her winter's memorial service, which had been due to be held this past Sunday. She has somehow summoned an icy February Frankenstorm to come upon us, necessitating  the postponement of her ceremony; kicking it down the calendar into late winter or early spring. \n \nForsythia season  for sure.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8wzBYX94u-c/TB7R0CgcS9I/AAAAAAAAADI/FaZPuEcPHok/s1600/jim+Syl+Varda+1962.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/02/each-mourning-is-different.html", "title": "\nEach mourning is different\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 27, 2013", "body": "\n \n \nIn the dark of a too early morning, I crack open the door of the boys' bedroom to wake Jacob, still deeply under, in the top bunk. \n \nI entreat him to rise with whispers, remind him to stay quiet himself, so as not to awaken his brother, asleep below, as he sits up uttering his usual first word of the day \u201cStupid.\u201d  \n \n\u201cJacob\u2026\u201d I whisper-scold. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t say the bad word\u201d he repeats in a singsong voice. \n \n\u201cShhhhhhh.\u201d I remind, again.  And in a louder, more urgent whisper  \u201cCome down now, Baby, the bus will be here in a half hour and it won\u2019t wait, you have to get ready for school.\u201d \n \n\u201cStupid\u201d says Jacob, one more time, as he lumbers down the ladder, his ancient blue bear firmly clutched in one hand.  \n \nThen, at the bottom: \u201cCan I have a hug, Mommy?\u201d \n \nAnd thus begins our day.  \n \nBy the time Ethan is up - after three visits to his bedroom, progressing from a cheerful \u201cgood morning\u201d through a gentle shoulder shake, the flashing on and off of lights, the radio blasting an obnoxious rock station and the (idle) threat of a cold water dousing \u2013 Jacob is long gone, sent off with a kiss onto his long bus ride to his wonderful Special-Ed school on the far, other (lower, East) side of town. \n \n(I try not to think about it too much, because it makes me sad when I do, but, yes, my boys, my twins - due to luck, genetics, a whim of the gods of autism & neurodiversity, and probably something I ate or didn\u2019t eat when I was seventeen - lead very separate lives.) \n \nEthan and I talk, always; words his currency, as they are mine. \n \nWe talk a lot or a little, depending in the day. Did the Knicks win last night? How about the Nets? Chatting away through breakfast eaten,  lunch made, bags packed.  \n \nSome days I take Ethan to school, yet others I send him walking with the neighbors, two boisterous boys whose testosterone-filled company he favors lately.  \n \nAlready he has begin to resist my goodbye kisses when others are present. \"Mooooooom\" he protests as I hand him over in the lobby, though I know tonight he will still curl up into my lap as we watch the game together, after homework has been done (please God, let the homework get done without torture tonight). \n \n \n<*> <*> <*>  \n \nAnd then I am alone, with too much to do, but no heart for any of it. \n \nI  am supposed to be writing my mother's eulogy right now. With the snow delaying her memorial service,  I have had a long time to accomplish this seeming simple task, even longer to contemplate it, as I knew, bone deep, that the end was coming soon.   \n \nAnd yet I just... cannot. Words are failing me. \n \nI wrote a beautiful eulogy for my father. Poured all my love and crystal knowledge of who he was into it.   \n \nBut my mother... my mother.. my mother... \n \nAll I want to do is keen and cry. \n \nIn spite of so many words spilling out of me immediately after her death, I am now experiencing my grief in a visceral, animal way.   \n \nI am angry, bereft, pained; and in no space to make pretty words of it. For even at the very end, drifting away from her memories, from the shaped, sharpened form of herself, my mother was still filled with light and love. \n \nAnd when we held hands the bond between us thrummed, strong as the day that I was born and we became mother and daughter.  \n \nMy mother was unwavering in her love, and the space it took up in me is now dark, hollow, memory's embers being a paltry substitute for the heat of a living presence. \n \nAnd there has been, yet, barely time to mourn, so filled are my days with the minutia of things that must be done; mountains of laundry and paperwork; all the threads that I dropped when constantly dashing off to my mother's bedside must now be gathered and stitched back in, the fabric of my life holey, like tattered lace.  \n \n \n<*> <*> <*> \n \nThe boys mourn my mother, each in their own way. \n \n\"I see Grandma, in my brain\" says Jake. And I am never sure if that means to him what it does to me. He still asks to go see her sometimes, the concept of death as a permanent state being perhaps too abstract for him to fully grasp.  \n \nEthan and I bake blueberry muffins, Mom's perennial favorite. No matter how low her spirits or appetite, I could always entice her to eat a blueberry muffin and a cup of hot cocoa.  \n \nCome to think of it, we're drinking a lot of cocoa, too. \n \nMom... \n \nI raise my mug to you. \n \n \n \n Mom, enjoying cocoa & a muffin with me, December, 2011 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hfd9Rql_mY8/TtYxWdrKavI/AAAAAAAABD4/KNJTBAM6MWo/s1600/Mom+%2526+hot+chocolate.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/02/the-view-from-here.html", "title": "\nThe view from here\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n Mom and her brother, Walter, November 2012 \n \nMy mother was one of those special people, beloved by nearly everyone she met.  \n \nShe had a warmth, a natural curiosity about people. Spend five minutes with her and she'd know your life story, the names of your children and where your ancestors came from. \n \nShe was also genuinely gracious, sincerely grateful to everyone for everything done for her. \n \nIn the hospital, in her very last days, she even whispered a \"Thank you\"  to the nurse giving her a shot of vitamin K. The nurse turned to me, her face alight, and told me she had never been thanked before for giving a patient an injection. \n \nThat was Mom. \n \n \n \n Mom & me, Mothers Day 2012 \n \nThe staff at the nursing home were shocked when I called to give them the news. \"Oh, no! Not our DDF!\" they all cried. \n \nThat was her particular nomenclature: I have been her D.D.D. for years - Dear, Darling Daughter\u00a0 - (and she my D.D.M.). And the women who looked after her at the home had become her D.D.F. -\u00a0 Dear, Darling Friends. \n \nMy father, as much as he loved his family, was defined by his life's work: his photography. \n \nMy mother, like so many women (especially of her generation), was defined by her relationships, the people she loved and who loved her.

At Carnegie East House, the assisted living community she had moved into with my father, and where she continued to live as a widow until her disastrous, hip-breaking fall last May, she had two close friends of a similar temperament: smart, funny, artistic, literate, left-leaning and bohemian. Not your typical \"little old ladies\" by any stretch of the imagination. \n \nThey called themselves \"The 3 Musketeers\" and took every opportunity to laugh at the foibles of old age and their situation, vowing not to become like some of the farbissinas* at the joint. \n \n \n \n Mom and her friends at Carnegie East, 2011 \n \nThe reason I chose the specific facility I did for mom's rehab stint (which then became her permanent nursing home) was that at the time, my Aunt Eva, her sister-in-law, was herself rehabbing there, as it was less than a mile from her Port Washington home. \n \n \n \n Mom & Eva at the nursing home, June 2012 \n \nEven after Eva returned home, being so close to mom's brother Walter meant that he visited often, allowing them to spend much time in the last few months of her life.

Read again, it seems like so much more than two years ago I wrote all that, three years ago I entered this, the blogging life. \n \nFor in these three years I have found an amazing, supportive community, of which I had not even a glimmer of a hint of its existence before I fell headlong into it. Within this, of course, many sub-groups make up my community... the special-needs-parent-bloggers, my fellow  LTYM -ers, my former SV Mom's Blog group, my \"3rd wave\" blogging cohort who began around the same time I did -  Alexandra , I'm talking YOU here, baby! - to name just a few. \n \nAnd this \"village\" (as well as my incredible circle of \"real life\" friends & family) has buoyed and sustained me through so much that I have gone through in these three years since. \n \nRight now I'm in the middle of the muddle of my grief, and having a hard time pulling anything from it. In the first few days the words tumbled out of me. I was writing my way through the sorrow, as rough and as raw as ground meat. \n \nI even wrote that \"This is the only way I know how to do it.\" \n \nBut then I stopped knowing that, caught up in the paperwork of it all and the thousand stinging nettles of the minutia of my daily life that continued on apace, in spite of the beast howling in my chest, mother-lost. \n \nI am struggling to find my voice again.  \n \nAlso? \n \nI am bewildered. \n \nWho am I now that I am no longer sandwiched? I have lost a full generation.  \n \nI suppose... I suppose I will need to change the name of my blog soon, \"Sandwich Generation\" no longer properly defining me. (Putting that on the back-burner, not ready to think about it yet.) \n \nBut for now here I am, an open-faced sandwich (though still rather squashed), entering my fourth year of doing this, living my life out loud in the inter-web-verse. \n \nWriting my way through the grief, through the sorrow, through the pain and the healing. \n \nBecause it's the only way I know how to do it. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc/", "http://www.gooddayregularpeople.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/02/its-my-blogs-birthday-and-ill-cry-if-i.html", "title": "\nIt's my blog's birthday and I'll cry if I want to.\n"},

A total mess, ten days on now. \n \nWait, it's eleven. Soon it will be two weeks. Soon it will be the memorial service come upon us. \n \nAnd I have a eulogy to write. Photos to dig up. \n \nMom's ashes to collect. (I got the call today, but I couldn't; I just... couldn't. Not yet. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe if Dan comes with me.) \n \nI have so much to do; so much todotodotodotodoooooo. \n \nAnd I want to do absolutely nothing. \n \nTo stand still, frozen, like a winter tree, just being for a moment; no leaves, no flowers, no pesky photons to synthesize from. Just standing; my roots dug in, holding me up. Life still flowing at my core, but you wouldn't know it from looking at me. \n \nI flip, like a flopping, water starved fish on deck, back and forth back and forth: I want to be left alone / I have to be with people.\u00a0 From minute to minute I never know what I'll need. \n \nI go see friends then run away and hide in the bathroom. I banish everyone from the house, then frantically call my cousins to talk. \n \nWhen my father died, I had to take care of my mother, to be there for her. I had her to mourn with; I had Bruce and Lois, my father's other children from his first marriage, by my side, making all these terrible arrangements together.  \n \nBut I am my mother's only child, and she is the second parent gone. So there is no one else. Just me. I am the sole surviving member of the nuclear family of my birth. \n \n(And yes, there is the family I chose, the family I made, and I thank the heavens every day for their existence. But it's still not the same.) \n \nI feel greedy and selfish taking time away from my family to mourn, from my children who need me as much today as they did two weeks ago. And yet even here I am hardly here, translucent, worn thin as the cotton of my mother's ancient favorite nightgown. \n \n(More sad tasks on my list: drive out to Long Island to retrieve her boxed-up final belongings from the nursing home. And then what do I do with her teeth? Her hearing aid? I can neither throw them into the trash nor keep them.) \n \nI took her glasses from her face in the hospital ER, promised to give them back when she was up to the task of reading again. I carry them around still in my pocketbook, come upon them when fishing for change and keys. \n \nI put them on though they blur my vision, not cure it. \n \nI want to see through her eyes; I want to see her clearly.  \n \nI want the sadness of the last, broken, lonely months of her life to wash away in all my tears. I want to remember the woman who loved birds and cats and babies and champagne and modern art and handmade things and the Chrysler Building in all its art deco glory. The woman who reveled in the crystalline beauty of the natural world. \n \nThe woman who loved ME so deeply, so fiercely, so freely; who loved me as only a mother can love a child. \n \nI whisper in my children's ears (now, mostly while they are asleep): \"I will always be your mother, and I will always love you.\"  \n \nShe taught me to love like that, my one and only mother. \n \nMe, her one and only child. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iCcY3olsnS0/UFmHokDYD2I/AAAAAAAAC4w/u4WrRcTvTEc/s1600/Me,+very+ill.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/2013/01/28/just-write-70/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/nothing-about-this-is-easy.html", "title": "\nNothing about this is easy\n"},

And thus I snapped away.  \n \n \n \n \nI captured her in her many moods: happy, sad, contemplative, playful, lost, loving, sleepy - often sleepy. But always beautiful. And always her own unique self, an iconoclast, not just another garden-variety old lady, for sure. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe folks who worked in the nursing home grew to love my mother, were deeply grieved to hear she was gone. \"She was one of a kind\" they said, and it's true.  \n \n \n \n Mom, September \n \n \n \n Out for a drive, October, 2012 \n \n \nThis weekend it was very hard for me to look at pictures of my mother. They made me so sad. I kept thinking: \"This is it. There will be no more photos\" and, even, harder, \"I will never see her again, except in these pictures and memory.\" \n \n \n \n Mom, September 14th, 2012 \n \nBut I wanted to finish this post, share these pictures of the last months of my mother's life.

{"date": "Friday, January 25, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Mom and me, August 1960 \n \n \nNinety years, four months, fifteen days. \n \nThat was my mother's allotted time on this earth. \n \nFifty two years, five months, seven days. \n \nThat was how long we had together.  \n \nAnd now... one week apart. \n \n(And yes we have spent many, many days, months, years, separated in this time, sometimes by continents, sometimes by oceans, sometimes just by emotions - adolescence, anyone? - and yet... and yet... we were always, somehow, still THERE with each other, connected by that invisible, permanent, virtual umbilicus that binds mother to child; infinitely expandable, invincibly endurable.) \n \nI remember the first time I truly contemplated the impact of my parents' demise. I was relatively young, still - my late twenties. No husband, no kids, a very different life. \n \nI was in the midst of many exciting happenings - though for the life of me now I couldn't tell you what they all were. I dimly recall I was deep into rehearsing a play (as assistant director and stage manager) and being on my way home from a rehearsal up on the Columbia campus. \n \nI was driving, flying down Riverside Drive and wanting to call and tell my folks about how well things were going, about plans that were afoot. And I couldn't.  \n \nThey were traveling at the time, far, far away on the greatest adventure they had ever undertaken. They were in Bali, in a little village, inland, upland - Ubud I believe it was called. And there was no way to phone. I knew the name of the guest house they were staying at, and of the proprietor, but this would do me no good.  \n \nThere was ONE telephone in the whole town, in the \"telephone house\" and it was only to be used in case of dire emergency, which this was not. And it was only available in the daytime hours between ten and six, which, with the fourteen hour time difference, this most certainly was not, either.  \n \nMy parents had never been so completely inaccessible to me and for so long (it was nearly a month's trip) and I felt frustrated by my inability to speak with them. \n \nAnd then my stomach dropped and I started to cry. Because this thought rang out in my head: \"This is what it will be like when they are dead. Only it won't just be for a few weeks, it will be forever.\" \n \nAnd as the feelings washed over me, I sobbed and sobbed, thankfully alone in my car, then pulled myself together, feeling grateful for the temporary nature of our separation. \n \nAnd yes, we had many more years together, my parents and I. \n \nAnd yes, by the end it was their diminished capacity for cognition that was keeping me from sharing all the ups and down of my life with them; the strong, care-taking parents of my twenties so long gone as to be nearly recognizable. \n \nBut still, through it all, we were connected; their love of me a constant, never-questioned core. \n \nAnd now the umbilicus is sundered, existing only as a phantom limb, aching in spite of its absence. \n \nAnd I can visit with my mother (and father) only in memory. \n \nAnd dreams. \n \nSo perhaps, though it is 4AM and I will need to be up in two hours to care for my own children, I should try, once again, hopefully successfully this time, to sleep. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8A2groFc6_M/TMRoMEWkdZI/AAAAAAAAAK0/w2tDFspfcY0/s1600/Me+11+days+300gcrp.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/ninety-years-four-months-fifteen-days.html", "title": "\nNinety years, four months, fifteen days\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 3, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Mom, Thanksgiving 2012 \n \n \nToday, Sunday March 3rd, we held a memorial service for my mother, Sylvia  Steinhardt, who died in January.\u00a0 We celebrated her interesting,\u00a090  year long life, and we said goodbye. \n \nIn attendance were my husband and kids, my mother's 85 year old \"kid\" brother and his family, my brother Bruce (Sylvia's step-son) and most of his family, plus many friends, in-laws, and a pair of dear old friends of my parents, nearly the last surviving members of that once-large clan. \n \nPhotos from various points of my mother's life were on display. Anyone who wished to share a memory of Syl was invited to speak, and quite a few did, including both of my sons. \n \nBut first I read a blog post ( found here ) written immediately after, and about Mom's dying moments.\u00a0 And then I read this eulogy: \n \nThe day before she died, the cardiologist who first met my mom in the ER a few days prior came in to her room to speak with me. \"When you said her aortic stenosis was critical you weren't kidding. It was SUPER critical. In fact\" - he added, clearly quite impressed - \"I have never seen anyone with such a tight valve still alive and so asymptomatic... That's some heart your mother has!\" \n \nAnd I say yes! That was some heart my mother had.    \n \nIn fact I would say it was her defining feature: My mother\u2019s capacity to love and be loved. Her big generous, open heart, and how many hearts she lives on in will be her defining legacy.  \n \nShe had a warmth, a natural curiosity about people. Spend five minutes with her and she'd know your life story, the names of your children (or parents, or both) and where your ancestors came from. \n \nShe was also genuinely gracious, sincerely grateful to everyone for everything done for her. \n \nIn the hospital, in her very last days, she even whispered a \"Thank you\" to the nurse giving her a shot of vitamin K. The nurse turned to me, her face alight, and told me she had never been thanked before for giving a patient an injection. \n \nThat was Mom. \n \nMy father, as much as he loved his family, was defined by his life's work: his photography. \n \nMy mother, like so many women (especially of her generation), was defined by her relationships, the people she loved and who loved her. And at this she excelled, oh so well. \n \nMom made friends everywhere she went. At Carnegie East House, the assisted living community she had moved into with my father, and where she continued to live as a widow until her disastrous, hip-breaking fall last May, she had two close friends of a similar temperament: smart, funny, artistic, literate, left-leaning and bohemian. Not your typical \"little old ladies\" by any stretch of the imagination. \n \nThey called themselves \"The 3 Musketeers\" and took every opportunity to laugh at the foibles of old age and their situation, vowing not to become like some of the farbissinas* at the joint. \n \nThe staff at the nursing home where Mom spent the last six months of her life were shocked when I called to give them the news of her passing. \"Oh, no! Not our DDF!\" they all cried. \n \nThat was her particular nomenclature: I have been her D.D.D. for years - Dear, Darling Daughter  - (and she my D.D.M.). And the women who looked after her at the home had become her D.D.F. - Dear, Darling Friends. \n \nIt was somehow fitting that nursing home where my mother spent the last six months of her life at was back on her beloved Long Island - a place that defined and encompassed so much of her life - where she grew up, held her first jobs, where she raised her family - me - where she came into her own as Sylvia Steinhardt of Steinhardt Gallery.  \n \nAs she was living in the same community as her brother Walter - Port Washington \u2013 they were able to spend much time together at the end. His visits, and those of his children \u2013 my cousins \u2013 and their children, brought her so much pleasure.  \n \nWhenever I would visit, she would point out the flowers brightening up her nightstand. \u201cAren\u2019t these lovely, Walter always brings flowers, he is so good to me.\u201d \n \nWhat was amazing about Mom was that this kindness, this deeply loving nature was found in a woman also funny and complex, sophisticated and keenly intelligent.  How intelligent? \n \nWhen I was about ten, Mom decided she wanted to take some classes at Nassau community college. Since she had never been to college, she started with Freshman English. For her final paper, did a study on how the classic English ballads changed when they came to America that included an amazing analysis and an audio tape recording of both Peter, Paul and Mary\u2019s and Led Zeppelin\u2019s version of Hangman. It was graduate level work... for a Freshman English class. Needless to say the professor was stunned. (She got an A+.) \n \nI was sometimes sad thinking of what my mother could have done, might have been if she had grown up in a family that valued girls and thought them worthy of higher education, but sadly, that wasn\u2019t the case. \n \nMy grandmother valued WORK and MAKING MONEY, and so that\u2019s what my mother did, after graduating high school, finding a job in a furniture store, then coming to work at her family\u2019s candy shop afterwards in the evenings.  \n \nShortly thereafter, the US entered WWII, and mom found herself joining the throngs of other young women swept up in war work\u2026 yes, my mom was a Rosie the Riveter. \n \nShe worked at Grumman Aircraft in small airplane parts through the war. And I remember feeling terribly proud of my mother for doing this, when I became aware of how brave and radical that was. \n \nAfter that, mom began to work in clerical positions, eventually to become a top fundraiser for the Joint Defense Appeal \u2013 the fundraising arm of the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League. \n \nThis job was in THE CITY, where Mom had finally left her parents home and moved to, with the help of a good therapist, and much to her mother\u2019s dismay (the shanda of an unmarried daughter leaving home having kept my mother bound there too long before she finally broke free). \n \nAt this point my mother began an exciting phase of living her own life: going to museums, plays, films, listening to jazz, dating interesting men \u2013 including William Styrone\u2019s roommate - (and even living with one for a while). But she still hadn\u2019t found her one true love. \n \nThat she finally did in the summer of 1958, at a resort in the Berkshires called The Music Inn, where my father, recently divorced, was also vacationing.  They met, sparks ignited, they discovered that they lived mere blocks away from each other in Greenwich Village.   \n \nVowing to play it cool and go slow, they then proceeded to see each other every day, becoming inseparable as soon as they got home to the city. And in a few short months, on March 1st, 1959, they married. \n \nAnd then, things changed, rapidly. My father had two teenage children from his previous marriage \u2013 my brother Bruce and sister Lois \u2013 and immediately after my folks married, my Dad\u2019s ex-wife had to leave the country for almost a year (it\u2019s complicated \u2013 don\u2019t ask), and left the kids with them. \n \nA friend of my mother\u2019s had joked that in marrying my father, she has gone from swinging single gal in the Village, to matronly mother of teenage kids on the Upper West Side in one fell swoop. \n \nAnd that wasn\u2019t far from the truth. Furthermore by the time Bruce and Lois had returned to their mother\u2019s home, Mom was pregnant herself\u2026 with me.  \n \nMy mother loved being pregnant, had wanted a child of her own for a long time, and had been unsure if she would even be able to have one at the unheard of old age \u2013 for that time \u2013 of 37. \n \nShe loved to tell me stories from her pregnancy \u2013 of how she had gained so much weight right off the bat, that when she, at 5 months along, went to the maternity ward to visit my Aunt Eva and see her new niece \u2013 my cousin Jessie, someone said to her \u201cI know who\u2019s going got have her baby tonight!\u201d  \n \nHow, while absentmindedly crossing Broadway against the light, a truck driver had yelled out to her: \u201cHey Lady, watch where you\u2019re going, you know you can get knocked DOWN, too!\u201d \n \nAnd THAT is classic mom \u2013 having a great sense of humor. As well as a tendency to curse like a sailor.  Salty as well as sweet. \n \nHer humor - and her cursing \u2013 stayed with her, through to the end.  When she was in acute rehab, trying to heal from her broken hip, she was working on walking down the hall with a walker. It was hard. She was weak and tired and in pain and the therapists were pushing her to take a few more steps.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d She complained. \u201cI just want to sit down, can\u2019t I fucking sit down?\u201d   \n \n\u201cSylvia\u2026\u201d said the therapist with a disapproving tone of voice.  \n \n\u201cOh.\u201d Said my mother \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to curse.\u201d \n \n\u201cYes\u201d said the therapist,  \n \n\u201cIt upsets the other patients.\u201d Said my mother. \n \n\u201cYes!\u201d the therapist chirped, glad she was \u201cgetting it.\u201d \n \n\u201cOK\u201d Mom said. Then with PERFECT timing that would have made a borsht belt comedian proud, she added, under her breath: \u201cFuck \u2018em\u201d \n \nIn this she and my very funny father were well matched. In fact they were well matched in nearly everything, a true pair of soul-mates, bonded by a love that burned bright to the very end.   \n \nShe took such loving care of my father as he was failing, he the center of her life, her anchor. It was not easy to be with him in those last, plummeting, months, when he was so difficult, drifting & out of rationality. But Mom made sure to only curse him out when her back was turned to him so that, deaf, he would have no idea.  \n \nAfter Dad passed, Mom missed him fiercely. She frequently teared up thinking about him, telling me yet again and again: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t just my husband he was my best friend.\u201d \n \nAnd they had had a good life. They LOVED to travel, and for twenty years - after I left home and before they became too frail - they explored the world together. Mom and Dad took trips to Greece, Hungary, Italy, Turkey, Alaska, Mexico, Trinidad, Israel, and Bali - to name a few places on their expansive itinerary. \n \nAnd, true to their nature, these were not your standard touristy tours of national monuments.  Because my parents were genuinely interested in other people and cultures they went deep into the hearts of these places, seeking out the spots the locals frequented, letting themselves enter into the true spirit of journeying.  \n \nEven when they took tours, these were folk dance tours, and they involved going to small villages, learning the local dances from the people who lived there, then joining hands and joyously dancing together with them.   \n \nWhat afforded them these wonderful trips was that the family business, Steinhardt Gallery, had finally become incredibly successful - the move from Westbury to Huntington perfectly timed to coincide with the resurgence of Huntington\u2019s downtown. \n \nEarlier I had said that Mom was defined by her relationships, and yet that is not entirely true. She was also defined by and hugely proud of The Steinhardt Gallery - that she had been a part of, as my father\u2019s partner, since the beginning. It was where both Mom\u2019s impeccable taste and people skills could come together and flourish. \n \nShe loved being surrounded by and dealing with beautiful things, She loved getting to know and interact with the craftspeople she bought from, the customers \u2013 who often became friends, and the staff, who became an extended family. \n \nIn fact, my parents really ran the business like a family, in a good way. Everyone who worked there, and all the artisans they dealt with were treated with fairness and respect, and, always, warmth and humor.  \n \nMy mother loved the fact that she was not just Sylvia Steinhardt but Sylvia Steinhardt of Steinhardt Gallery. And it always made her day when someone would either recognize her or the name of the gallery when they were far from home \u2013 on a cruise up the Alaskan coast for example, or on a Caribbean island. \u201cOh,\u201d they would say \u201dI LOVE that place, all my favorite gifts come from there.\u201d And Mom would just beam. \n \nAnd I loved being a part of the Gallery, too. Growing up in a family business meant being intimately connected with my parents working lives in a way that folks whose parents go \u201coff to the office\u201d can never be.  \n \nThis is one thread in the fabric of the close relationship I had with my mother. She loved children and being a mother. She included me in her life, sharing her passions with me, telling me her stories and listening to mine.  \n \nI remember countless trips to art museums; watching classic Japanese movies on channel 13, snuggled together on the sofa; Mom teaching me how to Lindy in the kitchen during a nostalgia craze in my high school years. \n \nAnd now, everywhere I go, everything I light upon, I find traces of her.  And I find evidence that so much of who I am has come down from her. \n \nRecently, I found myself in the dentist's chair, the radio tuned to the classical music station.  Beethoven's 6th symphony came on (the \"Pastorale\") and I found myself conducting with my hands. \"Oh, you know this one?\" my dentist asked, surprised, explaining that he usually has the radio tuned to classic rock but his previous patient expressed a strong preference for WQXR. \n \n\"Yes,\" I told him, \"it was my mother's favorite symphony, she played it often in my childhood.\"  \n \n\"Sorry,\" he apologized, knowing of my recent loss, \"that must be painful.\" But somehow it wasn't. It instead filled my heart to the brim with gratefulness that my mother had passed on her love of music, that she had shared with me, her child, all the things that brought her joy, and that their beauty lives on in me now.  \n \nAs much joy as Mom found in parenthood, she found that joy doubled as a grandmother, seeing her feelings replicated in me. She loved watching me revel in my own children, yet another bond between us: we were both mothers. \n \nMom also just flat out loved being a grandmother, first to my brother Bruce\u2019s children, Rachel and Simon, and then recently to my twin boys, Ethan and Jacob. \n \nShe never happier than when holding her baby grandsons, rocking them to sleep.  When they were toddlers, Mom always got down on the floor to play with them (even though with her bad knees she needed help to get back up afterwards) and seemed as delighted in building a block tower or putting together the pieces of a simple puzzle as the boys did. \n \nDelight. That\u2019s a word that describes mom\u2019s enthusiastic response to so much in life. Not that she didn\u2019t have her dark days, but she was always pulled back to the light by her passions. \n \nMom loved, among many other things, and in no particular order: people, purple, chocolate, art, nature, the ocean, lox and bagels, chocolate, Birkenstocks, a good joke, flowers, family, birds, dogs, cats - in general and Willie, her last cat, in particular, The Steinhardt Gallery, seltzer, handmade things, chocolate, Scandinavian furniture, travel, folk dancing, bird watching, African violets, Art Nouveau, word puzzles, artichokes, lobster, Maine, Long Island, music, poetry, Paul Klee, Shakespeare, Broadway Musicals, modern dance, champagne, hugs, Sunday mornings, babies, silver jewelry, the Chrysler building, chocolate, her husband Jim, children \u2013 in general, and Me, her child, in particular. \n \nShe loved me in a way that left no smidgen of doubt. She loved me so deeply, so freely: as a mother loves her children \u2013 with pride and acceptance and gratefulness for my mere existence.  \n \nI whisper in my children's ears (now, mostly while they are asleep): \"I will always be your mother, and I will always love you.\"  \n \nShe taught me to love like that, my one and only mother. \n \nAnd I loved her in return, fiercely. \n \nAnd I miss her every day. \n \n \n (p.s.

She had been drifting all morning, not really speaking to me, but rather mumbling  dream answers to questions only she could hear. \n \nShe would not open her  eyes, and when she did they fluttered for a moment then clamped shut  again. \n \nAfter having spent nights in her room (or sofa surfing with nearby friends) when she was clearly in immanent danger, I had just begun returning home to sleep.

My face was right before you, but you were not seeing me. You felt your heart unwind. \n \nI cried out, a sob torn from my chest, cast wildly about the room for someone to do something for just one beat of my own heart, then remembered there was nothing to be done, but bearing witness. \n \nI turned back to you, held your hand tight as your grip went lax, eyes slammed shut, then sunk further inwards. I placed my right palm upon your forehead, but all the heat that had been there, bright your thoughts, your spirit, had already flashed away. \n \nYour breathing slowed, caught, hitched, came as an afterthought.  \n \nYou were leaving me. You were nearly gone. \n \nI had told you it was okay to go, had whispered in your ear that I knew how tired you were, how in need of rest and cessation of pain, of peace. Had given you my permission to go. \n \nI wanted to take it all back, to beg you to stay. \n \nBut it was too late. \n \nThe visible pulse jumping in your neck quieted, and quieted again. \n \nYour last breath was so small, barely a breath at all. \n \nAnd you were free. \n \n \n*** \n \nMom... \n \nfrom beautiful little girl... \n \n \n \n Mom as a five year old flower girl at an Aunt's wedding, 1928  \n \n \nto beautiful old lady... \n \n \n \n Mom, Thanksgiving 2012 \n \n \n \nyou were always a class act, my dear darling mother, your own unique self. \n \nKnow that you live on now and forever in me and my sons.  \n \nThank you for everything, Mom. \n \nAnd rest in peace.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Oubwxzu08NU/TLzqkN7cE6I/AAAAAAAAAJo/DpCaJPlJDq8/s1600/Mom+%2526+me+3+mo+c.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T4AnajnqCo4/TMImwnUTT_I/AAAAAAAAAKI/OSFuh3NRGwU/s1600/MomFlowergirl300Crp.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s8UT6wteozQ/ULdBdHghM9I/AAAAAAAADv8/FthB-xnX6ac/s1600/IMG_6249.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/sylvia-steinhardt-september-2-1922.html", "title": "\nSylvia Steinhardt: September 2, 1922 - January 17, 2013 \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 17, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nAgainst all odds, my mother is still here, among the living. \n \nShe struggled through her touch and go night, and then swung more up than down throughout the few days since. \n \nI have stayed at her side or close by, fearing a call saying \"Hurry now, she's turned for the worst.\" But it has not come. \n \nShe is ill still; weak, and broken-boned. The heart still gallops, controlled by medicine's drip, drip, drip into her arm. Her blood is still hosting hostile invaders, though fewer, we believe, than in the depth of her illness. \n \nAnd yet, she had returned from the brink. No longer at the precipice of \"multi-organ failure\" her liver and kidneys are back in the job; her lungs and heart, though diminished, have not thrown in the towel. \n \nShe gains strength slowly, minute by minute. I watch the clock tick by with her heartbeats, the monitor screen my Rosetta Stone, translating her complex body into simple numbers I can witness the rise and fall of. \n \nWith these I can infer trajectories; legitimize hope. When her O2 sats at 99, *I* breathe easier. \n \nEverything in such a delicate equilibrium, we are all tiptoeing around her, afraid to do too much and send the scales wildly tilting again. \n \nAnd yet things must be done: IVs changed, oxygen delivered, blood pressure measured, pain medicine given. Most painful of all: her position shifted, so as not to develop bedsores. With every move her unset bones dig into her flesh from the inside, scream warnings of pain the drugs can only dull, not eliminate. \n \nAlso? She must eat. Because if her body is going to repair itself, to heal? It must have fuel and the ingredients to do so with. \n \nYet finding foods she is inclined to swallow is a daunting task. Sedated, reclining, nauseated from medications, she would rather skip the whole affair. \n \nSo I am once again mothering my mother. Offering tiny tasty morsels on the tip of a spoon, coaxing and cajoling her to take \"one more bite\"of something \"yummy\" harkens back to the days of my boys' infancy. \n \nWe are most successful with the comfortest of foods: soft, sweet, easy to slide down her tired throat: soups, yogurts, puddings. \n \nYesterday, perusing the hospital's dining menu I noticed an item I had previously overlooked and inspiration struck: baked sweet potato, one of Mom's all-time favorite foods! \n \nIt came soft and well done... perfect for my plans. I cut it open, smelling the earthy sweetness rising up from the deep orange flesh, slipped it all out of its papery skin, then went to work.  \n \nI emptied the margarine pats deep into the mound and watched them swiftly melt. I took up the fork and mashed and smashed, tamed lumps of potato flesh into a smooth pur\u00e9e. To thin it out to a consistency that would slide right down, I slowly spooned about half the accompanying tomato bisque soup into the potato, blending and rendering it halfway between a thick soup and a mash. \n \nAnd? It was perfect. \n \nPeople? She ate THE WHOLE THING. And with gusto. \n \nAnd in those few moments when I was scooping spoonful after spoonful of nutritious goodness into my mother, and I could see that eating this was something that was actually giving her pleasure, I was happier than I can ever remember being. \n \nA very small, very brief bite of happiness, to be sure. But blinding in its intensity, and staving off the encroaching darkness, if just for a little while. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a3t1xkndLyc/UPf_-AhXNsI/AAAAAAAAEKA/CSa0j4KJPmc/s1600/Monitor.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/small-bites-of-happiness.html", "title": "\nSmall bites of happiness\n"},

But somehow in the hour since I'd last phoned in, her blood pressure had normalized and her heartbeat reigned in, no longer pulled by stallions, champing riotous at the bit. \n \n\"Your mother may not last the night\" was still a possibilty, but no longer a softened, near certain prognosis. \n \nAnd, indeed, she stayed the night.  \n \nThis morning a nurse woke her up in the wee hours to administer another shot of vitamin K, attempting to stem the blood tide. \"Thank you\" my mother responded, astonishing the nurse who told me she had never been thanked for an injection before (more frequently cursed, I assume). That's my mother: gracious, grateful, full of love. And sorrow. \n \n\"Tough old bird\" I whisper under my breath as I kiss her forehead once again. \n \nHow thing-like a body becomes when it is old and broken and clinging to life with tendrils weak and brittle as snow-scorched vine. \n \nAnd yet my mother's hands are strong still, fingers wrapped, embracing mine, one of the few points of physical contact not obstructed by tubes and wires, her whole body a minefield of pain. \n \nShe looks like a fighter pilot: mask covering nose and mouth, offering air ever more oxygenized as her lungs are capable of absorbing less and less. \n \nAnd fighter she is (tough old bird) clinging still to life, diminished now to this room, my hand, my voice, a cup offering ginger ale through a bendy straw. \n \nShe is still here. \n \nI am here with her. \n \nShe knows I'm here. \n \nAnd, for now, that's enough. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ksH1VmB370U/UPQP2FnlDyI/AAAAAAAAEIk/Xwg8WQWOaaY/s1600/fighter+pilot+mom.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/that-train-is-coming.html", "title": "\nThat train is coming...\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 6, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n 2012: can you say \"Roller Coaster\"? \n \n \nI know, I know, I know! I'm supposed to be looking strictly forward, not backwards any more by now, nearly one full week into the new year. \n \nBut still... the other day, at the end of 2012, while putting up my annual  \"Best of Blog\" post , I realized that while it may showcase my best writing of the year, it didn't really tell the story of how my LIFE went in 2012. I then had promised that post - this post - \"tomorrow.\" But then life got... lifey, you know (kids home on school vacation! autism! ADD! my mother! blah, blah, blah...) and it didn't get finished.  \n \nSo today I will remedy that, sharing with you the high- (and low-) lights of my 2012. In other words...  \n \nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times...  \n \nThe year started off busy.  \n \n \n \n \nI was co-producing the first annual New York City Listen to Your Mother Show (working with a wonderful team of women), and we  announced auditions  in January, held them in February, finalized the cast in early March.\u00a0 I wrote a bit about the process here:  LTYM-NYC has made a busy bee out of me.\u00a0 \n \nThere were also production logistics and sponsorship details. And oh, I was also the webmistress of the very active LTYM-NYC website. Busy, busy, busy. \n \n \n \nWhich was a good thing, as these last few  years winter has been a very tough season for me, dragging me into the  abyss, as it is now so psychically interwoven with my father's long  drawn out death three years ago. That, however, was the impetus to  begin my blog, and thus in February I had my 2 year blogaversary... \n \nWhich I completely failed to blog about as I was so busy with LTYM-NYC. \n \n \n \n Dad & Me, Riverside Park, 1998  \n \nI did, however, blog about those other anniversaries: my father's passing on March 13th:  Two Years  and what would have been his 95th birthday on March 25th:  Not my Father's 95th Birthday post \n \n \n \n LTYM-NYC 2012 1st read-through \n \n \nAlso in March, however, LTYM came to the rescue and lifted me up out of my mourning with a wonderful rehearsal (so much talent!):  Tales from the LTYM Rehearsal \n \nThroughout this time, there were still, of course, the children. \n \n \n \n Jake's drawing\u00a0 of \"a guy,\" 2012 \n \n \nJake was drawing. A lot. And doing some pretty amazing work for a then not yet 10 year-old (with autism, no less). I shared quite a bit of his work in posts like these:  Art and Autism  and  An Autist and an Artist\u00a0  and  More from Jacob's Batman files \n \n \n \n Ethan looking very Dylan-esque, 2012 \n \n \nEthan was... being Ethan. His usual combination of bright, delightful and exasperating. Also often sleepless, as documented here:  Go (the F) to sleep, Ethan.  (until we discovered the magic of melatonin, later in the year). \n \n \n \n Ethan + melatonin = falls asleep before midnight - yay! \n \n \n \nApril was, as always, Autism Awareness month. So I wrote a lot about autism, and my wonderful autistic son Jacob, including:  My 1 in 88  and  Still Aware and Still Accepting \n \n \n \n Jake 2012 from \n \n One Face of Autism \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd then there was May.... \n \nMay 2012 was a watershed month for me. The highest of highs and the lowest of lows. \n \nThe high? \n \n \n \n Cast of 2012 Listen to Your Mother Show \n \n \nNew York City's Listen to Your Mother show was performed on May 5th:  Listen to Your Mother - an amazing ride! \n \nI was the producer and I read my piece: \"Holding Hands\" - about a quiet moment with my elderly mother. (See the video here:  \"Holding Hands\") \n \nIt was a wonderful experience, deeply fulfilling. \n \nAND? I published a post about my experience in... THE NEW YORK TIMES Motherlode blog:  A \u2018Sandwich Generation\u2019 Caregiver Heads Back to Work \n \nBut then, at the end of the month? \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n My mother in the ICU, May 2012 \n \n \n \nOn May 25th life changed irreparably in the opposite direction:  my mother fell , broke her hip,\u00a0  had surgery . She  nearly died , went through  various rehabs , but never fully recovered. \n \nMy life became about  taking care of her  and figuring out how and where she was going to live out the rest of her life, and since then supporting her in the Long Island nursing home she became a permanent resident of in August. \n \nOh, and continuing to be a mother to my own kids throughout this all, too, of course. \n \nWell, summer wasn't all doom & gloom. In the middle of all this I had a funny guest post published:  I am Aiming Low today! \n \nAlso in July? My sons, they turned... TEN!!!!!! \n \n \n \n \n \n E & J at 10 - & impossible to get them in one photo together! \n \n \nAnd, yeah, I wrote about that:  Last Day of Nine  and  Counting up to TEN! \n \nAugust was BlogHer, once again in NYC - thank goodness because i could not possibly have traveled away from my mother this year. \n \n \n \n Me reading \"Holding Hands\" as a VOTY at BlogHer12  \n \nAnd I was honored by being one of the \"Voices of the Year\" keynote speakers at BlogHer:  Listen to the Voices . An AMAZING experience:  First Thoughts on BlogHer '12 \n \nAnd then it was\u00a0 Vacation  and camps and \"adventures\" ( If it's not one thing, it's a flat tire and 103 fever. ) including lots and lots of driving -- all the late summer madness. \n \nPlus, my mother? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She FELL  and landed in the hospital. Right in the middle of all of this. Of course. \n \nSeptember saw the return to school (there IS a god) for Ethan ( First Day of Fifth Grade ) and Jacob ( Hopeful about the New School Year ), my  mother's 90th birthday , and  I was on Huffpost Live!  talking about Sandwich Generation issues, naturally. \n \nThe rest of the fall was more Sandwich Generation juggle... \n \nGetting a call while I was with my family at  The Harlem Globetrotters  that my mother was being shipped off for observation at a mental hospital for threatening to kill herself with a  butter knife . (You just can't make this stuff up, people!) \n \n \n \n Katie and me \n \n \nBut also I was an invited guest blogger at The Katie Couric Show (Sandwich Generation topic, of course):  Amy Grant talks (and sings) about Caring for Aging Parents on Katie Couric, and I was there...  \u00a0 And wrote a guest post for Katie's blog:   Caring For My Aging Parents \n \nOctober was also  NY Comic Con  and  Halloween  and, of course The Hurricane ( Running before the storm)  which left us unscathed but me feeling  Survivor Guilt . \n \nI blog-yelled at Ann Coulter for using the \"R-word\":  Dear Ann Coulter: This is who you insult with your... \n \nAnd then in November,  Obama  got reelected, which mattered to me a great deal:  A Democratic Process \n \n \n \n Mom and her brother, my Uncle Walter \n \nAnd I was able to spring my mother from the home & bring her out to my Aunt & Uncle's house for (day after) Thanksgiving, which was wonderful:  Second Thanksgiving \u00a0  \n \nIn December  I struggled . \n \nBut there WAS  Hanukkah!   \n \n \n \n Ethan chanting the candle-lighting blessing (Hebrew School paying off) \n \n\u00a0  \nAnd then Newtown happened, and I came a bit undone. But then the amazing Autism Shines movement sprang up to counteract the media distortions depicting autism as \"dangerous\" and autistics as potential violent killers. \n \n \n \n \nI am proud to say my friends put this together and I was a part of spreading the word, with my posts  This is Jacob. This is autism.  and  Autism Shines On . \n \nOh, one final thing I am happy and proud of... throughout this year I have done a regular monthly feature - a  Round-Up of What I Loved on OTHER People's Blogs .\u00a0I love curating and helping to create community.  \n \nAnd now? Now? It's a New Year! Looking forward at last. (Whew!) \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j-4bim3nAgk/Tv8VF4Qyk-I/AAAAAAAABGg/-EmrmUlg7sE/s1600/DSC02397.JPG", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0o7_-86YWz0/TYlNvXj3HuI/AAAAAAAAAhc/0gxd5uDS7_s/s1600/Varda+Dad+%2526+Cherry.jpg", "http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc/2012/03/16/ltym-nyc-first-look-first-rehearsal/img_1071/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_0KJr06aLMY/T-koqe6az0I/AAAAAAAABsA/qs2KzwttrrE/s1600/Jake%2527s+Bad+Guy.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FbmyWa6jnfI/T2FmjvNx8AI/AAAAAAAABS8/vLLIpu8t3Yo/s1600/IMG_1184.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-442dkvWEXRw/T6rB6QNqSlI/AAAAAAAABgw/B1FiFbeDYew/s1600/IMG_2117.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PspfMKCxfgs/TtBuzuU2iNI/AAAAAAAABCY/hlYeVQqamQM/s1600/IMG_0251.JPG", "http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc/2012/05/07/ltym-nyc-in-the-nyt/ltym-cast-nyc-2012/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnnDiS_nRVk&list=PL1159293EC380EFD1&index=10", "http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/a-sandwich-generation-caregiver-heads-back-to-work/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jz67IDNcWPU/T8RcXpG5HxI/AAAAAAAABmA/aE80ZXj3RiQ/s1600/The+view+from+where+I+sit.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7xABgt3N6W0/UBZwgZggT3I/AAAAAAAAB9g/G_PhsANv0w8/s1600/557883_4368016199804_921097234_n.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rSl8fsPR4Og/UBZwhEmR99I/AAAAAAAAB9o/kA3McVkEWZY/s1600/599354_4368017599839_1970772794_n.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IwSpykEQkfY/UCEGahb6DoI/AAAAAAAACC4/ZsFtxb96h8I/s1600/Varda+VOTY.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f3bSZSeixGU/UC_C91hryxI/AAAAAAAACZQ/ynVyzc9LKhQ/s1600/310529E7-5764-483D-8F29-F6454A35A648.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mHEYR5r54t4/UIGPyidojKI/AAAAAAAADRI/FGorZyUaXZo/s1600/Me+&+Katie+.jpg", "http://www.katiecouric.com/features/caring-for-my-aging-parents/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-piMJCXvcB5A/ULdBqZlRDfI/AAAAAAAADwM/yMeTR6gEayM/s1600/IMG_6253.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dZ-QTo_M_Ig/UMhw91HuWNI/AAAAAAAAD6U/I00iit_sK9o/s1600/singing+Hanukkah+prayers.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4IpSKEJrcEA/UNWdvuB7QvI/AAAAAAAAD9E/g5iLDkjLkNE/s1600/Jacob+This+is+Autism.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/good-bye-to-2012-my-year-in-pictures.html", "title": "\nGood-bye to 2012: My year in pictures and posts\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 2, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n In case you thought I was kidding about the \"mountain of laundry\" - JUST the boys' stuff. \n \n \nI'm terrible at these things. I don't really make official \"New Years Resolutions\" because I know they'll be broken before the week's end. But there is one thing I absolutely MUST do this year -\u00a0 which is clean my shit up. \n \nI am not a naturally organized or tidy person and neither is my husband. Together we're a disaster. And I hate the way our cluttered, messy home looks and impacts our kids. (\"Wait a minute honey, we can't leave for school yet because your mother needs to find this very important paper in that pile of chaos over there.\")  \n \nAnd this year I really NEED to do something about that. So of course, I turned to the internet for help. \n \nI am NOT a \"Flylady\" type. I get hives just stopping by that site. But Joslyn of  stark. raving. mad. mommy.  is my type of woman, and she, in her own, likewise ADD-rific whirlwind of disorganization put out the call for help to her readers ( Please Help Me: My New Year's Resolution is to Get Organized ). \n \n One of them pointed to this site:\u00a0  Unfuck Your Habitat  (or UfYH for those who don't like to curse - obviously not me). Their tagline is: \"Terrifying motivation for lazy people with messy homes\" - PERFECT! \n \nI also like their attitude, which is small goals, work for 20 minute chunks, then do 10 minutes of something else. Try for multiple rounds (but if one is all you can do at first, it's OK) and do it EVERY DAY. \n \nFrom their site:  \"We deserve to live somewhere with nice things we love, and to \nhave a clean, calm place to be, when we\u2019re not at work or school or any \nof the fifty zillion other places we go.\" \n \nAND:  \"... it\u2019s about motivation, and support, and accountability.\" \n \nAnd it's not just about housekeeping, it's universal:  \"And our homes aren\u2019t the only things that need to be unfucked. Our  finances, our jobs, our relationships: there\u2019s no end to the things we  can fuck up. The important thing to remember is that there is nothing  that can\u2019t be unfucked. You just have to do it.\"\u00a0 \n \nSo I've found my guru. The kind of inspiration I can live with: ironic, realistic. Written by my people for my people (messy, disorganized, drowning in inertia) with the simple credo of:  Do. Something. \n \nAnd that I can live with. \n \nAnd I'm starting today. Just 20 minutes, right?  \n \n(After I get the laundry put away - TODAY, I promise!)  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FYkVi0o1j5k/UOVRcHQwaOI/AAAAAAAAEFw/qGkDEr8Kf0I/s1600/LAUNDRY!.jpg", "http://www.starkravingmadmommy.com/", "http://www.starkravingmadmommy.com/2012/12/please-help-me-my-new-years-resolution.html", "http://unfuckyourhabitat.tumblr.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2013/01/new-years-resolution-clean-up-my-act.html", "title": "\nNew Years Resolution: Clean Up My Act\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 30, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Walking into the Light  by Neil Kramer \n \n \nWell, I so enjoyed doing my  2011 Round-Up  last year that I decided to make an annual tradition of it... gathering together some of the fabulous blog posts I've found on OTHER people's blogs, the ones that have moved me to  laughter, tears, astonishment, or action (possibly all four) and sharing them with you all.  \n \nSo right away, at the beginning of 2012, I started making note of posts I liked, thinking all I would have to do at the end of the year was hit \"publish.\"\u00a0 But then I found that in January alone I'd picked twelve great posts, and realized I would have a list of well over a hundred by the year's end. \n \nThus the  monthly Round-Up  feature on my blog was born.  \n \nBut this... THIS HERE is the big guns, the annual version! \n \nEnhanced this year with photos by my very, very, very favorite intstagram   photographer, Neil Kramer - of the blog\u00a0  Citizen of the Month     - who I am also very happy to call  my friend. He lives in both NYC and LA and also travels a good bit, so prepare to be amazed and amused.  \n \n \n \n Standing by Fountain  by Neil Kramer \n \n \nOnce again, please note that this is an idiosyncratic, quirky and very, VERY incomplete list. (Because you are not going to slog through the 150 or so posts I gathered in my monthly Round-Ups in one sitting now, are you?) \n \nAlso, once again, if you know I love you and you're not on the list this year? Please know that there were so many, many more posts I adored, but at a certain point I just had to stop myself cold turkey.

My mother's fall in late May, and the radical change in her circumstances that rolled out from that being at the center of most of it. \n \nIt was hard to choose again this year... \n \nThe popular posts or the sleepers? The \"big thoughts\" or the quiet moments? Heavy posts about my mother or sweet ones about my kids? The challenges or the gifts of Jacob's autism? My best writing or the most interesting events?  \n \nSome months I couldn't pick just one, so there's a few doubles. And that's ok, because, well, my blog, my rules, right? Who says it HAS to be only one post per month? (Not me.) \n \nSo, without further ado... \n \nHere are some of my favorite Squashed Mom posts from 2012: \n \n January:  Monday Listicles: 10 Things I Have Done to Make a Living  {A funny annotated list of the many and sundry odd - and I jobs I have held in my long life} \n \n February:  A Full Moon for Susan  {My goodbye to the wonderful Susan Niebur\u00a0 - aka WhyMommy - who died of metastatic inflammatory breast cancer, celebrating her life and work}\u00a0  \n \nand  10 years ago today...   {Looking back at my then pregnant self, realizing I had NO CLUE how much and in what ways my life was going to change} \n \n March:  Planets  {Taking a walk with Ethan and reflecting on my children's distant, fratious relationship.} \n \n April:  Words  {Reflecting on the power of words in our lives. Especially destructive ones - like \"Retard\"}\u00a0  \n \n May:  The Dress  {Cleaning out my closet, coming upon a dress I wore at a significant point in my life, and telling a tale from the beginning of my IVF pregnancy} \n \nand  Perspective  {Sitting by my mother's side in the ICU puts everything else in my life into perspective.} \n \n June:  My Heart, Her Heart  {Caring for my mother through her recovery, and adjusting - or not - to her new diminished circumstances} \n \n July:  The living and the dying  {Reflections on my mother and my aunt: old women near the end of life.) \n \n August:  Full Circles  {Dropping Jacob off for a week of SN Summer camp - at the same camp I attended as a 14 year old. Looking backwards and forwards in wonder.}  \n \n September:  Picures and Stories   {A smiling picture of Jake on a boat, and then the story of his horrific autistic meltdown five minutes later. The difference between pictures and stories.} \n \nand  Hunger  {A funny memory of my last trip to LA while pregnant with the twins, when my access to food got compromised - my Yom Kippur post.} \n \n October:  Her way home  {A poignant post about my fading mother and her struggles.}  \n \n November:  Survivor Guilt  {NYC got socked by a hurricane and my family suffered not one bit. And therefore I felt terrible.} \n \n December:  This is Jacob. This is autism.  {My contribution to the wonderful \"Autism Shines\" campaign / Facebook page to counter the autism negativity fallout from Newtown.} \n \n \n \n And that's the year that was! \n \nWell... not entirely. \u00a0Looking over these posts, I realized there is much missing from this recap. Because I have chosen to go pretty much with the \"best writing\" \u00a0side of things, there are quite a few key events in my life not covered in here, as my posts regarding them were more reportage than literary, and thus didn't make it onto this list. \n \nSo I think I need yet another re-cap post about my LIFE in 2012 -- including things like my producing\u00a0 the first annual New York City Listen to Your Mother Show, my reading as a Voice of the Year at BlogHer this past summer, the boys turning 10, etc., etc. \n \nTomorrow, peeps... \n \nAnd until then? \n \nSending my wishes out to you all for the happiest of all possible New Years, and a 2013 that is wonderful and either wild or peaceful (depending on your preference), exceeding your wildest dreams. \n \n Linking this post up at:  \n \n \n \n \n Photo credits: Spiral Galaxy by  Calar Alto Observatory  via  NASA \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ktEjWzlJ2RI/TzE_pjMXsdI/AAAAAAAABQs/XX1Rq_cYhHY/s1600/NGC6946-Subaru-Gendler900c.jpg", "http://www.mamakatslosinit.com/2011/12/a-year-in-review-2/", "http://www.caha.es/", "http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/12/best-bologna-of-2012.html", "title": "\nBest Bologna of 2012\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n The light of a thousand menorahs (actually about 20) \n \nThis past Sunday was my husband Danny's family's annual Hanukkah party. It's a giant extravaganza that has been going on forever. Early in my husband's childhood, it took place at Aunt and Uncle's homes, and then, as the family grew and grew, in his father's  Bronx kosher catering hall. \n \nSince the demise of that, it has continued, every year in varying locations, public and private, the common factors being: large, latkes, and loud. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI married into a BIG family. (Did I mention  having come from  a tiny one, I had always wanted a bigger family? Did I mention that one  should be careful what one wishes for?) \n \nFortunately  they are warm and welcoming, inviting and inclusive. My first experience  with the Danny Family Hanukkah Party took place in 1998, the year we  began to date. (That year it was in the city, as we took over half of Ben's Kosher Deli.)  \n \nIt's the tradition in his family for  people to bring someone to the party when it gets \"serious\" because it  will be noted that there is a date along and there will be kind-hearted  teasing about it. It is also where new engagements, upcoming Bar Mitzvah  dates and impending additions to the family will be announced with much  joy and congratulations.  \n \nAs I may have mentioned here before (in  last year's Hanukkah party post , as a matter of fact) as we walked to the subway together afterwards, heading back to the Upper West Side where we both lived, I remarked to Dan: \"I've never been hugged and kissed by so many people I just met in my life.\" Like I said, warm and inclusive. \n \n \n \n Big cousins = big fun \n \n \nSince then we have stuffed our faces with latkes in the city and the burbs - both Jersey and Westchester - at cousin's homes, kosher delis, synagogue social halls, seminary dining rooms and hotel banquet halls. This year's constellation was Westchester & hotel. Well suited to the growing cadre of young ones who needed halls to run and play touch football in. \n \nWhen Ethan and Jake were born there had been a baby lull in the family, the youngest cousin's kid being four, with a huge gang in their late teens to late twenties. But when the boys were nine months old, another little cousin joined the family, and since then every year has seen the addition of one to two new ones. \n \nMy estimate is that there were about eighteen in the ten and under crowd on Sunday. \n \nA big part of the tradition is that every family brings a menorah, and they are all lit together at the end of the meal. This year, for the second year in a row, we let Ethan do the actual lighting of ours (sniffle, he's no longer my baby, sniffle). \n \n \n \n Ethan chanting the candle-lighting blessing (Hebrew School paying off) \n \n \n \n Jacob loves all the lights \n \n \nThere is also an obscenely huge Table of Presents that everybody drops their gifts onto when they come in (not pictured this year, for some reason, my documentary photographer skills falling somewhat short). And the final official event of the party is the present toss, where the gifts are handed out to the (mostly) kids and an unwrapping frenzy takes place amidst squeals of delight. \n \n \n \n Presents! \n \n \n \n \"Thanks, Aunt Patty!\" \n \n \n \n Jacob groking his Star Wars book \n \nOne note of sadness crept into the festivities for me: the absence of my mother. Part of the inclusiveness of Dan's family is that my parents were invited to any and all events. Even though they were from a rather different side of Jewish culture (secular, bohemian) they did often come to the Hanukkah parties and other festivities and were warmly welcomed.\u00a0  \n \nFor the past two years it was lovely to see my mother surrounded by the swirl of family and children, enjoying the scene, even if she wasn't quite sure who anyone besides her two grandsons were. \n \nThis year, wheelchair bound and hours of driving away in Long Island, taking her was out of the question. Sigh. \n \nBut let's end on a lighter note: Happy Hanukkah to y'all! \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X9oVRYWmlC8/UMhw4O3_BgI/AAAAAAAAD5k/KY1cLzrMaks/s1600/Hanukah+lights.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Kx_sLZCOn24/UMhw3sB1g0I/AAAAAAAAD5c/jmqCIjOW73g/s1600/Ethan+at+2012+Hanukkah+party.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5UR3zg1e8vg/UMhw5yyN8EI/AAAAAAAAD50/_HPLtpuIWMk/s1600/Jake+at+the+Hanukkah+party+.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RI40hhgFoZw/UMhw--07mlI/AAAAAAAAD6c/YA475hDSndg/s1600/upside+down+Ethan.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dZ-QTo_M_Ig/UMhw91HuWNI/AAAAAAAAD6U/I00iit_sK9o/s1600/singing+Hanukkah+prayers.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sHI44Ws75bY/UMhw5BgdgXI/AAAAAAAAD5s/d8pj9ewGCLw/s1600/Jake+&+Menorahs.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8roGdChW7c/UMhw8gZ__6I/AAAAAAAAD6E/IELpdvr1nXQ/s1600/Presents!.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xdggTNKM3pc/UMhw9B5CCJI/AAAAAAAAD6M/jMUdqvSSYWA/s1600/Thanks,+Aunt+Patty!.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70z_37Ke05Y/UMhw6gAVegI/AAAAAAAAD58/8yoyQznyL4o/s1600/Jake+loved+his+Star+Wars+book.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/12/hanukkah-lights.html", "title": "\nHanukkah Lights\n"},

Newtown. \n \nThere has been a misguided media feeding frenzy focused on a possible autism diagnosis of the shooter, and erroneous speculation that autism was behind Adam Lanza's heinous acts. \n \nThere is much destructive misinformation spreading around the world. \n \nIgnorant, spiteful people have created hate sites about how autism = violence, and proclaiming that autistic people are monsters who should all be rounded up and jailed or exterminated. \n \nI can't... \n \nI just can't... \n \nI can't even breathe when I think about this. \n \nI have not been able to write about it yet, finding myself just too devastated, frightened and overwhelmed to form a cohesive sentence.

Parents are sharing their children, adult advocates are introducing themselves. \n \nAnd that I could do; thus this picture, with these words. \n \nAnd we're all sharing it here, on the  Autism Shines facebook page . \n \nCome, see the beautiful shining faces of so many of us and our children.

{"date": "Saturday, December 15, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n menorah on 6th night \n \n \nIt is the 8th night of Hanukkah tonight, and so we're done. Hanukkah came early this year, putting us at a bit of a disconnect with the rest of the country. We'll be well all done before the Christmas frenzy is in full bore. But so it goes some years. \n \nLast year Christmas Eve was the 5th night of Hanukkah, the holidays overlapping nicely. Next year, thanks to simultaneous oddities of the standard western and Hebrew calendars, Hanukkah will actually cross paths with Thanksgiving, beginning the night before! \n \nI'm still weaving in and out of my seasonal ennui, some days lighter, others darker.\u00a0 Holidays are always about family, family, family and I am missing some members of mine. This week the universe conspired to remind me of my father constantly, now gone nearly three years. \n \nI sat down to get a cup of coffee in the middle of the day on Wednesday and gather my thoughts, when I noticed the man seated next to me in the cafe, heartily enjoying a bowl of potato leak soup, one of my father's favorites. I just had to get a some myself, the silent tears dripping off my face and dropping into the bowl rendering it a bit on the salty side. Just how Dad liked it. \n \nI was thinking about the last months of my father's life, how even up until the very bitter end, when he was barely eating anything, becoming more of a skeleton day by day, I could still often get a little soup into him, if nothing else. \n \nNabeyake udon or vichyssoise, pasta fagioli or avgolemono, clam chowder or chicken noodle, goulash or gazpacho; the man loved soup. And every time I make some, I conjure Dad up, if just for a little while. \n \nAnd then on Thursday night, my husband and I got to spend some time with dear friends who are a generation older than we are (but young, so young in spirit and full of life).\u00a0 I love them to pieces and we had a wonderful dinner and lively conversation and I enjoyed every minute of it while simultaneously feeling so sad that my father is gone and my mother fading fast. And there was our friend Al (OK, I'll name drop: Al Jaffe) a year older than my mother, but still working, still living completely independently (yes, it probably helps that his lovely wife Joyce is a decade younger, but still, that makes her no spring chicken herself). \n \n \n><><><>< \n \nOK, this post was supposed to be going up yesterday, on & about the 7th night. I had written this much by Thursday and was going to finish Friday. But then I came home from my intense all day appointment in Brooklyn (the impartial hearing concerning Jacob's schooling) having been pretty much in a bubble all day, to find the news... the school shooting... all anyone can talk about, think about. And I froze. \n \nHow can I write about a cheerful holiday, about missing my father who got to live a long, fulfilling\u00a0 life and become really, really old before he died, in the wake of this immense and senseless tragedy, in the wake of twenty dead children? And yet, there were my thoughts, up until Friday evening. \n \nAnd so I am walking around dazed and shell shocked today; doing what I have to do, boys to basketball, lighting the final menorah, feeding everybody and washing up the boys weekly five loads of laundry. Because life, for the living keeps going on. \n \nI cannot write about Newtown yet. I don't know if I ever will. There is no sense to be made of it. And, for once, I truly have no words. Except to say that we need vastly better mental health services in America, and with less stigma attached to getting them when we need them. \n \nAnd so I'll end here, rather abruptly perhaps, because there is no way to stitch this into a smooth and seamless post. There was regular life, skipping, trudging, shuffling along. And then... the thousand ton boulder dropped into the middle of it. And aftermath. There's always aftermath.  \n \n \n><><><><  \n \nTo conclude: last year I shared  the Maccabeats & Matisyahu's wonderful Hanukkah song  with you, this year I'm sharing a new song from Matisyahu... and hoping everyone had as happy a Hanukkah as possible, in spite of all the insanity and tragedy in the world. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E3bq6P3psg0/UM1o8ZBWWsI/AAAAAAAAD7w/W3AHkS4cXLA/s1600/6th+night+menorah.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/12/light-all-candles-8th-night-of-hanukkah.html", "title": "\nLight all the candles (8th Night of Hanukkah)\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat? \n \nWhat? \n \nI'm silent on my blog for a mother-loving WEEK (the longest break since I committed to writing frequently, over two years ago) and then I plop a post about \"What I'm reading\" down here? \n \nUm, yeah. \n \nSo you might get the feeling I don't want to talk about my life right now. And you'd be right. \n \nI'm struggling. \n \nI'm whining, whinging, stuck, avoiding and generally being a cranky person and I really really don't want to bore you with that. \n \nI have a post I started to write a few weeks ago called \"Wrestling the Black Dog\" and there's a single sentence in it:  \"It's that time of year again, when the days shorten and so does my  concentration, my capacity for joy, and my temper. Depression\" \n \nAnd then I stopped.  \n \nI'm being good at stopping and bad at going, at doing. \n \nAnd what I have done my whole life when I am stopped, stuck, and withdrawing from life is read.  \n \nI can't talk about my feelings anymore right now. (What little I've let out here is making me uncomfortable enough. I am really not OK with how not OK I am. Because I'm a mom and this has the potential to affect not just me, but the kids. Not OK.) But I CAN talk about what I'm reading.  \n \nSo here goes: \n \nAt  Thanksgiving dinner with my family  this year, the teens (17 year-old Aaron & 14 year-old Greta) were talking about a book they were reading:  Paper Towns  by John Green. It sounded really wonderful. A YA novel that was smart and literate. \n \nI have an affection for good YA books, and finally a reasonable excuse for reading them: vetting for future reading by my soon-to-be-teen boys. (And also I will confess: I harbor a secret desire to maybe write one some day.) \n \nSo I picked it up. And it was good. More than just good. Smart, funny, literate; a pleasure to read yet deep, full of soul, lots of things to ponder. A coming of age story, of course, but so much more. \n \nJohn Green's main characters tend to think too much - like me and most of the people I like - and are really interesting to spend time with.\u00a0  \n \nSo then I grabbed another John Green book, his latest:  The Fault in Our Stars . \n \nWow. \n \nwowwowwowwow \n \nThis is the kind of book that makes you want to stand up on a mountain top or soapbox and shout: \"READ THIS BOOK!\" to everyone you see. (Well, it makes me feel that way, anyway.) \n \nAfter I read it I found it to be on a lot of people's \"Best of 2012\" lists. And not just in YA, but for fiction in general. Best NOVEL of the year lists. And yes, it deserves that place. \n \nI know I will be reading it again. And again. It's one of THOSE. Characters you fall in love with, who then break your heart, which you willingly hand to them, and let them do what they will. \n \nIt's a rip-your-heart-out-but-also-fill-it-to-the-brim story about a 16 year-old girl who will be dying of cancer. \n \nIt is moving and touching without ever being trite, mushy, sacharin or maudlin. The storytelling is taut as a bowstring and each sentence finds its target perfectly - zing! \n \nThe language sings.  \n \nYou would think a book full of teenagers wise in the ways of pain and loss and facing their immanent mortality would be heavy beyond belief; and yet this book shimmers with light. \n \nAnd it's a perfect antidote to my unlovely attraction towards  a good wallow, the mighty pull of\u00a0 self-pity in these times of darkness. Let's just say I needed this.  \n \nI am not going to describe the plot one iota, because it should be experienced as the story unfolds. \n \nI will say it's the story of a girl. And a boy. And some other girls and boys. And their families (parents who are neither monsters nor superheroes; all very real, very human).\u00a0 It's about love. And being alive, truly alive. And courage. And fear. And dying. \n \nAnd it's also about a book, and that book's author, who is important to the main characters -- because that's how John Green rolls. His books are always also about the books his characters are obsessed with, which I - a book lover - find delightful (like I said, it's literary, literate YA fiction).  \n \nAnd I will say: READ IT! You won't be sorry. \n \n(OK, coming down from the mountain, stepping off my soapbox now.) \n \nFinally, I will leave you with a quote from the book, whet your appetite a tiny bit (and hopefully I'll be back soon with some more words of my own)... \n \n \u201cSometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical  zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be  put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\u201d    \n\u2015     John Green,             The Fault in Our Stars      \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/0525478817/?tag=thesquashedbo-20", "http://www.amazon.com/Paper-Towns-John-Green/dp/014241493X/?tag=thesquashedbo-20", "http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/0525478817/?tag=thesquashedbo-20"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/12/what-im-reading.html", "title": "\nWhat I'm reading\n"},

{"date": "Friday, November 23, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Jim & Pat's beautiful table at Thanksgiving \n \n \nIt's another year of Thanksgiving finding me full of mixed emotions, aware that looking backwards and feeling sad is so much easier than looking forwards and feeling hopeful. \n \nThis was the first Thanksgiving since my parents moved back north that I did not spend with my Mother. We will be seeing her today when my family does their day-late Thanksgiving celebration on Long Island. But Thanksgiving proper was spent with my husband's family in the city, a small quiet dinner with just two families (and our nephew's lovely girlfriend). \n \nThey live up high in the sky, on the top floor of their tall apartment building, and from a south facing wall of windows there is a clear cityscape view with the Chrysler Building standing out, central to it all. \n \nThe Chrysler Building is deeply significant to my mother, her favorite building in the whole world. She loves art Deco and it is a supreme example of that architectural style.\u00a0 Whenever we came to events at Jim & Pat's (and we have for many many occasions since I've joined my husband's family) my parents were always invited, and my mother always seated opposite this window where her view of the Chrysler Building would be unobstructed. And she never ceased to wonder, marvel at the view. \n \nOne thing my mother has never been accused of is being unappreciative, ungrateful. She would thank Jim and Pat profusely every time she came over, would spend much time looking out over the city she loved, watching the skyscape shift from day to night, giddy in her good fortune at being invited for such a view. \n \nAnd last night, every time I looked out the window and watched the  Chrysler Building shining back at me, the unbidden thought kept welling up: \"Mom should be sitting here, seeing this. And she likely never again will.\" \n \nTwo years ago,  the first Thanksgiving without my father and Dan's mother  was flat out hard. Last year, still, there such  a sense of missing people, of present ghosts. \n \nThree years ago, Thanksgiving day was the last time my father ever entered my home, and it was clear, that day, he was fading fast.  \n \nAnd now my mother is slip sliding away too; though slowly, so very slowly. \n \nThis may be her last Thanksgiving. It may not. We spin the big wheel and see where the fates take us. Either way, we're along for a bumpy ride. \n \nI hate striding into the holiday season hand in hand with this melancholia. I long for simple good cheer. But that's not how life sits with me right now. \n \nSo I strive to feel grateful for the little things, those shiny moments, amidst the gloaming. \n \nShortly we will pile into our ancient but still serviceable car, drive out to Long Island to pick up my mother and take her to family, to the heart and hearth of her brother's nearby home. \n \nIt won't be the Chrysler Building, but it will more than do. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r-Q3TwMyTdU/UK-hFRQs0uI/AAAAAAAADuo/H57BceTu180/s1600/Thanksgiving+table.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/11/thanksgiving-blues.html", "title": "\nThanksgiving Blues\n"},

They live in LA and were doing the East Coast family tour for the holidays. \n \nI drove them out to Long Island to see Mom (his grandmother). She was delighted to see Simon and meet Rachel.

{"date": "Monday, November 19, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nMy husband - who is a big supporter of my writing - has been very busy, and just caught up on a couple of weeks of blog reading. \"Good stuff, really good work you've been doing lately.\" he told me. Then added the caveat: \"You might want to post something funny soon.\" \n \nIn other words, it's gotten a wee bit heavy around here lately. Can't argue with that. It's true. And while I do genuinely feel the need to lighten things up on the blog, I can also only work with what I've got, and I know I just don't have a funny post in me right now. \n \nFortunately for you, I have friends. Funny, funny friends. And it turns out that I, too, am funny when I'm yakking with them on social media (translation for my Luddite friends - murdering time on FaceBook and Twitter).  \n \nAnd one of these cyber-friends (just as real as so-called \"real life\" friends, don't you believe otherwise) has written a hysterically funny post on \" Ways to make your next IEP awesome .\" \n \nYes, this is \"awesome\" with tongue firmly planted in cheek. Because IEP Meetings * ? Well, the term \"torturesome\" comes up much more often than \"awesome\" -- unless you take these ideas to heart, because then you too could have the funniest IEP meeting ev-ah! \n \nSo, go! Read! My friend is Lexi Sweatpants and her blog is Mostly True Stuff. \n \nThe post:  \" Ways to make your next IEP awesome .\" \n \nAnd if you look down to the bottom to see the crowd of bloggers who offered up suggestions for this post, who were part of the autism brain trust, as it were, you'll see my name listed. Two of them come from me. Whoo-hoo! \n \nThere's a third one I came up with that didn't make it on to the list, and I'll share it with you here, as a little bonus: \"Wear an eye patch, and every time they look away switch it to the other eye.\"\u00a0 You're welcome. \n \nSo go, visit Lexi and read all of the rest and get your laugh on. I promise I'll be funny again here, some time soon. (But probably not tomorrow when I'm telling you about bringing my nephew Simon and his girlfriend to see Mom today.) \n \n *Note:  If you don't know what an \"IEP\" is? (First off, consider yourself incredibly fortunate and know I envy you.) It stands for \"Individual Education Plan\" - and is basically the contract between the school district and the Special Ed student that spells out what is needed for the child to receive the \"free and appropriate education\" to which they are entitled as citizens of this nation. \n \nIt the sets educational goals for the student - both short term and long term. It specifies the classroom setting - inclusion or specialized classrooms; number of students and/or student-teacher ratios. It outlines the teaching methodologies, accommodations and additional therapies necessary to educate your child. And? It is legally binding. \n \nIf a miracle has occurred and you live in a school district that is truly seeking to do right by its needier students, this can be a wonderful thing; written as a true collaboration between the family and knowledgeable educators, creatively coming up with a great blueprint for your kid's education. \n \nAnd if you have a Special Ed kid, and have sat through an annual IEP meeting, I will pause now for the laughter and/or tears to subside. \n \nBecause in 99.9% of the cases I know of, that is not the case, and it becomes instead a battleground wherein the family tries to get what their child needs written into it while the school district tries to eliminate as many services as possible and write the thing so vaguely that you have nothing to hold their feet to the fire with, when they fail to properly educate your child. \n \nA bad IEP meeting resembles nothing so much as negotiations between the White House and the Kremlin at the height of the Cold War. It can get ugly and mean and above all ridiculous. You walk out of a bad IEP meeting ready to go to war because people who do not know your child are planning his education, not with his best interests in mind, but hell bent on their singular goal of saving the school district some money. At the expense of your child, who is just so much collateral damage. \n \nAnd then you fantasize about doing some of the things listed in Lexi's post, instead of grinding your teeth while trying to smile and appear reasonable.\u00a0  \n \nOK, I'll shut up now, because I have clearly stopped being the least bit funny, and am at risk of turning into a giant buzz-kill. Mea culpa. Go read Lexi and laugh.

It's hard to get back on track after three  day weekends, after school vacations - scheduled or unintentional like  the week he just had off for Hurricane Sandy. But he's never been like  this.  \n \nThe whole morning, getting ready for school is  filled with Jacob growling and sobbing and angry-crying and clenching  his jaw, grit-grinding his teeth, overwhelmed by waves of frustration. \n \nBesides  this, his begging for more sleep, he is also demanding \"My. Skittles!\" a  holdover from our struggles yesterday to curb the upwards spiraling  trend of candy consumption in our house, engendered by the one-two punch  of Halloween and hurricane.  \n \n\"I'll get fired for  sure!\" he wails, his latest script - culled from Sponge-Bob - in  response to any admonition I make, no matter how gentle. \n \nMe: \"Jake, please keep it down, everyone else is still sleeping.

Shattered into a million glittery pieces. It  breaks my heart that I get angry and frustrated with him, too, at these  moments, watching the clock tick away knowing I have only so many  minutes to get him dressed and fed, medicated and jacketed and  downstairs, ready for the bus.

{"date": "Friday, November 16, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Me, my boys and my parents, 2006 \n \nI used to think my blog title was self-evident...  The Squashed Bologna: a slice of life in the sandwich generation.  Maybe even a little too on the nose. \n \nBut apparently not. I still get asked questions. \"Why are you squashed? What's that 'Sandwich Generation' thing mean?\" And I feel shocked, and if I take a moment to think about it, a little saddened. I've been living the \"Sandwich Generation\" life for so long now, I forgot that it might be possible to not know. \n \nIt has been so many years that I've been simultaneously caregiving for two generations (and doing pretty much nothing but that) that I can barely remember the time when I had just myself to worry about and care for, cannot fathom what it would be like to be innocent of my intimate knowledge of sandwiching, to not constantly feel like the meat squashed in the middle of the family bread. \n \nThe \"Sandwich Generation\" is the catchphrase much used by the popular media to describe people like me, who held off on their childbearing until later in life. So when our parents become elderly and needed us to step in, instead of having older, adult children who can themselves help out, we have young children still at home, depending on us as well. \n \nThus we are \"sandwiched\" between caring for the two generations at once: our parents AND our children. \n \nIn my case, this is ever more so, as my parents were - quite unusually for THEIR generation - older parents themselves. My mother was nearly 38 when she had me, and I, nearly 42 when I had my boys. (I'll spare you the math, that makes me a 52 year-old with 10 year-old boys and a 90 year-old mother in my care.) \n \nIn February of 2005 my parents moved back to New York City from  Sarasota Florida, where they had enjoyed an active, happy and lively  retirement for nearly fifteen years. I'd had my boys in 2002, grandchildren they wanted to spend more time with. But the stresses of travel were affecting them so that every time they came up to see us, Dad ended up in the hospital. It was time. \n \nThe other, unspoken, but clear imperative was that my parents really needed to be cared for, both on a daily basis around things like meals and medicine, and on the larger scale, like bill paying, doctors appointments, and decision making in general. All of which they had been thoroughly failing to manage on their own.  \n \nSo, although they had moved into a senior residence with meals and \"recreation activities\" provided on site, they were effectively in my care to oversee all aspects of their lives. And chauffeur and accompany them wherever they needed to go. \n \nAnd yet, at that time, I also had toddlers, my two and a half year-old twin boys, one of whom was beyond a handful all on his own, having just been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.  \n \nI would say a quintessential \"sandwich\" moment took place on Mothers Day in 2006. There were plans for us all to have a big luncheon together, along with my husband's family, which included his elderly mother, too. When I called my parents in the late morning to confirm that I would be picking them up in about an hour, my mother replied that they would have to beg off, as she didn't feel up to going out. \n \nFurther inquiry revealed that she was still in bed. Because she had fallen in the bathroom that morning at about 6 am. And, as she was in too much pain to walk afterward, she had crawled back to bed, where she intended to remain until she felt better. And could I maybe come see her tomorrow. \n \nUm, no, Mom, I don't think so. \n \nAnd thus I spent Mothers Day that year - yet only the fourth one of my life as a mother to that point - NOT with my darling boys, but with my parents in an emergency room. My poor mother had cracked her pelvis, a fact which it took them 10 hours to X-ray her and figure out, and then FINALLY knock her out with potent pain meds, so she could get some rest. My father and I were not so lucky, spending the night shuffling between the hard plastic chair at her bedside and the uncomfortable ER waiting room sofas.  \n \nOne night, of many, many more - not my first, and hardly my last - in the ER with my parents; my husband putting our kids to bed on his own, waking them up in the morning and having to tell my sad, missing-me boys: \"Mommy's still not here, she's taking care of Grandma / Grandpa at the hospital.\" \u00a0  \n \nAnyone who has followed my blog for any length of time knows that this past year, my mother been on a steeply downward trajectory, clearly entering the endgame of her life, hastened by her  fall in May , wherein she broke her hip badly. \n \nThat very nearly killed her, and it effectively ended any last remaining shreds of her independence. Confined now to a wheel chair, she has had to move into a nursing home for the level of care she needs. \n \nMy heart is broken on a near daily basis as her mental and physical deterioration both proceed apace. I am  watching her fade  before my eyes. \n \nIt is both different from and similar to what I went through with my father, when he passed away in March of 2010. There was a both rapid and excruciatingly slow three months of torturesome leavetaking involved in that. But  he was home  up until the very, very, very bitter end, when we  brought him to hospice  to better manage his pain. \n \nAnd he had my mother by his side. \n \nMy mother, for years, has been fond of repeating the saying \"Growing very old is not for sissies\" at the end of her long list of complaints, ailments and discomforts, usually followed up by a resounding \"This sucks!\" \n \nWhen I reply, in turn \"But it beats the alternative...\" she has always nodded her head in agreement and acknowledged \"I suppose so.\" \n \nBut these days she is sometimes answering \"I'm not so sure, I'm just so tired, so lonely, I don't really want to go on.\"  \n \nI comfort her as best I can. I hold her hand, remind her of the grandchildren she so loves, who want her to stick around.  \n \n\"I'll try to make it to their Bar Mitzvahs.\" she declares; a date three years hence. It's her goal now, less ambitious than their college graduations she had once promised to attend. But maybe, possibly, just on the outside chance, attainable. \n \nAnd with much luck she will still remember who they are, when she gets there. \n \n(I would like to add that caregiving for your elderly parents is not for sissies either. But it too beats the alternative. By a landslide.) \n \n   \n If you are a caregiver or know a caregiver who needs support, please visit  aarp.com/caregiving \u00a0for much caregiving help and information. This is a very useful site, a resource that I wish I'd had as I took on my caregiving role with my parents. \n \n I am a member of AARP\u2019s Kitchen Cabinet on Caregiving and  Caresupport.

Ethan had homework to do for the first time in a week, and yes, that went about as well as expected. \n \nAnd, of course, it was election day. \n \nThe boys and I had been out all morning at a movie-and-lunch birthday party followed by some errands. I had not yet had a chance to vote. \n \nI had been hearing tales all day long of 45 minute waits to vote, and the idea of being trapped on a crowded line with both of my boys (who get along about as well as a pair of rock-em-sock-em robots) was unappealing to say the least. \n \nIn past years I have relished taking a kid with me into the booth to talk about voting with him and have him tip the switches and pull the big lever at the end. But I knew there would be no such satisfying conclusion to the process this time, as New York City had switched over from the old mechanical voting booths to electronic voting. \n \nSo I made the (wise, wise, wise) decision to leave the boys home with their dad while I went off to vote.  \n \nWhen I arrived at the public school that was my polling place (new this year, they had shuffled the districts yet again) I was greeted by a very disheartening scene: a line that stretched not only out the door, but also... around the corner... all the way down the whole block... around the next corner... and 3/4 of the way down THAT block. \n \n \n \n The line at my polling place as I left, still 2+ hours \n \n \n \nAnd, we were told, this was only the half of it. The line was just as long INSIDE the building, too. \n \nYes,  it was going to be a two hour process to vote, with one hour of it  waiting outside on a very cold day. (Thank goodness I'd worn my hat and  gloves!) \n \nBut I didn't even think for a second about leaving and retuning home un-voted and defeated. Even though I may have skipped an occasional inconsequential year (nothing really to vote on besides judges running uncontested, etc.) I have voted in pretty much every election since I turned eighteen, and most certainly every presidential one. \n \nAnd this one? Very important to me (see Tuesday's post:  Obama, Obama, Obama) . Even though New York State was certain to go to Obama without my one lone vote, I knew how important it was that his electoral college win be backed up by a win in the popular vote too, and there my vote absolutely did count.  \n \nSo I resigned myself to waiting. Luckily, the moment I stepped into the line, an old friend from the neighborhood popped on right behind me. Our kids had gone to the same pre-school, and they used to live across the street from us, but all that had been quite some time ago, so we had years of catching up to do -- the perfect distraction from an otherwise potentially excruciating wait.  \n \nThankfully, just about the time my nose and toes were starting to freeze up, our part of the line had snaked its way into the building. In the meantime, the woman behind us in line had joined into our conversation, a retired teacher with grown kids who had lived in the neighborhood for years and years. \n \nAlso, many other neighbors and friends old and new were spotted, saying hello as they walked back to join the end of line or offer their sympathies as they were joyfully exiting the building. All in all, there was quite a neighborly, community-like feeling bubbling up all around us, completely appropriate to the civic-minded venture that is voting.  \n \nWhile I was in line, a friend texted me, letting me know she had come to vote with her youngest child in tow, seen the line and fled, knowing it was melt-down worthy. She asked me to get the scoop on how late she could show up and still be able to vote, and that's when I found out the \"On the line at 9\" rule. I let her know if she was here and in line by 9 (when the polls closed in NY) she would get to vote, even if it took 2 hours (and it did). \n \nSo, after all that waiting, I have to say the electronic voting process seemed a little... anti-climactic. I missed those old mechanical voting booths with their heavy crimson curtains, smelling of metal and machine oil. \n \nI had fond memories of going to vote with my mother for years and years of my childhood, feeling shocked at how different my school building looked when it was full of adults and voting machines instead of its usual cohort of kids. I had stood with her in those selfsame booths, tipped down the switches, pulled the big lever for her, heard that satisfying ker-CHUNK that let you know your vote counted, was being tallied.  \n \nI like voting booths. There is a feeling of hush inside them, of being sequestered from the world, making your choices in secrecy, then whoosh -- as your vote goes in, the curtains open. A perfect dramatic exit. \n \nThere was none of that in the new process. It's like taking a standardized test - you get a piece of printed paper to bubble in your choices on. A \"privacy booth\" is just a tiny high desk on wheels with three raised sides, white melamine, nothing booth-like about it. Then you walk to the other side of the room and a bored woman looks on as you stick your paper through a computer scanner and hand it off to her afterward. Your only satisfaction: the words \"Ballot Registered\" or some such pops up on the screen after \"scanning.\" \n \n\"That's it?\" I thought as I hesitated for a moment before walking away. I missed the sacred feeling inside those old booths something fierce; that sense of completion upon exiting them. But what's done is done, the world has moved on and so must I. \n \nI stepped out into the even more chill evening, two hours after having arrived, and briskly walked the six blocks home. When I got home Dan was finally able to head off to his office, voting, himself, on the way. \n \nSo Dan was working late, and Jake went to bed his usual early time, as election results tip way too far on the abstract scales to hold his interest. But Ethan stayed up with me for some time glued to the TV set, watching MSNBC (the only channel that didn't make me stabby) as the results came trickling in. \n \nHe fell asleep on the sofa, his feet in my lap, about an hour before the decisive state - Ohio - dropped into the Obama camp and victory was nigh. I called Dan to let him know and we quietly cheered together by phone. \n \nWatching Obama's acceptance speech, I was proud of my nation for choosing to stand by this man, who, though clearly a flawed human, like all politicians, I believe has his heart in the right place, and is in possession of a soul. \n \nWhich is further evidenced in this, much smaller, but equally heartfelt and moving speech he gave when he stopped by his Chicago campaign headquarters, unannounced, to thank his campaign workers: \n \n \n \n \n \nHoping you enjoyed your voting process, whatever the outcome meant to you. And now I'm done with politics for the bit, and will shortly be back to my regularly scheduled program of old people and autism... \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZ0ezRrS-7M/UJy9lEoNeqI/AAAAAAAADjk/5ZdXM8GEDvE/s1600/NY+Times+front+page+Obama.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BK3xIufzXxQ/UJy9lw2F31I/AAAAAAAADjs/KHFkzJjYvn0/s1600/Voting+line+=+2+hours.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/11/a-democratic-process.html", "title": "\nA Democratic Process\n"},

The same for a vote for any Republican Senators or Congresspeople. Because the Republicans have consistently, for the last four years worked AGAINST to good of this nation and the American people, just so they could undermine Obama and win this election. People have suffered and DIED so that they could play politics. They shot down a very important aid bill for VETERANS. \n \nMake no mistake: The Republicans wanted this nation in terrible shape today and they kneecapped everything Obama tried to do to help our nation emerge from the dangerous financial place irresponsible Republican policy had brought it to four years ago.\u00a0  \n \nI could go on and on, but I have been reading some brilliant words by others who have laid out why. so movingly, eloquently and in some cases surprisingly, I am just going to quote and link here from now on. \n \nFirst off, from Avitable's  Why I\u2019m Voting For Barack Obama In The 2012 Presidential Election . I don't even know how to chose a quote here; his whole post is clear, concise, brilliant, heartfelt, and 100% on the mark... so this: \n \n \" Over the past four years, I have seen President Obama try to compromise  and work with Congress to help this country, and I have seen his  opponents act ignorantly and prevent him from accomplishing as much as  he could, just because they are from a different political party. Who  are these people that are so arrogant that they put their own ideology  ahead of the desperate needs of the American people? When did the  welfare of our own country become second to the aspirations of those in  Washington?.\"   \n \nThen there's this:  The Politics of Pressure\u00a0Support\u00a0  A very important post (please share EVERYWHERE) from a father whose child has grave medical issues and who, though a hardworking taxpaying member of America;s middle class was being ploughed under by his child's medical care costs and insurance companies who had capped their spending. Until \"Obamacare\" forced them to continue to pay the care this child needed instead of just lining their pockets more deeply.\u00a0 \n \n \"Governor Romney has repeatedly promised that on his first day in office  he will work to repeal Obamacare. Insurance companies will again be free  to deny my family coverage for whatever reasons they see fit. The Ryan  budget which Governor Romney plans to enact as president includes  enormous cuts to Medicaid. \u00a0A vote for the Romney/Ryan ticket is a vote  to completely destroy the financial security and medical safety of my  child and family. If you are planning on voting for him I\u2019m sure that  you are doing it for other reasons but these will be the consequences of  that decision. You may not like hearing it but it\u2019s the truth. A vote  for Romney/Ryan is a vote that will hurt hardworking Americans like me  and my family.\"\u00a0  \n \nAnd then this article:  Why I'm Voting to Re-Elect President Obama  from a man who does not love Obama, not at all, but finds the alternative guy so wacko and deeply owned by and aligned with questionable people and organizations; so much so he feels it is the only vote possible... \n \n \"I watched the Republican primaries. I went to the debates. I saw  long-settled assumptions about the nature of representative democracy  thrown down and danced upon. I heard long-established axioms of the  nature of a political commonwealth torn to shreds and thrown into the  perfumed air. I saw people seriously arguing for an end to the social  safety net, to any and all federal environmental regulations, to the  concept of the progressive income tax, and to American participation in  the United Nations, the latter on the grounds that a one-world  government threatens our \"liberty\" with its insurance-friendly national  health-care reform bill. I saw Rick Santorum base his entire foreign  policy on the legend of the 12th Imam, and I saw Herman Cain and Michele  Bachmann actually be front-runners for a while. I saw all of this and I  knew that each one of them had a substantial constituency behind them  within the party for everything they said, no matter how loopy.\" \n \n \nThen there's this chart from this Forbes article:  Who Is The Smallest Government Spender Since Eisenhower? Would You Believe It's Barack Obama?  revealing that Republicans actually OUTSPEND Democrats when in office. \n \n \n \n\u00a0Not a typo. True. Please send this article to ever Republican you know! \n \nThen there is this:  The Eldercare Cliff. It's Coming. Are You Ready?  an article that doesn't name names ,  but talks about voting for candidates that support eldercare - the elderly and those who care for them; talks about how important Medicaid is to the middle class, not just the poor. And you ALL know a vote for Romney is a vote against the safety net, including Medicare and Medicaid. A vote for Romney is a vote AGAINST old people.\u00a0  \n \n \"One-third of Medicaid\u2019s entire budget \u2014almost $120 billion\u2014is spent on long-term care services for frail elderly and younger people with a disability.\u00a0 Which  means any of the proposed cuts in Medicaid will directly result in  unpaid caregivers needing to take on the care of aging relatives, adult  siblings or children who lose their coverage and services.\" \n \nFinally, a bit of levity -- Joss Whedon (the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly/Serenity for the non-geek among you) with a very funny video about the whole thing - WATCH! \n \n \n \n \n \nSo share this with everyone you think needs to hear it. And go out and vote!

{"date": "Saturday, November 10, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nI've been sitting on this for a while, so it is with a great sigh of relief that I can finally shout out to the world:  Listen to Your Mother  is returning to NYC in 2013! \n \nThat's right, once again, this May, I will have the honor and privilege of producing the  Listen to Your Mother  show, here in New York City. I will again be working with the killer team of Director  Amy Wilson  and Associate Producer  Holly Fink . And this year we will be joined by the lovely and talented Shari Simpson AKA Dusty of the blog  Earth Mother just means I'm dusty . \n \nIf you're one of those really organized types, you'll want to save the date. This year we'll be performing the show on Mothers Day itself: May 12th, 2013, in the early evening. \n \nIf you don't know what all this is about? Here it is (in the words of  Ann Imig  who started this whole thing):  \n \n \n \n LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER  (LTYM) is a national series of live  readings by local writers in celebration of Mother's Day. Born of the  creative work of mothers who publish online, each production is  directed, produced, and performed by local communities, for local  communities. \n \n LTYM began with one show of local writers reading\u00a0in  Madison Wisconsin on Mother\u2019s Day 2010 .\u00a0 The video of the show was posted online in its entirety, and so LTYM reached a global audience and garnered a huge response.  \n \n Bloggers across the country began asking to host LTYM in their home towns, and so in  2011 Ann took the project national  with shows in 5 cities across the country.   And then in 2012 it expanded to 10 cities - including New York City!   \n \n The mission of each LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER production is to take the   audience on a well-crafted journey that celebrates and validates   mothering through giving voice to motherhood\u2013in all of its complexity,   diversity, and humor. \n \nLast year's show was amazing. I loved every minute of putting it on, from the auditions, to  the rehearsals , to maintaining  the local website , and all the hard work that went into making it happen. Working with Holly and Amy and Betsy was a dream. Our cast was an incredibly talented group of wonderful women (and one man) and I can't imagine a better one. And then of course there was  the show itself,  a highlight of my year. \n \nAnd this year ?  (Drum roll, please) ... TWENTY-FOUR cities around the country! Yes, 24! Watch this lovely announcement video to see them all listed:  Introducing Listen To Your Mother 2013! \n \nAnd if there's one near you? You should definitely consider coming out to audition (it's a wonderful experience, whether you get cast or not) and most certainly go see the show, come May! \n \nThe production teams in each of these 24 cities will be announced soon (with 9 out of last year's 10 cities returning this year too), and I have to say I am bubbling over with excitement about how many of my dear blogging friends around the country are coming on board. This is some mad crazy talent pool here, and you will be thrilled when you read that list, too.  \n \nWatch for that announcement on the main  Listen to Your Mother  site next week. And in the  days and weeks to come, more information  about the shows around the country and right here in NYC will appear there too. Also please follow us on Facebook and Twitter for timely announcements. \n \nAnd if you want to see what we were up to last year? Here's my post linking to the VIDEOS of both the NYC show and all the others as well:  The LTYM Videos have Launched! \n \nAnd also, because hey, it's MY blog, in case you haven't seen it yet, here's the video of me reading \"Holding Hands\" at the 2012 LTYM-NYC: \n \n \n \n \nStay tuned for more soon! \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://listentoyourmothershow.com/", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/", "http://www.whendidigetlikethis.com/", "http://www.theculturemom.com/", "http://dustyearthmother.com/", "http://www.annimig.com/", "http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc/", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/show-archives/2010-show", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/show-archives/2011-shows", "http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc/", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/2012/11/introducing-listen-to-your-mother-2013.html", "http://listentoyourmothershow.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/11/listen-to-your-mother-is-back-and.html", "title": "\nListen To Your Mother is back and badder than ever!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n NASA satellite image of Hurricane Sandy \n \n \nHurricane Sandy hit New York City a week ago. The kids are back in school today. After a few days home, we were out and about in our Upper West Side neighborhood as if nothing had happened. \n \nThe only signs of anything being off or odd were all the big kids on the street in the middle of the day; a few more branches and leaves on the ground than on your average fall day; and the grocery stores looking sad with their half-stocked shelves.  \n \nAnd yet we were a little island of normal in a sea of despair and destruction. \n \nSo many of my friends sat in their cold, dark houses, cut off from the world, yearning for heat and light. \n \nPeople lost homes, businesses, and lives. \n \nA mother's young sons were ripped from her arms. Lost. (The family needs help paying for their funeral costs, please click  HERE  if you can give, even a little.) \n \nAnd yet, here we sat, untouched, my biggest problem keeping a pair of jangly 10 year-old boys entertained and away from each others' throats. \n \nIt felt - it feels - surreal, odd. I feel uncomfortably disconnected. If I didn't have these children on my hands I would have tried to go out and do something to help the relief effort. But have them I did, 24/7, for a whole week. \n \nMy husband, a writer who can work from home as easily as anywhere, had many projects demanding his attention, deadlines to meet, and really no excuse to not work (we had lights, heat, food, internet). So he did. A lot.  \n \nSo much human drama was unfolding all around us, I should have been electrified, writing away. But I wasn't. I wasn't writing a thing (facebook updates don't count). \n \nI felt moved, horrified and numb at the same time.  \n \nThe fact that this came at breakneck pace, right upon the heels of our very small, local tragedy (the Krim children's murder) just pushed me further out from my center, thunderstruck. \n \nI feel scooped and hollow, yet vastly lucky and deeply guilty all at the same time.\u00a0  \n \nToday the children were back in school. But I still had no time to myself (train rides, surrounded by jabbering strangers don't count). I wanted to go to the Krim children's memorial service to support the family and gain some closure there, but other needs pressed: my mother. (Always my mother, these days.)  \n \nSo I boarded a Long Island Railroad train today, as I had  just before the storm , and went to spend the day with my mother, who has forgotten there ever was a storm, but was deeply happy to see me, as ever. (And evoking ever more guilt, as whatever I may have to give is not enough; she needs a companion, and that I just cannot be.) \n \nShe, who is now the eldest of her clan, was the one who first taught me the phrase \"survivor guilt\" when describing her own mother, my  Grandma Dunia . \n \nMy grandmother was a difficult, gruff and mostly unloving woman. The eldest daughter of a large family in Eastern Europe who all stayed behind and vanished in the Holocaust, she was the sole adventurer, come to America. The sole survivor. \n \nShe would not talk about her family. She shut down her feelings. Her oft quoted retort to my mother - who had answered her question of \"Why are you in therapy?\" with \"Because I'm not happy, Mom\"... The classic: \"Happy! So who's happy?\" \n \n \n \n Me, Mom & Grandma Dunia in 1974 (Mom was 52 = my age now!) \n \nI fear there may be a passing down of this familial torch some day, as they say that siblings of kids with special needs often feel a form of survivor guilt, too, as they leave the family behind and march on with their lives. \n \nI hope to spare Ethan that. But then again, it's impossible to truly control what emotional baggage we pass on to our children, can only hope it's knapsack-sized and not the whole damn steamer trunk.  \n \nTomorrow morning we'll make cookies and bring them to Ethan's school for the traditional \"Election Day Bake Sale\" this year's profits going not to some school project but rather to provide relief to the victims of Hurricane Sandy; assuage our collective guilt with a little sugar. \n \nFor though our buildings may have been untouched, here, our hearts have been breached by this storm. And only by reaching out with our hands, and doing... something... anything... just a little baking, even, will we move forward, together, into the sun. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XXd6dZhjpKM/UJhiAA-SlmI/AAAAAAAADfA/u-VJvztajDU/s1600/10:28:2012+11AM+EDT+NASA+Satellite+Image,+Hurricane+Sandy.jpg", "http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?fundraiser_id=12916&url=brandonandconnormoore", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qXg8OIBhzwU/TZQBSjTfeJI/AAAAAAAAAjM/GV8IA03l5gU/s1600/Dunya+3a_2.jpg", "http://yeahwrite.me/82-open"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/11/survivor-guilt.html", "title": "\nSurvivor Guilt\n"},

Jake starts talking about it over the summer. By September it comes up nearly every day. Jake loves pumpkins and Jack O' Lanterns and all things Halloween in that passionate and obsessive way that autistic kids can love things. \n \nFor Ethan it's about the costume and the candy (the CANDY!!!!!) and the fun with friends. But for Jake it's so much more. It's something really recognizable that helps him figure out the passage of time. Halloween time comes around every year, and every year it is more or less the same. \n \nHe loves seeing his superhero friends come to life and walk all around town. He loves ghosts and witches and black cats. \"Oooooh scary!\" he'll say, not the least bit scared. \n \n \n \n Jacob IS Batman \n \n \nJake loves the decorated buildings, the Halloween pop-ups that sprout in empty storefronts; is disappointed when they disappear in a sudden poof come November 1st. \n \nBut this year? I must admit that Halloween 2012 was a bit of a wash. Between the tragedy last week and then the storm, with the fear and preparations; and then the destruction all around us, I admit I was in a bit of a daze, hardly entering the holiday spirit at all. \n \n \n \n Jake & me, in my annual \"throw on a hat & call myself a witch\" costume \n For years now I have been obsessively making Ethan's costumes by hand (I would have done so for Jake too, but he dearly loves the store-bought ones) but this year I just knew I didn't have it in me. \n \nBetween the pressures of caring for my mother in Long Island, being in the thick of the intense middle school application process for Ethan, it having taken a month to get Jake's schoolbus straightened out and being in the midst of our legal process to get his school paid for, plus about a dozen other things I'm not even going to go into, I am worn quite thin right now, stretched to near breaking point. \n \nSomething had to give, and that was the handmade costume. So be it. \n \nAnd then there was Sandy.  \n \nWe live in uptown Manhattan in New York City, which means on high, high ground, well above the surge and North of the dark zone, the blackout line. We live in the land of heat and light and screens and open stores and restaurants. But all around us are those in cold and darkness.  \n \n \u00a0 \nSo our building held its annual Halloween party, for who could deny our children their fun, their pizza and candy, their rides in the spookily decorated elevators run by the Hulk and Blackbeard. \n \n \u00a0 \nBut it felt strange to be celebrating amidst so much destruction and tragedy. \n \n \u00a0 \nAnd now it's over. Jake was so sad to come to the lobby today and find the decorations all taken down. \"Where did Halloween go?\" he asked. Where, indeed? \n \nHope your Halloweens were full of less mitigated fun and joy.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 30, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Mom, Sunday \n \nSunday I was torn, yet again, between my mother and my children.  \n \nAny plans I'd had for the next few days were scotched by the coming of Sandy, a \"Frankenstorm\" of supposedly biblical proportion. \n \nAnd this meant especially that I would not be spending Monday with my Mom at her Long Island nursing home, but instead in my home, holed up with the kids, as school was being cancelled. Furthermore, if the storm proceeded as forecast (and it did, as we all know, rather exceed expectations) it would be days and days before I could get out to see her again. \n \nThe choice was clear: Sunday or not until Friday at the soonest, if that. \n \nMy practical mind told me not to go. Driving was out of the question, as the mere possibility of car trouble, accidents, etc. stranding me out on Long Island for the week was giving me palpitations. But the subway and train option was not ideal either, as New York City's entire transit system was being shut down preemptively at 7pm that evening.  \n \nAnd yet... and yet... my heart told me to go. \n \nAnd my gut. \n \nBecause as much as Mom does not consciously remember my visits, at some deep, other level, she knows. And it affects her in all ways, physical and mental.  \n \nThings happen. The  initial fall . The middle of the night  sink vs. face incident . The  butter knife fiasco . These all occurred after a missed visit. They all happened on the rare occasion of there being more than a week's passing since I had last seen my mother. Or, more germanely, since she had last seen me. \n \nSo I feel that while  she may not remember my time with her , something in her psyche does, and she unravels a bit, if that's missing.  \n \nNow this may be all malarkey. It might be coincidence. I may be borrowing guilt for no good reason. But what if I'm not wrong? \n \nAnd then there's that other thing: what if I don't go and something happens during the storm? \n \nSo I fought with myself a bit; crowd-sourced my decision by posting my dilemma to FaceBook, but ended up, of course, taking only the advice that fit in with my gut feeling, unshakable, that this trip needed to be done. \n \nAnd so it was. \n \nI would have to time it very well. No chance to linger. I would have to catch my train home well before the last subway was leaving Penn Station. \n \n(Such an odd concept to a native New Yorker: the \"last subway\" being normally non-existent in this, the city that never sleeps. I remember being shocked when I lived in Boston for a college summer to discover the T stopped at midnight, and equally appalled by Paris's  dernier m\u00e9tro. ) \n \nGoing out, I was lucky with the subway, a number two train pulling in moments after I'd arrived in the station, so I made my train with time for Starbucks (there just may be a god).  \n \nI arrived to find Mom playing bingo, a new-found pleasure she finds as embarrassing as it is enjoyable (she likes to win, my mother does). \n \nAnd then, too, a brief visit from Uncle Walter - Mom's 85 year-old \"baby brother\" - who came bearing flowers, fruit and chocolates, as always. \n \n \n \n Mom and Walter at the BINGO table \n \n \nOwing her a manicure for many weeks running now, I managed to get Mom's nails done as she played, no mean feat.  \n \n\"I love it when you do my nails\" Mom always tells me. But getting her to remember they're wet and hold her hands still long enough for them to dry unmarred is quite another story. (I've figured out to do them one at a time. It takes twice as long, but is the only way it works without tears.) \n \n \n \n \nStill, it's a tangible reminder that I've come, and this is a very good thing. \"Your nails are lovely\" everyone tells her, and she answers \"My daughter did them!\" \n \nAnd then she remembers, she knows (at least for the next few minutes) that I was there. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bn-MgYyHSbY/UJC3yjD0FsI/AAAAAAAADYU/iZLT3_60TKQ/s1600/Mom,+Sunday.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tkIXuWLDq9M/UJC3xc1TB7I/AAAAAAAADYE/uqFV3GL7Va0/s1600/Mom+&+Uncle+Walter.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1d9pfFgpkIQ/UJC3yJdns5I/AAAAAAAADYM/UNlk1DyWUIA/s1600/Mom%27s+manicure.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/2012/10/29/just-write-59/", "http://thingsicantsay.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/10/running-before-storm.html", "title": "\nRunning before the storm\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 28, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n My Jake \n \n\"I love you, Mommy.\" \n \nHe says it quietly these days. Sometimes loudly. Spontaneously. At the dinner table last night, as I sat down. Often enough to almost take it for granted. Almost. But also never. Because my boy is autistic.  \n \nBecause once I did not know if Jacob would ever say \"Mommy\" let alone \"I love you.\" \n \nOnce I did not know if ever there would be conversation, a back and forth, a flow. And now, of course, I find myself begging for a break from Jake's constant need for engagement. \n \nThe conversations are odd, of course, bringing smiles or bewilderment to the faces of the folks waiting at the bus stop with us (for the dreadful will-it-ever-come M104) as we repeat topics over and over, revisiting them cyclically as the waiting goes on and on, and Jake walks in circles, tighter or wider, to relieve the anxiety of the when-will-the-bus-come unknown.  \n \nThere had been good news from the ophthalmologist: Jake no longer needs glasses.  Another thing we had thought might never come to pass.  But of course my son being a creature of habit greets this news with none of the joy his twin brother Ethan had three years ago, upon the same pronouncement. \n \n\"I. Want. My. GLASSES!\" he bellows as I explain patiently (for I knew this would involve much patience, greeted this \"good\" news with trepidation, fearing just such a reaction) that \"the eye doctor says you don't need them any more, the glasses did their job, they're finished.\" \n \nJacob's school's half-day Friday had seemed the perfect opportunity for his annual eye exam. And it turned out fortuitous in so many other ways, as I had a real need of my son that day. A need to see him, to hold him tight.  \n \nMy community was hit by tragedy Thursday: a family lost two children to unfathomable, senseless violence. And when I say my community, I mean more than just we live in the same neighborhood, I mean we have a connection to this family (although I do not know them personally).\u00a0  \n \nThere was a bit of the same feeling around the Upper West Side right afterwards as there was on 9/11: a sense of shell shockedness, a sense of there-but-for-fortune-ness. Not as universal, more of an echo; but still, more than a bit spooky. \n \n\"Why? why? why?\" drummed over and over in my head as I walked about the streets. Taking Ethan to school Friday, morning the parents were out in full force. Those of us who often send our kids in with \"the neighbors\" could not seem to do it, needing to kiss their heads personally at the last possible moment and watch their backs recede into red brick buildings.  \n \nSo many of us appeared with eyes dark circled, earned from 3 am checks of our slumbering children. How long had it been since I had stood in a doorway, watched two small rib cages rise and fall in the near darkness?  \n \nMy mind kept curling back, all day long, to the mother, the family. The mother (like so many of us) employing others to watch her children, in spite of being an at-home hands-on mom, because when you have more than one child, having help is... very helpful. \n \nI return again and again to the screaming everyone says was bloodcurdling, primal, knowing that such sounds would be erupting from me were I ever to come upon my children, likewise  undone. \n \nI cancelled my Friday evening plans (an old friend's play). We sat together for a family dinner, dusting off the Shabbat candlesticks and lighting them, finding comfort in familiar, in ritual, in ancient things that continue. \n \nFinding more than comfort in my son's words as I sat at the table; \"I love you mommy\" taken for granted never, appreciated now more than ever. And now I attempt  to embrace  sleep, to resist the siren call of watching my children slumber, reassuring myself of their continued existence on this planet. \n \nIf will alone could protect them, keep them safe all their lives, then all our children would live forever. \n \nAnd so I hug my sons a little tighter now. \n \nPlease hug your children every day. \n \n \nFinally, I can never say or think the words \"there but for fortune\" without hearing Phil Ochs sing them. So here he is, now doing just that: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y0C16XUcdgA/UI4LfyHANII/AAAAAAAADW8/njhsFpDLzqY/s1600/Jake.png"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/10/there-but-for-fortune.html", "title": "\nThere but for fortune\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 25, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nAnother day, another drive, another visit with my mother. \n \nI arrive with a paltry cache today: no cookies for the staff no cake for my mother, no new clothes, no taking her out to lunch, no manicure, no courtyard nap in the sun. \n \nJust myself, briefly, too briefly, but all that is possible today, and a wide toothed shower comb (two for three dollars at K-mart, the one I had bought for myself, as mom's had been pinched by her klepto roommate). \n \nAs ever she is surprised and relieved to see me, no idea of how long it's been since my last visit. It could have been just an hour earlier this same morning but that would be too long ago for her to recall, making it too long, so lonely long since my last visit; to her. \n \nThe tears stream down her face when I arrive, and when I leave, as always. \n \nShe has no memory of this week's visits, of last week's visit when I took her out for a drive, and to lunch in town at a Japanese restaurant.\u00a0  \n \nI show her picture proof and she is astonished: \"Is that me?' she asks, barely recognizing her own image, the thinner, paler, diminished ghost version of any self she knew. \n \nWe have taken over the north-west lounge, my mother removed from the wheelchair, relieved to be ensconced on a vaguely comfortable sofa. \n \nShe wants to see more pictures and I oblige, scrounging around the iPad's spotty collection of photos I'd uploaded intermixed with images from the videos Jake watches incessantly on the thing. A thousand educational apps and all he wants is YouTubed basketball games from the 1980s. Knicks and Celtics, preferably. \n \nIts always risky showing Mom pictures of Dad, of the two of them, together, looking so happy, robust and young, even if they are only from three years ago. The change is startling, terrifying. and she gets so wistful, so sad: \"He wasn't just my husband,\" she tells me, who knows this better than anyone else in the world would, for perhaps the hundredth time, \"He was my best friend.\"  \n \n \n \n Me, Mom & Dad, September, 2009 \n \n \n\"Oh, Varda, I miss him so much!\" and the floodgates open again. (But how much worse would it be if she started to forget him?) \n \nLunch arrives and I am once again facing off against a recalcitrant toddler. \"I'm just not hungry\" says my former food-loving mother, as she pushes the broccoli florets around on the plate. \n \nBut the mere act of my sitting with her pushes her appetite forward, if just a little bit.\u00a0 And I resort to blatant bribery and outright bullying. Just like with my kids. \"Come on, Mom, one more bite of chicken and you can eat your (rapidly melting) ice cream.\" \n \nAfter a quick stuffing I take my leave. There are children to be picked up and dropped off, ferried about, and homework supervised and checked. \n \nI know I'll be back on Sunday and Monday, but to her, just like my boys the first time I left them in someone else's care, it's the end of the world, abandonment forever. \n \nI hope on Sunday I'll have at least one boy in tow. I pray that the phone calls I get from the home continue to begin with \"Your mother is fine, I just called to discuss...\" and never get darker. \n \nPop music floods my brain as I drop into the driver's seat, pushing out my tears, my sorrow, making the drive home possible, as Shakira serenades me and my car, like an old horse, seems to know the way home. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zTESE72Kshw/UIomHyszrGI/AAAAAAAADVw/umdBQxl9aXw/s1600/Mom,+today.png", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v09o5KLuWIc/TriFNOF61aI/AAAAAAAAA-U/af0WTudsZlc/s1600/DSC06630_3.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/10/mom-today.html", "title": "\nMom.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 23, 2012", "body": "\n A friend has pointed out that during the Presidential debate last night, the conservative pundit Ann Coulter had tweeted this little gem of an insult to our President: \n \n \nAnd she started  a link-up on her blog , invited us, who have special needs children to tell her: \"Dear @AnnCoulter: This is who you insult with your words\" and share a picture of our child(ren) who may some day be (or already have been) called out with the term \"retard.\" \n \nAnn, here is my son Jacob, a beautiful 10 year-old boy with autism: \n \n \nSpend five minutes with him and you'll know he is different. He is likely to ask you, over and over again, who Patrick Ewing is, or who the coach of the 1984 Celtics was. He is likely to get really excited and jump up and down and flap his hands as the feelings so move him. He is just as likely to carry on a conversation with your pet poodle as he is with you, should you be walking your dog down our street. \n \nHe would never call you or anyone else a \"retard.\" He does not know what that word means, nor would he cruelly insult anyone on purpose. But you know better. And still, you do this. \n \nI know you don't care. You have shown time and time again your willingness to use the meanest language you can just for the shock value, and because yours is the party of the top dogs, of the survival of the fittest, of only the wealthy 1 percent who counts and the rest of us can drop dead for all you really care. \n \nYou know that language matters, that language can hurt, diminish, dehumanize. It is not news when I tell you this. And I know, you still don't care. But still I must say it, must say that your use of the \"R-word\" as an insult is dead wrong and downright evil, and call on you to stop.  \n \nAnd, furthermore I must point out that it was completely inappropriate to so childishly name call a standing President of the United States. It has amazed me how many conservative Tea Party type Republicans, the kind who keep demonizing modern morality and call for a return to \"old fashioned values\" see nothing wrong with shredding the dignity of the Office of the President. \n \nEven if they disrespect the man holding that office (and oh, they do) - he *IS* the elected leader of our nation, and thus even if they find fault with him, there should be a level of respect in the way he is discussed. They do not seem to care that they are reducing the status of the OFFICE of the President when they engage in their wholesale dismissal of the man. Getting in their licks seems more important than retaining the high regard of all the other nations on our planet.  \n \nAnd I cannot help but believe, deep into my bones, that this is racism, through and through. The dismissiveness with which he is spoken, the insulting, demeaning, diminishing and disrespectful language used toward President Obama, over and over, is the belittling kind of language used by people toward those they think of as \"lesser\" and the President's brown skin and African American heritage put him in that category in their minds, and thus free their vitriol to find a new low. \n \nAs nasty as the Right was toward Clinton, a different sort of language was used for their insults of him. Because he was white. No dancing around it. And I am sure if the President was a woman there would be an equal lack of respect in the tone used to cut her down to size.  \n \nI don't talk about politics much here in my blog, I am mostly a personal storyteller. But some things are too big and wrong to let stand, and thus I'm up on my soapbox today, concluding with this: \n \nAnn Coulter, and the rest of you: stop being so racist in the way you speak of our President, and stop using language that hurts MY child, a boy with autism whose brain works differently than yours.  \n \nHe is not a \"retard,\" he is not less valuable than your neuro-typical kid.  \n \nAnd he is also something of great value that you are not: nonjudgmental. Kind. \n \n \n Oh, and this is a blog-hop, so if you've written a post on this subject yourself, please add it on below!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QFpu4b1ARPI/UIZQPimzGKI/AAAAAAAADUo/wpC9KJi_1M0/s1600/ac.jpg", "http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/dear-anncoulter-this-is-who-you-insult_22.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cqXwBHA3t9w/UHCZrWH8LzI/AAAAAAAADIA/MdAOBqUzCMA/s1600/IMG_0115.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/10/dear-ann-coulter-this-is-who-you-insult.html", "title": "\nDear Ann Coulter: This is who you insult with your words\n"},

It's a lovely way Katie and her show are actively engaging bloggers and the social-media-connected generation. \n \nI was also asked to contribute a post for the Katie show blog, and you can find it here:  Caring For My Aging Parents \n \nI highly recommend you watch this show if you have any interest in this topic, or even if you don't but you have still living parents or other older people in your life you may end up caring for some day. And even though it may SEEM years away still, you never know what fresh disaster is just around the corner (ever the eternal optimist, I know) to make that hazy \"someday\" instantly morph into today.  \n \nIt is intense, exhausting, deeply rewarding, filled with love and  sorrow, and something nobody thinks about - or wants to think about -  until it is thrust upon them. It's better to be prepared. Don't turn away just because it's unpleasant to think about. Watch and start to plan now! \n \nAlso Amy Grant gifted us with a live performance - the world premiere of a new song that she wrote for her parents, her mother now passed on, her father deep in the throws of a grave dementia.  \n \n \n \n Amy Grant performing on Katie \n \n \n \nBlogging the show was a great experience.

{"date": "Monday, October 22, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Mom, in the car \n \nOn Thursday, when I drove out to see my mother, it was a beautiful day, I thought possibly one of the last unseasonably warm days of October. While the trees in the city are barely registering autumn's existence, I spotted some orange and gold amidst the greens as I wound my way through the island, and the idea dropped into my brain: why not take Mom out for a drive?  \n \nSince  her fall in May , the only time she's been outside has been when she's being transferred between facilities or for brief wheels around the courtyards of the nursing home. \n \nAt first Mom was in too much pain to contemplate transferring her into the car, and then there was the  next fall in August . But it's been a while since then, and I'd been mulling over what I could do to lift her spirits mightily and there was nothing I could think of that would do that better than a foray into the world.  \n \nUpon arrival at the home, I proposed it to the unit charge nurse and she saw nothing to stop us, so she dug out the paperwork and plans were set in motion. There were a few kinks to work out, so by the time we left it was approaching lunchtime. \n \nThen I got really ambitious.  While I'd initially been thinking: half hour drive and right back home, I decided to try taking her out to lunch as well.  \n \nMom has been losing weight, her appetite diminished down to near nothing. Mostly it's depression, but some of it has to be the monotony of the food; hospital or nursing home it's all the same bland stuff.  \n \nSo into the car Mom went. (The car that used to be hers.) A few minutes into the drive I realized two things: that her hearing aid battery was absolutely dead, and her morning Tylenol dose had worn off, so the bumps and bobbles of the road were causing her enough discomfort to be distracting.  \n \nA stop at the local Rite Aid remedied these issues and the drive continued. I also handed her a lovely mini blueberry scone (from Alice's Teacup) that I'd snagged at the PA meeting I had attended that morning before trekking out to the island. \n \nWe toured the roads of Port Washington and Sands Point. I drove her by the big fancy houses nested along the shore. We caught a few glimpses of beach and the Sound, where it opened up to the most expansive vista she's enjoyed in months.  \n \nEvery turning tree, every still blossoming garden elicited her enthusiastic appreciation: \"Oh, how beautiful.\" or \"Just look at those leaves!\" \n \nAfter about a half hour I was getting hungry and so steered us into town. Port Washington is a really special place to me. Not the town I grew up in, but the town of my cousins. It's a place with a personality,  a center; not a suburban-nowhere. And I've been spending time there for nearly half a century.  \n \nI knew we could get a good meal in the lovely little downtown and in a fit of inspiration I chose Japanese.  My parents had loved Japanese food, especially my father who thought a good bowl of nabeyaki udon was something approaching perfection. Wherever they lived, they had a local Japanese restaurant they frequented on a weekly basis, befriended the owners, became \"the regulars.\" \n \nAnd now it had literally been years since Mom had eaten Japanese. I remedied that on Thursday. \n \nThe place was near empty, which worked for us. I ordered the salmon teriyaki lunch special for my mother. And she ate with gusto. She ate the Whole. Damn. Thing.  \n \n \n \n Mom, slurping up her miso soup \n \n \nSo much for the lack of appetite.  \n \nIt was a lovely lunch. I had set Mom up with a view of the large tank of koi goldfish, living things always pleasing her so.  \n \nIt was good for her to be out in the world, good for me to be with her, in the world.  \n \nThere was a part of me, of course, that didn't want to turn into the home as we approached; that wanted to keep going, to drive and drive, kidnap mom, ride off into the sunset with her, feed her all kinds of interesting foods, show her as much of the world as we can see for as long as she can keep going, a Thelma and Louise style road trip (minus the violence and the cliff and all, though). \n \nBut of course I didn't. There were some little people who would be very hurt and disappointed if their mom didn't come home at the end of the day. \n \nA breeze was picking up as I pulled into the circular drive, the leaves all waving goodbye as I wheeled Mom back inside. There was a bit more sparkle in her eye as I kissed her goodbye, squeezed her hand, promising, as always, to return within a few days. \n \nWhat shall we eat next, when I do? \n \nIndian or middle eastern? \n \n(Let the adventure continue...) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q6OBnsEh2Ug/UIPwquTU3nI/AAAAAAAADTg/lrmhTEiDzY8/s1600/Mom+in+the+car.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0aID7DJ6M9Q/UIPwpDgpq3I/AAAAAAAADTY/GrBZ0W48OE4/s1600/Mom+eating+Miso+Soup.jpg", "http://yeahwrite.me/80-open"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/10/taking-mom-for-drive.html", "title": "\nTaking Mom for a Drive\n"},

Back from where? Was I somewhere else?\"  Groundhog Day  all over again, as ever. \n \nBut still, I know part of the constellation of keeping her from spiraling into the pits of depression is frequent visits from me (and other family and friends). She may not consciously remember my having been there, but some part of her psyche knows, and it lifts her. \n \nUnfortunately, if was yet another gray, chill day, so I couldn't wheel her outside into the sunshine she so craves. So it goes. \n \nThose two  visits to the mental hospital , further out on the Island, took about a year off my life. I hope never to see the inside of a locked psych ward again.

Just the nature of the beast right now. But yesterday I was really feeling it. \n \nIt started a few minutes before six in the am, when Ethan padded in to tell me he had gotten up to pee and just couldn't get back to sleep. Nearly an hour and a half before he truly needed to awaken. \n \nWhen I went in to their room to get Jake shortly thereafter, he woke up crying and yelling, exactly the same way he'd gone to sleep the night before. \n \nGetting both kids out the door to school?\u00a0 Took everything out of me, and it was only eight am.  \n \nThe sky was crackling blue. It was a beautiful, seriously beautiful day.  \n \nBut my heart just wasn't in it. I felt off. Going through the motions, but not fully inhabiting my body. \n \nMy ten-thousand item to-do list shortened only slightly, in spite of much doing all day long.  \n \nAnd Ethan was a cranky tired beast when I picked him up from his playdate, on our way to synagogue for our Hebrew School's annual Sukkot celebration. \n \nIn synagogue, however, there were moments of grace, of beauty. Standing one arm around each boy, my husband just to the other side of Ethan, swaying and singing ancient melodies my ancestors had chanted unto hundreds of generations back, I felt my heart opening, softening. I felt connected to something vastly larger than myself, a thing braided of community and spirit; a rooting that was much needed, deeply felt and vastly appreciated. \n \nJake looked over to me at one point and offered up a rare spontaneous \"I love you Mommy.\" Ethan leaned against me and snuggled into my shoulder (he may have taken a little nap).   \n \nAnd then Ethan melted down over the lack of soda or pizza at the potluck supper. Declaring lasagna and other delicious food \"disgusting.\" Sigh. He had Challah bread for dinner. And water. (But how come I'm the one who feels like a prisoner?) \n \nAnd today? I was even offer (I know that's not an actual word - but do you really want to pick a fight with me today?

(My usual answer if pushed to spit one out is: just the right combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers, a complex process that is different in every individual on the spectrum. Epigenetics, dude.) \n \nWhat this is, instead, is a post about hope. And awesomeness. And Jacob. \n \nIt's also long overdue, because what I'm about to share took place this summer, right at the end of our usual Berkshires vacation. Something I'm so excited about, been dying to share. But if you've been reading here for a while, you will recall that we returned home from vacation on a Friday evening at dinnertime in mid August, only to have the phone ring at 2 AM with the news that my mother had  fallen in the nursing home , and was headed to the hospital. \n \nSo things got a little out of hand in my life at that point, and this post sat, languishing and half-written in my \"zombie files\" of unfinished posts that I really mean to complete and send out into the world someday. \n \nAnd so this is that day... \n \nThere is something new afoot... a wonderful blossoming in Jacob's development... \n \nAt the boys' Aunt Patty and Uncle Jimmy's house in Great Barrington there is a wonderful pool. And Jake, given his druthers would spend nearly all day there. He is OK in it alone - with me right at poolside watching OF COURSE - but prefers the company of others for his frolicking. \n \nSo   the day before our final packing and leaving day, we had all been in the pool together, having fun, playing our version of   something like pool volleyball.\u00a0 This involved Ethan and I playing   against Danny, with no net and semi-contentious guesstimating of the   center line and outer boundaries and which were actually point scoring   shots. Meanwhile Jacob was parallel playing a game of catch with all 3 of us  with  a separate ball, right in the middle of it all.  \n \nI   had begged a moment to myself to just float off to the deep end which   was still bathed in sunshine. Dan had gotten out of the pool for a moment and was getting back in the water when Jacob looked up at him. \n \nI heard Jacob asking his daddy   one of his thousand incessant questions and I had piped in to help answer  it  when I suddenly realized -- hey! This wasn't yet another usual Jacob question, rhetorical and answer-already-known; his idea of conversation. \n \nI stopped dead in my tracks. \n \nWhat had I heard? I replayed it in my head. \n \nJacob: \"Why are you not wearing a shirt Daddy?\" \n \nWHAT?  \n \nIt was  a  genuine, spontaneous, curious and wanting-to-know-the-answer WHY   question. \n \nA why question!!!!!! \n \nAnd, because it came out so naturally, I answered just as naturally and didn't even realize what had happened until a full beat afterward: \"Because boys and men have the option of not wearing a shirt when swimming and Daddy makes that choice, like Ethan does.\" (Jake prefers a swim shirt.)  \n \nAnd then I had the biggest cognitive double-take I'd ever taken. \n \nWh-WHAT? \n \nI suppose Dan's shirtlessness had just registered with Jake, and as my husband is not the type to wander around our home without at least a t-shirt on, Jake rarely sees his Dad bare chested. \n \nAnd he wanted to know why. And he asked. \n \n(Simple really. But momentous if you know autism.) \n \nI honestly   did not know, up until that exact moment, if I would ever hear this from him, if he really understood the meaning of \"why\" - an abstract concept if ever there was one; certainly compared to who, what, and even when.  \n \nAnd maybe it makes sense that it happened in the pool where Jake is so happy from getting its sensory input needs met, water giving up so much more information and pressure than air against his every millimeter of skin. So brain firing on all cylinders, chugging along, he made a new connection, a leap. \n \nIt hasn't happened since, but I have no doubt that it will.  \n \nAnd on darker days, stormy and difficult, I consciously choose to turn around, look back to this bright shiny moment and remind myself: patience. He will get this; get there, in his own way, according to his own internal timetables. Remember: it's all inside, waiting to burst forth, someday. When he's ready. \n \nAnd until then? \n \nPatience. Love. Support. Set the bar high. Never give up hope. \n \nAnd be prepared to hear to a thousand basketball statistics, while listening for the next \"why?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Eo_ZmPnvmsw/UGvBqMH3PbI/AAAAAAAADG0/1rHduEM8C98/s1600/IMG_4490.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/10/asking-why.html", "title": "\nAsking Why\n"},

Certainly more visits to my mother, twice or thrice weekly, sometimes with a boy or two in tow, sometimes not. (This past Sunday, with.) \n \n \n \n Mom & Jake on Sunday \n \nThe air took a turn for the crisp today, and I was so ready for that, as my thoughts are gliding towards the autumnal too: a little sad, the bitter mixed in with the sweet. These are the days of waning and I feel that in nearly all things right now. \n \nNone more so than when visiting Mom.  \n \nShe is so diminished, I don't even know what to do with my feelings when I see her. I just try to care for her as best I can. I hold her hand and look into her eyes. We talk a little but not so much, the deafness being a barrier as well as the cognitive dimming.  \n \nI take her out into the courtyard every time I come so she can get fresh air and see the trees and flowers, birds and squirrels - what passes for nature in a paved suburban enclave. I massage her shoulders - feeling the muscle melting away, more bone and less flesh each time -  and try to make sure she is being properly taken cared of.  \n \nBut \"Mom\"? Pretty much  not there any more. Just a sweet old lady with a few of her memories  (and fewer by the day). \n \n \n \n Ethan is a soccer player now  \n \n \nAnd yet there is also this: Ethan woke up earlier than usual  this morning, at the same time as Jake. Unable to fall back asleep, he joined us in the living room, and instead of his usual cranky not-ready-to-be-awake self, was incredibly helpful with getting Jake ready for school. \n \nEthan remarked upon the still dark at that wee hour, pondered the breaking dawn. He also kept track of the time and kept himself rather on schedule to get ready for school, too. And that was just the beginning... \n \nI had a trying day today. Literally. An Impartial Hearing is in progress with the city's DOE over Jake's schooling, and today was an in-session day. I obviously can't talk about any of the details of it, as it is... in progress, other than to say: it's about as much fun as you imagine it to be.  \n \nThe hearings are in downtown Brooklyn, and we are keeping our babysitting down to a minimum these days, which meant that Dan was in charge of the boys this afternoon until I could wend my way back to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. \n \nI came home to find quite a scene: Ethan was in the middle of patiently helping Jacob with his homework (had gotten half his own homework done already, too). \n \nYou could have knocked me down with a feather. If you are at all aware of the normally fractious relationship between my boys (just this weekend, for example) you will be stunned at the miracle this event represents. \n \nAnd then? And then? And then... \n \nEthan made dinner for himself and Jacob. Nothing elaborate, rather basic - organic hot dogs grilled in the  toaster oven, cut up fruit, baby carrots, bread / rice  crackers. But still, he took the initiative,\u00a0 volunteered, followed through. Incredibly proud of himself afterwards (and rightly so).  \n \nSo maybe another thing this month that's autumnal and waning is a good thing: Ethan's nine year-old obnoxiousity giving way to some incoming ten year-old maturity. A mightily welcome October surprise indeed. \n \nAnd I'll leave you with a little more bit of October: \n \nA live performance from The October Project - an old friend of mine's band from the 90s. They're lovely if you've never heard them. Haunting alternative rock. Had a few albums out.

{"date": "Thursday, September 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n  \n \n \n A detail of my car's dashboard. Very 90s. \n \n \nWe have a car in Manhattan and we park it on the streets.  \n \nAnd that's every bit as insane as it sounds, but we have our reasons. ($400 a month garage fees being chief among the street-park decision.) \n \nI never set out to be an auto-bearing Manhattanite, but rather had this thrust upon me when my very elderly parents moved back to New York and under my care about seven years ago, and their car came up from Florida with them.   \n \nIt was full of dings and scratches, patches of other car colors that had been acquired by... violent proximity. Apparently  at the end of his driving years, nearly every time he took the car out, my father would return with dents of unknown origin.  \n \nIf my parents had just moved to Manhattan, I would have sold their car and been done with it. But no, they chose a senior residence in the northern reaches of Riverdale. (Technically in Yonkers even, though literally it was just a toehold over the line, on the north side of the dotted-line dividing street, rather than the south.) \n \nI was their chauffeur, ferrying them to doctor appointments, shopping trips, Dad's one-man show at the Yonkers Library (his last big professional hurrah).  \n \nNow, other than weekend road trips and family vacations, I mostly drive Ethan to school on alternate side parking days, when the car must be ritually moved and re-parked.* Twice a week. More if we've used it and been unlucky in our parking choices upon return. \n \nAnd after dropping Ethan off, I have about an hour to kill before it's time to re-park. The perfect excuse for morning coffee with the mom-friends. \n \nThis morning our conversation spanned hysterectomies, Gay Day at the Mall of America, rating of  local pediatricians, concern for a friend having a hospitalization-worthy manic episode, homework, Sacha Baron Cohen, Simon Baron Cohen, the horrors of the middle school application process, Freddy Mercury, a theatrical parent's reaction to numerous boyfriends over the years  until her loudly sung declaration of the husband to be: \"Keeeeeeper!\"   \n \nOnce again I was filled with that warm snugly feeling that I have the best friends in the world. \n \nA particularly supportive non-judgmental group; when I hear of women complaining about the competitiveness, vindictiveness and shallowness of women's relationships I can't help but think: \"Who the Hell are YOU befriending?\" because that so does not describe anyone I know or choose to spend time with. Then again we're not the \"perfect\" moms in designer clothes (unless they came from Filene's or Loehmann's) with the \"perfect\" children. Far from it. \n \nGiving a friend a ride home after coffee today, she hopped into the passenger seat and seemed delighted to find I had a cassette deck in my dashboard, with actual cassettes in the cubby. (I did mention it's a 1997 sedan that had been previously owned by old people - i.e. my parents -\u00a0 right?) \n \nShe grabbed Special Beat Service and popped it in and we started loudly caterwauling together, singing along to  \"Sugar and Stress\"  as we barreled up Amsterdam Avenue.  \n \nBy the time I dropped her at her door  \"End of the Party\"  was playing. A hauntingly beautiful song. We had spent much of the car ride talking about how important music has been to us at various times in our lives.  \n \nI mentioned how one of my blog friends had included a song in her post that sent me on a wild nostalgia ride: Kate Bush singing \"This Woman's Work.\" \n \nAnd then, a few moments later, just as I'd found a parking spot, the heavens opened up and a torrential downpour ensued, the kind that laughs at your puny little umbrellas as it soaks you with sideways rain and from the ground up in great splashing puddles.  \n \nThere was thunder and lightning involved, and the blaring of alarms, as cars close to the strikes rocked in the violence of the electrically discharging blasts. \n \nMe? I sat toasty in my bubble, listening to my old music on the cassette deck; enjoying the spectacle outside my windows. \n \n \n \n Windows, from a rainy window \n \n \n \n Trees above, through windshield raindrops \n \n \nSo I will leave you with a few words from and a video of this English Beat song  I Confess : \"I know I'm shouting, I like to shout!\" Enjoy: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n *Note: this is a post from my \"Zombie Files\" - written months ago, and just finished up and posted today (being reminded of it by the rain). Right NOW I am actually using the car a LOT driving back and forth to Long Island where my mother is in a nursing home. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rbig_tEpBCI/T8DrjDEcSnI/AAAAAAAABlI/ZlbeG_xLh6c/s1600/IMG_2459.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vM0nR-B6AKk/T8Drkg0asnI/AAAAAAAABlQ/VzRKVw60OOI/s1600/IMG_2460.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L433y51vkoA/T8Drl16q4KI/AAAAAAAABlY/YF9CZpDpj6I/s1600/IMG_2461.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/09/alternate-side.html", "title": "\nAlternate Side\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Me, pregnant in L.A., March 2002 \n \n \nToday is Yom Kippur, the last day of the Jewish New Year, the holiest of the holy of the Days of Awe. Also a day when adults are commanded to fast, to take in no food or drink for the entire day, from sundown to sundown (how Jewish days are measured). \n \nThere is something lovely about this tradition, and I have always enjoyed the fast, especially how it's the perfect excuse for a delicious little afternoon nap.\u00a0 Also, Jews being Jews, there is always a wonderful full repast immediately afterwards, a gathering of family and friends to break the fast with, because food is truly what we do best. \n \nBut I haven't fasted since 1999.\u00a0 I married in 2000, at nearly 40. So, time being of the essence, we got \"to work\" right away in our attempts to start a family. Thus there were two years of trying to get pregnant and then two years of being a nursing mother, and since then, just being an exhausted mom of special needs / high maintenance kids. \n \nNow that the boys are ten, it's feeling a bit ridiculous, the never-ending excuses; so today I am semi-fasting - taking in liquids only - easing into it as it were. Plus it's still my reality that I need too much energy to look after my kids to truly fast. \n \nSo I am experiencing some hunger today, which is making me think about past hungers in my life, and an amusing story from my life, that I have yet to tell you... \n \nWhen I was about four months pregnant with the twins, I took my last business trip to LA. (although I had been a frequent visitor until then, I haven't been back since). My husband, Danny, came along, both to carry on some of his own business and take care of me. \n \nHe had also accompanied me on my (similarly last) trip to the Sundance Film Festival that January, and I had truly needed his help as the \"morning\" sickness combined with altitude sickness to leave me in bad shape some days. (See  this post  for my entertaining story about nearly puking in a famous actor's lap.) \n \nSo, back to the L.A. story... we landed in the late afternoon, and it took MUCH, MUCH longer to get the rental car straightened out than we'd planned. By the time we finally arrived at our hotel, I hadn't eaten for hours. I was famished in the way that only a woman pregnant with twins in her second trimester can be famished. \n \nAnd then? And then? It turned out that our lovely hotel? Had no onsite restaurant open for dinner. (Breakfast through lunch \"coffee shop\" only. Grrrrrrr.) \n \nIt being L.A., we were expected to retrieve our car (10 minute wait) and then drive up and down the street looking for a suitable restaurant (15 to 45 minute process). Yet I, being about to start gnawing on the desk clerk, found that idea impossible. And might have said so in less than polite terms. \n \nWe were then directed to the joint across the street, the House of Blues.  Nobody's idea of fine, L.A. worthy cuisine, quite truly a tourist trap. But I didn't care. At this point I was a ravenous, crazy pregnant-with-twins starving lady. \n \nAnd of course: there was a wait for a table. And once we were seated: the service was molasses slow. \n \nAt the table next to us was a couple paying their bill, clearly done with dinner. And their basket of fresh cornbread? Untouched. \n \nYes, I swiped it. I ate left-behind food off a stranger's table in a restaurant. I had turned all Pregnant She-Hulk: MUST. FEED. BABIES. \n \nAnd my dear husband, who normally would have been mortified by such uncouth behavior didn't bat an eye. (By this point in the pregnancy, he knew better than to get between me and FOOD.) \n \nAlso? He very gallantly manhandled a waiter into taking our order pronto and putting it in as a rush. \n \n(Possibly because he saw I was eying the uneaten half of a steak about to be left behind by a different couple at the table on our right.) \n \nThat was truly the hungriest I have ever been, or ever hope to be. \n \nAnd it's good to remember that right now, today, as 5 pm rolls around and I am feeling a bit peckish, impatient in my wait to return to synagogue; eager to hear the final notes of the shofar's blast reverberate through the sanctuary, echoed by the rumbling of a thousand empty stomachs (including mine), yearning to be filled. \n \nL'Shanah Tovah, my friends. And have a  Tzom Kal (easy fast). \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tTVKBl74RzA/TfawoNM-vDI/AAAAAAAAAo4/bfN4NSXDBQ0/s1600/Varda+Pregnant+LA+2.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/09/hunger.html", "title": "\nHunger\n"},

Today, finally, I caught a glimpse. Although I am now fully spent, having made up for lost time by filling my day to the gills: \n \nTaking Ethan and the neighbor's kids to school (because their little sister puked just as they were getting ready to head out). \n \nA quick coffee with school-mom-friends (need caffeine!) \n \nPicking up the car from the repair shop (poor old thing). \n \nDriving out to visit Mom, and all that that entailed (heart wrenched in a thousand different ways). Yet another conference with nurse manager on how to get and keep her on track, moving forward. \n \nDriving back to pick Ethan up at school, and oh holy hell the check-engine light comes back on again (our car's resident poltergeist not fully exorcised), so back to the shop and then flagging down a cab to get to Ethan on time. \n \nDragging Ethan off to an appointment way East in midtown (1 bus, 1 subway, and a 4 block walk away). And if you know the U.N. is in session right now, you know this means closed streets and roadblocks and checkpoints and police everywhere. \n \nMeanwhile, and threaded throughout: Emails and phone calls about Jacob's bussing situation. Which is bad. He's been getting to school AN HOUR late every day. Because the bus has twice as many kids on it as it should, with multiple schools to drop off at. Because the City of New York is trying to save money at the expense of Special Ed kids, the most disenfranchised citizens to start with. Don't. Get. Me. Started. (I will burn a hole in your computer screen with the white-hot lava of my wrath.) \n \nThen back uptown and West to our 'hood for dinner at Shake Shack because it's near the... \n \nBig meeting at Ethan's school about the middle school application process. \n \n(If you don't live in New York City and send your kid to public school you have no idea of the hell that this means. Middle school is the bottleneck. There are many good elementary schools. There are a lot of good - and even great - high schools. There are very few decent middle schools, and NOT ENOUGH seats in them for all the kids who apply, thus making it a tough and very competitive process to get your kid into a one. Shoot. Me. Now.) \n \nFinally HOME, a full twelve hours after having left. \n \n(And then homework to go over with Ethan, but oh dear God he rushed through it, wanting to play his DS, so it all has to be redone, give me strength.) \n \nDiving back under, not expecting much humanity tomorrow.

{"date": "Friday, September 21, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Ethan hanging out with the Harlem Globetrotters - how cool is THAT? \n \n \nPeople? You know me. I don't do a lot of promoting on my blog. I am not much about the products or the events. I am a writer. Who has a blog. \n \nBut when the lovely marketing folks from the  Harlem Globetrotters  contacted me about being one of their social media moms and promoting their upcoming New York City game on October 7th with a ticket discount code? I jumped at the chance. I may have even done a little jig. \n \nBecause my boys? Basketball? The great LOVE of their lives. About the one thing they both agree on. And the Globetrotters? An amazing family-oriented organization that does a whole lot more than just play basketball. They go into communities and make a difference. They inspire. \n \nAlso? Super nice folks. I know because I got to meet some of them. And Ethan? He got to PLAY BALL WITH THEM! \n \nYes, last week there was a small media event in the city for some of us mom and dad bloggers  and  our kids. Five members of the team took time off from their strenuous pre-season training to come say hello, sign some autographs, and play a little one-on-one with the under-five-foot set.  \n \n \n \n \nEthan got to go toe-to-toe with Buckets, TNT, Slick, Big Easy and Hammer on the lovely basketball courts at  The Sports Club/LA \u2013 New York  on the Upper East Side. \n\u00a0  \nHe  got his jersey signed by the gang, too (now never to be washed!) and we  watched a demonstration of their famed \"magic circle\" where the players  show off their neatest tricks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \nEthan had a BLAST, as you can plainly see. And I have to tell you these players were as nice as they were talented and funny. \n \nTalking with Big Easy, I mentioned that Ethan had an equally basketball-loving autistic twin brother who couldn't be there that day (due to school transportation issues) and he expressed genuine regret that he didn't get the chance to play ball with him, was happy to hear that Jake would be coming to the game in October and told me he wanted to be sure to meet him then. Just... wow! \n \n(Seems like the Globetrotters regularly work with and have special sensitivity to Special Needs kids on top of everything else. Could they be more perfect?) \n \nSo, from everything I have read about them, and then meeting them in person and seeing how roll (and spin and bounce) I can say I am over-the-top excited about going to their game on October 7th. And if you live in (or are visiting) the New York City area and have kids, I strongly encourage you to come join us at the game. It's going to be a great show, a blast, a whole lot of fun. \n \nAnd as this show also happens to be the GRAND opening of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn (new home of the Brooklyn Nets), you get bragging rights to being one of the first people to see the joint from the inside. Yet more cool. \n \nNow the ticket specifics: The Harlem Globetrotters are coming to play at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Sunday October 7th and I have a discount code for tickets for you all: \n \n \n \n \nClick on the graphic above, or this link:  GLOBETROTTERS at BARCLAYS CENTER  and then the \"Buy Tickets NOW!\" link on that page.

The light seeping in through the gaps between the blinds is wan, green, presaging a stormy day; dank and heavy.  \n \nIt's not how Rosh Hashannah should be, these Days of Awe nearly always crisp and autumnal, sporting achingly blue skies to be glimpsed longingly from inside the synagogue's hush and thrum. \n \nBut I have not been this year, sending the menfolk off without me, this virus hitting hard as the holiday's just begun. We have managed the bare minimum tradition requires: a round challah procured, apples honey-dipped, a family meal shared, a sweet new year requested. \n \nAnd now all I long for is sleep, sleep, sleep. And the room to stop spinning. And the unholy pile of dishes in the sink to wash themselves. And for my mother to walk again. \n \nNo matter how far I go in my thoughts, it keeps coming back to that: this huge lump of sadness lodged deep under my heart like that bubble of acid that would not go away throughout my entire pregnancy, spilling out if I tilted just the tiniest bit off true, to the left or right.  \n \nMy mother has not been my compass for many years, yet I am hers. All she has left. But I am spinning, spinning, spinning right now, unable to find my North.  \n \nThe storm outside will not come on, teasing all day with skies darkening and lightening and the air growing thicker and thicker until we are all covered in a sheen of our own sweat though we are doing nothing more strenuous than engaging in yet another internecine battle of the homework wars. \n \nFinally, as dusk comes on and the winds begin to lash, the heavens clearly ready to finally open up at any moment, I must leave the apartment for the first time in days, driven by an empty medicine bottle of Jacob's plus the deep need see something other than these walls and my children. \n \nBut one insists on coming with: Ethan who will not be separated, even though that age is coming on soon when I will be the one clinging and fearfully watching his back as he strides away. He proceeds to be helpful, carrying bags as we make a few stops to stock our waning pantry as well as pick up his brother's necessary pills. \n \nBy the time we trudge back, laden, dying to peel off the rain jackets that were not really necessary but instead have encased us in our own steamy dampness, it has grown near dark and the wind pushes against our bodies, something substantial to resist, fight against, instead of each other, as we find our way home. \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iCcY3olsnS0/UFmHokDYD2I/AAAAAAAAC4w/u4WrRcTvTEc/s1600/Me,+very+ill.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/2012/09/17/just-write-53/", "http://thingsicantsay.com/", "http://www.thingsicantsay.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/09/days-of-argh.html", "title": "\nDays of Argh\n"},

And since that's the definition of Stream of Consciousness Sunday, I thought: perfect! And then when the optional prompt for this week turned out to be \"Who has dropped into your life and made it better?\" -- even better!

This is the weekend, dammit, THEIR time. \n \nLousy timing to be this sick, four days off for the kids and all I want is for them to be elsewhere so I can be sick and sleep in relative peace. \n \nAlso?

Ethan got to go 1-on-1 with professional ballplayers. For a basketball-loving kid that is just the greatest, sweetest thing in the world. \n \nAnd know what they said? He got game. Uh, huh. \n \nSo even though I'm feeling mighty sour right now, there is some sweetness too, as we head into this New year. \n \nHappy 5773 y'all.\u00a0 L'Shanah Tovah.

There are still, always, the large and small people I love, who love me; around me constantly, asking for and offering hugs and delightful conversation. \n \nThere are good things going on that I haven't had time to write about; a post, half-written, about Jacob's spontaneous \"why\" question this summer, languishing in my blog queue. \n \nToday, after moving my parents sofas, beat-up coffee table (which was still in better shape than our old beat-up coffee table) and assorted boxes of sundry into our already cramped tiny apartment,\u00a0 I ran off to Brooklyn for the initial \"Impartial Hearing\" in our annual suit against the Board of Ed to get Jacob's school paid for. \n \nThen I had to rush back into Manhattan to pick up Ethan and take him to his annual check-up, while constantly checking in with Danny to see how Jake's first bus ride home from school this year was going.

My mother now sleeps on scratchy hospital sheets, in a bed not really her own, her few meager possessions perched on and in some generic institutional furniture. \n \nThe big moving day with the truck and the guys was yesterday. Today I went back to do the final clean-up, sifting through what I was leaving to see what needed keeping after all. \n \nDad had been found on a shelf, up high in the back of the hall closet. I had to bring him home myself, did not want to pack him into a box entrusted to movers. Ashes are heavy.

{"date": "Wednesday, September 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Jake, on the boat to Fire Island \n There are pictures and there are stories.  \n \nA picture is a frozen moment in time. How things looked for a fraction of a second, over there, from here. And the story that goes with the picture, well, a story is another thing altogether. \n \nThere is the story under the story. Beyond the story. On the other  side of the story. There is what went on before, what happened next. \n \nI took this picture last week, when I took a day off from dealing with the dismantling of my mother's life and apartment, the dispossessing her of her things, to spend a day at the beach with my sons. \n \nThis move couldn't possibly have come at a worse time: the dog days of summer when the kids have no school, no camp and no friends around to entertain them; when everyone who is capable of it has gotten out of dodge. But here I was, trapped, sitting in an apartment in the City, sifting through every last bit of my parents' life together, downsizing my mother into a few boxes. \n \nBut that's neither here nor there, one bit of the backstory of this photo, which has so many backstories, so many threads all woven together to create this one image. \n \nThe moment is this: I'm on the boat to Fire Island with my two sons, a friend, and  her  twin boys, who are friends of Ethan's and have gone to camp with him this summer.  \n \nDay-tripping, we have taken the subway to the train to the taxi to the boat. But arrived with short moments to spare before it takes off, thus the desired \"top deck\" outdoor seats are all occupied and we are relegated to the likewise nearly full benches below decks.  \n \nJake's got the window seat and he's loving it. I take this photo. Instagram it, and send it out over Twitter and Facebook. \n \nFriends chime in: \"Have a lovely day at the beach!\" \n \nThat was my intention, a laid-back day of sand and sun and ocean and beach town. A one day mini-vacation in the midst of so much that is sad drudgery and emotional quicksand in my life right now. And the boys were to have \"Fun Mommy\" back for a day. \n \nBut that's not how the gods of autism saw it. \n \nBecause about ten minutes after this photo was taken? \n \nJacob stuck his head just a little further out the window... and the sharp wind blew his hat sheer off his head, tumbling it in the air, plummeting into the ocean below and increasingly far behind us.  \n \nAnd Jacob? He howled. He screamed. He beat the bench with his fists. He threw himself down on the floor of the boat and carried on an autistic meltdown to beat all autistic meltdowns. On a packed boat.  \n \nHis grandfather was a Cantor. That must be where he got the lungs. \n \n\"My hat! I want my orange hat! I want my hat back!\" \n \nI heard this, well, I can't say \"non-stop,\" because he did, eventually, stop for short whiles before working up to full steam again, but I heard this near continuously for the next six hours. And then regularly, with slightly longer breaks, for the next six after that. (And I am still hearing the occasional \"What happened to my hat?\" today, five days on.) \n \nThe full-bore screaming tamped down after the first hour or so, but the sporadic sobbing continued for the rest of the day. Along with demands that we go GET. MY. HAT. BACK! \n \nJake doesn't melt down often, but when he does, it's a wonder to behold. \n \nI was really not fond of the stares. But didn't have the time or energy to focus on strangers. My boy was in distress, miserable and out of control. And I had to protect him. And help him (as best I could, but good lord my best was not good enough). And oh my god yes I have another kid, too, and thank god my friend just whisked him away with her two sons, and we met up with them an hour or so later when the worst of the storm had passed. \n \nNo mini-vacation. No fun mommy. \n \nJust barely-holding-her-shit-together-mommy, once again. \n \nAnd so it goes. \n \nBut the picture is lovely.  \n \nAnd all that it suggests. \n \nThe day that might have been. \n \nBut that would be a different story. \n \n \n \n \n \n I am linking this up with my friend Heather's Just Write \n \n  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OtfxD0XVmc0/UEgkbMWnnYI/AAAAAAAACs0/ANZhXQjUu04/s1600/Jake+on+the+boat.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/09/picures-and-stories.html", "title": "\nPicures and Stories\n"},

The biggest of the littles,  poised on that precipice of tweendom, in that neither-here-nor-there  land. \n \nThere is a whole year ahead of us, and much to do and learn, and  yet there is that feeling of the beginning of an ending, that just...  is. \n \nEthan has been at this school the whole time, entering as a just turned 5 year old so many years ago. Could he ever have been as tiny as the kindergarteners we passed today? Doubtful, but must be so.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe are seeing friends and acquaintances - both of us - that we  haven't laid eyes on for nearly three long months, and the kids, they've  all changed. Gotten taller, older, teen-y-er.  \n \nEthan is about due for a big growth spurt, I can feel it coming.  Mostly because his feet have just jumped a size and a half in two  months, necessitating a major back-to-school shoe shopping session...  Which he did not mind one bit, that fahionista son of mine. \n \n \n \n Ethan's look saying \"Enough pictures, Mom!\" \n \nI wish I had more time to enjoy all the feelings involved this  back-to-school stuff, but I was deep in the detritus of my mother's life  all day, getting ready to store or shed everything she and my father  ever owned. \n \nI jumped ship for an hour, left the great pack  to pick Ethan up, necessary on his FIRST DAY of FIFTH GRADE. \n \nBut once I  had shown up, my job was done. He really wanted to walk home ALONE with  his friend, our upstairs neighbor. Not yet, my son, but I agreed to let  them walk a half block ahead and make their own street crossing  decisions, carefully observed, of course. \n \n \n \n Walking home with a friend \n \nJake goes in on Monday: a new teacher, a new classroom, a new school building.

{"date": "Monday, September 3, 2012", "body": "\n My mother turned 90 yesterday, and she is finally starting to look close to her age. It's something of a shock to both her and us, who have assumed her youthfulness would go on forever. \n \nThis year has been harsh on her. Tough on all of us. \n \n Last year at 89 ? \n \n \n \n Mom & me on her 89th birthday last year \n Still going strong. We drove out to Coney Island to visit with friends, made a full day of it, took Grandma out to dinner at a diner near her NYC home when we got back to Manhattan. \n \nBut this year? \n \n \nWheelchair bound now, post broken-hip fall; sleeping much of the time (her heart not pumping efficiently enough to give her a full day's energy). Living in a nursing home. Still bruised from her  latest fall . \n \n \nDanny and the boys and I came out from the city by train (the car is still in the shop) and my Uncle Walter - my mother's 85 year-old \"baby brother\" - picked us up and drove us to the nursing home which is just a mile from his house. \n \nWe gathered in one of the small lounges, just off the dining room, where there was a table, sofa, chairs. \n\u00a0  \n \n \n Uncle Walter & Mom \n \n \n Three generations \n Walter brought flowers. We brought a cake (chocolate - is there any other kind?) and candles - nine, one for each decade. \n \n \u00a0  \nWe visited for a while, ate cake, interspersed hugs and kisses with stories. Mom napped in her chair, on and off throughout the proceedings. \n \n \n \n \n Birthday kisses from Jake \n \nI gave her a bracelet, a simple string of blue-grey pearls on an elastic cord. Something easy to wear, not too valuable, as things of value are not possible to keep in a nursing home (the sad truth). \n \nI had no idea they would be the exact same shade as the shirt she was wearing today, a bit of serendipity, something cheerful to cut into the sadness that was running a deep vein throughout the afternoon. \n \n \nWalt told winding stories of their childhood together. Tales of their parents, and the candy store they ran together; of his father's earlier work as a waiter, filling in some details I had not heard before. \n \n(The children were bored. They played video games. Hopefully, someday they will have interest in\u00a0 the currently unimaginable past.)  \n \nI hadn't realized Grandpa Joe had worked in high-class joints like the Waldorf, and been instrumental in founding the waiters union, NYC Local 1.  \n \n \nThey talked about their grandfather, their father's father, remembered only as Zayde (Yiddish for grandfather), first name obliterated by time. Walt remembered how harsh and bristly his beard was, like razor blades, and how his father had inherited that same rough stuff. \n \n\"You have a beard like none other I have ever seen!\" declared his barber when Grandpa Joe went in for his twice monthly fancy shaves, \"It's tough as nails!\" \n \nWalt doesn't have this. Did it die out with my grandfather's generation, or is a steel wool beard in store for my boys when, in a few years, they sprout facial hair? \n \n(This is why I feel it so important to gather these stories now, while  those who lived them first hand are still among us and remembering.  That world has long faded away, and yet my children walk into the future  carrying the genes of their ancestors with their every step. these are their stories too, even if they don't know it yet.) \n \nWe took leave of Mom as dinner was being served, handed out the remains of the cake to the folks at her table.\u00a0 She looked so sad, sitting there in her wheelchair, dozing off, waiting to be served. \n \nI had to work hard to walk away without spilling over into sobs, remembering my father's bountiful 90th birthday celebration just five years ago, with abundant food, family and friends gathered 'round; not this paltry, anemic thing we had just done, too slight to be called a party. \n \n \n \n Mom with birthday flowers and cake \n Mom, I know this is not how you wanted it to be, but you made it to 90.  \n \nAnd 90 is still 90, a big deal. Nine decades. \n \nAnd I know you don't think so, are distressed by how much you now look like \"an old woman\" but you are still so beautiful, so beautiful to us all. \n \nHappy Birthday Mom!

(Nods to  Elissa Freeman , she knows why.) \n \nToday Jake and I went out to see my mother, while my upstairs neighbors rescued Ethan from a day of video-game-and-TV-watching boredom. \n \nHe has such a terror of spending a day alone (not ALONE alone, mind you, but alone as in NOT played with, being pretty much ignored by busy working parents) and is rather vocal in his displeasure with such arrangements. Especially when they involve proximity to his autistic twin brother. \n \nEthan does not believe me that no one has ever died of such a thing as boredom, and claims he will be the first. I have tried the \"bored children get chores\" gambit, but there is no yard work here in our tiny urban apartment, and all other housekeeping tasks would require MORE of my time and energy to teach and supervise him in than to do them myself. \n \nSo he empties the dishwasher and then it's pretty much back to entertaining himself with expensive electronics. (The horror, the horror...) \n \nBut today, my neighbor (whose praises I cannot sing enough) knowing all too well herself the eldercare-and-kids sandwich squash, took Ethan on for the afternoon. \n \nLeaving Jake free to train out to Long Island with me, to spend some quality time with my mother. (Taking the train because the morning had been spent bringing the sadly falling apart old car to our  lovely mechanic * to get a  new tire , among other things.) \n \nAnd we did. just. that. \n \nAnd I didn't cry because Jake was there and I didn't want to scare him, but I held my mother while she cried about how reduced and sad her life is now, about how much she misses my father. Each and every day. \n \n\"He was my best friend,\" she tells me yet again, tears welling up in the good eye, and the bad. \n \nA pair, they were. Bonded in love and friendship. Fifty one years. \n \nI hated to leave her, when it came certainly time to say goodbye. \"This is what I look forward to now,\" she said, apologetically, gesturing to the bingo game they were starting to set up in the dining room. \n \n\"Your mother is a good player, she wins!\" piped up one of the other residents, declaring my mother a youngster, she a sprightly 96. \n \nYes she is. \n \nYes she does. \n \n90 on Sunday. \n \nWe'll be back. \n \n \n *If you're a New Yorker with a car, I love, and am happy to recommend our mechanic.

{"date": "Saturday, August 25, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is going to be a fairly short one, if not a particularly sweet one... \n \nWhen I went to pick Ethan up from camp on Friday morning, I was so happy. It was a beautiful day and I'd had the wonderful company of my friend Deb on the 2 hour drive hour out, as I was giving her boys a ride home, too. We have a lot in common, had a lot to talk about, and the drive-time just flew by. \n \nI arrived to find Ethan looking tired and miserable, sitting on his duffel bag. I was expecting a happy-dance reunion, and I got a nine-mile stare instead. A mumble and a tearful hug. \n \nI was more than a little miffed to find out that the message I had specifically asked to be delivered to him, that I would be doing the LATE pick-up time, as I wanted to take the camp tour, and thus to NOT worry that he was one of the last campers being picked up? Had NOT been communicated to him at all. \n \nI assumed that an hour of anxiety was the source of his listlessness and clinginess, his resistance to going on the walking tour of the camp. That and the fact that he had slept poorly the night before. As he reported to me, he had woken up in the wee hours to pee, and had had trouble falling back asleep.  \n \nI really should know better. When Ethan is THAT out of sorts, something is up. My friend Amy even wrote a blog post about this phenomenon recently (called:   those who cannot remember strep throat are doomed to repeat it ) that I had read, and actually shaken my head thinking *I* certainly knew better. The more fool, I.  \n \nBecause it wasn't until after the tour (which I dragged him on) and after lunch in town (which he only ate half of) while in the local penny candy store (that he was being surprisingly less than enthusiastic about) that I heard him complain of feeling cold. And it was actually rather warm in this store. \n \nThat's when the bells and whistles FINALLY went off in my head and I put my hand on the back of his neck... to find it burning up. \n \n \n \n Feverish Ethan, with friends \n \nA short trip to the local drug store for a thermometer revealed a temperature of nearly 103.  \n \nYikes! No wonder he'd been feeling so punk. I had also picked up some tylenol (pretty sure he would need it) so boy properly dosed, we cut short our poke-about town walk and got into the car to head home. \n \nThe medicine kicked in and the ride home was going swimmingly. That is until a large chunk of debris - it looked like a piece of bumper, maybe - flew off a car diagonally in front of us and landed in the road: hard plastic, light blue and deadly to our right rear tire. \n \nAfter the bump of rolling over it, I felt the sickeningly familiar chunkity-chunkity-chunk and pulled over fast, on a section of I-80 that fortunately had a decently wide breakdown lane. The boys were all thrilled, they had never been in a car that had sprouted a flat tire, let alone one on a major highway - quel excitement! \n \nAfter some time on the phone with AAA and being told we'd have a long wait for a tow truck to come to our aid, we were pleasantly surprised by fast efficient service. \n \nOf course the spare was in a well in the trunk, which had to be emptied of camp duffels, and of course it was completely flat. But I had warned the operator of this probability and the truck driver actually had a tank of air with him, and the spare, once inflated, thankfully, held. \n \nI was nervous as a cat the whole long, long final hour of our ride home; every bump or slight shimmy making me fear my cranky old spare had given up the ghost. But it held true and got us back home to the city with narry but a good tale for the boys to tell their friends. \n \nI might have kissed the sidewalk in relief when we finally stepped out of the car, home safe, but I know how many dogs have peed there. So I settled for a friendly pat of the old girl's roof, telling her \"Good car, good car.\" \n \nAnd I thanked the parking fairies for delivering us a spot nearly right in front of our house. Not quite  rock-star, but proof they weren't pissed at us, either.  \n \nHopefully Jake's return home tomorrow will involve less highway adventure, and no need for thermometers. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-plV2z0Ik41c/UDnFsSJJaeI/AAAAAAAAChs/GhHbLBg8DPs/s1600/Flat+tire%21.jpg", "http://www.whendidigetlikethis.com/2012/08/sickagain.html", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aREkXuTeXi4/UDnFrtheEXI/AAAAAAAAChk/DbMu8FRBaEw/s1600/Ethan+and+friends.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/if-its-not-one-thing-its-flat-tire-and.html", "title": "\nIf it's not one thing, it's a flat tire and 103 fever\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 21, 2012", "body": "\n \n  \n \n \n \"Tree of Life\" \n \nIt's four am and I should be asleep. \n \nI have a long day of driving ahead of me, up to the Berkshires in Western Massachusetts and then back home again. \n \nI am taking Jacob up to camp. \n \nIt's the same special needs program at the  sweet, wonderful Jewish sleep-away camp  he went to and loved last year.  \n \nBut still, sleep is not coming. \n \nOn top of everything else that is making me anxious these days, there is this: \n \nEven though he went last year, even though he is a year older and his communication skills have jumped leaps and bounds over where he was a year ago? \n \nMy son Jacob is still quite autistic; still unable to reliably report on his activities; still as likely to answer \"yes\" to any and all questions asked of him, because he knows that answer makes us questioners happy, as opposed to trying to represent some sort of truth. \n \n\"Did you do math is in school today, Jake?\" \n \n \"Yes!\" \n \n\"Did you play basketball today?\" \n \n \"Yes!\" \u00a0  \n \n\"Did you go to the moon today, Jake?\" \n \n \"Yes!\"\u00a0  \n \n(So my son is still an astronaut.) \n \nAnd also, though he can say \"I want...\" this or that, will tell you \"No, I don't like that!\" if he hates something you've given him to eat or wear... still, he doesn't really know how to thoroughly advocate for himself yet. \n \nI worry.  \n \nAnd I'm struck once again by how different my feelings were two nights ago, preparing to send his twin brother Ethan off to HIS one week sleep-away camp; the excitement, the certainty that he would be having a good time, easily able to let the folks there know what he needs, to take care of himself. \n \nTwins. But so different. \n \n \n<> = <> = <> \n \nOn road, in the early morning of what is sure to be a beautiful day, Jake is in the back seat and we are listening to pop music on the radio. \n \nDriving up to New England, the highway passes through the Riverdale area of The Bronx; means I pass right by the exit I took to go see and take care of my parents for two years, in this, their old car, now mine. Today the exit sign for 254th street brings my heart into my throat, tears burning my eyes. \n \nMy mother so diminished and frail now, hurting and in the hospital. I am contrasting that with visions of my parents when they first moved here, back from Florida together, the two of them. So much younger, so full of life in 2005. \n \nSeven years. \n \nAnd he is now gone and she is in the endgame. And my children are now ten, double digits; on the precipice of launching into teendom. Life flowing in two directions all around me.  \n \n \n<> = <> = <> \n \nIt has indeed turned out to be a beautiful day, the finest of this whole hot miserable summer. I am sitting on a bench in the outdoor sanctuary at Jacob's camp. In the place where, as 14 year old, I had lain a mosaic; now long gone, replaced by a lovely tree of life ark. \n \nThis camp has changed over years since 1974, yet also so much remains the same. Walking past the old red barn, chills ran down my spine, memories shuffling past. Last year the special needs camp was held at this camp's sister location nearby. But this year: here. \n \nLast year the opening ceremony was lovely, but did not evoke the past.  \n \nThis year I sit in this exact same spot as my fourteen year-old self, and past and present swirled together like the light and dark sections of a mixed pumpernickel bread. As we sing the the words of the prayers, my arm around Jacob who is leaning deep, snuggled into my side, I am crying.  \n \nGrowing up in non-religious household, going away to this camp at fourteen was the first time I was really exposed to Hebrew and prayer. That one summer, four and a half weeks, really, have remained a deep & meaningful time, are a part of shaping who I am. \n \nNot particularly observant now, there is still, somewhere in my core, a rooted sense of Jewish self, an unshakable identity. And I know my one month here at Jewish sleep-away camp instilled that. \n \nPeople have asked me why my near fervently non-religious parents had sent me here, of all places. And there was the official, and I'm sure true reason: I had always wanted to go away to camp, they wanted to give me what I wanted before it was too late, and this was the cheapest camp they could find. \n \nBut I also have to think that they somehow knew, maybe even subconsciously, that I needed this, needed to belong to something larger than just myself and my tiny nuclear family. \u00a0  \n \nAnd now I sit, my son at my side, my mother in a hospital bed, physically distant but ever on my mind. And in front of me, in this sanctuary, is a beautiful, sculptural Tree of Life. \n \nA visceral image of what I sit in the middle of every day, these days, caring for the young and the old. Looking backwards and forwards. \n \nBut today, trying to be just here. In and of this moment. \n \nAnd then my son hops up, heeds the call for campers to make their departure. He plants one more kiss on my chin, runs up the hill to the awaiting counselors. Just when I think he's off with nary a glance back, he turns, offers me a big smile and wave and happy \"Goodbye, Mom!\" shouted at the top of his lungs. \n \nAnd he's gone. \n \n \n \n Jake waving goodbye \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I am linking this up with my friend Heather's Just Write \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GXkz975xtHk/UDSly4CENZI/AAAAAAAACbA/t4iY_wFFenE/s1600/Tree+of+Life.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xEDo0SHT2AY/UDStcc8oLoI/AAAAAAAACb4/03PMPv0wc3U/s1600/Jake+waving+goodbye.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/full-circles.html", "title": "\nFull Circles\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 23, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nMy two empty nest days are over. \n \nTomorrow I am up early once again, driving out to Pennsylvania to pick Ethan up from camp. \n \nSo, with no time to write, and also Jacob much on my mind, as he spends his week at special needs sleep-away camp for the SECOND year in a row, I thought I would re-post my report from his first year there. \n \nLast year I called him a \"fledgling\" as he was leaving the nest for the very first time. This year he has shown himself to be a veritable eagle, soaring high on his own wings, so easily.  \n \nHere is that post (written for the Hopeful Parents site) from last summer: \n \n \n \n Jake & me at camp welcoming ceremony 2011 \n \n \n Fledgling   \n \nThis summer, an amazing thing happened in our lives: our 9 year-old  autistic son Jacob went to (ASD) sleep-away camp for a whole week in  late August. And we didn't get that dreaded phone call to come get him  because he was falling apart, unable to hack it. He had a great time. \n \nThis is the child who clung to me and sobbed when I left him at  pre-school...  \n \nWho had to have a photo of me taped up in his cubby at  Kindergarten, so the teachers could bring him over and point to it when  he got sad and called out for me, reminding him that he would be going  home to me on the bus in just a few scant hours... \n \nThe boy who every  time we are out and about in the world doing anything, even something he  truly loves, will ask, after a few hours, to go home please, telling me  that he misses Coco (the cat) and his blue bear. \n \nSo knowing all this, why did we dare send him in the first place? \n \nWell, we did it for him and we did it for us. For him because he is too dependent about things he actually has the ability to be independent  with, but not the inclination; thinking that a week without us would  kick-start some self-reliance, push him to take more responsibility for  himself, where others are having expectations for him with the bar held  high. \n \nWe also wanted him to have the confidence that comes with knowing he  could spend a week apart from us and survive, and maybe even thrive.\u00a0 We  were hoping he would make friends, would try new things, that the  experience would open up his life. \n \nAnd also? I was terrified. Because while Jake may live  in the body of a rather large nine year-old, emotionally and socially he  is a LOT more like a four year-old. And you don't send four year-olds  off to camp alone. \n \nAlso, the camp was a pilot program, being run out of a regular (Jewish) camp,  at the end of their regular season. So this was an experiment on all  sides. It was set up for \"high functioning kids on the autism spectrum\"  ages 9 to 13, and I was afraid that Jake would have less language and be  youngest both physically and emotionally. \n \nWe were  teetering on the fence   about this for a long time: was this the right thing to do, or should  we wait another summer.\u00a0 But I didn't want to underestimate my son, and I  wanted to give him this opportunity to grow. \n \nSo, with trepidation, a few Sundays ago I loaded up the car with  Jacob and a giant black duffle trunk containing a huge portion of his  worldly belongings, a full set of medicine & vitamin packs and a  detailed description of his GF/CF diet. \n \nWe had written social stories  aplenty, made a special calendar that he could check off each day until  it was the next Sunday and he was to come home.  Blue bear  came with, and he held him the whole ride up. \n \nIt was just Jake and I traveling North to the Berkshires together  because his twin brother Ethan was traveling West to another state this  same Sunday with their Dad, on his way to an introductory week of  sleep-away camp, himself, along with a bunch of his friends. (Remember  when I said this was for US, too?) \n \nThe whole ride up I chatted away to an unusually quiet Jake in the  back seat, talking about camp and how today was Sunday and I was going  to leave him there and come back the NEXT Sunday and pick him up. It was  impossible to know how much was sinking in or not. \n \nWe arrived to be warmly greeted by a lovely staff. There were around a  dozen kids in the program, and surprisingly about half were girls.  There was a family welcoming ceremony with songs and prayers and introductions. \n \nYou know you're at Autism Spectrum camp when someone steps up to  introduce themselves to a group and says \"Hi, I'm Dan\" and a voice from  the peanut gallery calls out: \"You're short!\" (He was.) \n \nToward the end of the ceremony, Jake turned to me and asked, calmly,  \"Are you going now, Mom?\" So I guess he understood, after all. I told  him I was not leaving quite yet, that all the mommies and daddies would  be kissing their kids goodbye at once and then he would go off with his  counselors to settle into his bunk and begin the fun. \n \nAnd when the time came, that's exactly what happened. A big kiss and  hug, a wave, and goodbye, Jake. Wow. Someone had tears in their eyes,  and it wasn't the boy. \n \nI got a call the next day, and nearly had a heart attack because I  got to my phone just as it rolled into voicemail. But it turned out to  be a courtesy call, wanting to reassure us that all was fine, share that  Jake had settled in well and was happily having fun. \n \nLike all modern camps these days, photos posted daily to their  website and we were able to see our boy swimming, dancing, sculpting,  playing games, playing drums. Sometimes smiling and laughing sometimes  looking a little lost inside himself, but never scowling, unhappy. \n \nHow strange it felt to not have him home, how many extra hours I had  in  my day to get things done, how unstructured my evenings became --  which was both exhilarating and vaguely un-mooring; that's  another  story for another day. \n \nAnd then, when it was time to pick him up, he ran to Ethan and I  beaming, happy to see us, but turning and waving goodbye to his new  friends, too. A happy, tired boy, my little fledgling, one step closer  to becoming the young man he will someday be. \n \n NOTE: This post  originally appeared on  the group  Hopeful Parents site  on September 10th, 2011.

But also, of course, a curse.   \n \nSo here I am, again, on 2 hours of sleep again, with my poor hurting mother. \n \nWhat happened was: she fell. Again.  \n \nMom fell in the bathroom of the nursing home where she now lives. The aide who had brought her in there was being kind, giving her some requested \"privacy\" for a moment, so had stepped back, was hovering  just outside the (open) door.  \n \nBut Mom forgot that she was supposed to ask and wait for help when she was done and attempted to get up by herself.  You can see what a good idea THAT was. \n \nShe fell, hard; clonked her head but good on the sink. Additional assorted body parts also made contact with surfaces harder that they should have. And she was sent off to the local ER to rule out fractures, brain bleeding & other such fun stuff. \n \nWhen I arrived at the ER, I took this picture. Believe it or not the eye looks much worse now, a veritable goose-size egg rising under the purple, bleeding surface of her lid and brow. \n \nAnd yet, my mother, being my wonderful mother, still has a sense of humor about it. \n \nShe kept asking \"Why can't I open my right eye?\" (Yes, her short-term memory issues are so bad she kept forgetting what had happened to bring her into the hospital. Albeit the percocet may have contributed to the fog.) So I showed her the picture. \n \nHer response: \"But you should see the other guy!\" \n \nAnd also she managed to look on the bright side: \"Doesn't my hair look great?\" Love that mother of mine. (Wonder no more where I got my gallows humor from. And my father was even worse.) \n \nSo. \n \nHere we go again. \n \nOn the up side... astonishingly, unbelievably, no bones were broken. Her ribs, elbow, hip are bruised. Skull: intact, with no brain bleeds. \n \nJust one massive, ugly shiner-to-beat-all-shiners. \n \nOh, and also maybe it's a good thing that something landed her in the hospital, because as they were doing all those x-rays to see if she'd broken anything, they found some fluid in her chest. At first they thought it was maybe in her lungs, and that she was brewing a pneumonia, but then concluded it was around them, in the pleural area, and she was instead in the wee early phase of an incipient heart failure. \n \nWhich they are now fixing. \n \nSo yes, obviously she was admitted into the hospital.  \n \nGood thing I wasn't going to that family wedding this weekend, after all. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f3bSZSeixGU/UC_C91hryxI/AAAAAAAACZQ/ynVyzc9LKhQ/s1600/310529E7-5764-483D-8F29-F6454A35A648.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/fallen.html", "title": "\nFallen\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 20, 2012", "body": "\n   Five things I want to tell you (updates and downloads of momentary thoughts from my currently chaotic brain) in no particular order. Kind of like what you'll get if you open up one of my kitchen drawers (don't ask): \n \n1. Ethan has been dropped off at camp. \n \n \n \n Ethan, excited at camp drop-off \n Five whole days apart. I am missing him. And yet? Wow, is the house quieter and more peaceful. \n \nEvery now and then something happens and I realize yet again that my son who  doesn't  have autism is actually higher maintenance and more exhausting to parent much of the time. Go figure. \n \n2. And Jacob? About to do the same with him on Tuesday, a return to the  wonderful ASD Jewish camp program  he went to last summer. The one I had to drive like a bat out of hell up to last summer, a full day early, to pick him up and then  race Hurricane Irene  back down to New York. \n \nPlease let this year be a repeat of the wonderful time he had last year, but can we just skip the hurricane emergency and accompanying parental anxiety? Thanks in advance, gods of Autism. And extreme weather. \n \n3.  My mother  is doing... better. I have heard that the swelling around her eye has gone down considerably. It was so hard to not be with her yesterday, but I had to take Ethan across 2 states to camp, and then come back, and I just didn't have it in me to then travel an hour each way in an opposite direction. (Many thanks to Suzanne who lives one town over, and came to visit my mom in my absence. True friend.) \n \nI will spend today with her. Hopefully she can go home. Even if that \"home\" is no longer a true home (sob), but just her nursing home bed, it's better than a hospital one. \n \nMom is constantly anxious about her glasses, which I will be bringing with me today when I see her. But she forgets. This is the tragedy of my mother's cognitive impairment. In the moment she is so with it: bright and connected and funny and kind. But her short-term memory, her ability to make things told to her stick? Is just... GONE. \n \nAnd so she is constantly anxious and worried and upset about mysteries that have no need to be mysteries if she could just remember. But she can't. \n \nI HAVE her glasses. They have been fixed. I will bring them to her today. She has been given this information at least twenty times in the last two days. But I am positive she will wake up this morning not knowing where her glasses are, and worrying that they are completely broken and she will never get them back. \n \nNumber 342 of the things that are breaking my heart. \n \n4. I am having a really hard time right now with all that's going on (and I'm not even telling the half of it). Anxious. I do not feel anxiety often. Which is a good thing because I tolerate it REALLY poorly. I am jumpy, twitchy and more distracted than usual. My ADD goes into hyper-drive. And I get really cranky. And negative.  \n \nAnd I write things like this: \n \n When you've been spending time with your sad, injured mother, you tend to think ungenerous thoughts about strangers as you walk around streets of New York, like: \"How come YOU get to stroll down Broadway chatting with someone who is clearly your sister, with your twin, odd, ungainly gaits while my Mother has to lie in a hospital bed with a baseball sized purple goose egg swelling her eye shut?\"\u00a0 \n \n The brain screams NotFairNotFairNotFair as I and everyone else just walk about on our daily routines, oblivious to the manifold disasters that lurk around each bend. Every able-minded and -bodied person is just one misplaced step away from becoming a member of the underclass injured, the invisibles who shuffle or wheel among us oblivious, lucky folks.  \n \nSee? I am just SO much fun right now. (Yes, it IS appropriate to start feeling sympathy for my husband right about now.) \n \n5. Squirrel! ... Shiny! ... Was I going to say something else i was going to tell you? Never mind. I'll remember later. You don't mind a call around midnight, right? Or better yet - something to post about tomorrow. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-24yLJFwSJ2I/UDIyDnfH11I/AAAAAAAACaI/b4cKHbNlKYA/s1600/Ethan+happy+at+camp.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/hodge-podge-edition.html", "title": "\nHodge-podge Edition\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n A beautiful morning in Great Barrington \n \nWe are here on vacation, in a setting so idyllic it makes my heart zing every time I open my eyes and look around. My in-laws' beautiful Great Barrington house. \n \n \n \n Boys actually playing together in pool = big win \n \n \nAnd yet it is impossible to  just relax and let myself be transported, for I am tethered to so much (phone calls, phone calls, phone calls about my mom). I  didn't even make it into the pool yesterday. Though the boys did (all three). \n \n \n \n 3 guys in the pool \n \nComing back here, year after year, we have developed some traditions.\u00a0 I spend as much time barefoot as possible - and take a picture of my feet in the grass, to remember this time by. Check! \n \n \n \n \n I took some lovely portraits of the boys: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere was the 3rd annual watering of the car, an anticipated event now. This year Ethan did not fully join in, but he helped Jake fill the can. Cooperation at its finest. And the old beast is (marginally) cleaner, so there is that. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe had our walkabout in town, replete with a foraging session at the candy shop and a tour of Toms Toys, the lovely independent toy store on Main Street. I remember buying them Thomas trains there. (How fast they grow up. Sigh.) \n \n \n \n Spinning the pinwheel outside Toms Toys \n \nWe found a local ball field and the guys had a game of catch. Thank goodness there was a basketball court there too.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIndoor diversions? Screens screens screens. Plus a 500 piece World Map puzzle Ethan and I worked on for 3 days. The Indonesian islands nearly killed us, but we got it done! \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd then there is the new...  \n \n \n \n \nA this Greek restaurant, Ethan ordered the grilled SALMON off the kids menu and proceeded to eat it and ENJOY it. Anyone who knows what a picky and stalwart \"kid food only\" eater Ethan has been over the years is now probably thinking I was hallucinating at last night's dinner. \n \nBut no, it was real and he was thrilled that we were thrilled. As Jacob likes salmon, too, this means there is now something I can actually cook for a family meal that is healthy and everyone will eat. Not having regular family meals, the way I did growing up, the way I assumed I would in the family I created is a never-ending source of guilt and sadness for me. \n \nThis will make it easier to achieve, at least once a week. Salmon. Whew! \n \n \n \n Ethan awaiting incoming ball \n \nUnderlying and overlaying all this classic vacation stuff, however,  is my mother. All that I have to do for her in the next few weeks is a weight on my shoulders. How lonely she is in this week without my visit, a stone in my heart.  \n \n \n \nCompound that with feeling so sad and guilty that we  never brought her here on vacation with us. Last year would have been the  perfect year, after my frail and unmovable father had passed, yet when she was still hale enough herself to travel, to swim. Now is too late, she  is so diminished. \n \nI spot a hummingbird flitting amidst the morning glories outside the kitchen window and think \"Oh, Mom would have loved to see this!\" I would cry and cry about it, if I didn't need to  make breakfast and put on my happy face for the boys. \n \n \n \n Watching the kids cavort in the pool whilst in my PJs? Priceless. \n \nSo this is us on vacation. Just trying to have a little fun. To not think too much. And I'm determined to rest up a little bit before the shitstorm of caretaking that's going to hit upon our reentry on Friday. \n \nWish us luck, once again.

{"date": "Sunday, August 12, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n The view from the Great Barrington house \n \n \nToday I packed up the family into our old kit bags and we took the show on the road. \n \nNot very far. To Great Barrington again, the Berkshires; these old, soft, rolling hills a verdant background to what passes for our family vacation these days. \n \nThere is always work going on in the background; laptops and tablets never far from reach. \n \nThere are always elderly parents to be worried about. \n \nTwo year ago, the morning after we'd arrived we got a seven a.m. phone call. And that turned out as well as you may have guessed. We passed most of our vacation with my husband absent, back in the city dealing with yet another hospitalization for his elderly mother. That one, actually, the beginning of the ending. \n \nI am hoping and praying we will pass five days without an urgent call from my mother's home. That said I know that while my children cavort in the idyllic pool I will be watching them with one eye whilst spending hours on the phone, straightening things out around my mother's situation. \n \nSuch is life these days; my heart divided, always, rarely fully present with anyone (least of all myself). \n \nThere will be squabbles aplenty, as the boys alone together without any outside, third parties is\u00a0powder keg territory. To say that Jacob so easily gets\u00a0on Ethan's very last nerve is an understatement of \u00a0epic proportion. \n \nTo borrow one more cliche: they are oil and water. \n \nYet also somehow every time we come here a little magic happens in their relationship. \u00a0They have moments of fun together; cooperation, collaboration, bonds renewed. (And I quietly weep for joy over this when they are not looking.) \n \nI would say it's Jacob getting his sensory needs deeply fulfilled by all that time in the water (he can and will spend all day in the pool) but it has even happened when we come in the winter too. \n \nAlready there has been a completely friction-free frisbee game at our favorite watering hole - the Route 7 Grill - where we dined tonight, pulling in road-weary at the end of our travels. (Just 3 hours, but we're NYC folks, not car people, to us this is a big trip!) \n \nWe love to eat there because of the fields out back behind the restaurant - an upscale, locavore, roadhouse of a place - where many a game of catch has been played while waiting for the food to arrive. The chef-owners also have a young son, so there are many yellow toy construction vehicles available to work the gravel pit, too. \n \nPulling up to the house, even in the dark, my spirits lifted. It is so large and beautiful, sitting atop a hill with a majestic view of distant hills behind. My in-laws generosity knows no bounds, inviting us to return year after year, in spite of the chaos our brood inevitably brings to their ordered peace here. \n \nWe had been planning to meet them for a late lunch before they returned to the city, but it just took too long to get ourselves ready and out the door with this and that and the other thing needing to be done (taking our show on the road requiring so much more than just tossing some clothes in a bag and hitting go). \n \nThe boys disappointment when they realized that in spite of being in their house we would not actually be seeing their beloved Aunt Patty & Uncle Jimmy was palpable.  I felt bad, scoured my mind for what I could have done to get us up here sooner, mother-guilt never being far from reach. \n \nBut I need to let that go, let myself glide into vacation mode when the long days are filled with sunshine and pool splashes, and hopefully the boys' internecine tendencies will be once again blunted. \n \nWish us luck. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P_sXsp5K1xU/Tk-lbeN_i3I/AAAAAAAAAyc/bCV8-NTuECY/s1600/DSC02241.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/taking-it-on-road.html", "title": "\nTaking it on the Road\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, August 9, 2012", "body": "\n I am particularly squashed right now. \n \nMy mother can no longer walk, so she can't go home to the lovely assisted living community she has been a part of for over two years now. They cannot handle the level of care she now needs. \n \nI am in the midst of transitioning her into a nursing home now (and it is breaking my heart). \n \nSo I need to dissolve all but about two suitcases of her entire life. All while my children have a MONTH left until school starts up again, with only a week of non-mom supervision scheduled. \n \nI have so much I want to say here, but no time to write, even though the words are bubbling up inside me, yearning to break free. \n \nI am sure some night soon I will be up way too late, writing anyway, as the bottled up words just cannot stand. \n \nBut until then? \n \nI do not want my blog to suffer, lonely and forlorn waiting for my attention. So I have made the decision to bring some of my guest posts back home, especially posts you may have not read, that seem relevant to current circumstances. \n \nAs I have just come back from this year's BlogHer conference, I thought I would start with this post, about finding my tribe of bloggers. \n \nAnd in case any of you are in doubt, this weekend confirmed ever more than before for me: Blog friends ARE real friends, indeed.  \n \n <> <> <> \n Tribes  \n\u00a0  \nI am of an age. Older than many other mothers of nine-year-old boys. \n \nI have belonged to many tribes in my 51 years of life on this planet. \n \nIn the beginning, obviously, there were the tribes I was born into,  happenstance of ancestry and geography: Jews, native New Yorkers. \n \nThen other, subtler tribes, born of the choices my parents made: the  tribe of only (sometimes lonely) children, the tribe of Bohemian  artists, which I must say was much larger when we lived in Manhattan,  shrank to the miniscule when my family moved to the flatlands of Long  Island. \n \nThen there are tribes of circumstance and identity that coalesce  among school-age children. Mine were of the bookish variety, including  the Educated Apes & Pigs \u2013 the name the \u201cregular\u201d kids coined for  those of us in the Enriched & Accelerated Program, or EAP classes in  my elementary school. \n \nWe didn\u2019t care what they called us. A group of  too-smart-for-their-own-good kids together? Is a very good thing. For  two years we with our own, exclusively, and could relax for once. It was  glorious. \n \nThen through the tumbled, tumultuous years of adolescence and  teenagery, like so many others, I stepped into and out of tribes, trying  on and shedding groups and identities; seeking the true and the  comfortable, shedding old and too tight skins. \n \nChoir nerd / theater nerd / tech squad / artist / vegetarian / hippie / feminist / punk \n \nThen more of the same in college. But fine tuning it, getting closer to the core, to ones that stuck around for a while: \n \nFor a long time I was a radical lesbian-feminist, a member very  insular and exclusive group. There was a tremendous sense of identity  there, a fierce belonging, a complete subculture and I was one of the  tribe, lavender-dipped down to my skin. \n \nAnd then? \n \nI changed. \n \nIt was hard to leave such a tight, interconnected tribe, to step out into the world as just me. \n \nBut the inside was evolving and no longer matched the outside. Another skin to shed. \n \nMoving back to New York in my mid-twenties in the mid-eighties, the  world was wide. I spun through single gal \u2013 married woman \u2013 divorcee \u2013  married again. \n \nFor a while I was in the tribe of the infertile. That one was hard. Rock and a hard place hard. \n \nAnd then, most transformatively of all, I joyfully, and with many  tears, joined the Mom tribe, frequently anointed in pee and poo and  leaky breastmilk. \n \nMy life, before, ever expanding, contracted for a time into that  fiercely insular world of infant parenting: a few blocks bounded by the  parks, the nearby stores that sell diapers, teething toys and baby  tylenol, the pediatrician\u2019s office, the kid friendly cafes. \n \nI left my square mile infrequently. But within were many other  members of my weary tribes: older new mothers and mothers of twins. \n \nIn the past few years I have, unfortunately been inducted into tribes  not of my own choosing. \n \nAlthough I have embraced it whole-heartedly and  learned of its gifts, joining the tribe of  Autism Mothers  was quite a shock. Unwelcome at first, to say the least. \n \nAnd then there\u2019s the  Dead Dads Club   whose membership card comes, eventually, to all who enter the tribal  cave of the elder-care-givers. Once again this was thrust upon me. But  it is a weight I bear with love, my  89-year-young  mother still my charge. \n \nWhich brings me to this, the tribe I find myself among today: the tribe of bloggers, we of the writing kind. \n \nI did not know I had not yet found my people. I sat in the middle of  so many belongings, I felt so connected. How could I have suspected  there was more? \n \nBut then  one day  I transformed my words into little packets of ones and zeroes and pinned them on a virtual page I called my own. \n \nI had no idea what I was doing. \n \nI just needed to shout into the wilderness, to hear my own voice  amidst the cacophony of special needs children and dying parents. \n \nI wrote and wrote. \n \nAnd then I began to read. \n \nAnd then I joined a blogging community. Or two. A group blog. A conference. \n \nAnd one day I realized: my ghostly, virtual friends were as real and important as my flesh and blood friends. \n \nAnd that I was Blogger. \n \nThat this was my true tribe. \n \nAnd that it took me fifty years, but I had found my people, oversharers all, and come home. \n \n <> <> <> \n \u00a0To read my post as it appeared initially in October 2011, go  here  to my friend Katie's blog  Sluiter Nation . \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://sluiternation.com/2011/10/tribes/", "http://sluiternation.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/my-tribe.html", "title": "\nMy Tribe\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Me reading \"Holding Hands\" as a VOTY at BlogHer12* \n \nIt is now two days since I've come back from the overwhelming, awesome, non-stop whirlwind that was the BlogHer12 conference (and yes, I know it was in NYC, my home town and I didn't officially \"go away\" as I slept in my own bed every night, yet still I  was  away from my regular life) and I have yet to have a moment to organize my thoughts on the matter, craft a carefully thought out response.  \n \nBut this year, damn it, I am determined to not go down my usual rabbit hole of over-rumination, of having to have everything thoroughly digested before I wax forth on the subject. In other words, I'm going to get a post up about BlogHer before the week is out! \n \nEven though I haven't uploaded all my photos yet! Even though I don't know exactly what I want to say about it yet! Even though my brain hasn't settled down one iota yet! Squirrel! Shiny! Where was I? Oh, yeah... \n \nSo herein find... not a deep thinking piece of any sort, but rather, what pops out as I whirl through thoughts of the last few days, kind of like the wispy pink threads that are spit out of the core of a cotton candy machine, once it heats up and spins up to speed. \n \nSo I now offer up here a few spun sugar thought tendrils that I have caught on the white paper cone I am desperately trying to properly twirl through the bowl of my mind; picking up the feathery wisps and gathering together into something of mass.  \n \n(And have I mentioned I am abysmally bad at the actual cotton candy making in real life, having signed Ethan's 4th grade class up for this particular booth at his school's spring fair this year? I thought it would be easy - ha! It requires a certain sort of coordinated dexterity and speed that are currently beyond me. I  kept making a mess of things. A sweet, sticky mess. I wish someone had taken a picture of me as I finished my turn at the booth covered in cotton candy bits; looking like I'd gone punk with pink and lavender strands strewn throughout my hair.) \n \nBut back to BlogHer (see, my mind, it wanders) here's some nibbles, full meal to come later... \n \nIt start and ends with the people, because that's why I'm really there: seeing my Twitter stream and Facebook feeds come  to life, getting to engage in face to face conversations with people I  already felt intimate with online was, once again, both extraordinary and joyful.  \n \nThursday's Health Minder Day was especially important to me because I was doing the special needs parenting track, and these, THESE were my people. The ones I NEEDED to see, to embrace, to laugh with. \n \nThis year, other than Thursday, I went to less panels than any other year, and certainly less than I'd initially planned. Why? \n \n Yeah.\u00a0 \n \nI WAS READING FRIDAY AFTERNOON. \n \nAnd that kind of took up a looooooooot of brainspace until it was over. And then I was a bit of a limp noodle for the rest of the conference, afterward. \n \nI had snagged a fortuitous invite (thanks  Holly ) to a fabulous offsite event organized by  Beth  and hosted by  Liz , where I ran into a host of friends I'd wanted to meet up with and got my picture taken with Kristin Davis: \n \n \n \n I'm sure Kristin Davis so wishes she had curly hair like the rest of us! \n \nI also learned all about  Zarbee\u2019s  all natural honey based cough products. And? It was the perfect thing to keep me busy and distract me from what was coming up next... \n \n \n \n Me, reading.** \n \n \nI did it! \n \nI took the stage and read my post \"Holding Hands\" as a  \"Voice of the Year\" keynote speaker.  I was number fourteen of fifteen  readers, and as I listened to the others read before me, sharing their  words with the most supportive and accepting audience possible, I actually grew  calmer instead of more nervous, as I'd feared.  \n \nStanding at the podium I did indeed feel all those who had been there before,  standing beside  me in spirit. And not just this year's  speakers but  all five years of Voices, none more so than Susan Niebur, the amazing  \"Why Mommy\" who passed away this past winter after a fierce battle with  metastatic inflammatory breast cancer.  \n \nHearing HER read on  this selfsame stage two years ago at BlogHer 10 was the absolute  highlight of that year, and to me this will always be Susan's stage.  \n \nIt gave me strength as I read my post about my very elderly mother, who  is currently in a much more frail, vulnerable and sad place than when I  had written my essay the previous spring. I had been afraid I was going  to break down and cry. But i got through it by staying in the moment,  feeling the audience, so full of friends and well wishers, right there  with me. \n \nAnd then Shari, the last Voice of this Year, read a   completely hysterical essay  that had me, and everyone in the room,  nearly peeing ourselves with laughter.  \n \n \n \n \n My lovely friend Shari, reading \n \n \nAnd then there were parties, hotel bar conversations, then Saturday, right, Saturday I... I don't even remember what I did on Saturday (limp noodle, remember). Oh, I did time in the Serenity Suite being and helping others be serene. So serene in fact that I fell asleep a bit, sitting upright too. (And  Heather  and  Ellie , being with you there, one of the heartlights of my weekend.) \n \nTruly time for bed now, I'm getting sloppy, happy-lovey here, and I'm stone cold sober. In fact I had all of ONE drink at BlogHer, some ghastly (but effective) concoction at the Aiming Low party.\u00a0  \n \nSo... Everyone was beautiful, I loved you all (even those of you who stepped on my feet whilst dancing to the overloud shitty music) and if I didn't drop your name in this post tonight, that's just because I'm saving you up for my NEXT BlogHer '12 post-mortem post, wherein I will tell all. \n \nOk, not quite all. \n \nBecause what happens at BlogHer stays at BlogHer... well, except for the 4,000 posts being written about it.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 1, 2012", "body": "\n \n  \n \n \n Me with my BlogHer11 Roomies: Alexandra & Shari  \n \n Well, it's the DAY BEFORE BlogHer12 begins, and I have just realized that I have an unpublished post from last summer's  BlogHer11 still sitting in my   \"zombie files\" - where posts that I began and never finished, but to which I'm too attached to just leave for dead, sit and wait for   resurrection...   \n \nOK, don't laugh, here it is: my final BlogHer11 wrap-up post. And only 364 days after the actual event. \n \nOnce again, I\u2019m late to the party; very, very late. Everyone put up their \u201cseriously folks, this is my very last post about BlogHer11\u201d post in late August, about the time I put up  my FIRST one . But here's my little secret: if you're late enough you can be early. \n \nSo really, this isn't a ridiculously late BH11 post, it's another pre-BH12 post. Voila! \n \nPart of it is that I\u2019m just not a quick digester, I like to ruminate (sorry about the visceral image that metaphor may conjure up). And then there\u2019s, you know, my crazy life. Oh, and did I mention I have ADD. Bad. Yeah, that might be part of it too. \n \nBecause I STARTED writing this post on the plane home from BlogHer11 in early August. Last August. \n \nAnd now I'm finishing it the night before BlogHer 12 kicks off here in my own New York City. One whole year later. (Note to self: work on this ADD thing, OK? Sheesh!) \n \nSo.... \n \nFirst of all, I was THERE, at BlogHer11. (And at first I typo-ed that as \u201cBlogHer111\u201d and amused myself by thinking while fixing it, \u201cno that\u2019s not for another 100 years yet.\u201d Now wouldn\u2019t it be something if it were still going on then? Although what that would look like? What media will exist in 2111? I have no idea. So exponential is the rate of technological evolution and advancement at this point, it renders this inquiry mind-bogglingly unimaginable.)  \n \nYes, I actually flew across the country and was immersed up to my elbows in all things Bloggy, at the biggest women\u2019s blogging convention EVER. But, oddly enough, without either the physical or mental capacity to write anything. Oh, I made sure my  SN Sibling Saturdays  guest post went up (by putting in significant 2 AM time at the hotel\u2019s rent-a-computers center). But other than that? Nada. \n \nAnd then I came home to the then nine year-old twins, 24/7. And the Autism. And the ADD. And two weeks worth of everyone\u2019s laundry. And I could go on, but I'll spare you. \n \nSo I went to BlogHer11, and yes it was terrific, in oh so many ways. I had many tales I could tell, especially about being  STYLED  by some wonderful ladies. Did I overindulge a bit, were those three days a little over-stuffed? Yes, you might say. But also deeply satisfying.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nAnd, as always it seems, some of the best parts were unplanned, the result of serendipity or gifts of circumstance; seemingly forced upon me by necessity, but bearing wonderful fruit.  \n \nMost importantly, if I could have afforded it, if I hadn\u2019t been doing it on the way-cheap, on a budget of nearly nothing - early bird conference rate, frequent flyer miles airfare, all but one meal free, ridiculously cheap ride to/from airport, etc. etc.? I probably would have stayed in a room alone (a room to myself being a rare-to-never luxury in my life these days). And that would have been a tragedy of epic proportions.  \n \nBecause, I? Ended up rooming with Royalty and a red-headed TV Star. Oh, yes. \n \nI had booked my room way early FOR ONCE, instead of scrambling at the last minute (usual M.O.) and so I had a much desirable room at the actual conference hotel. I then, eventually (you didn't think I did EVERYTHING on time did you?) set about conjuring up a roommate. \n \nAnd I got two: the  Empress Alexandra  of the blog Good Day Regular People, and the lovely  Shari , she of the blog: Earth Mother Just Means I'm Dusty. Two very funny women. \n \nNow, pretty much everyone seems to know that Alexandra is also known as \"The Empress\" due to the royal names of her children and her regal, generous personalty. Alexandra is a blogger much beloved on the internet, and was being wined and dined by many in San Diego, as she was a Voice of the Year speaker. \n \nBut did you also know that Shari, the amazing \"Dusty\" (aka her blog name) is also a  reality TV star? Yes, beautiful and funny - what a combo - she  recently had her kitchen done over for a reality TV show - and here's  her  v-log post about it .\u00a0  \n \nSo a merrier band has ne\u2019er been seen in all the world. Truly. We got along famously, like a house on fire. It was like the best parts of being college roommates (heart\u2013to-heart discussions in PJs, honest & hilarious clothing & make-up consultations) without all the other crap (being 18 again and confused & insecure - shudder, shudder). \n \nI had known Shari already in real life, both of us being local members of the sadly defunct Silicon Valley Moms Group Blog. We had bonded over being older moms together, and our love of all things New York City.  \n \nAlexandra I had known only online, and I was prepared for a connection, as we had been leaving insightful supportive  comments on each others' posts, and tweeting away together for at least a  year. But I had no idea how much it would be love at first sight. It  was like we had been friends forever. \n \nAnd she brought me & Shari each this wonderful pendant, just because we let her room with us: \n \n \n \n On the back: Super Mom, Super Busy, Super Tired \n \n \nThey were the best roommates EVER. And did not hate me when my husband rang my cell phone at 3 AM local time, waking EVERYONE up, to ask where our son's lunch box might be. (Guess who usually does mornings with the boys?) \n\u00a0  \nLast year, Alexandra was a VOTY reader and this year, Shari and I BOTH are. I think maybe some of Alexandra's sparkly magic, filled the room and cast its glow upon on us while we all slept. \n \nI so look forward to seeing them both again this year, hugging them and riding off into the sunset together... or maybe just cruising the Expo hall in search of Dove bars and a good laugh. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J4D4s-W9PXY/TmIDNqc_xZI/AAAAAAAAAzw/eNKZ0UFsFVg/s1600/DSC02174.JPG", "https://twitter.com/GDRPempress", "https://twitter.com/dustyearthmom", "http://www.dustyearthmother.com/dusty/2011/06/ladies-and-gentlemen-the-kitchen.html", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JIavYcLdJXQ/T8RcXDTshNI/AAAAAAAABl4/kR-bn66g01k/s1600/Talisman+thanks+to+Alexandra.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/lost-stories-of-blogher11-rooming-with.html", "title": "\nLost Stories of BlogHer11: Rooming with Royalty and a TV Star\n"},

{"date": "Friday, August 3, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nToday I have a tremendous honor and privilege. \n \nI get to read a blog post I have written in front about 5,000 people, mostly women, at the Voices of the Year keynote address at the BlogHer convention, here in New York City.  \n \nAnd? This is the friendliest, most receptive, appreciative audience I am ever likely to encounter. \n \nAnd? Fourteen other wonderful writers will be reading along with me, sharing their words of humor, heart, self and belief. Some of these fellow Voices of the Year are old friends, some new. I can not wait to hear them read. \n \nWe bonded yesterday in our nervousness as we rehearsed our movements: from green room to holding area to stage, up and down a variety of steps and staircases (thanking goodness I will not be wearing high heels, having no desire to find out if I can actually fly). \n \nWe each spent a moment, standing center stage in front of this vast empty ballroom, imagining the faces of our friends, eager to hear our stories, shining up at us from below and beyond. \n \nI am looking forward to it. A little anxious, but mostly excited in anticipation. Yesterday I wore a tunic whose pretty pattern was full of tiny butterflies, if you looked closely. When people asked if I was nervous about my upcoming reading I replied \"Not really,\" then pointed out that I was wearing my butterflies on the outside, so I didn't have to have them in my stomach. \n \nVoices of the Year as the Friday afternoon keynote is a BlogHer tradition that goes back to 2008. There are too many amazing writers in the cohort who have read in past years to name them all here, but suffice it to say I am in amazing company. \n \nPolly/Deborah/Wendi/Eden/Jenni/Alexandra/Cecily/Tanis/Jill/Liz/Jenny/Marinka etc. etc. etc... thank you for paving the way. \n \nBut, for me, I will always associate the Voices of the Year with one very special Voice I heard read two years ago, on this same stage in this same ballroom: Susan Niebur, aka Why Mommy. \n \n \n \n Susan's BlogHer10 VOTY Keynote address (photo via  TeachMama ) \n \n \nAt the time she was in the middle of battling yet another recurrence of metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. Susan finally  lost that fight  this year, in February, when her brilliant light was extinguished, much to the sorrow of many, keenest of all to her loving husband and two young sons. \n \nI know I will feel Susan's presence with me as I walk up those steps, place my hands upon that selfsame podium and speak my words. That stage ever belongs to her, to me.\u00a0  \n \nBut this afternoon I will take to it, make it mine for five minutes, share my words with all who will hear. \n \nAnd thank you for listening. \n \nAnd, if you can not be there to hear me, here is what I will read, a slight variation of a post from Spring, 2011: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<!--\n /* Font Definitions */\n@font-face\n {font-family:Times;\n panose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;\n mso-font-charset:0;\n mso-generic-font-family:auto;\n mso-font-pitch:variable;\n mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}\n@font-face\n {font-family:Times;\n panose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;\n mso-font-charset:0;\n mso-generic-font-family:auto;\n mso-font-pitch:variable;\n mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}\n@font-face\n {font-family:Calibri;\n panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;\n mso-font-charset:0;\n mso-generic-font-family:auto;\n mso-font-pitch:variable;\n mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}\n@font-face\n {font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n panose-1:2 11 5 2 2 1 4 2 2 3;\n mso-font-charset:0;\n mso-generic-font-family:auto;\n mso-font-pitch:variable;\n mso-font-signature:-2147483033 0 0 0 503 0;}\n /* Style Definitions */\np.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n {mso-style-unhide:no;\n mso-style-qformat:yes;\n mso-style-parent:\"\";\n margin:0in;\n margin-bottom:.0001pt;\n mso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n font-size:12.0pt;\n mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-fareast-font-family:Times;\n mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n mso-no-proof:yes;}\nh1\n {mso-style-unhide:no;\n mso-style-qformat:yes;\n mso-style-link:\"Heading 1 Char\";\n mso-style-next:Normal;\n margin:0in;\n margin-bottom:.0001pt;\n mso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n page-break-after:avoid;\n mso-outline-level:1;\n font-size:12.0pt;\n mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n mso-font-kerning:0pt;\n mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;\n mso-no-proof:yes;\n text-decoration:underline;\n text-underline:single;}\np.MsoHeader, li.MsoHeader, div.MsoHeader\n {mso-style-priority:99;\n mso-style-link:\"Header Char\";\n margin:0in;\n margin-bottom:.0001pt;\n mso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n tab-stops:center 3.0in right 6.0in;\n font-size:12.0pt;\n mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-fareast-font-family:Times;\n mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n mso-no-proof:yes;}\np.MsoFooter, li.MsoFooter, div.MsoFooter\n {mso-style-priority:99;\n mso-style-link:\"Footer Char\";\n margin:0in;\n margin-bottom:.0001pt;\n mso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n tab-stops:center 3.0in right 6.0in;\n font-size:12.0pt;\n mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-fareast-font-family:Times;\n mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\n mso-no-proof:yes;}\nspan.Heading1Char\n {mso-style-name:\"Heading 1 Char\";\n mso-style-unhide:no;\n mso-style-locked:yes;\n mso-style-link:\"Heading 1\";\n mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-ascii-font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-hansi-font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n font-weight:bold;\n mso-bidi-font-weight:normal;\n mso-no-proof:yes;\n text-decoration:underline;\n text-underline:single;}\nspan.HeaderChar\n {mso-style-name:\"Header Char\";\n mso-style-priority:99;\n mso-style-unhide:no;\n mso-style-locked:yes;\n mso-style-link:Header;\n mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-ascii-font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-hansi-font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-no-proof:yes;}\nspan.FooterChar\n {mso-style-name:\"Footer Char\";\n mso-style-priority:99;\n mso-style-unhide:no;\n mso-style-locked:yes;\n mso-style-link:Footer;\n mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;\n font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-ascii-font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-hansi-font-family:\"Gill Sans\";\n mso-no-proof:yes;}\n.MsoChpDefault\n {mso-style-type:export-only;\n mso-default-props:yes;\n font-size:10.0pt;\n mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt;\n mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;\n font-family:Times;\n mso-ascii-font-family:Times;\n mso-fareast-font-family:Times;\n mso-hansi-font-family:Times;}\n@page WordSection1\n {size:8.5in 11.0in;\n margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;\n mso-header-margin:.5in;\n mso-footer-margin:.5in;\n mso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.WordSection1\n {page:WordSection1;}\n-->\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Holding Hands \n \n \n \n Today my\nmother was tired when I stopped in to visit, planning to take her downstairs to\nlunch.  \n \n \n \n And while\nmany a day I will coax and cajole, force her to rouse herself, to rise to the\noccasion, today I didn't. I let her be. \n \n \n \n Why?\nBecause I was tired, too. \n \n \n \n So I\ndidn't make her make an effort, make her rise and dress, put in her teeth. I\ndid hand her her hearing aid, however, to make conversation less about shouting\nand gesturing, and guessing. \n \n \n \n And then?\nI laid down beside her on the big, now half-empty bed and held her hand. \n \n \n \n And we\ntalked. \n \n \n \n We talked\nabout the little things; about everything and nothing. \n \n \n \n I told\nher how we had just this morning measured Ethan, to find he had grown a full\nhalf-inch in a month. \n \n \n \n She patted\nher head and mine, proclaimed us both lucky in our luxuriant curly hair. \n \n \n \n I talked\nto her about Jacob.  \n \n \n \n \"He's\nstill autistic, isn't he?\" \n \n \n \n \"Oh,\nyes, that's for certain, probably always will be.\" \n \n \n \n Her eyes\nsoften, wishing there were something she could do, finding nothing.  \n \n \n \n \"But\nhe's doing well? He's in a good school?\" \n \n \n \n \"Yes,\nMom, Jake\u2019s doing very well, and in a great school, where they love and\nappreciate him. I'll bring him by soon. He wants to see you, asks for\nyou.\"  \n \n \n \n \u201cSo\neverything is good then?\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cYes,\nMom, everything is just fine, terrific.\u201d \n \n \n \n (Terrific?\nIs not a word I currently use to describe my life. Once you add Special Needs\ninto the mix of kids and family, life becomes many things: intense.\nchallenging, stressful  -  always -\nstressful,  also  meaningful and\nrewarding in ways I had never imagined. But \u201cjust fine\u201d? \u201cTerrific\u201d? Not so\nmuch.)  \n \n \n \n But also,\nthis is news that cannot be shared with my mother, not anymore. She needs to\nknow - to believe - that all is well with me, that caring for her is never a\nburden. She would feel so guilty if she thought she were one more weight heaped\nupon my life. She feels bad enough it\u2019s me taking care of her now instead of\nthe other way around; that  I\u2019M \nwashing out  HER  underpants. So, to\nher, my life needs to be \u201cjust fine.\u201d) \n \n \n \n \"Haven't\nfound me a man yet, have you?\" \n \n \n \n \"Nope,\nMom. They're either too old, too young or too... dull.\" \n \n \n \n She nods\nin agreement, knows my father would be a hard act to follow. Yet, still, she\nlongs for companionship. \n \n \n \n We lay\nside by side, a short arms reach apart as I know she had lain for 51 years with\nmy father on many a morning and evening talking about everything and nothing,\nthe easy rhythms of intimacy. \n \n \n \n I know\nthis well in my own life, with my husband (though in these frantic child-rearing\nyears, our quietly together times are much fewer and farther between)  \u00a0 -- and also with my son Ethan who zealously\nhoards his bedtime talking time with me, needing so much to process his day\nbefore releasing it to slumber.  \n \n \n \n I held my\nmother\u2019s hand.  \n \n \n \n We talked\nof this and that, and then we drifted off to sleep; took a little nap, side by\nside, our fingertips a bridge from daughter to mother. \n \n \n \n \"I'm going to be 89\nsoon,\"  she\nhad said, \"Imagine that.\" \n \n \n \n \"I\ncan. I do. I'm no spring chicken myself, you know.\"  \n \n \n \n \"I plan to make it to\n100.\"  Then,\nshaking her head, \"Not\nlikely.\" \n \n \n \n \"Why\nnot?\" I\u2019d asked \"Why not?' \n \n \n \n She just\nsmiled. \n \n \n \n We\nnapped. \n \n \n \n I woke\nfirst, slipped my hand from her now lax fingers, stepped into the kitchen to do\na little cleaning up after my formerly fastidious mother who now sees no dirt. \n \n \n \n I came\nback to wake her, to say goodbye. (There was so much to be done back across\ntown, in my own life: groceries to purchase, children to retrieve, encroaching domestic\nchaos to beat back.) \n \n \n \n But first\nI sat softly on the bed, gently clasped my mother\u2019s hand once again, leaned\nover to gaze at her barely lined, still beautiful face; whispered quietly,\nbeneath the threshold of her dimmed hearing:  \n \n \n \n \"Why\nnot, 100? Why not?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L3gw9ELoe4o/UBvCrDgTJDI/AAAAAAAACCA/_fsAsXfMsVs/s1600/BlogHer+12.png", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rm4hxzPdjoA/TzHEs-6wVcI/AAAAAAAABQ8/i38AO2juAXo/s1600/blogher-8-315x236.jpg", "http://teachmama.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/08/listen-to-voices.html", "title": "\nListen to the Voices\n"},

Believe me, even drugged up on the c-section happy juice, I remember that.) \n \nI have already told the story here (twice!) of how amazing that day was:  last year when you turned nine,  and the year before that  when you became eight.  So no need to rehash. \n \nLet me just say, I am so excited as you stand here, on the cusp of your official \"tweendom,\" headed soon into teenagehood and so much more beyond that. \n \nBeing an older mom (and feeling more and more ancient each day) can be very useful, sometimes.

I look ahead three short years and see you already have a Bar Mitzvah date (October 10, 2015 if you're into long range planning).  \n \nEthan, this is your last year of elementary school, and middle school awaits (and getting you into a good one, the bane of NYC public school existence, is my nearly full time job for the next few months). There is so much you have been looking forward to about this, your \"senior\" year, most of all when you will dominate the basketball court as a 5th grader.  \n \nJacob, you have finished your two years as a \"Level Two\" student at your  wonderful school , and are moving up to \"Level Three\" with new teachers in a new building. I hope the transition goes smoothly for you, and that this year's teachers will love you as much as your last. I'm thinking with how lovable you are, they certainly will, and promise I will be by your side to make sure you feel safe secure and happy as you negotiate the changes. \n \nAnd, as much as I am looking forwards, birthdays always make me look backwards, too.

{"date": "Monday, July 23, 2012", "body": "\n \n  \n \n \n \nI haven't done  Stasha\u2019s  Monday Listicles in a dog's age. But today's topic is \"BIRTHDAYS\" and as the boys turn 10 at the end of this week and my (Ahem!) significantly-more-than-that birthday (52nd) is not far behind, I though I'd better participate. \n \nAnd I want to be fun and light today, as my life so is NOT at this moment... so (conjuring frothy, frothy thoughts from the far recesses of my brain) here is my list of: \n \n TOP 10 WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT BIRTHDAYS!: \n \n 1. \u00a0 People have to be really nice to you. OR you can make them feel really guilty if they're not. Either way, it's a win. (Wait, did I just say that out loud?) \n \n 2. \u00a0 Birthday cakes. And have I ever told you I make kick-ass ones for my boys? No? See here: \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \n 3. \u00a0 Childhood memories - mine. I could tell you about pretty much all the birthdays of my childhood: beach picnics and backyard barbecues, pointy pink party hats and unwrapping beloved barbie dolls. For a few years we found ourselves in Maine with my cousins' family in mid-August, and as Annette's birthday is a scant four days after mine, we would make these marvelous co-celebratory lobster dinners. \n \nAnother thing that occurs regularly in mid-August is the Pleiades meteor shower. One night in\u00a0 Maine, smack in the middle of our birthdays, I remember the grown-ups waking all the kids up and hustling us outdoors in our PJs at midnight, wrapped in quilts and blankets to lie on the ground and look up at the heavens.\u00a0 I saw the sky above us exploding in light as a seeming million stars streaked across, some appearing to travel all the way down to the cliffs we lay atop, to douse themselves into the ocean that lay just beyond. \n \n 4. \u00a0 Childhood memories - creating them for the kids. Since we live in the city and don't have a yard, backyard barbecues are definitely out. We do, however, live right near a great city park - Riverside Park. And thus for the first seven years of their lives, the boys had wonderful, huge, blowout parties in the park. \n \nThis meant we could invite everyone we wanted to, whole families always welcome. And we got incredibly lucky, because summer afternoons in NYC? Often means thunderstorms. But for seven years (7!) in a row, we had good weather on their birthday party days. And then finally for their 8th birthday I had the feeling our luck had run its course, plus the boys were getting big for just running amok or being entertained by a very patient clown. \n \n \n \n Boys Birthday Party 2006 \n \nSo we're now doing events. This year: a movie (Ice Age: Continental Drift) followed by pizza, followed by a behind the scenes tour at our local Rita's Ices (where we have become friends with the manager) and actually getting to help make a batch of Italian ice. And then eating it, of course. \n \n 5. \u00a0 Having a nice quiet dinner alone with my husband. (Stop laughing, we may have actually pulled this off once or twice.) \n \n 6. \u00a0 Having a cousin who paves the way for me. You may have heard me mention this before, but my other cousin, Jessie, the sister to Annette, is nearly exactly my age, having been born four months ahead of me, in April. We were incredibly close as children, and still are in ways I can't begin to describe, even if a month can go by, these currently busy days, without a phone call.  \n \nAnd thus I have always had four months to adjust to whatever age I am about to turn. Having the certain knowledge in the pit of my being that Jess and I are \"the same age\" as soon as she flips over to the next digit, I feel a part of me doing so in lock-step up as well. \n \nSo unlike folks who cling to their previous age until the day before their birthday, fighting the inevitable tooth and claw, I will find myself claiming to be my next age, quite unconsciously, from mid April on. Therefore all the possible trauma about aging has been removed from my actual birthday, and it's just a good excuse to eat and drink well, with people I love. Win-win. \n \n 7. \u00a0 Being a tourist in my own city. For years I had a tradition of celebrating my birthday by doing the kind of fun, touristy things we tend to do only when we have out of town visitors, but doing them instead with a close friend or two, a mate, or by myself if necessary. I've been up to the top of the Empire State Building, out to see the Statue of Liberty, and circled my city on a tour boat. \n \nWhat stands out the most is my birthday spent up at the top of the World Trade Towers, observing the city and surrounds from the observation deck, followed by lunch at Windows on the World. I had imagined taking my (as yet unconceived) kids there someday.  Gone. Gone. Gone. \n \n 8. \u00a0 Recalling, vividly, every year of my kids lives. As birthday time rolls around I always start to marvel again at how big they've grown in just a year, how far they have come in their development, albeit at different paces.\u00a0 It sends me to the photo album - OK, technically to the virtual one that is the iPhoto program on my computer - to look up birthdays and years past, loving simultaneously the little boys they were and the big boys they have become. \n \n 9. \u00a0 Recalling, vividly, every moment of the day my boys were born. Ethan and Jacob came into this world a scant twelve days shy of my own (42nd) birthday, and therefore I have claimed them as my best birthday present EVER. \n \nAt our birthday time, and especially ON their actual birthday I find myself reliving that whole special day; from the incredible anticipation of leaving our home as two, knowing that we would be returning as four, to the first time I laid eyes on my darling boys and my heart instantly tripled in size, to my first sleepless night with their little burrito-bundled bodies in my arms.  \n \n \n \n \n(Unless it's also the day of their party that year, when I would find myself running around like an exhausted headless chicken, getting everything and everybody ready for the ensuing fun and mayhem.) \n \n 10.  \u00a0 Cake. I know I listed it twice. Because it IS. JUST. THAT. GOOD. Especially homemade. Especially when topped with ice cream.  \n \nAnd there you have it folks. Not a single word about death or autism. For today, at least. Tune in tomorrow... \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.northwestmommy.com/category/monday-listicles", "http://www.northwestmommy.com/category/monday-listicles", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9Y-5WR7jiUY/TT011NPAudI/AAAAAAAAAX4/O5hmdHuTCM8/s1600/DSC07677.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6lPCga1ey9s/TT9TCZSiEdI/AAAAAAAAAYU/iAF0uG0ePkc/s1600/DSC06136.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m4e0LP_9SSs/UA3nrL74C1I/AAAAAAAAB2w/UBcVypYYfZk/s1600/DSCN1232.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dv5jRW39TZA/TFip3UKAU2I/AAAAAAAAAEY/BU50kRflfVo/s1600/img009_2.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/07/monday-listicles-10-wonderful-things.html", "title": "\nMonday Listicles: 10 Wonderful Things about BIRTHDAYS\n"},

{"date": "Friday, July 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nWell, I figured if I made the title long enough I wouldn't actually have to write much of a post. Doesn't work that way does it? No? I thought not. \n \nCan't I just distract and dazzle you with photos of BlogHers past?\u00a0  \n \n \n \n Me & Jenny at BlogHer10 \n \nCan't I just recycle one of my pre-BlogHer posts from the past two years? My funny, irreverent one from last year -\u00a0  NOT a BlogHer primer - or - Don't take advice from ME!  that sort of was a primer? \n \nOr how about the one from 2010 -  Look, Ma, I'm going to BlogHer  - wherein I told tales out of Sundance and other conferences from my old life?  \n \nNo? \n \nOK, so here it is: \n \nBlogHer 2012, the biggest, baddest women's blogging conference in the world, coming back to my home town (NYC) and staring in less than two weeks. And I'm... really not thinking about it much. Too much else on my plate, right now.\u00a0  \n \nWhich is completely ridiculous as this year IS a big deal, or rather  it's the biggest deal I'm ever likely to experience at a BlogHer  conference as I'm one of the 15 Voice of the Year readers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThat means getting up on the stage and reading in front of 4,000 or so fellow bloggers. (Well, the ones who aren't off at fancy private parties, or glued to their bar stools in the Hilton lounge downstairs, or still stuffing swag into their bags in the Expo Hall, that is.) \n \nAnd have I bought new clothes, lost twenty pounds, had my front teeth fixed, had my hair professionally dyed and well cut? Um, that would be no. People are going to have to take me as I am, the imperfect semi-disheveled mom of my day-to-day life. \n \nHave I filled out a planning spreadsheet, gotten myself invited to a thousand glittery private parties, set up all my meals with people I need to see? No again. There is just going to have to be a lot of serendipity involved this year. \n \nI have bigger fish to fry. \n \n(My Mother.) \n \nI may even have to miss a part of the  conference, as I can't spend five straight days without going to see and  take care of my mother, wherever she may be at that point. (Her latest tentative release date from rehab is July 30th, and yet she can't go back to living on her own as she is, and I have no idea how this is going to work out.) \n \nThe one thing I am doing is praying hard for no major crisis in any part of my life on August 3rd. I really want to read.  \n \nSo the shakeout of all this, is that I have neither the time nor inclination to be anxious about BlogHer this year. Not that I was much in other years either (see aforementioned posts, I really don't get the per-conference jitters) but it's possible the whole reading in front of 4000 other (mostly) women thing might have gotten me a little spooked.   \n \nBut no, I'm just going to show up and... whatever whatever. Because the hamster running on the wheel in my brain is so completely burnt out right now, I have very little capacity for planning anything beyond my next moment. Other than, you know, making sure the kids are properly awakened/fed/medicated/lunch-made/backpack-packed/sunscreened/dropped-off/picked-up/dinner-fed/entertained/medicated/bathed/bedded.  \n \nAnd making sure that this will all still go on smoothly while I'm busy at BlogHer.  Because even though I will be sleeping at home? I have warned the family that it is going to be LIKE I am away, so expect me to be completely MIA. But, ha!  \n \nGuaranteed I will be called back to duty for some minor emergency or other. (Yes, honey, I still remember that 6am YOUR time, but 3am MY time phone call last year to ask where Jake's lunch box might be kept.) \n \nWhen I stop to think about it for a minute (pause, OK) I am actually very excited about meeting up with dear friends, old and new, distant and near. I can't wait to see my roommates from last year (The Empress) Alexandra and (Dusty Earth Mom) Shari. \n \n \n \n Me with BH11 roomies Alexandra & Shari - the 3 Bloggeteers! \n \nLast year Alexandra was a Voice of the Year reader, and this year, Shari and I BOTH are. We think maybe The Empress was our lucky charm. So if you want to be a reader next year, maybe you should go rub her belly for luck. (My dear Alexandra, if a bunch of women accost you next week, forgive me!) \n \nI am also so excited about meeting up with my autism and other special needs parenting cohort at the Thursday Health Minders Day track for us, about taking care of ourselves as we take care of others. Hmmmm... needed much? (YES! YES! YES!) There are too many names to name here, but you know who you are, my peeps, and I can't WAIT to squeeee with you. \n \nAnd then there's my Listen to Your Mother clan - both the New York performers & production team and my producing/directing counterparts from around the country. I can't wait to see them all, and especially our fearless leader, Ann Imig. \n \nAnd if you're going to be at BlogHer, YOU should be sure to come to the Listen to Your Mother Open Mike Salon. It was a highlight of last year's BlogHer and promises to be even better this year!!! \n \nI am also doing a stint hosting the Serenity Suite - come visit me there on Saturday from 12-1 and again from 4-5. \n \nOK, looks like I'm actually getting scheduled up, going to be pretty busy there, after all. (Note to self: remember to make up Jake's thrice daily vitamin & medicine packs to last through next Sunday, TODAY!) \n \nAnd? If you're at BlogHer and you're my friend? \n \nPlease come to the Friday afternoon keynote address and sit front and center, so I can see some familiar faces in that sea of humanity when I'm reading, just in case the nerves DO creep up on me. Okay? Thanks. \n \nHave a happy BlogHer everyone! \n \np.s.

{"date": "Thursday, July 12, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n  \n \n \n Me & my Aunt Eva, 1992 \n \n \nIt has been days since I have written. I am not wanting to write; and I ALWAYS want to write. \n \nI even missed my Hopeful Parents day on Monday (I will somehow write that post and put it up tomorrow, better late than never). \n \nIt's not just the busyness. I am always busy. \n \nI am just seriously tired of what is running around on the hamster wheel of my brain right now. \n \nI  am tired of death and autism and special needs and medications and  doctors and insurance companies and death and care-taking and dealing with medical  establishments and death and clutter and real estate and paperwork and  death and money (the lack thereof) and death. \n \nI have had too many conversations about cemeteries and plots, about hospice protocols, about funerals.  \n \nMy Aunt Eva is still with us for now, in that childlike state some people enter in the process of dying. \n \nAnnette  says she has moments of playfulness and energy when she will awaken and  smile beamingly at everyone gathered around her, lift her hands up by  her face at wiggle her fingers, the wordless way one plays with a baby.  And yet, she is the baby this time. \n \nShe speaks rarely, and sometimes in German, her first language.  When Annette shared this I remembered something my husband had told me,  of how his father, slowly dying in their apartment when he was a  teenager, babbled away in the Yiddish of his childhood for the last few  weeks of his life. \n \nI'll be seeing Eva today. Saying hello and another possible goodbye. I'll be able to manage a long visit with my mother, too, as Ethan is off on a three-day camping trip, and thus I don't have to rush back to the city to pick him up at 4. \n \nOn Tuesday, driving out to Long Island, what is usually a fast, against the flow of traffic trip ground to a screeching grinding halt early on, in Queens. I figured there had to have been an accident, and there were, in fact, TWO on the Grand Central Parkway at the same time. \n \nEastbound, in my direction, it was just a minor finder bender, but a little further on, Westbound, was a major conflagration. Not just due to rubbernecking, as there was an emergency vehicle in the left lane of our direction, I passed so slowly that I looked over to the other side, just to see what the hell was going on that could snarl traffic in both directions so thoroughly. \n \nAnd in that moment I saw a white sheet being lifted up, an outflopped arm - tanned, male, short sleeve blue uniform shirt - being placed back within, once again enshrouded. \n \nI couldn't unsee it. It played over and over in my mind. A fatal accident. I tried not to take it as an omen. I was ever glad that I was alone, that the boys weren't with me, that questions did not need to be asked and answered.  \n \nEthan is already a little over curious about car accidents, thrilled with the tale I told him of the  near disastrous crash Dan and I were in on our honeymoon . \n \nI have not yet spun for him the tale of the taxi cab fatality I witnessed, was a part of, one morning newly pregnant with him and his twin. \n \nBut it came back to mind a lot Tuesday, one tragically dead body calling up the ghost of another. \n \nAnd really, could everyone just stop dying for a while. I want to write, think about something else for a change. \n \nOn Tuesday I made my mother promise to stick around until her 90th birthday in September. \"We'll celebrate together!\" I'd told her, as Annette, Trina, Mom and I munched on cookies from the Hungarian Pastry Shop I'd brought out with me. \n \n\"I'm planning to live to 100!\" she'd reassured me. \n \nA promise I hope she''ll keep. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PVlPAqsLoug/T_60ObbguOI/AAAAAAAABz4/akzVC0ESEWQ/s1600/IMG_3608.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/07/burnout-factor.html", "title": "\nBurnout Factor\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n  \n \n \n \nAs you may well imagine, Jacob is nearly beside himself with anticipation over this weekend's opening of the Batman movie: The Dark Knight Rises. Batman has been an on-and-off obsession of his for years. \n \n \n \n Two-Face, one of Jacob's favorite Batman villains \n \n \nAs far as autistic obsessions go, I find Jacob's fascinations with superheros (& their counterparts, super villains) to be, well, fascinating. He is particularly intrigued with the notion of the double / secret identity. \n \nHe is always talking (in his way, which means asking closed-loop questions) about  this. \n \n\"Who is Bruce Wayne, Mom?\" (Only acceptable answer = \"Batman\")  \n \n\"Who is Batman?\" (Answer: \"Bruce Wayne\") \n \nOccasionally he will get deeper into the matter of the transformation itself and ask \"What happens when Batman puts on his cape, Mom?\" (Answer: \"He becomes Batman.\") \n \nThat it's an obsession with people - albeit fictional people - makes me happier than if it were, say, train schedules for (an overused) example. Especially since he also likes to talk about what they are thinking and feeling. \n \n \n \n According to Jake this is \"Bane\" the main bad guy of the new movie \n \nWe are going to a 9 AM screening on Saturday (remember, Dan is in  \"the business\" and the producer is a friend of his) and Jake can't stop  asking \"What are we doing on Saturday, Mom?\" even though he knows full  well the answer. \n \n \n \n \nI am very glad Jake has an activity to keep him happily occupied on these dreadful heat-wave weekend days. He will go though a half ream of paper over the course of a week. \n \nAnd  have you noticed how his style is evolving?\u00a0 He is drawing fewer giant  heads and starting to include more bodies, slowly figuring out how to do  that (whereas before, his bodies were mostly vaguely rectangular shaped  lumps). \n \nHis faces are becoming a little less  interesting in the process, but I'm sure the details will come back once  he gets this body stuff figured out. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd the rest of these guys aren't necessarily Batman related, but just some of the recent crop that I found particularly intiguing or endearing. \n \nEnjoy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I think of this one as \"Introspective Superman\" - less chiseled, more thoughtful \n \n \n (For more Jacob art posts, click  HERE .) \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uxF02o70aoQ/UAbCMcg2gSI/AAAAAAAAB1Q/nU3QsOLPbnY/s1600/IMG_3682.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7fekW76YR0Q/UAbCNzoQcbI/AAAAAAAAB1Y/wzsjjVuxAPM/s1600/IMG_3683.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5vgn7CyRWw8/UAbCSrkgw9I/AAAAAAAAB1w/ssYHYsFFWVg/s1600/IMG_3690.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sWxwrqsrc28/UAbCUMNlizI/AAAAAAAAB14/LxaBDL0mbKI/s1600/IMG_3691.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jyYsk6G07JQ/UAbCVneoeqI/AAAAAAAAB2A/eje-s65jAg4/s1600/IMG_3692.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16l-5_BiURk/UAbCLPmC40I/AAAAAAAAB1I/pozUk1J-p7c/s1600/IMG_3681.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LkrJj5tuVkQ/UAbCPcQLY2I/AAAAAAAAB1g/mGcIYn6gA7o/s1600/IMG_3684.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CyKYAtIvecA/UAbCQ8QcEtI/AAAAAAAAB1o/NFouSqBO-gc/s1600/IMG_3685.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XH4n_9-xRfI/UAbCXEK8tgI/AAAAAAAAB2I/vLBrMlM04no/s1600/IMG_3693.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6-CaDmXquLA/UAbCYohFbZI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/d8TRMV-JZqg/s1600/IMG_3694.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/07/more-from-jacobs-batman-files.html", "title": "\nMore from Jacob's Batman files\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 14, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nI'm still pinned to the wall, a bug squashed against the windshield of life.\u00a0 And yet I want to check in here, to let you know... \n \nSome things this week went right: \n \n \n \n Ethan & friend preparing to launch on camping trip \n \nEthan had a great 3-day overnight camping trip with his day-camp. He's been watching the older kids do this for years, and now he finally IS them. Perfect weather. Good friends. Kid food galore. And he came home only slightly sunburnt. Total win. \n \nJake asked for and got a haircut Friday, and is very happily telling everyone about it. \n \n \n \n Before the cut \n \n \n \n Haircut! (Handsome boy) \n \n \nI had a lovely, long visit with my mother Thursday. I gave her a manicure, a lenghty process as I have to do one hand at a time and let it totally dry before doing the other one. \n \nThis is because she has a need to blow her nose. A LOT (she has a two tissue box a day habit). And so if I do both hands at once, one gets ruined in the nose blowing/wiping process. She just can't help herself. \n \n \n \n Mom, showing off manicure \n \n \nI went to dinner with her, which was a good thing as I found out that in spite of my talking to the nutritionist at intake, she was getting food she really dislikes. No wonder she isn't eating enough and is losing weight. \n \nI looked at the tough hunk of \"pork loin\" on her plate and asked why she had chosen this for dinner, as I knew it was not going to end up crossing her lips. \"I don't choose, they just bring me food.\" was her reply. \n \n\"Mom, you fill out a menu choice form.\" I remind her. \"No,\" she says \"I don't. They just bring me food. I don't like a lot of it.\"  \n \nSo those menu things they bring each week that she's supposed to be circling her choices on? She was just adding them to the pile of papers on her dresser. Had no idea what they were for. \n \nIt seems no matter how many times you tell people your mother has cognitive and memory issues, because she is so bright and with-it in the moment, they treat her like she is capable of a level of self-management and decision making that she really just isn't. \n \nYou can't just hand her a menu and tell her to turn it in later. You have to sit with her and ask her questions. Fill it out for her. Really.\u00a0  \n \nI had a long, possibly LOUD talk with the head of dining and now *I* will get the weekly menus to make choices for her. \n \nAfter dinner (a nice piece of fish was hastily procured for her, and she ate a good half of it!) I took her outside into one of the courtyards. It had been too hot early in the afternoon when I had arrived, but by six thirty was delightful. \n \n \n \n \nMom loves flowers so. It lifted her spirits immeasurably to sit in a garden, even a somewhat scraggly one. And it was the perfect place for me to give her a good shoulder / neck / back massage (as I try to do every time I visit). \n \nI left her in her room, digging in to the new puzzle book I'd brought. She had been awake, alert and lively for the entire visit. A vast improvement over past weeks, and even just this past Tuesday. Step by step. Bit by bit, coming back to life. \n \nAnd then I was on to see my aunt, uncle and cousins, not even a mile from Mom. We sat in the yard and drank in each others company and cocktails (virgin for me, drive home ahead). \n \n \n \n Flower in my aunt & uncle's garden \n \nHow much I love my family can not be measured. How they are circling round the wagons, all come in to care for and spend Eva's last significant days with her, so beautiful to see. \n \n \n \n \n \n Greta, 14, borrowed my iPhone to take \"selfies\" \n \nAnd Eva herself had a bit of a rally. Was asking for food.

{"date": "Sunday, July 8, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n  \n \n \n Eva & Mom, 10 days ago \n \n \n\"Varda, I think I'm dying\" my Mother says when we visit her, pulling me close so as not to scare the children. But \"No,\" I reassure her, \" you  are not dying.\" \n \nNot yet. Frail as she has become in these past two months, she is robust, sparkling, clearly still full of the stuff of life. Clearly because we have come from my cousin's childhood house, where my Aunt Eva is deep into the business of dying. And the difference is stark, unmistakable. \n \nAt this point in my life I, unfortunately, know full well what a dying person looks like. This is good when it comes time to reassure my mother it is not her, that her mortal coil is not easily shook off. That right now she's just having a devil of a time recovering from her fall and broken hip. (Old people heal slow, that's just the facts.) \n \nBut it's not so good when I sit with my Aunt Eva, possibly for the last time. I know what I am seeing. There is a far off look to her eyes, a done-with-this-ness to her body, every movement bought precious from a deep dearth of energy. \n \nShe is mostly sleeping, and her sleep is mostly peaceful. Her family have come together to give her a good death. Home. Surrounded by the ones she loves best. Her comfort everyone's foremost priority, no pushing, no prodding. Letting this happen as naturally as possible except for the pain part; minimizing that. \n \nA good death that comes at the end of a long good life. It's what we all want.  \n \nAnd Eva has had a good life - education, meaningful career, family, financial security, community. Not perfect, not charmed, but good. \n \nYet it was almost one cut short, nearly no life at all. As a young teen she one of the very last Jews to escape Germany, on possibly the very last boat out, allowed into this country only because her father's friends had conspired to find a job for him that could be filled by none other - the Metropolitan Museum of Art was suddenly in desperate need of an expert on unicorn imagery in medieval tapestries, and he happened to be the world's foremost authority, imagine that! \n \nOur trip out to Long Island yesterday was good and hard in equal parts. I wanted to be there for Annette, I needed to say goodbye to Eva, though what I said to her, literally, was: \"I love you, I love your daughters and grandchildren, we will always be family.\" \n \nLeaving her side, my back turned, I mouthed my silent \"goodbye\" closed my eyes for a moment to settle my heart back into place, then headed out into the stifling heat of the yard where the children were gathered, waiting to launch.  \n \nWe had come with yet another mission, furthering the next generation's cousinly bonding, as so took Katrina out with us for a local jaunt: hours of fun in the Manorhaven pool, a quick visit to my Mom and then late dinner in the town diner. \n\u00a0  \n \n \n Ethan and Trina looking tough after a good swim \n \n \n \n \n Ethan visiting Mom \n \n \nAs we left I peeked back into the room where Eva lay. Her husband, my Uncle Walter, was sitting close by her side, holding her hand, gingerly stroking it gently as possible, the one touch she can  now stand. \n \nHe was gazing upon her face as if to drink it in for all time to come.\u00a0 There was nothing in that room but love and tenderness, and leavetaking. \n \nIt's how we all want to go, if given a choice. \n \nA good death that comes at the end of a long, good life.  \n \nSurrounded by love.  \n \nIn relative comfort, in spite of a failing body. \n \nWith sufficient children and grandchildren to know your genetic legacy will live on, beyond you. \n \nLeaving behind many who will remember you; in whose lives you have made a difference; who hear your voice in their heads, giving advice (whether they take it or not). \n \nI am expecting a call soon. \n \nToday. Tomorrow. Whenever. (Probably within the week.) \n \nWe've had a good run, my family, this generation all making it into their 80s and 90s. But every lucky streak must eventually come to an end. \n \nSometime, probably not this week, but likely within the year, it truly will be my mother's time. \n \nFor a while it looked like she and Eva were running neck and neck for the next to leave us, but my mother has flopped up upon the banks of life, while Eva is swimming hard toward that other shore. \n \nMy mom is a tough old bird, after all.  \n \nSome life left in her. \n \nEnough to appreciate flowers; a beautiful sunset; a hot fudge sundae, and the nieces (and grand-nieces) that bring it to her, before they drive the short mile back home to their dying mother. \n \nI hold them all in my heart.  \n \n \n \n Our visit to Mom: Trina, Jake & Ethan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CCEf235-FIE/T_l4T7oqSZI/AAAAAAAABzk/CPJMgWLV-FA/s1600/Mom+&+Eva,+10+days+ago.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1EAahItfnQk/T_lwkmUQw_I/AAAAAAAABzI/QbUxk0CHFOQ/s1600/IMG_3540.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bW3HNNUNCy4/T_lwnQGDYGI/AAAAAAAABzY/t2xRINnOJpc/s1600/IMG_3543.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--Ar9D1PoB8Y/T_lwmNPKfcI/AAAAAAAABzQ/sObPboMHxRc/s1600/IMG_3541.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/07/the-living-and-dying.html", "title": "\nThe living and the dying\n"},

I don't have the concentration, the focus. \n \nWhen I have a spare five minutes I play word games with friends on my computer or my phone. I know these are \"time wasters\" and I have none to spare, yet need the mindless soothing they provide. challenges with quick and clear outcomes (I won! I lost!) resolved in minutes, as opposed to weeks, months, lifetimes. \n \nJake woke up at 5 AM today again. He says it's \"bad dreams\" but I have no idea if this is really about dreams or if that's just a phrase he's picked up from TV/books/movies and finds convenient. \n \nHe won't elaborate. Neither is he capable of getting back to sleep.  \n \nSo another night's sleep shot to hell for me. \n \nIt's supposed to be the hottest day of the year today. Triple digits. \n \nWe're supposed to be going out to the Island, me and the boys, see my mother, my cousin Annette and niece Katrina; find a body of water to throw our overheated bodies into.  \n \nBut if I don't get a bit more sleep I'll be too tired to safely drive.  \n \nAnd now it's 7 and Ethan has awakened, also too early. \n \nThey will probably fall asleep in the car. Which is OK. (As long as I don't.) \n \nExcept it will probably be five minutes before we arrive at Mom's rehab center. So I'll be on the horns of a dilemma: drive around aimlessly to let them sleep a bit longer, eating up fossil fuels and making my mother wait for our visit, or wake them up after a mere cat nap and carry on. \n \nHow I wish I could declare today a lazy-stay-home-all-day-electronics day. But we need to see my mother, my cousins, and most importantly my Aunt Eva. \n \nShe is come home from the hospital now, under hospice care. All she really wants now is to be left alone. Although vastly more comfortable home than in the hospital, everything is still all too much. \n \nTouch hurts, bothers her.  \n \nShe has stopped eating, will take water in small sips from a spoon. \n \nThis may change. But if it doesn't... \n \n \n \nI am sure she has no interest in seeing me. But I need to see her. \n \nTo say goodbye. To be there for my cousins and my uncle (who himself just developed walking pneumonia, being there for everyone else and neglecting the care of his own self). \n \nAll I want is to lie in front of an air conditioner and sleep. \n \nWake up and eat blueberries with sour cream; something I thought was disgusting as a kid, but now invokes my mother in the summer so strongly I feel she is at my side, lifting my spoon to her own mouth as I sit and take in the light and the dark, the sour and the sweet.

In fact, sometimes I go the opposite way and roll too much with the punches, fail to react with the alacrity necessary to a given situation. \n \nAnd while the uber-anxious among you may be thinking \"Gee that's great, bully for you!\" I have to say there's a considerable down side.\u00a0 Because when I AM actually anxious? It freaks me the hell out. \n \nMy tolerance for anxiety is kind of zilch. \n \nSo when I was single and dating and feeling all anxious about a relationship that was neither here not there? I would often push the other person until they broke up with me, just so I could have some resolution and therefore a drop in my anxiety level. Of course then I would get all mopey and depressed. But depression was much more comfortable to me than anxiety, and THAT I could live with. Not exactly a winning strategy. \n \nSo lately due to a bunch of converging crap in my life, I have been feeling more than my usual share of anxiety, and frankly that is making me, well, anxious. But this time there's no ambivalent boyfriend or girlfriend to pick a fight with, to quickly resolve this thing. \n \nI'm certainly not going to speed my mother toward the purchase of the farm just to relieve myself of the jitters around not knowing her actual expiration date. \n \nI'm not going to fire my kids and replace them, even though some other, more neurotypical ones would be easier to manage.

{"date": "Friday, June 29, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n\n\n     \n \n \n Ethan & Jake in the Mist Zone \n \n \nToday was the last day of Jacob's two week break between the end of school-school and the beginning of camp-school (what we call summer school around here so it can feel more like what Ethan does which is capital \"C\" Camp). \n \nI had planned on having it be a very magical \"Mom and me\" time for him with special trips and activities, but then things with MY Mom went South and well, I have barely given my poor boy the time of day. Our \"big trips\" have been to go visit my Mom, first in the hospital and then in the Long Island rehab center. \n \nJacob doesn't mind of course, he loves to see his Grandma, and in fact, talks about her all the time right now, asks to see pictures of her from our trips. \"Let me see Grandma sick\" he requests, scrolling through my iPhone for all the recent images of her. \n \nToday though, being the last of the last, I was planning something special. That is until a very loud thunderstorm woke him up irreparably at 5:05 this morning. With Jake out of school and Ethan's camp sporting a 9:30 start time, that meant that he and therefore *I* was up a whopping THREE hours before expected. \n \nAnd me, seriously under-slept at this point means seriously cranky and no fun at all. \n \nI was seriously cranky and no fun at all. \n \nSo instead of a day at a museum and playground, Jake had a day in front of the TV at his drawing table. He got to watch a whole Batman the Animated Series DVD and go though about a quarter ream of paper. He was perfectly happy. \n \nI felt like a crappy parent, but what else is new these days. \n \nWe took an exciting trip across town to pick up some medication samples from a doctor for a drug that otherwise costs upwards of $175 a month on our crappy insurance plan, and then exciting trip back to the West Side in time to pick Ethan up from Camp. \n \nIt was HOT in New York City today, one of those real deadly summer scorchers we all dread. After pick-up there was a resounding call for lemon ices from the camp canteen so we indulged. \n \nAnd right near the canteen and shaded sitting area was the \"mist zone\" - a misty sprinkler you can run through (or stand in) to cool down considerably. It was running full blast today. \n \nNow, in the past, Jacob has had considerable difficulty with getting wet when not in his bathing suit and in a swimming situation (when he is then perfectly happy to spend the day submerged) but that has been changing lately (thank goodness!) and I was curious to see what would happen here. \n \nAnd indeed, Jacob was seriously interested in cooling down and joining in the fun. What was most amazing was that he observed that many of the other boys had taken off their shirts and he asked if he could take his off, too. \n \nAnd if you know anything about autism, you'll know how stellar this was, and that I was over the moon. My boy looking to what the other kids are doing and deciding he wants to do things the same way. And then having a great time doing so. (Autism Mom swoon.) \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n One happy boy \n \n \nMuch fun was had. Ethan was even in a generous spirit towards his brother and played in the mist with him a bit, horsed around under the shade tent. \n \n \n \n \n \n Yes, that is Jake under that towel \n \nAnd then? And then? I made the rookie mistake of counting my happiness chickens before they'd hatched. Because walking from camp back to Broadway to catch the bus home, somewhere in the middle of 111th Street, Jacob asked to watch TV when we got home and I did not say \"Absolutely yes.\" I told he we weren't going to talk about TV right now. \n \nEthan had lost screen time for the rest of the day (don't ask, a third ignoring of my admonishment against doing something) and I didn't want to promise Jake TV right away until I could figure out how to wrangle keeping it away from Ethan at the same time. \n \nAnd then some combination of the extreme heat and the earliness of the rising and the fickle gods of autism deciding their free pass had expired kicked in. Jake heard a \"no\" where I had said a \"maybe\" and he just lost his shit in a way he hasn't for a while. \n \nScreaming crying wailing and shouting, much stomping and rolling around on the sidewalk. Snot pouring out of his nose and mouth and no kleenex or napkin in sight. (Autism Mom sob.) \n \nEthan stood about a half building away, pretending he didn't know us. He has reached the \"age of much embarrassment\" about his family, and having an autistic brother in full-on melt-down mode is, I would think, about as top of that list as you can get. \n \nAnd it went on and on and I realized the idea of him calming down completely before we moved on was moot, so I walked a sniveling and occasionally still sobbing and shouting boy to the corner and we all caught a cab home. \n \nAnd then it was of course dinnertime, but Jake didn't want me to leave him alone in his bedroom where the meltdown was continuing apace to go to the kitchen and make it (because of course by this time the idea of any TV at all tonight was \ncompletely out of the question, and he was all sad about THAT now). \n \nEthan was hungry and tired and wanting my attention too, and so I had two clingy, wiped-out kids and no screens to mesmerize them into relative calm while I got our meal together. \n \nEventually dinner was assembled, eaten; baths and showers were taken, pajamas donned. Jake was tucked into bed as early as possible (but not without one more teary mini-melt right as we were singing him to sleep). \n \nAnd then, Ethan cuddled into me as I read to him from a book I'd been wanting him to try for a while - the first book of Diane Duane's \"Young Wizards\" series - and I got him hooked. He yelled \"Noooooo!\" when I put the book down, and picked it up to read himself to sleep a few short minutes later. \n \nAfter trundling him off to his bed, I sat on the sofa in a deep mom-stupor. \n \nWhat a day. \n \nAnd I hear there's another one coming up tomorrow. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fk8MVFDNgk4/T-66j7GNaMI/AAAAAAAABw8/_0SNnK4KxwQ/s1600/IMG_3184.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-udFJ7z4wmts/T-66ihsS2KI/AAAAAAAABw0/kdZQ2KJSR2Y/s1600/IMG_3182.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Phx5MCcuM-s/T-66hEzkQYI/AAAAAAAABws/cIuFmOAuiNQ/s1600/IMG_3178.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aPEme6SyRwU/T-66mfsw8_I/AAAAAAAABxM/DlwmEdMPyww/s1600/IMG_3186.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mEHfshN_iwA/T-66lb5i20I/AAAAAAAABxE/SxBgdvqJtxU/s1600/IMG_3185.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/to-heaven-and-hell-in-day.html", "title": "\nTo Heaven and Hell in a day\n"},

And the sparkle of mischief in those eyes. \n \nIt never ceases to amaze me how Jacob manages to capture so much expression and emotion and character in the faces he draws. This would be impressive for ANY not-yet-ten year old boy, but for someone on the autism spectrum?\u00a0 Truly, mind bogglingly extraordinary. \n \nI love how it goes against the grain of all the common \"wisdom\" about autistic folks - how they are more interested in objects than people, don't pick up emotions, etc. etc. Because Jacob? Fascinated with other people, and clearly VERY tuned into facial expressions and what they convey.  \n \nLike I always say \"You meet one person with autism... and you've met  ONE  person with autism.\" And Jake is SOME person with autism.\u00a0 My favorite (but I am clearly prejudiced.) \n \n \n \n \"Peter Parker\" \n Jacob says this is Peter Parker - see the bit of spider on his arm that is cut off in this photo - but I think he looks quite a bit more like John Lennon, no? \n \n \n \n \"Two Face\" \n \n \n \"Batman Bad-Guys\" \n Jacob is so clearly enamored of larger than life characters and stories. He loves drawing both superheros and their nemesises - the \"Bad Guys.\" \n \n \n \n \"Harry Potter\" \n We've been having a bit of a Harry Potter film festival in the house this past week, as that's what Jake's been asking for, and I don't mind a bit as I have loved the books and enjoyed the films. This is definitely Harry from Book Seven, roughed up a bit and covered in either mud or blood - Jake was not quite clear on which - or both. \n \nWe haven't been watching in chronological order, but rather jumping around as Jake requests one or another specific film with a logic his own that I am not questioning, but rather letting dictate our viewing habits.\u00a0 He has been commenting on Harry's maturation over the course of the series, going from asking \"Is Harry a boy or a man?\" to stating \"Harry is a boy AND a man!\" as he understands the films encompass some years of his life as he grows from one to another. \n \nI think Jake is also thinking in about himself and how he will grow from a boy to a man someday. He's been talking about his impending birthday a lot, when he will turn TEN!  \n \nAnd with that thought I leave you. More tomorrow on... something.

{"date": "Saturday, June 23, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n A lovely day for a party in Connecticut \n \nIt's been up and down all week, all month, all year, and well, let's just say for some time now we've been riding life's rollercoaster, or if you prefer your metaphors nautical: cast adrift on life's choppy seas, pitching and yawing along. \n \nToday, this very moment, I am feeling well weary of the negative, of feeling I am one popped stitch away from coming apart completely at the seams. So I will, here in my own little bloggy fiefdom, do as the old song says and ac-cen-tu-ate the po-si-tive. \n \nSo, hereforth and forthwith are five things from the past week that DIDN'T suck, that might even qualify as good news... \n \n1. Getting Mom out of the hospital and into a nice suburban rehabilitation center  was totally the right move. We brought her out to Long Island on Thursday. She ate a hearty amount of lunch, was in good  spirits, worked on one of her word puzzle books for the first time in a month. \n \nAnd when the cute male admissions  nurse left the room after saying he needed to come back and do a full body  check on her? Her response to me: \"He's cute. He can do a body check on  me anytime.\" You go, Mom!  \n \nAnd the reason why we picked this particular rehab center? I have been very (what's the diplomatic word here?)... disenchanted with the rehab options in NYC. And then, it turns out that my Aunt Eva, my mother's sister-in-law is currently also a short-term rehab resident at this facility, which is a mere mile from her home. Which means my Uncle Walter, my Mother's brother, visits daily. \n \nAnd now that my Mom is ensconced two doors down from my Aunt, my Uncle gets to hang out with BOTH his wife and sister at the same time. Also my doctor cousin Jessie (Walt & Eva's daughter) has declared this facility \"definitely nicer than most of these type places.\" Win-win. \n \n2. Jake had his annual physical on Friday and an appointment with the doctor we see for bio-medical issues on Monday. We're taking his two week hiatus between the end of the school year and the beginning of camp-school (what we call his six week school summer program to make it sound more like what Ethan is doing) to get in all our doctor visits.  \n \nBoth doctors thought he was doing quite well, were pleased with his relative calm and very impressed by his art work (I showed them samples). \n \nAnd then when he had to have blood drawn he was pretty good about it. A little anxious beforehand and during, but no screaming. And then he was a little fascinated by the process and talking about it a lot afterward\u00a0 - \"What color was my blood, Mommy?\" and \"What did the doctor do to my blood, Mommy?\"  \n \n3. On Friday, during his daily recess basketball game, Ethan made a 3-point shot to win for his team. And the week before, at his afterschool basketball program awards dinner he had been given a special medal for \"Best Defensive Player of the Year.\" \n \nAs basketball is his great passion these days, both of these things made him inordinately happy.  \n \n4. Jacob is clearly missing school. Three days into his vacation he decided to have Blue Bear and all his other stuffed animals get on the bus and go to school. Once they arrived, he recited the daily schedule to them and then he led them in a bit of \"guided reading.\" They ate lunch and played ball and then went back home to their mommies and daddies. But he told me they would be going back to school the next day! (And they did.) \n \nPart of preparing Blue Bear to \"get ready for school\" was to get her dressed in some doll clothes I had bought for her last year, when Jake had insisted she get dressed when he did. So the second day of this game, after getting BB on the bus (Jake's pillow), the monkey bus driver drove on to the next pick-up point. \n \nBut once there, Jake declared of the penguin and cheetah who were waiting for the bus: \"They can't go to school, they're NAKED!\" Yes! Social rule understood: No naked school days! \n \n5. We were finally invited to an annual birthday pool party I have been hearing about for years, the social event of the 4th grade boys world at Ethan's school. And today was the absolute perfect day for a drive to Connecticut and a pool barbecue bounce castle trampoline party. (And it was easy to bring Jake along to this, as the hosting family has a SN kid of their own as well, and is particularly lovely and understanding.) \n \nWe returned slightly sun kissed, tired and happy. Perfect. \n \n \n<*>*<*>  \n \nI am not going to mention my worries about Mom's blood pressure being consistently low. \n \nI am not going to talk about how despite it being cute, my mother's level of disinhibition is troubling, indicative of more cognitive changes afoot. \n \nI am not going to share my disheartening realization late last night that last year's bathing suit was not going to fit, necessitating a last minute, early morning run to the full-priced neighborhood swim and lingerie shop where I got to beg them to help me find a suit that hid the fact that I do not have a bathing-suit-worthy body. \n \nI am not going to fret over Ethan's being positive he is going to win a basketball scholarship to Harvard, and therefore doesn't have to put too much effort into his actual schoolwork. \n \nI am not going to bring up my thousand fears and anxieties about Jacob and his future. \n \nAc-cen-tu-ate the po-si-tive. \n \nBack to kvetching and bemoaning tomorrow.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nqcwC6E8GK4/T-b66RQ5rzI/AAAAAAAABrc/q_kBPtYsq_M/s1600/Party+in+Connecticut.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/good-news-aka-things-that-dont-suck.html", "title": "\nGood News (AKA things that don't suck)\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n\n     \n \n \n \nNo one ever tells you how hard it's going to be, this caring for an elderly beloved, as you enter the endgame, the last few months, maybe years; this reversal of roles so deep I've really completely forgotten what it was like to have a mother who was my parent and not my child. \n \nShe breaks my heart every time I see her and yet it breaks her heart every time I say goodbye and leave. She clings to me like a toddler whose mother is off to work. \"Varda, please, don't go!\" And then she apologizes because she knows I have other, pressing responsibilities I must rush back to (my \"real\" children chief among them). \n \nAnd that hurts even worse, when she quietly sobs out: \"You are so good to me, I don't know what I would do without you.\" Because I know that even my best is not nearly enough. She needs a companion, someone by her side, with her night and day as she was for my father as he went through his rough patches and then those awful, final three months of active dying. \n \nBut he's gone now and it's just me. And my heart and time are divided, parceled out to others, too. Not fair, but what it is. \n \nWe don't have much time left. She knows that, senses it even though no one has said anything to her directly. It's her memory. She keeps forgetting she has a progressive, terminal heart condition. \n \nWhenever a new doctor listens to her heart and out pops some version of \"Wow that's noisy!\" (as critical aortic stenosis is wont to be) she explains: \"Oh, yes that's my heart murmur, I've had it since I was a little girl.\" \n \nBut it's not, it's this new thing - or relatively new at any rate - on top of that old thing (her sizable mitral valve prolapse) but why tell her again what she's going to forget again in five minutes time? Sometimes the doctor discretely says nothing, but I can always see it on their face. \n \nWhen I went to see her on Monday she searched my eyes for confirmation as she took my hand and said: \"Varda, I'm not doing well, I don't think I have much time left.\" \n \nI was stuck, pinned to the wall. \n \nI didn't want to lie to her, nor hurt her with the truth, so I evaded, \"However much time you have left, Mom, let's enjoy it, and each other.\" (Lame, lame, lame, but all I could come up with on short notice.) \n \nAnd I kissed her white curls yet again and hugged her shoulders in that not quite satisfying way that is the only possible hug when someone is in a wheelchair. \n \nI come bringing puzzle books, grandchildren, seltzer, chocolate and my loving presence.\u00a0 I wish I could clone myself, so I could leave me behind like all the else. But that's just science fiction, a pleasant fantasy. \n \nI come and then I go. \n \nOn Monday I left her in the dining room, playing bingo, one old lady in a wheelchair among a small sea of others. I would say \"her peers\" but she is peerless, my mother.  \n \nNo one ever tells you. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ECYBQG1-bjc/T-ra8H4M-SI/AAAAAAAABvA/-9oeKIHZV3I/s1600/%E2%80%9CMom,+now%E2%80%9D+.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/", "http://thingsicantsay.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/my-heart-her-heart.html", "title": "\nMy Heart, Her Heart\n"},

And so we moved quickly into the whole fertility game after only three months of trying the \"fun way.\"  \n \nWe were very lucky; our first IVF \"took.\"\u00a0 We have had so many challenges in our lives since, I don't think back to that time all that often, but those two years between our wedding day and the day our boys were born were hard.\u00a0 I know others have had fertility issues that went on much, much longer. But also I knew that we were racing the clock, and that things could easily have gone the other way for us (in which case we would probably be the parents of a little Chinese girl instead of a pair of boys). \n \nI have nearly completely forgotten all the public tears I quietly shed, when surrounded by heavily pregnant women in my family friendly neighborhood on yet another day the pee stick showed a single forlorn pink line.

A reminder of the beauty she has always been: \n \n \n \n Mom as a five year old flower girl at an Aunt's wedding, 1927  \n \n \n \n \n Mom in her early 20s, in the 1940s.\u00a0 Hubba, hubba! \n \n \n \n \n Mom and me, 1960 (A copy of this sits by her hospital bedside.) \n \n \n \n \n Me, Mom, & Grandma Dunia (her mom), 1974 \n \n \n \n \n \n Mom & Dad on vacation in Jamaica, 1984 \n \n \n \n \n Visiting grandbabies in Florida, March 2003 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mom & Dad, March 2006 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mom's birthday, September, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n Thanksgiving 2010 \n \n \n \n \n Chanukah, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n Taking Mom out for a hot cocoa, Fall 2011 \n \n \n \n Rachel visiting with Mom, February, 2012  \n \n \n \n Me and Mom on Mother's Day, 2012, just before the fall \n \n \nLooking at these as a progression, I can so clearly see a definite dip in her spirit, her liveliness between the last two photos. Even though they were only take a few months apart, she looks years older in the last one. \n \nI had noted her decline on Mother's Day, slipping even from when I had seen her just the week before. I had lined up all sorts of doctor visits for that last week in May, in fact. But then she fell. And it has been downhill ever since. \n \nLooking for a direction change soon. (Kuna hura.

And this year, I am not just an honoree but an actual speaker... Which means I will be READING my selected post in the big Friday evening Voices of the Year keynote address at this summer's BlogHer conference here in New York City on August 3rd.   \n \nI remember so well sitting in the audience, listening, rapt in 2010 and 2011; being moved to laughter and tears by so many wonderful, inspiring women and their work. \n \nLast year, my dear friend and BlogHer roommate Alexandra (the Empress) was one of the readers, along with other bloggers, old and new to me, whose voices sang out into the room. \n \nAnd now this year I, along with so many other wonderful women (and one rather wonderful man: instagram genius, Neil Kramer) will get to return the favor.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 12, 2012", "body": "\n   \n \n Mom walking (with PT help) \n I am so sorry to be continuing with the grim here. I want to be uplifting and life affirming, really. But what I am today is worn thin from being with, and advocating for my mother, who is simply flat-out miserable in her recovery. \n \nUntil today she had a bad case of white-coat-itis. She would complain and complain and complain of how horribly sick she was feeling to me, but as soon as a doctor I had summoned came around she was \"fine\" owning up to being maybe \"a little uncomfortable.\" And I seemed like a nut, like an over reactive nudge. Then five minutes after the doctor leaves the room it's back to \"Oh, Varda, I am dying.\"  \n \nYesterday the GI service doctor was acting super pissy and miffed at me - nearly suggesting *I* was the problem since \"No one else has reported your mother's discomfort.\" \n \nSo I then spent the rest of the day asking all the therapists who worked with her if they had noticed any gastric distress, and when they said \"of course!\" I begged them to PLEASE note it in her chart since it was just not being addressed adequately enough. \n \nThe fact that after a week it is getting WORSE, not better, in spite of her actual hip clearly healing, seemed to be of little concern to people until I raised bloody hell today. The fact that *I* had to be the one to point out she is NOT EATING and no one had thought to measure her calorie intake? Really not acceptable. \n \nIt also helped that Mom was finally in such a state that she was no longer making nice for the doctors and letting it all hang out, so they got to see and hear some of what I have been witness to over this past week.  So  now they believe me when I tell them she's been feeling horribly  nauseated for days on end and is mostly miserable. \n \nSo I will now leave you with this lovely list of things my mother said to me today: \n \n \"I have never felt worse in  my entire life. Is there a God? Why is he doing this to me? I don't  understand, I don't understand.  \n \n Kill me! kill me. Let me kill  myself. I can't take any more of this. I'm so sick, I'm so sick. I feel  so sick. I've never felt this bad before in my life. I feel awful.  I'm  dying. Let me die, kill me, kill me. Please help me die.  \n \n Varda, Varda, Varda, let me die. Varda, let me die. Varda, let me die. Please. Please. Please. Kill me!  Let it end!  \n \nIf I could just throw up, if I could just throw up.  If I could just throw up, I would feel better.    \n \nI'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I'm making you go through this with me.    \n \nOh my god.   Let it end. Let it end. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.\"   \n \nSo, um, yeah, in spite of the fact that she actually walked further  down the hall  than yesterday, today was not a very good day at the hospital.  \n \n(And, as you may have figured out, one of the ways I keep from completely losing MY shit while mom is saying all this is to distance myself from it by typing her words it into my phone with one hand while holding her with the other.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EWsDyj1z3UQ/T9gXR0J2fQI/AAAAAAAABps/8dHtikP42HU/s1600/Mom+walking+%28with+PT+help%29.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/", "http://www.thingsicantsay.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/things-my-mother-said-to-me-today.html", "title": "\nThings my mother said to me today\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, June 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n  \n \n \n Beautiful flowers in Mom's room (thanks Bruce, Bern, Rachel & Simon) \n \n \nI only have time for the quickest of updates tonight; barely a post, more of a postette, postella, postellini. Because I am completely knackered. (For my readers who are not anglo-australo-philes that means totally worn out, tired, broken.)  \n \nIn fact, I'm pretty much going to recap my Facebook status updates because that about says it all: \n \nWhen I arrived: \n \n \"Mom is having another really hard day. One minute she is admiring the smile of the nurse who has come to take her blood and the next she is sobbing and screaming at me to just let her die, it hurts to much to live and she just wants to be done.  \n \nAfter this, and before going home to children who will be all over me because I've been gone all day? I think I need a drink.\" \n \nThen, later:  \n \n Mom was in better space & spirits by the time I left. I still do  not understand how no one figured out her severe discomfort was caused by gas and that she needed a very simple anti-gas medicine (simethicone) to feel like a human being. I should NOT have to have been the one to suggest it! \n \nAnd in the middle? (Warning, what follows is a bit of a rant. Cursing involved. Because it was one of THOSE days.) \n \nA lot of begging my mother to eat and drink, followed by her taking one mouthful of yogurt, one sip of seltzer, and then holding up her hand, cursing at me when I try to force more. \n \nA lot of running to the nurse. They are growing to dread me at the hospital rehab nursing station, and that's a good thing. Because I MAKE them fucking take proper CARE of my mother, which they are somehow loathe to do. \n \nI tell the nurse my mother in in excruciating pain and she blinks at me blankly \"Really, she didn't say anything to me.\" \n \nREALLY? REALLY? Are you fucking kidding me?  \n \nShe didn't \"say\" anything because she is so out of it. The pain has reduced her to the state of an animal, holding her abdomen and moaning about how she is terrified she is dying.  \n \nBut if you ask her point blank, she will say she's not in pain, that she's just uncomfortable. Because she's so polite and all. Also, at this moment, mentally compromised enough to NOT be a reliable reporter - as I have told the staff a BAJILLION times. \n \nAt one point, she turned to me and asked, \"They are giving me so many medicines already isn't there SOMETHING they can give me that will take me out of this misery?\" And I thought \"Damn straight there should be something!\" and ran off to the nurse to make sure they'd been giving her simethicone for what was, so clearly obviously to me, severe gas pain. \n \nNope. \n \nNo one noticed, and she didn't request it. I actually may have gotten a little mouthy at that point and said something about how when my babies were gassy and screaming in pain it didn't take a medical degree for me to figure out they needed simethicone drops. And how I didn't feel the need to wait for them to \"ask\" either. \n \nAnd a dose of simethicone and a couple of trips to the bathroom and bedpans later (no gory details I promise, even though I got to live them, you won't have to) and she was back in her mind, able to converse, aware of the world outside her body. \n \nSo I arrived to a mother who would not eat a bite of her lunch and who responded to my entreaties by pounding on the bed and yelling \"Yes, yes, I want to die, I am ready to die, just get this OVER with, I can't take any more!\" \n \nAnd I left a mother who was actually eating dinner, slowly making her way through the fruit salad and asparagus, the first solid things she had taken in, in days.\u00a0 And a mother who was holding my hand and thanking me for being there. \n \nAnd it was so hard to leave her, not knowing how she would fare in the night. But my children across town needed me too. \n \nAnd I don't know who I am going to find in the morning, the pain animal or my rational mother. Hoping for my sweet mother, but willing to do whatever it takes to get her back, in any case. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B3UOf2d2qKM/T9R6WyHb2AI/AAAAAAAABn8/UBtAfgq5h8M/s1600/IMG_2695.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/up-and-down.html", "title": "\nUp and Down\n"},

I even said so in  The New York Times  (online) . \n \nAnd then bully big bear life took a giant paw and swatted me back down. But first he took down my mother. \n \nFor a while now we have known that she was one fall away from hell, and our fingers were crossed for so long they grew permanently twisted and entwined like wisteria trunks. But it happened anyway. On a random Friday.

My mother is descending the rabbit hole of despair. She is in a no-win situation and while I hold it together during my visits, I weep in the elevator on the way down to the street, emerge from the hospital's chill air onto the steaming city streets with silent sobs wracking my body, tears streaming down my face. \n \nI have just spent two, three, four, five hours besides my mother who is grimacing and groaning and sharply intaking her breath, in between moments of begging me to let her go home. She is so tired, so discomforted, so without energy or appetite or hope; unmoored in time and space, unsure of where she is or why. \n \nShe wants to be allowed nothing more than to sleep; to sleep and sleep and sleep and rest her bone-weary body. But to let her lie in bed now is to let her lie in bed forever; if she doesn't get up on her feet soon, she never will. \n \nSo I am letting the rehab folks kindly torture her. And feel the twisting of my guts as she says: \"I can't, I can't, I can't.\" But then does. \n \nAnd every fresh day I lie in bed at 5:45, alarm braying, saying to myself: \"I can't, I can't, I can't.\" But then I do. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Linking up with lovely Eden of Edenland today.

And distractions. \n \nTalismans for comfort, and to indulge that small part of me who still clings to magic. Because... why not? What could it hurt?   \n \nAnd distractions because I would like to retrain to my last shreds of sanity. And those dreadful few days in the ICU, sitting in the preternaturally noisy hush, watching a machine breathe for my mom? Were whatever is the polar opposite of awesome. Hence the books, magazines, snacks, telephone, and screens large and small. \n \nThe talismans? Jewelry, most of it given to me by dear friends, that I can see, touch; feel giving me strength as I sit. And wait. \n \nFirst a bracelet of faceted stones from my friend Rachel who lost her wonderful parents way too soon. As their only child capable of caring for them (her brother is autistic), she knows more than any other close friend, what it means to be a caretaking daughter.  \n \nThen a wonderful necklace made up from a \"Super Mom\" pendant my dear  Empress Alexandra  gave me last year when she was my roommate at BlogHer, strung on beads that were once my mom's. Purple beads, our favorite color. \n \nFinally another bracelet: sparkly plum-colored glass beads, with a flattened silvery bean in the middle, a perfect worry stone conveniently encircling on my wrist. This is one of sixteen nearly identical bracelets. \n \nI gave one to each of my fellow  Listen to Your Mother NYC  cast members just before we began our show. It reminds me of my non-caregiver self, she who moves through the larger world and will do so again, one day soon. \n \nMay they work their magic and keep my mother (and me) safe. \n \n \n \n Holding Mom's hand again \n \nAs for the much needed distractions: I played a lot of games on my iPhone. A million thanks to my Scramble and Words-With-Friends friends.  \n \nI brought with me about the only two books I could tolerate in this situation:   Let's Pretend This Never Happened  by Jenny Lawson (The Bloggess) and Rosanne Cash's  Composed ; both memoirs, by the way, as that's how I roll these days. And also? I have meaningful connections to each of these authors, and somehow that made me want their words with me, let me feel like I was sitting with a friend, not a stranger, as I was reading them (or in the case of Rosanne,  re-reading ). \n \nAnd hearing their words in THEIR voices inside my head as I read, instead of my own, also makes me feel less alone. \n \nJenny's book is with me because it is hysterically funny and also raw and real at the same time. And I think reading a book by someone more neurotic and over-the-top than me makes me feel calm and together in comparison. I know Jenny, have hung out with her at blog conferences (she's in that funny category of fond acquaintances who feel like close friends to me because I am privy to their innermost thoughts via reading their blogs) and have given and received numerous hugs from her. \n \nShe is a generous and compassionate woman, just the right person to sit with me by my mother's bedside. (She also gave my blog its first big boost by linking to my  From Autist to Artist \" post in one of  her Sunday wrap-ups  two years ago, and for that I am forever grateful.) \n \nAs to my connection with Rosanne, it is more tangential and tenuous, but I still feel it. Besides the fact that my sort-of-step brother (it's complicated) has toured with her band at times, and that I am friendly with a couple of friends of hers, we also met face to face once. Her book was actually released ON my 50th birthday and I chose to go to a reading/performance/signing that night.\u00a0 \n \nAs someone who has gone through the illnesses and the loss of so many of her loved ones, and written about it so soulfully and eloquently, I have found much comfort in reading her book yet again this week. \n \nAnd Jenny and Rosanne are both Twitter friends. Which is the perfect lead in to my final distraction, which is also so much more than a distraction, is actually a tremendous support and source of strength. And that is social media. \n \nThrough Twitter and Facebook (and this blog) I have never felt alone on this journey with my mom, not even for a moment, not even in those darkest hours when her strength was at a nadir, and I thought I might lose her. \n \nFinally, if you're here for an actual update on Mom's actual condition: As of today, Thursday, she is much improved. My brother (her step-son) Bruce came in yesterday to lend support, and he took the evening shift, so I could pick up my kids, have a family dinner.\u00a0 \n \nYesterday afternoon, Mom moved from ICU to a step-down unit, and, if all continues to go according to plan, will be in a regular \"medicine bed\" tomorrow and then on to rehab, working on walking again. Because she still has that broken hip, remember? \n \nSo there will be a lot more hospital days in her and my future. But with the right talismans and distractions\u00a0 - and my wonderful community of friends and family, both physical and virtual - I will make it through.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JIavYcLdJXQ/T8RcXDTshNI/AAAAAAAABl4/kR-bn66g01k/s1600/Talisman+thanks+to+Alexandra.jpg", "http://www.gooddayregularpeople.com/", "http://www.listentoyourmothershow.com/nyc", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-23bCN1i78Mw/T8iJfBcJs2I/AAAAAAAABmk/J4BgMdUF8wg/s1600/IMG_2534.JPG", "http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Pretend-This-Never-Happened/dp/0399159010?ie=UTF8&tag=thesquashedbo-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969", "http://www.amazon.com/Composed-Memoir-Rosanne-Cash/dp/0670021962?ie=UTF8&tag=thesquashedbo-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969", "http://thebloggess.com/2010/06/its-still-sunday-but-just-barely/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/05/talismans-and-distractions.html", "title": "\nTalismans and Distractions\n"},

Yep, still got 'em. \n \nJacob tonight was showing me the pictures he'd drawn today, while he was home after school with Daddy. As is usual, he engaged me in conversation the best way he knows how: asking questions he already knows the answers to. \n \n\"Mom, what color is Vegeta's* hair?\" I had to look to see if he had been drawn as a regular Sayan or a Super-Sayan this time. \"Black honey, it's blackish.\" \n \n\"What is 'black-ish' Mom?\"  \n \nOy! \n \n-ish is such an abstract concept, I think he's never going to get it, but I try...\u00a0 \"You add '-ish' to the end of a word to show how it is kind of, almost, but not quite all of something. You say 'whitish' about something that is not quite pure white, but on its way there, in the white family.\"\u00a0 And left it at that. \n \nAnd five minutes later... \n \nJake: \"Mom, what color is Freeza's skin?\" \n \nI look over. \"It's pink honey.\" \n \n\"Nooooo, it's pink- ISH , Mommy!\" \n \nAnd so it was. \n \n(Never underestimate an autistic person's ability to learn.)  \n \nAnd then Ethan, on the loooooong way home from an East side doctor's appointment (Obama in New York = traffic from hell) decides to invent a word. Or rather, a new meaning for an old word, create some slang, as it were. \n \n\"Mom, let's make up a new meaning for the word 'Bagel' - OK?\" \n \n\"OK.\" I say, game for any sort of game that does not involve a screen. \n \n\"How about... a special way you stab something with a sword?\" He suggests. \n \n\"How about something non-violent?\" I counter. \n \n\"It's a hug. A special, special hug where you wrap your arms around someone and give them a squeeze like you're the bagel and they're in the hole in the middle.\" \n \n\" THAT  I like!\" \n \n\"Give me a bagel, Mom!\" \n \nAnd I do. \n \nI so do. \n \n \n*If you have anything like a nine year old boy, you probably know who all these characters are.

And thus my second weekend being completely torn between my mother's and my family's total need of me. \n \nTo say I am nearly being ripped apart by this is an understatement. \n \nI am so sorry to still be here in this space, neither delighting nor entertaining you, my readers. I like being funny. I miss being funny, sweet or lyrical. I even miss thinking about autism nearly all the time. \n \nIf you're newly visiting my blog and want something other than this grim, gut wrenching sandwich generation, ill, elderly and rather broken mother in the hospital stuff, might I suggest you read some old posts of mine? Try \" Best Squash \" or \" The Alphabet Posts \" in the tabs above. Or maybe click \" Humor \" from the label cloud to the left. (Or click my shiny hotlinks.) \n \nAnd, for people who actually want the update on my life, my mom:\u00a0 She's hanging in there. We're both exhausted. \n \nThey  moved her to the rehab unit yesterday, and I'm not sure she was quite ready,  but a  bed was open so... she went.\u00a0 Physically, she is out of immediate post-operative danger,  but the rehab is going to be a long haul for her. \n \nShe's still  in a lot  of pain. And she's very up and down.  \n \nWhen I show up, I never know if I'm going to find with-it, upbeat, funny, joking with the nurses  Mom, or  confused, miserable, groaning in pain and begging to go home Mom.\u00a0 And sometimes I will show up to find one type, and then she will emerge from a short nap, the other.  \n \nBut show up, I must. If I am not there, my mother does not eat. \n \nWhen I arrive a look of relief usually washes over her; she grabs my hand, holds it for all the world as if she's never letting go. And then three minutes later she's drifted off to sleep again, the hot cocoa I've brought her abandoned two sips in. \n \nToday was my mother-in-law's unveiling. I was heartbroken that I couldn't go to the cemetery with my husband and the rest of his family. But it was to be the whole day, and I couldn't not show up at my mother's bedside. \n \nAlso this: while my mother is out of immediate danger, her inevitably fatal cardiac condition is progressing: critical  aortic stenosis; which is the same thing that killed my father. (Which is  why I am encouraging Ethan to go into hi-tech medical research and  invent nanobots that can repair aortic valves. Just in case, you know?) This could be her last hospitalization. This could be the beginning of the end, which is surely coming, in the not so distant future. \n \nI must push to be as there as possible for her. Each moment is precious. Even if she is sleeping through most of them right now.  \n \nToday was another one of those days. But they're  all those days, these days.  \n \nToday Jake melted down because his video game didn't work right, and he didn't want to play another. And then, he had to take his glasses off because they were all foggy with crying and he sat on them, bent them out of shape. And then he was crying because he wanted his glasses - and the store that fixes them opens at noon earliest on Sundays. \n \nAnd Ethan had undone homework hanging over our heads like an anvil, and I could not let him go off on a playdate until it was done. And Jake's vitamins needed to be poured for the day, because neither the sitter nor my husband can do that. \n \nAnd so this morning the clock was ticking and I had not showered / dressed / packed my bag. Because there is always something else that needs to be done but I can't do it all and also get to my mother's side as soon as I wish. \n \nI can't remember my last un-squashed moment. \n \nBut when the big one comes, when I am no longer squashed by my mother's demands but rather by the thousand-pound chest-weight of her absence, then I will long for these days when she was still here and I could still be with her, could still do for her. \n \nAnd so I do, I do, I do. \n \nAnd I sit and hold her hand. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u6RAki6sklM/T8xGmvfsPGI/AAAAAAAABm8/tusJtNwMwf0/s1600/Mom%27s+hand+&+hospital+blanket.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/sandwiched.html", "title": "\nSandwiched\n"},

She is in her 4th room in seven days - 5th if you count the ER - and she is disoriented. (Well, I think I would be too, in that situation.) \n \nShe is also, for the first time this time around, unfortunately, in the \"A\" bed now, which means the one near the door, not the window. And for my mother that means trouble, always. I have learned this by now. But try getting the hospital staff to listen to me... \n \nMy mom, struggling with short term memory issues under the BEST of circumstances (let alone the disorienting journey that is hospitalization) needs all the external supports she can get to help her know where she is and why she's there, what time it is and whether is is day or night.  \n \nAnd a window? Wonderfully useful to figure out whether the clock on the wall is telling you if it's noon or midnight. \n \nWithout this knowledge she gets anxious.\u00a0 Today, every time she drifted off and then reawakened - which meant about every ten minutes - she would ask me, fearfully: \"Is it morning or night? What time is it? What am I supposed to be doing?\"\u00a0 And also, often: \"Varda, where am I? What happened to me?\" \n \nIt's  Groundhog Day all over again  (and over, and over, and over again). \n \nI considered making a voice recording on my phone so I could just hit a button and play it back for her each time, instead of leaning in to her good ear to speak the following, very clearly and in the perfect cadence that is neither too slow or too fast, with a voice that is neither too loud nor too soft: \n \n\"Mom, you're in the Hospital. Last Friday - a week ago now - you fell and broke your hip. On the left side, this side, here.\" (As I lightly touch the top of her left leg.)\u00a0 \"You had surgery on Sunday to fix it and they did - they put a metal rod and pins and screws in, good as new.\" \n \n\"But you heart had a hard time with the surgery. So you had to go to the ICU to get better. There was a machine breathing for you, with a tube down your throat, and you were heavily sedated. You probably don't remember anything from those days.\" (She shakes her head, she most certainly doesn't. This is all news to her. Again.) \n \n\"Then you got better, so they took out the tube and woke you up, and moved you to a room. Bruce came to visit for a few days.\" (She nods but she's just being polite. She has no memory of that either, it being more than an hour ago.) \n \n\"And now you're in this room, on the orthopedic floor, and you need to work on getting stronger and using your leg now. It's (insert time here) and time for you to (insert desired activity here - eat, rest, get your vitals taken, have PT) soon.\" \n \nMission accomplished. \n \nUntil the next time.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-__WHN9SY6dc/T8nKRsMhk9I/AAAAAAAABmw/O_1dRdZVw1U/s1600/IMG_2535.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/06/one-more-day.html", "title": "\nOne more day\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2012", "body": "\n   \n \n The view in ICU \n Mom is doing better today. Much better. \n \n(How much do I love writing that?) \n \nShe is off both the ventilator and the vasopressor drugs (that were supporting her blood pressure).  \n \nShe's not out of the woods yet, but neither is she stuck in the weeds. There is a path and she's on it, even if it meanders and seems to double back at times.  \n \nThere are still minefields ahead. Her equilibrium is so very delicate, thrown off by the slightest breeze. So we are going slow as they remove the supports that have been propping her up since the post-operative crash. \n \nAnd yet there is danger in this, too. \n \nThe sooner she is on her feet, the better, as she is most assuredly in the \"use it or lose it\" years. And at the moment, still immobilized by equipment lines, strapped into a bed, she is not using much of anything. \n \nUnless you count her middle finger, glowing bright red under the oxygen monitor's light, which she is waving under the noses of the staff who are bothering her, poking and prodding, hassling and tugging at her; tightening straps she wants loosened and set free from. And yes, I believe she knows what she is doing as she lifts that finger to them. \n \nShe can't really speak much yet, her esophagus torn up pretty badly from the ventilator tube's sojourn there. But her eyes and gestures say plenty. \n \nWhen the nurse had handed me the suction tube and showed me how to stick it into the hole in the oxygen face mask, told me to encourage her to cough and suck up whatever comes out?\u00a0 She forgot to warn me that what might be coughed up could resemble a lung. \n \nSeriously, a giant gob of bright red clotty blood came spewing out and even I, who have staunched my father's bleeding wound with my bare hands, blanched and willed myself not to faint as I suctioned it all away and then gingerly hung up the now bloody tube, wondering if I would have the courage to pick it up again.  \n \n(My apologies to the squeamish among you for that.) \n \nThank goodness they finally ditched the mask, set her up with the old nasal cannula (after she rasped \"take this fucking thing off me\" enough times). And her oxygen - as far as I knew when they kicked me out for the night - was still satting at 98%. Excellent. \n \nMy mother, while sweet and tender, is also a tough old bird. I don't want to tempt the fates and say this, so please knock on some wood or spit over your left shoulder three times while you read it, but I think... she may just pull through.  \n \nIt's not going to be easy. Rehab is going to be a long haul, and we HAVE to get her on her feet again. And she is not exactly compliant with exercise regimens, though she will tell you she is. Because if she does something once, she considers herself DONE with it. Even if she has been told to do it three times a day for a month. \n \nI have seen her lie to doctors and physical therapists. She wants to be SEEN as compliant without really complying. \n \n(OK, I might just be describing myself here, too. And my son Ethan, as well, come to think of it. Methinks a pattern is emerging. I may just have detected a lovely family trait.) \n \nSo, there is clearly much more cursing ahead. \n \nBut that's OK. \n \nIt's AHEAD. \n \nAnd so I'll take that ahead, whatever way it comes. \n \n \n \n \n \n I am linking this up with Just Write, just because. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ln3hcvGAoHM/T8XpV8nyZHI/AAAAAAAABmY/Xs1ilqkvwgM/s1600/ICU+Equipment.jpg", "http://extraordinary-ordinary.net/2012/05/28/just-write-37"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/05/better.html", "title": "\nBetter\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 28, 2012", "body": "\n \n     \n \n \n The view from where I sit \n \n \nMy life since last Friday morning has been a jumble. \n \nI am riding the rollercoaster, strapped to my mother's flagging health. \n \nI am up, down, and all over. \n \nI couldn't even begin to put things into a coherent sequence, present a normal timeline to you. The days whiz by, but the minutes telescope to feel like hours. Waiting is excruciating. But so are the events that puncture the boredom.  \n \nThe biggest single up/down moment: \n \nOn Sunday morning, Mom's orthopedic surgeon came out to find me in the waiting room, to tell me that the  operation had gone well: rod and pins in, bones fit together like tidy  puzzle pieces, quickly done. He told me she was about to be  extubated; that in about an hour she would be waking up, and they would send someone to bring me to her side. \n \nThe hour came and went. I didn't want to be a nudge; figured she probably was waking up slow from the anesthesia. (I know I do.)  \n \nI was being happily distracted by my friend Barbara, who had surprised me  by a visit with rations (black and white cookie!) and delightful  conversation. \n \nBut when she left it was nearly two hours without a word. \n \nI walked up to the desk to ask \"When can I go to my mother?\" and did not like what I was overhearing as the reception clerk attempted to track her down. \n \n\"She's in recovery on another floor.\" was all she told me, and the unit and bed number. But when I got out of the elevator I saw that the unit had a name too: Surgical Intensive Care Unit. This did not bode well. \n \nAnd when I arrived at her bedside I was shocked to see her surrounded by medical folks frantically doing... THINGS to her. Not what \"successful operation\" had lead me to expect. \n \nI was shooed away to wait outside with nary an explanation. I tried hard not to flip out. Eventually I was made to understand the situation. \n \nNo one ever properly apologized for leaving me in the dark for so long. But I understood, people had been kept busy trying to save my mother's life. I couldn't be too pissed. \n \nAnd so it has gone for the last 48 hours. \n \nI am up, down, and all around.  \n \nMy mother, due to her critical aortic stenosis, is such a delicately balanced machine, and they have not yet found the perfect sweet spot for her blood volume. Push too many fluids and they back up into her lungs, send her into heart failure. Remove too much of that excess fluid and she can't maintain her blood pressure. \n \nSo a ventilating machine is helping her to breathe, so she can get enough oxygen in spite of the (hopefully lessening) fluid in her lungs, and medicines are keeping her blood pressure in a normalish range. There are various other forces pulling and pushing at her including her levels of pain and sedation. \n \nAll in all, an incredibly complicated dance. \n \nShe rides it up and down throughout the day, as do I. I am sharp one moment, lost the next. I have been deeply distracted and also in need of distraction (many thanks go out to friends playing iPhone word games with me, you are keeping me sane). \n \nThis morning my brain was in another sphere while brushing my teeth. I had accidentally picked up my son's Sponge Bob toothpaste and squeezed it upon my toothbrush, didn't notice until I got a mouth full of bubble gum flavor where I was expecting mint. That grabbed my attention, in a not particularly pleasant manner. And the rest of the day followed suit. \n \nJust as I was thinking that I'd had enough of watching her seeming sleep, that it was time to go home and leap into the waiting arms of my beloved children (who were likely gnashing their teeth and fighting over Wii games) she floated up to consciousness for a moment. \n \nI hastened to stand by her, on the side of the good ear. She was clearly bewildered and very uncomfortable, finding the giant tube down her throat most distressing, her eyes beseeching, full of questions. \n \nI explained as best I could, simply, succinctly since I knew I had likely only moments before I lost her again.\u00a0 I like to think he heard me, understood. \n \nAnd then it was time to go, to flee Westward, back into the arms of my husband and progeny.\u00a0 I missed putting Jake to bed, but caught a very-happy-to-see-me Ethan awake. \n \nAnd unbathed, of course.  \n \nAnd slightly sunburnt.  \n \nAnd with a big hug and kiss for me, his one and only, irreplaceable Mom. \n \nUp. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jz67IDNcWPU/T8RcXpG5HxI/AAAAAAAABmA/aE80ZXj3RiQ/s1600/The+view+from+where+I+sit.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/05/rollercoaster.html", "title": "\nThe Rollercoaster\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n   \n \n \n \nWhatever I was whining to myself  about came to a screeching halt on Friday morning, when I got the call that my mother had taken a bad fall and was on her way to the ER. That sweeps everything stark. \n \nWhat is important... what is stupid piddly shit... made instantly clear. \n \nChildren don't have this perspective yet. Jacob has been clingy, Ethan morose, petulant; they want their mom. \n \nSo do I. \n \nHere's the update I don't want to give:\u00a0  \n \nIt's touch and go right now. She is in the ICU. A machine is breathing for her. Her blood pressure is being supported by drugs. She is surrounded by machines, tubes, equipment. A thousand IVs hang around her. Lines snake themselves all over her body. Monitors beep and hum. The thrum and hiss of the ventilator sets the bass beat. \n \nThe unquiet quiet of an ICU. \n \nI made a difficult decision on Friday to take the risk and do something (surgery) that may just be the road to killing her quickly, versus doing nothing and walking  the path of certainly killing her slowly. \n \nTo not have had the surgery, to choose the \"do nothing\" approach would have meant a month - or two or three - on complete bed rest.\u00a0 And bed rest plus an elderly person such as my mother - with cognitive/memory issues and a bum heart - usually equals an excruciating, permanent slide into the abyss. \n \nAnd yet, whatever the immediate outcome, the long term is still not good. I have been losing her bit by bit for quite a number of years now, hastened much by my father's death. (Can it really have been two years and counting?) \n \nThe incline of her decline has steepened in the past few months. I really have felt like I'm watching the color fade from her spirit, before my very eyes. \n \nAnd yet now that feels glacial slow compared to what has transpired in the last three days. \n \nIn one word: \n \nFreefall \n \nThe hip repair surgery went well, but...  \n \nBUT \n \nBUT \n \n(Like that old joke, \"The operation was a success, but unfortunately the patient...\") \n \nShe was not a good candidate for surgery. \n \nHer old, huge, much used heart is tired and worn out.  \n \nThe valves don't work like they should, like they used to  (though one has been tricky since the beginning: she, a little girl with a heart murmur). \n \nSo even though they took a zillion extra precautions.\u00a0 Were oh so careful to try to not unduly stress her heart during the surgery. It's still surgery. Things had to happen. Things her heart did not like. \n \nThe surgery went well. She could stand on that leg (if she could wake up and stand). \n \nBut her heart needs the help now. \n \nThe machines. The slow drip of the IVs. \n \nAnd so she slumbers deep below the level of consciousness; sedated, kept under to avoid the unbearable discomforts her body is enduring in its struggle to remain alive. \n \nAnd yet still, she is there, some small part of her. The spark of her life flickering but not guttered. \n \nI sit by her side (until they toss me out for the night). \n \nI cannot touch her skin; she winces, grimaces at even the gentlest caress.  \n \nSo I stroke her hair, smooth it down; fan it out on the pillow, fingertips following the ripples of her silver curls out to the ends.  \n \nI whisper in her ear.

I was in a taxi, taking Jacob up his doctor's appointment when I realized a message had come in that I hadn't noticed in the hustle and bustle of my early morning. \n \nWhen I registered that it was from the nurse at Carnegie, I held my breath. It is almost never good news. \n \nA fall... found by aide... ambulance... Mt. Sinai ER. \n \nNot how I was planning to spend the day (or the entire holiday weekend, for that matter). I had been thinking: do Mom's laundry, take her to lunch, give her a manicure. Bur ER bound we were. \n \nI was on pins and needles throughout Jake's appointment, just itching to get. to. the. hospital. Jake was amazing though. He had heard my phone conversations, had understood my explanation that we were NOT going to be visiting Grandma in her home as planned, but instead going to the hospital to see her. \n \nHe told everyone at the doctor's office: \"My Grandma is in the hospital. She doesn't feel good. We are going to see her to tell her to feel better.\"\u00a0 (Whoever says autistic kids lack compassion can go suck it.) \n \nAnd he was great in the two hours he was with me there (until my husband could come to pick him up). He kept telling my mom to \"Feel better, Grandma!\" \n \nVery shortly after we arrived they wheeled her away for CT scans and X-rays. The doctor prepared me. By the rotation of her leg and the level of her pain, it was certain her hip was either broken or dislocated. \n \nI was praying for dislocation but not feeling hopeful, and sure enough, it was as we'd feared: the top of her femur, the \"ball\" part of the ball and socket joint that is a hip was broken clear off the rest. She needs surgery to repair it, to place a metal rod in the bone and pins and screws to hold everything in place. \n \nDamn!  \n \nThank goodness her sense of humor is still intact. Between that and the disinhibiting quality to the morphine that is keeping her out of severe pain, she has been terribly funny. \n \nIn the ER, as the nurses were trying to put in a catheter, and she was not quite understanding what they were doing, I heard my mother's voice calling out from behind the curtain: \"Varda, why are there \nwomen in my vagina?\"  \n \nWhen told that she needs to have surgery that involves putting the metal rod and pin in \nher hip, her reply was: \"Then I better find a man with a magnetic \npenis!\" \n \nI hold on to this as I prepare to return to the hospital in the wee hours of the morning tomorrow, to send my mother off into surgery. there will be more tales to tell, but for now, I am tired. So, goodnight. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jejcNcNJaTc/T8IAFpwQC2I/AAAAAAAABls/GOfrmBwNQYU/s1600/Mom+in+ER.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/05/down-rabbit-hole-again.html", "title": "\nDown the Rabbit Hole (Again)\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n  \n \n \n \nI'm clearing out my closets. Trying to sort the wheat from the chaff. Trying to lighten up our load, to dispossess ourselves of some of our excess possessions, the clutter that that has taken over our lives. \n \nI could claim it's the children and all their attendant... things. I could claim it's autism, citing how long we have to hold onto toys Ethan has long outgrown, because Jake has still not yet grown into them, or is so fondly attached to and revisits from time to time the toys of a much younger child. (Thomas, anyone?) \n \nBut this would be a big fat lie. \n \nI have always been this way, surrounded by too much stuff. Not quite ready to be featured on an episode of Hoarders, but not quite NOT either. If there were a show called \"They're serious collectors and clutterers but CAN throw out paper and trash and WILL donate outgrown clothes to others who can use them\" you could sign me up. \n \nIt doesn't help that we live in a small apartment, no longer have a storage space downtown, and both my husband and I have had recent parental deaths land a lifetime of memory-filled THINGS into our laps. What we release now is never coming back. There is no ancestral attic or basement for the detritus of our and their (and our grandparents') lives. \n \nThere is just one small, overstuffed apartment, that we also need to live in. \n \nRight now I am coming to terms with the fact that I am unlikely to ever again be the size or shape that I was in my twenties and thirties. And so all the clothes in the back of my closet, the stuff that has survived twenty years of previous purges, has to go. \n \nEven lovely favorites, filled with memories... I bought that shirt at my first Sundance Festival... I used to go clubbing in the 80s in that crushed velvet jacket... that's the sundress I wore when I met my husband on Memorial Day weekend at Fire Island, fourteen years ago... \n \nIt's too much to hang onto.\u00a0  \n \nAnd yet.. and yet... there's one dress I cannot part with. \n \nThis: \n \n \n \n \nThe green velvet dress I wore to Thanksgiving, 2001. \n \nMy parents were in town. We were at my in-laws. And I was in a foul, foul, horrible mood. Just despondent.  \n \nYou see, I had done a terrible thing that morning, had cheated and taken a home pregnancy test. Even though it was still days before it would be accurate. Even though we had been admonished, in no uncertain terms, to NOT DO THAT by the fertility clinic. We were just 23 days into our IVF cycle, a week and a day since the embryo transfer. Too. damn. soon. \n \nBut the box of pee sticks in the bathroom cabinet had sung their siren song of temptation to me that morning. I had been feeling so pregnant, surely there would be confirmation on a stick. \n \nReally, I had been floating on the air of rising expectations for days. There had been signs and portents that yes, the IVF was successful. \n \nAnd then that Thursday, Thanksgiving  morning, I was just plummeted into the black pit of despair. Once more, a lone pink line on the pee-stick. \n \nI lay on the sofa moaning and groaning, in mourning. I barely roused myself in time to shower and dress for Thanksgiving dinner across town. But I made sure to throw on a beloved dress that I always felt good in: the crushed green velvet. \n \nThat year, unlike the one just past, I was not spending Thanksgiving with my beloved cousins, but with my husband's family - who I am thoroughly fond of, but much less intimate with, so I couldn't really talk about what was going on. \n \nI didn't even tell my husband what I'd done, as it was so against the rules and I didn't want to admit to being bad, bad, bad. Explaining my mood, I just mumbled something about having an ominous feeling, and that I was starting to think that maybe the IVF hadn't been successful. \n \nI managed to eat my dinner and engage in some minimal, polite conversation. But then right afterward I withdrew and joined my elderly father in the living room as he was taking his traditional post-turkey sofa nap. I don't think I even got up for dessert, feeling thoroughly rotten, thinking to sleep off my funk. \n \nSo why would I possibly be nostalgic about this dress then, commemorating such a dreadful day? \n \nBecause two days later, on Saturday morning I peed on another stick and saw the most beautiful sight in the world: two pink lines, one fainter than the other but definitely, undeniably, there.  \n \nI was pregnant. \n \nVery, in fact. \n \n(yes, the twins) \n \nAnd suddenly Thanksgiving Day was cast in a whole new light... \n \nMy mood swings, sudden despondency, near hysterics? Clearly a sign that the pregnancy hormones were starting to kick in, big time. \n \nMy need to nap after dinner? That the intense first trimester exhaustion had likewise begun.  \n \nSo the dress, to me now, has magical qualities, evoking the beginning of my noticeable pregnancy. I'm keeping it. If I can wear it again someday, so much the better (green has always been a good color on me). \n \nBut until then? It's going in a box, alongside a photograph of five two-day-old embryos, a pair of tiny blue hospital bracelets with \"Baby A\" and \"Baby B\" on them. And a little white plastic stick with two pink lines on it. \n \nWhat? You didn't think I could throw THAT out, did you? \n \n \n \n \n And, for the first time in a long time, I'm linking up with Yeah, Write because I sorta kinda like this post and hope you did too.

I wrote a really tough post about depression yesterday, the absolutely most beautiful day of the year when I stayed inside in my PJs. But it is just too raw, and I am not ready to publish it yet. So for now, this from today:\u00a0  \n \n \n@@@@@@@  \n \nI lift Ethan's sweat-soaked body from my bed to carry him back to his.\u00a0 Although his shirt is drenched through, his back feels cooler now. The fever's broken. Finally. \n \nI silently wish him sweet dreams and an easy rest of the night's sleep. I start to make plans to scotch all my plans for tomorrow. I'll have a sick kid home with me to attend to, and he'll need lots of attention as well as chicken soup and saltines. I am deeply praying it's just a random 24-hour viral fever thing, and not the flu. Please. not. the. flu!  \n \nWe have been, HE has been, lucky. So far in his nearly ten years on the planet he has had one flu, two strep throats, a few handfuls of colds, three maybe four stomach bugs. (Yes I *AM* knocking on wood and spitting over my left shoulder as I write this.) \n \nWe have had no stitches, no broken bones, no trips to the emergency room. And not for his brother Jacob either, and for a sensory seeking kid with autism that;s quite a miracle, I am well aware.\u00a0 (Rest assured: more knocking and spitting.) \n \nBut the downside of tihs is feeling ill hits Ethan really hard, feels very abnormal to him, deeply frightening. He came to me in the bathroom this afternoon as I was FINALLY going to get to take my shower. He burst in crying \"Mom, somethings wrong! My teeth are chattering and I feel hot one minute and cold the next and then both at the same time! What's wrong with me?!?\" \n \nHe was genuinely perplexed and panicked, it had been that long since he'd had a spiky fever. When I went to feel him he was massively hot clear to halfway down his belly. That's between 101 and 102 in my mom guestimation book. \n \nI calmed him down by reassuring him it was \"just a fever\" and started the alternating motrin & tylenol train rolling. Within an hour he was slurping ginger ale and playing a calm Wii game. But by bedtime he was pretty punk. And I was wiped out too.  \n \nAnd, on top of this?\u00a0 Jacob was in massive meltdown mode all day because he lost TV for the WHOLE day due to some early bad behavior. Because I, like an idiot, had said - \"If you do that ONE more time you will lose TV for the whole day!\" - and then I had to follow through. And tihs was before Ethan got sick. We survived. But that's a whole other story for another day. \n \nI never did get my shower. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \u00a0  \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Thursday, May 17, 2012", "body": "\n \n   \nZ is for Zzzzzzzzzz \n \nCatching a few delightful zees. \n \nOr?  \n \nAsleep at the wheel. \n \nIt's how I'm feeling these days, quite often. \n \nA victim of insomnia; though I am also sleep's bully, keeping it from its proper place in my life quite willfully. \n \nFor, you see, it's not so much that I can't fall asleep, it's that I won't let myself go to bed. Night-owl Ethan often does not go down until 10 or 10:30. That's when my \"me time\" begins. And there is so very, very much to be done. \n \nWhen I do manage to put myself to bed at a decent hour? A nighttime's rise up to consciousness - whether to relieve a bladder or turn from an aching hip - will no longer be a brief blip in my slumbers; will now result in extended wakefulness. If you have gotten an email from me at 3 am? Yes. This. \n \nAnd then there is unfortunate circumstance: a child's middle-of-the-night projectile vomit; my mother's ER visits, always an all-night affair, occasionally even 36 hours when hospital beds are scarce. \n \nAll conspiring to rob me of my rightful slumber. \n \nI used to be a good sleeper, once. \n \nThe sandman and I enjoyed an easy, cozy relationship.  \n \nBefore kids. \n \nBefore autism. \n \nBefore ADD.  \n \nBefore peri-menopause. \n \nBefore elderly parents. \n \nBefore death.  \n \nBefore blogging. \n \nAye, there's the rub: I confess I write best at about two am. It's not just the quiet in my household, kids tucked away in their beds. Even though I live in the city that never does, in this mostly residential, very family neighborhood, even though it is, yes, Manhattan, most of the people all around me are fast asleep. \n \nNot all, certainly not that. Somewhere in my building there is surely a teenager chatting away on Facebook, an old man raiding the refrigerator, a new mother pacing the floorboards with her restless babe. \n \nYet still, it is enough. There is a psychic calm all about. Cars along Riverside swoosh by sporadically. The doormen are ensconced in lobby chairs, struggling to remain alert to the rare late arrivals, no longer jauntily calling out to each other from beneath sidewalk awnings. The brainwave patterns surrounding me are buzzing in the deep deltas of sleep.\u00a0  \n \nAnd my words, which serve such pragmatic purposes during the day, find themselves bubbling up from deeper pools in the dark; flowing into channels that delight and surprise me, swirling eddies carrying me along to places I have only glimpsed before, maybe in dreams. \n \nAnd so, when I awaken at three am, having fallen asleep bolt upright on the couch while attempting to watch a movie on TV with my husband, I don't just pop myself into bed. I sit down at the computer: prime writing time has begun. \n \nThere's a reason I'm sleepwalking through my days sometimes, and its name is blog. \n \nAnd I like this writing life so much, yes I do, that I'm willing to sacrifice a standard good night's sleep to it; catch my z's when and where I can.  \n \nAnd, please note: \n \nZ is also for something really important to me... Zygotes. \n \nThose are the earliest bits of us, what happens when a pair of compatible gametes meet cute, get happy together; existing for four days only before they become blastocysts, then embryos, then fetuses. (And then, eventually, if all goes according to plan: babies.) \n \nI have zygotes on the brain right now because, having just realized that I've never truly told the tale here, I'm busy writing out the story of my twin boys' conception. Not a terribly sexy story I'm afraid, as it was a highly technical affair involving petri dishes, not mood lighting. Yes, IVF. Stay tuned... \n \n \n \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock's  Alphabe-Thursday writing meme, the letter of the week most obviously \"Z.\" And yes, after this she's going to start back at the beginning with \"A\" again.

{"date": "Monday, May 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n  \n \n \n Photo courtesy of Anne Flournoy @TheLouiseLog \n \n \n \nNew York City's first (hopefully annual) Listen to Your Mother Show did indeed take place yesterday. And I produced it. (Chills.) \n \nIt was amazing, glorious, profound and moving. And I'm not blowing my own horn here, but talking about all my fellow cast members.\u00a0 It was a privilege and honor to share the stage with them, to listen to their stories. (And? Thank goodness for waterproof mascara.)  \n \nI was so happy during the show. And then, afterwards, slid into that happy / sad place I often find myself in, when something so long anticipated and labored to bring to fruition is finally done, over, finished; and the world has whirled on. \n \nThe show's director,  Amy  and I were texting this morning about how we'd both had an odd insomnia last night, not wanting to go to sleep, because when we woke up it would have all become \"yesterday,\" and we concluded it felt much like a wedding in that way.  \n \nI'm trying to still bask a little in the glow today, but there is so much to DO in all the rest of my life. (Isn't that ever so, once motherhood has come along and the term \"free time\" becomes an oxymoron?) \n \nI have an essay reflecting upon the day and the production process in me, but it's not yet ready to come out today.\u00a0 So instead I'm going to share what I read on the stage. (YouTube video will be available soon.) \n \nThis is a slightly expanded version of a post I wrote last June, that was also just published in StoryBleed online literary magazine last week, an essay called: \n \n Holding Hands \n \nToday my mother was tired when I stopped in to visit, planning to take her downstairs to lunch.  \n \nAnd while many a day I will coax and cajole, force her to rouse herself, to rise to the occasion, today I didn't. I let her be. \n \nWhy? Because I was tired, too. \n \nSo I didn't make her make an effort, make her rise and dress, put in her teeth. I did hand her her hearing aid, however, to make conversation less about shouting and gesturing, and guessing. \n \nAnd then I laid down beside her on the big, now half-empty bed and held her hand. \n \nAnd we talked. \n \nWe talked about the little things; about everything and nothing. \n \nI told her how we had just this morning measured Ethan, to find he had grown a full half-inch in a month. \n \nShe patted her head and mine, proclaimed us both lucky in our luxuriant curly hair. \n \nI talked to her about Jacob.  \n \nShe furrowed her brow, \"He's still autistic, isn't he?\" \n \n\"Oh, yes, that's for certain, probably always will be.\" \n \nHer eyes soften, wishing there were something she could do, finding nothing.  \n \n\"But he's doing well? He's in a good school?\" \n \n\"Yes, Mom, very well, and in a great school, where they love and appreciate him. I'll bring him by soon. He wants to see you, asks for you.\"  \n \nI haven't brought Jake to see my Mom since I had to put her cat Willie down last week. For a quite a while before that even, as Willie was growing quite frail, unable to handle the overly enthusiastic love of an autistic eight year old. \n \nJake adored that cat, will have a hard time with him gone. I'm not ready to handle that. Not yet. \n \n\u201cSo everything is good then?\u201d \n \n\u201cYes, Mom, everything is just fine, terrific.\u201d \n \n(Terrific? Is not a word I would ever use to describe my life. Once you add Special Needs, Autism into the mix of kids and family, life becomes many things: intense. challenging, stressful - always - stressful, also meaningful and rewarding in ways I had never imagined. \n \nBut \u201cjust fine\u201d? No. Not ever. Everything is not fine.  \n \nAnd also, this is news that cannot be shared with my mother, not anymore. She needs to know - to believe - that all is well with me, that caring for her is never a burden. She would feel so guilty if she thought she were one more weight heaped upon my difficult life. \n \nShe feels bad enough it\u2019s me taking care of her now instead of the other way around; that I\u2019m washing out HER underpants. So, to her, my life is \u201cjust fine.\u201d) \n \n\"Haven't found me a man yet, have you?\" \n \n\"Nope, Mom. They're either too old, too young or too... dull.\" \n \nShe nods in agreement, knows my father will be a hard act to follow. Yet, still, she longs for companionship. \n \nWe lay side by side, a short arms reach apart as I know she had lain for 51 years with my father on many a morning and evening (and, in their later, retired years, many an afternoon, too) talking about everything and nothing, the easy rhythms of intimacy. \n \nI know this well in my own life, with my husband (though in these frantic years of young and special needs children, our quietly together times are much fewer and farther between) and with my son Ethan who jealously hoards his bedtime talking time with me, needing so much to process his day before releasing it to slumber. (Not an easy sleeper, that one, not at all.) \n \nI held my mother\u2019s hand. We talked of this and that, and then we drifted off to sleep; took a little nap, side by side, our fingertips a bridge from daughter to mother. \n \n\"I'm going to be 89 soon,\" she had said, \"Imagine that.\" \n \n\"I can. I do. I'm no spring chicken myself, you know.\"  \n \n\"I plan to make it to 100.\" Then, shaking her head, \"Not likely.\" \n \n\"Why not?\" I\u2019d asked \"Why not?' \n \nShe\u2019d smiled. \n \nWe napped. \n \nI woke first, slipped my hand from her now lax fingers, stepped into the kitchen to do a little cleaning up after my formerly fastidious mother who now sees no dirt. \n \nI came back to wake her, to say goodbye. (There was so much to be done back across town, in my own life: groceries to purchase, children to retrieve, encroaching chaos to beat back.) \n \nBut first I sat softly on the bed, gently clasped her hand once again, leaned over to gaze at her barely lined, still beautiful face; whispered quietly, beneath the threshold of her dimmed hearing:  \n \n\"Why not, 100? Why not?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x9JtzOKZAjo/T6mVsssGZRI/AAAAAAAABfc/Tiy1IX6Ei5I/s1600/LTYM-NYC.png", "http://www.whendidigetlikethis.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/05/listen-to-your-mother-amazing-ride.html", "title": "\nListen to Your Mother - an amazing ride!\n"},

You spin around three times and squint at the sun, and those days are long gone; barely a wisp of a memory to look back on fondly...   Playgrounds full of shade and welcoming benches you could park yourself on - at least for a little while, when the activity localized on this particular climbing bar, that particular  tire swing. \n \nThough these were  also the days of \"Push me Mommy, push me! Push me higher,  and higher,   and higher,   and higher.\" And \"Noooooo, it's more fun when you do it!\" And aching arms. But worth it for the happily worn out, easier to bed down children. \n \nNow playgrounds are \"boring & for babies\" and the good basketball hoops in this city are few and far between and often taken over by teens and beyond; grown-ups taking their sport very seriously and yelling at the kids whose errant bouncing balls interfere with their a-little-more-intense-than-friendly games. \n \n \n \n A little old to be dominating a schoolyard, no? \n \nI want to yell at them: \"You're in a SCHOOLYARD, dude.

It's not a month. It's a life. \n \nA good life. But different. \n \nI am still, more than ever, swamped by my duties as producer of the Listen to Your Mother Show, which is happening THIS upcoming Sunday. So I barely have time to type even another sentence about anything else, let alone the meaningful post about autism I should be writing today. \n \nSo even though yesterday's post was stream of consciousness (to the max) and I usually try to follow that with something well thought out and structured. Not possible to happen today. It's just another brain-dump people, with apologies.  \n \nJacob has spring fever or spring mania or something and is bouncy and happy but also bouncy and LOUD, with his all-the-time talking at a new high. It's probably time for a visit to the psycho-pharmacologist for adjustments, and that is time and money I don't have. (Putting that call on my already floor-length to-do list for tomorrow.) \n \nListen to Your Mother is going to be amazing and our rehearsal yesterday truly inspiring. But it has definitely taken a toll on my family, with Ethan once again declaring that \"You love your computer more than your kids, your computer is more important than ME.\" Sigh. I hope some day he'll understand. \n \nYesterday I actually said to him \"I am more than just your mother, you know.\" And I kinda, sorta meant it. \n \nI have to assume some of Jacob's over-the-top-ness is his needing more from me than I have been giving lately. He wants to play, to talk, to show me everything he is doing, which is truly, truly wonderful, but the timing couldn't have been worse. \n \nSo I am juggling three full time jobs - LTYM, Special Needs Mom, Elder Caregiver - and well, it ain't pretty. \n \nThere is an important conversation going on right now, that you should be reading if you care about autism. It's over here: \n \n \n \n \nIt's an answer to someone finding their blog using the search words \"I wish I didn't have Asperger's.\" They want everyone typing those words into a search engine to find  THIS site  - and hear words of positivity and encouragement. \n \nHow utterly awesome. I wish I could have participated, but Asperger's is not the flavor of autism I have any real intimacy with, Jacob being of a different stripe altogether.\u00a0  \n \nBut it's wonderful stuff, a lot of great posts by a lot of my autism-mom friends written and linked up there. You should go and read! \n \nAnd that's really all I have time for today. Almost not a post, but better than nothing. (At least I'm sending you somewhere full of the wonderful.) \n \nNow I have to go do another hour or three worth of work on Listen to your mother, and then plan the kids' weekend.\u00a0 Do some paperwork for my mother. \n \nAnd sleep, oh, yeah that \"sleep\" stuff.

I am flat out flat out right now between producing Listen to Your Mother - show goes up on SUNDAY - yikes! - and then trying to actually BE a mother, and a care-taking daughter. and feeling like I'm failing miserably at BOTH right now - haven't seen my mother in a week too busy busy busy. Got a call from my aunt Marilyn's nursing home yesterday morning that she'd had another toe infection - nothing to be alarmed, just keeping me in the loop - and I'm all stabbed with guilt because I haven;t brought my Mom to see her sister in over a MONTH now but it always makes her so sad to see her sis so far gone, but then she feels guilty when she doesn't go, dilemma, dilemma. \n \nJake acting up a lot lately repeating \"Timmy is a Stupid Kid\" over & over (his own lovely take-off on the cartoon show Fairly Odd Parents theme song). I think he KNOWS it annoys me - because he's looking right at me and smiling his \"I got you\" smile while he does it - & is doing it because he's not getting enough positive attention from me as I am balls to the walls (yes metaphoric ones) with this LTYM show which is way more work than I had bargained for in the beginning but it feels so good to be working and being more than just mom but I know I am not being a quite good enough mom while I am so busy and mostly just DISTRACTED.  \n \nAnd thank GOD for wonderful neighbors who actually took Jake for 3 hours yesterday when my sitter had to leave early and my rehearsal was still going on and my husband was working at a convention and couldn't leave early because he was on a late panel. They're actually the most amazing people on the planet, kind and generous and smart and funny and fun to hang out with and I don;t know what I did to deserve them but whatever it is THANK GOODNESS. and then I feel guilty because I don;t know what i can ever do to repay them for all the slack they pick up for me other than occasionally picking their boys up at school. \n \nANd the LTYM rehearsal was today and so fabulous and the show the show is going to be WONDERFUL and I wish the theater were bigger because we are so sold out and so many of my procrastinator-y friends didn't think to buy tickets until it was too late even though I TOLD them it would sell out a month ago. le sigh. \n \nAnd my poor neglected blog - I tried to do Momalom's 5 for 5 linky but only got to 3 for 5. even started the last post - \"Listening\"\u00a0 - really wanted to write that one & had a lot to say there, but only got four sentences into it when had to put out another LTYM fire. lesson learned for next year - expect very little elsewhere in my life during pre-show month of April.

{"date": "Thursday, April 26, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nAge. \n \nYes. \n \nAs in: I am a woman of a certain... \n \nAs in: I am an older parent of older parents. A member of a stretched out sandwich generation. A hoagie, a grinder, a foot-long, as it were.\u00a0 With boys still in the single-digits (for a few months longer anyway) and a mother fast approaching her 90th birthday (while fading away before my eyes), I think about age a lot. \n \nI ask myself \"What was I thinking?\" having my kids at 42, when the alarm rings on a school morning at 5:45 and my Peri-menopausal insomnia has kept me up well past two. \n \nBut as my sleepy guy gives me a hug after his initial growl, intones \"Good morning, Mommy\" in his sing-song voice, I remember: this. \n \nI was thinking of this, and what I would miss if I didn't jump at my last good chance.\u00a0  \n \nI don't do the math anymore. \n \nI used to calculate: When the boys are Bar Mitsvahed at 13? I'll be 55, and my mom will be 93... \n \nHigh School graduation? Boys 18, me 60, Mom 98. \n \nCollege graduation: 22, 64, 102. \n \nTheir weddings? Well, that's anyone's guess. But, most certainly? Me: OLD. (And Mom? Beyond unlikely.) \n \nYou see how it became problematic in so many ways.  \n \nJacob's trajectory is anything but straightforward. The Bar Mitzvah can probably be accomplished at 13. With tutoring and accommodations. But those others? Not even really on my radar, autism the biggest monkey wrench imaginable to be thrown into future plans. \n \nJake is on his own timetable, biological and mental/emotional ages matching up at some points and diverging wildly at others. He is his own constellation, and the itinerary of that firmament is still so unknown and unknowable. Jake will do things on Jake's time. Enough. \n \nEven Ethan, without autism's schedule-skewering influences may stray from the straightforward march of life. Who knows? \n \nAnd then there's my mother's age, already stretching towards the horizon. \n \n \"Why not 100?\"  I had asked her, just a short year ago. But I can see how unlikely that is to happen now, how much this year has taken away, diminished her. \n \nAnd also unspoken here, when I began these calculations, in my sons' infancy?\u00a0 My father was still living and part of the equation. He made it to their pre-school graduations. To their 7th birthday party. Not beyond. \n \nHe would have been 98 at their Bar Mitzvah. Not impossible, as initially calculated. But not to be. \n \nAnd me? I am charting my own waters here. Nearly 52. A mother, easily old enough to be her children's grandmother. But not. \n \nLooking younger (a mixed blessing, an oft-used excuse for my immaturities). Some days feeling like a kitten; others as old as those proverbial hills. (Especially on ones when my boys want me to play basketball.) \n \nIn the last year of his life, when my father could still speak, before the  final downward spiral  when words sifted out their meanings from him, he shared with me this wondrous thing: \n \nAt 92, looking in the morning mirror, he would still find himself, some days, astonished to see an old man looking back at him. Because inside, he said (pointing to his head, his heart) is a young man of 22. \n \nForever and always. \n \nAge. \n \nYes. \n \n \n \n I am participating in Momalom's 5 for 5 link-up and the prompt for today, Thursday, was \u201cAge.\u201d\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://momalom.com/2012/04/five-for-five-topics-revealed-finally"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/age.html", "title": "\nAge\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 24, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nWords count. \n \nThey do.  \n \nI have always loved words. Been a reader. A person with a big vocabulary. Occasionally accused of snobbery for my use of ten-dollar words, for my correction of others' misuse of them.  \n \nIt has never been clearer how important words are, as the mother of one son who, like me, delights in words, and yet another who struggles mightily with them. \n \nWord have power. \n \nTo name. \n \nTo define. Or not. \n \nI was never afraid of the word: Autism. \n \nIt did not crush me - as I am aware it has others - when first I heard it used to name my son, these many years ago (October 6th, 2004, but who's counting?) \n \nBut other words? They do bear the power to harm. To diminish. To \"other\" a person. \n \nThe \"R-word\" is one of THOSE words: Retard. \n \nCall my son that? Make a joke about it? And I will hurt you. \n \nMy friend Ellen has written many a time, and most eloquently, about the harm that word does, and is deeply involved in the campaign to end it. (Read her on this:  Would you call my child a retard? ) \n \nRight now there is a video making the rounds in the special needs parent blogging community, and beyond, thanks to Joslyn (the Stark Raving Mad Mommy) at Babble. Watch it in her post there:  \u201cIt\u2019s About Dignity\u201d \n \n Or here , on my friend Jill's blog  Yeah. Good Times. \n \nIn it the father of a less communicative son on the autism spectrum (I refuse to use the term \"low functioning\" - believe it leads to viewing people - wrongly - as lesser, and to discounting their intelligence) comes public with the story of his son's suffering humiliation, bullying, cruelty and betrayal at the hands of his teachers and aides. \n \nYes. His teachers. Not other students. His teachers. \n \nAnd it was hidden. A secret. His son's sudden deterioration a mystery until the father wired him for sound one day after six months of getting nowhere, going through the proper channels at the school.  \n \nThe teachers and aides berate him. Tell him to \"Shut up!\" Make him cry by cruelly telling him \"No, that's not going to happen.\" when he asks, anxiously, if he is going to see his father later. Then call him a \"Bastard\" for crying. \n \nAnd it goes on. Gets worse. Their complete disregard for the humanity of the children in their charge apparent in everything they say and do.  \n \n(And they didn't all get fired. All but one? Just reassigned within the district. Still \"teaching.\") \n \nThey did not hit this boy, did not abuse him with their hands. But they systematically destroyed him. With words. \n \nBecause they could. \n \nBecause they knew he could. not. tell. anyone. \n \nHe didn't have enough words to do so. \n \nI rejoice in my autistic son's growing facility with words. All the new ways he tells me what he is thinking and feeling. The jokes he makes, even when they involve substituting \"stupid\" for every other descriptive word in a song. \n \nBut still, I know there are whole realms of things he cannot tell me; thoughts and ideas still locked in his head, the language key not yet found that would release them. \n \nAnd I worry, I worry every day that bad things could happen to him; bad people cross his path, do him harm.

{"date": "Monday, April 23, 2012", "body": "\n    \nI haven't participated in  Stasha\u2019s  Monday Listicles in a loooong loooong time. But this week's topic is near and dear to my heart, so I had to jump in. This week, Stasha herself asked us to write a list about... books.\u00a0\u00a0 \n That's it: Books! Anything about books.\u00a0 So... Easy - I love books! \n \nAlso? Not so easy - I love books - so I can think of 10,000 things to say about them, how can I narrow that down to ten. \n \nAnd is this a list of MY favorite books? My kids' favorite books? Books I've really enjoyed, even if they're trashy? Or books I think are IMPORTANT?\u00a0 Or... or... (Yes, I AM capable of over-complicating anything, thank you.) \n In the end? I decided to go with, simply: 10 books that I love. (Even though it is guaranteed that as soon as I hit the publish button on this post I will hit myself upside the head with a \"Oy! How could I have left THAT book off the list!) So without further ado:  \n \n Varda's List of Ten Books That I Love (or are important to me in some way) in no particular order : \n 1.\u00a0   Just Above My Head , by James Baldwin  \n \nThis last novel of his is, in my opinion, vastly underrated, and one of my  favorite novels. It's gloriously shaggy. And it has one of my favorite 1st  lines: \"The damn'd blood burst...\" \n \n \n \n \u00a0 2.\u00a0   No Place On Earth  by Christa Wolf  \n \nOne that I can guarantee 99.9% of you have never heard of.  The first line: \"The wicked spoor left in time\u2019s wake as it flees us.\" \n \n 3.\u00a0  An American Childhood  by Annie Dillard \n \nI love Annie Dillard. She is one of my very favorite writers on the planet. I once found hardcover copies of this book on cheap remainder somewhere and bought 5 so I could give them away to friends. \n \n \n \n 4.\u00a0  A Wizard of Earthsea  by Ursula K. Le Guin. \nThese were favorite books of mine as a child (then a trilogy, now a  longer series) and still are wondrous tales. Ursula Le Guin is an  amazing writer. \n \n \n 5.\u00a0  White Noise  by Don Delillo \n \nNo description really necessary. Much lauded. A wonderful novel. Unfortunately the first Delillo I ever read, and nothing else ever measured up. \n \n \n 6.\u00a0  Wave Without a Shore  by\u00a0   C.J. Cherryh \u00a0 \n \n Science Fiction. I love it. And C.J. Cherryh is an amazing writer, one of my favorites. I can't even begin to describe this book, a strange one. But it makes you think and think and think; and that's what science fiction does, at its best. And I just found out that she's a blogger and calls her blog  Wave Without A Shore,  so this must be one of her favorites too. \n \nAnd now, some important books written by writers who are all on the autism spectrum. How important these are to me is hard to explain, except to say I read them all when Jacob was young and much less expressive of his thoughts and feelings than he is now, when once I feared I would never catch even a glimpse into his inner life. \n \nNow, he is nowhere near as articulate as these folks - all adults with aspergers and thus not with Jake's specific language processing issues - but still, every day I am moving closer and closer to him. It is wonderful, and deeply appreciated. \n \nBut when I read these books, Jake was still so much a cypher to me. Hearing these authors talk about their experiences as autistic children in the confusing and cacophonous world has been invaluable to my early burgeoning understandings of my son:\u00a0  \n \n 7.\u00a0  Songs of the Gorilla Nation  by Dawn Prince-Hughes \n \nThis is a beautiful and important book about autism, written by an autist who became a primatologist and began to understand people though gorillas. Incredible writing. \n \n 8.\u00a0  Look Me in the Eye:  My Life with Asperger's  by John Elder Robison  \n \nWonderful and richly detailed memoir of John Elder Robison's life both before and after his diagnosis of Asperger's. And much of his life takes places in Amherst, my old college town!  \n \n 9.\u00a0  Born on a Blue Day  by Daniel Tammet \n \nAnother wonderful memoir by an autistic author. Daniel is a math savant with major synesthesia who has memorized Pi to an amazing length. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0  \n \n 10.  Thinking in Pictures   by Temple Grandin \n \nThe mother of all autism memoirs. Temple is probably the most well known autists on the planet, and she is an amazing woman.\u00a0 I met her once, and remember her asking the person standing next to me if he preferred her to look at or listen to him because she was having trouble doing both. \n \n \nOK, I'm done - let's call it a night!\u00a0 What are some of YOUR favorite books? \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.northwestmommy.com/category/monday-listicles", "http://www.northwestmommy.com/category/monday-listicles", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-93RhCUj4mBo/T5ZN779vmvI/AAAAAAAABaY/CQRr70wPvNw/s1600/James+BAldwin.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pp87OlOBtIU/T5ZOwTPrHlI/AAAAAAAABao/vPDzmEvPoU4/s1600/No+Place+on+Earth.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s19ph2gKEDg/T5ZOvgB75iI/AAAAAAAABag/Ttug_RuzcVQ/s1600/Annie+Dillard.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AuuK8cURb4M/T5ZOx7EBzTI/AAAAAAAABa4/992Rw5or43I/s1600/Wizard+of+Earhtsea.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I1iReeE6uqY/T5ZYPF9vZeI/AAAAAAAABbY/jQAcwRrZHNM/s1600/White_Noise.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d0x6sz2OtnI/T5ZbILKFi7I/AAAAAAAABbg/cg3ciUbjV-s/s1600/Wave.jpg", "http://www.cherryh.com/WaveWithoutAShore/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QN0rRQ0d63I/T5ZOw3eVrmI/AAAAAAAABaw/DANtowomX7w/s1600/Songs+of+the+Gorilla+Nation.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TzvW09LwTAA/T5ZSBtCmI_I/AAAAAAAABbA/XU6cO-azrWc/s1600/Look+me+in+the+Eye.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RrfVyBY473U/T5ZSCG9oe_I/AAAAAAAABbI/zEkUakB-sFI/s1600/Tammet.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i7rM2r7ccYg/T5ZSCXy_nBI/AAAAAAAABbQ/ItLWz0ji75o/s1600/Temple+Grandin.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/monday-listicles-books-books-books.html", "title": "\nMonday Listicles: Books!

I am feeling worn down by the unending nature of it  all, the intensity of my nine year old son\u2019s needs, especially in  comparison with his typical(-ish) becoming vastly more independent twin  brother. \n \nBut as this community is called \u201cHopeful Parents\u201d and not  \u201cCranky Whiny Parents\u201d I don\u2019t want to bring that negativity here.  \n \nSo  I thought I would take a moment to share 3 positive things that my son  Jacob\u2019s autism brings to the table. These may be small, even trivial  things (and some seeming contradictory, the positive side of a presumed  negative trait) but small gifts are still gifts, nonetheless. \n \nAnd I  would rather focus on being grateful than serve you another round of  complaints today; tip the scales up instead of down. \n \nSo here is a short list of some of the gifts Jacob\u2019s particular flavor of autism has bestowed upon him and us, his family: \n \n1.  Jake\u2019s obliviousness has some decidedly useful aspects. Last night I  banged my elbow, HARD, holding open the bus door as Jake disembarked (I  have definitely done some damage as it still hurts badly today). \n \nAs I  stepped off the bus and literally jumped up and down and then leaned on  the bus stop wall as my knees buckles with the pain, I DEFINITELY let  loose a stream of words Jacob should not have been hearing.  \n \nIf  it were Ethan with me last night? He would have been cackling with  delight. I would now be hearing no end of his having caught Mom cursing,  and furthermore he would likely be telling everyone all about it,  outing me to the other moms in the schoolyard this morning.\u00a0  \n \nBut  Jacob? He didn\u2019t notice the salty language one bit, offered me nothing  but sympathy: \u201cMommy, do you have an owie? Are you OK? You need a  band-aid, Mommy!\u201d and patted my back, kindly. (And anyone who says autistic kids have no empathy can suck it.) \n \n2. Jacob loves the  movies so much he will see ANYTHING. Ethan, on the other hand, has a  very short list of what he will watch and it has to fit into his idea of  \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cBig Kid / Teenage-ish\u201d and that is that. \n \nBut Jacob? While  there are some (heavily advertised) kid movies he begs to see - and we  do - he is perfectly happy to sit through pretty much anything in a  movie theater, as long as there is popcorn and he can stay through the  very last end credit.\u00a0  \n \nThis means if I have dropped Ethan off on  a playdate and there\u2019s a vaguely-appropriate-for-kids movie I want to  see (rated PG13 or below), I can bring Jake with me and we will both be  very happy.  \n \n3. Jacob doesn\u2019t judge people. He has no notion of  race, of class, of \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cuncool.\u201d He notices that people are  different from each other, but it is interesting to him the way the  difference between two flowers would be interesting: the facts, no  values attached. \n \nThe other day he asked a boy with a port wine stain birthmark what  was on his face, and thank goodness that boy understood that there was  no meanness in the question for Jake, just curiosity. So the boy  answered in a very straightforward manner that it was a birthmark and  had been there since he was born, just a part of him. \n \nAnd that was it  for Jake. Question answered. Let's play. \n \nAnd that\u2019s it for me tonight. Three little things I am grateful for. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more. But I have to go ice my elbow now. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/---QvjpP8X2o/T5J8nP2dTKI/AAAAAAAABaQ/a5WaIRbq2rU/s1600/IMG_1621.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/autisms-little-gifts.html", "title": "\nAutism\u2019s Little Gifts\n"},

It was the very end of Spring Break. Ethan had a birthday party to attend on the East side, very near my Mother's place, so we went to see her for a short visit afterward. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter dropping her off in the dining room, then stepping out into the late afternoon sunshine, I had a brainstorm: Ethan and I should go out to dinner; just Mother and Son, enjoying a rare balmy April evening.  \n \n \n \n \n \nI called Dan who was home with Jake and told them they were on their own for dinner, and he was OK with that. \n \n \n \n \n \nHe knew Ethan had been complaining that \"Jake got all this time alone  with you Mom while I was in basketball camp, and I didn't get any.\" So we needed this time  together.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Barking Dog Diner, one of my favorite casual local joints, was just two blocks away, and had a slew of outdoor tables.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter we put in our order (I had my usual grilled salmon sandwich on \n7-grain bread - the one I had craved constantly during my pregnancy) we \nhad time to kill together sitting around the table.  \n \n \n \n \n \nEthan was itching to get his hands on my iPhone and play games, but I  \ndidn't want to lose him to the screens. I suggested we take advantage of\n  the sunshine and his cuteness and take some photos. Hence the mugging. \n \n \n \n \n \nEthan\n LOVES to pose dramatically, though he often cracks himself up doing it.\n He has a hard time keeping the \"brooding\" face on.

This post originally appeared there, in December 2011, and I am happy to report that the hashtag community phenomenon is still going strong.   \n \nIf you\u2019re on Twitter, and maybe even if you\u2019re not (say, if you read  Stimey's wonderful article )  you may have heard of a hashtag topic marker that has been making the  rounds for the past few weeks, even spending some time trending (on days  when celebrity gossip yields few juicy items I presume).  \n \nIt is this one:  #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf\u2026 \u00a0 and it has been garnering some amazing responses.  \n \nIt started as a private joke between two autism-mom bloggers who are also twitter friends: Jenny ( @manyhatsmommyMI ) and Elise ( @ RaisingASDKids ), a take off on Jeff Foxworthy's \"You might be a redneck if...\" humor. \n \nAnd  then, as brilliant ideas often do, it spread like wildfire. People in  the autism community noticed, chimed in (what Twitter was made for)  because if there\u2019s one thing we autism parents need on a daily basis,  it\u2019s a good laugh. \n \nAnd while some of the tweets were funny in a  side splitting way, others were funny with a wince; some were heart  touching, yet others a call for help and support. \n \nHere is a small sampling below: \n \n @Stimey :  #youmightbeanautismparentif you consider your kid's epic spinning    session in a fast food restaurant to be an exercise in autism awareness. \n \n @diaryofamom : #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf you've discovered that 'family' need not be defined by blood. \n \n @littlebitquirk :  #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf you are filling out forms and your 7 year  old points out the mistakes you're making. And she's right! \n \n \n   @LeeAnne_K_Owens :  #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf you carry fidgets, gum & pec cards instead of lipstick and nail files in your purse. \n \n @jillsmo :  \u00a0 #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf trying to get any information out of your child is practically your full time job. \n \n \n @myautisticson :    #youmightbeanautismparentif you have learned to love your child for   who  they are, rather than who they should be. Best lesson ever! \n \nI caught wind of all this about a week after it had started, when  I saw a #youmightbeanautismparentif tweet from a friend and thought  YES! And looked in to see what this hashtag was all about. \n \nI added this to the conversation: \n @squashedmom : #youmightbeanautismparentif you think that neurotypicality is HIGHLY overrated. \n \nWhat  I found was a community gathering itself again, in a marvelous way.  Some people were even joining Twitter just to be a part of the  conversation. Jess from a diary of a mom tweeted: \n \n \n   @diaryofamom: \u00a0  #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf   you barely glance at Twitter outside this hash tag cause a) you're out of time and b) all the cool kids are here. \u00a0    \n \nIt made me think about how important community and support are  when you\u2019re a special needs parent. I am well aware that we are the  lucky ones, we who became parents in this age of awareness and internet  connectivity; how even if you live in an isolated rural area, you can  now easily find others who really \u201cget it,\u201d who can answer questions,  laugh and cry with you. \n \nI think about how hard it was to be a  special needs parent in the age when we were told our kids were  hopeless, to just shut them away and forget about them, or even worse,  that it was OUR fault they were that way.  \n \nI can only imagine how  hard it must have been when it was considered a shameful secret to have  children that weren\u2019t \"perfect,\" and to support and believe in your  special needs child was a radical act; and you were unlikely to know  anyone at all in the same boat. \n \nI am grateful to those brave  pioneers who have come before me, and so thankful to be in the midst of  the many amazing, supportive communities I have found both in my city  and in the world via the internet. \n \nSo every day I check out what\u2019s new in the twitter stream gathered at  #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf ,  grateful that every day brings me new friends who have found yet  another place to share the joys and pains of special needs parenthood. \n \nCome join the conversation on Twitter. You can find me at  @Squashedmom . Usually adding my two cents daily, even if it\u2019s just... \n \n @squashedmom :  #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf you are just too damn tired to think of  anything witty tonight, but still need to connect to this community. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/", "http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/autism-unexpected/2011/dec/5/youmightbeanautismparentif-youve-seen-hashtag/", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23youmightbeanautismparentif", "https://twitter.com/#%21/manyhatsmommyMI", "http://twitter.com/raisingasdkids", "https://twitter.com/#%21/raisingasdkids", "http://twitter.com/#%21/Stimey", "http://twitter.com/#%21/diaryofamom", "https://twitter.com/#%21/littlebitquirk", "https://twitter.com/#%21/LeeAnne_K_Owens", "https://twitter.com/#%21/jillsmo", "http://twitter.com/#%21/myautisticson", "http://twitter.com/squashedmom", "https://twitter.com/#%21/diaryofamom", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23youmightbeanautismparentif", "http://twitter.com/squashedmom", "http://twitter.com/squashedmom"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/building-community-one-tweet-at-time.html", "title": "\nBuilding Community One Tweet at a Time\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 12, 2012", "body": "\n   Note:  In Honor of Autism Awareness/Acceptance Month I am bringing some of my posts from the group  Hopeful Parents site  (where I post monthly on the 10th) back home to my blog. This post originally appeared there. \n \nA few things in my life have been tapping me on the shoulder lately, asking me to please pay attention to the long view; looking down the road toward what my son Jacob may need in about a dozen years when he will ostensibly be an adult, or something like one. \n \nWe can\u2019t know what life has in store for us, what twists and turns may lie ahead, with anything near certainty, but with each passing year that my son Jacob remains clearly on the autism spectrum, the prospect of him moving into \"the mainstream\" fades further and further from my radar. \n \nAnd it hurts. It hurts my head and my heart to stand in the middle of the path Jake is currently on and calculate, clear-eyed, his trajectory, seeing it landing him square in the realm of needing some sort of minding or looking after... for the rest of his life.  \n \nNow, my son Jake is in a funny category. I don't love the labels, the ranking and quantifying. Because it leads to a certain reductivism, a tendency to see the traits, the diagnoses, and not the whole person - my wonderful son - who is so much more than the sum of his parts. But sometimes it helps when talking about these things to say: my son is considered \"mid-high functioning.\" \n \n\"High-functioning\" in the ways he has spoken language, reads, constantly attempts to communicate, actively engages with others and has a tremendous amount of social desire. \n \n\"Look, Mommy,\" he'll say, \u201cI\u2019m petting the kitty!\u201d wanting to share his world with me. \n \nBut still, he is \"mid-functioning\" in how much of his language is still often scripted and repetitive, in how much of what he is hearing he is not comprehending; his language processing deficit rearing its ugly head time & time again. \n \nAnd while he understands much about his immediate, concrete world, as soon as abstractions are introduced he is quickly lost. Language based as they all are. \n \nAsk him a why question and you get a tautology: \n \n\"Why are you crying Jake?\" \n \n\"Because I am sad.\" \n \n\"Why are you sad Jake?\" \n \n\"Because I'm crying.\" \n \nBut the biggest concern of all is how little he understands of how the world works, and thus how undeveloped his ability to safely navigate in it. \n \nJake\u2019s twin, at 9, doesn't always exhibit complete safety awareness when crossing a busy city street, but he's working on it. And he knows the elements involved, can rattle off what he should be doing -- waiting for the walk signal, looking both ways, watching out for turning cars, etc. etc.   \n \nJake on the other hand, still seems to not know the difference between the sidewalk and the road, has no awareness as to there being a threshold crossed from one to the other. I must have pointed out the red stop hand and the white walking man of the crosswalk signs a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand times, and still he cannot for the life of him remember what they are supposed to communicate, why they should matter to him.   \n \nI could give a hundred other examples, but let's just say that while I expect Jake to grow and change, develop significantly, and blossom forth, unless there is a whole order of transformation about him - let's say future nanobots that can hook up the disconnected neural pathways or whatnot - we're looking at some sort of lifelong support system for him. \n \nAnd this is where I quake in my boots. \n \nBecause the infrastructure to support that, for the MASS of kids who are going to need it, from the autism explosion that has manifested in Jake's generation? \n \nIs simply. not. there. \n \nI have a friend whose brother is autistic and in her charge, as her parents are both now gone. Her brother is living in a wonderful place, a small group home run by a dedicated staff. It is stable and intimate, and they function like a family. The residents venture out daily to jobs or day programs; there are outings: nature hikes, bicycle rides, movie nights, ice cream runs. \n \nWonderful. \n \nBut not wonderful. \n \nBecause my friend's brother had to wait 10 years on a waiting list to get in. And he's 42. Of the 5 in 10,000 generation. \n \nThere are a few handfuls of wonderful, appropriate settings for mid-functioning autistic adults; allowing them to live in supportive communities, nearly, but not fully independently. And, most importantly, where the residents have significant SAY in how things are run and their lives are ordered. \n \nAnd now, it is our job as the parents of young autistic children to see that those grow a hundredfold, a thousand-fold, so they will be there for our kids who will likely need them. \n \nAnd if you help to build a network of terrific group homes and your child ends up being one of the lucky ones, able to function fully independently in the world without support? You have done a wonderful thing for your community. \n \nAnd if you don't act NOW? Your child may end up homeless on the street, in jail, or worse. Because while you think they can live with you forever... are you really going to live forever? \n \nSo yes, this started as a personal meditation on my son's future and ended with a call to arms. \n \nBecause in about ten year's time a whole generation of autistic adults is going to be aging out of their educational programs and therapeutic services. Many of them will be bright and personable enough to get jobs, but perhaps not be able to manage finances, or keep up with the many maintenance tasks of daily life without some degree of support. \n \nAnd where will they go? Where will they go?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/looking-down-road.html", "title": "\nLooking Down the Road\n"},

But with SOC Sunday I can take a snippet out of my brain and call it a post. Wheeeee!  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n \nJacob is getting really crafty. He's always got something going on... some phrase or word or sound that he repeats over and over.\u00a0 When he was little it was word-for-word scripting from his favorite TV shows. But he's become much more creative now. \n \nHis language is growing by leaps and bounds, and I'm not complaining about that in the least.\u00a0 OK, I;m lying, I DO complain about it sometimes when he talks all the time. We are a family of talkers, and often there is precious little peace in the house.  \n \nThere is a lot that is frustrating for Jacob in life, and he needs to vent his frustration like we all do.\u00a0 And these days, his favorite word to do that with? Is \"Stupid\" - which happens to be one of my least favorite words in the English language (of course). \n \nThe first time he used it, I was thrilled with his being \"age-appropriate\" (I even  wrote a post about it !) but now I'm getting really tired of it. \n \nBecause, of course, once he realized it annoys me? Its value has risen sky high. So it's not just being used to express his feelings (\"Stupid Batman!\" when he can't get the guy to fit in the Batmobile in a way that lets the top close) but instead, it's become his beloved catchphrase. \n \nHe inserts it into EVERYTHING... asking to watch \"Sponge Bob Stupid Pants,\" asking for his \"stupid\" dinner and singing \"Twinkle Twinkle Stupid Star\" along with me at night. \n \nAnd then, when I have had enough and start threatening loss of privileges - like his beloved TV - if he says it again? He is changes over to... spelling it out: S - T - U - P - I - D.\u00a0 And I have to laugh, as he is being so clever. \n \nI still don't like it, but as he is being so S-M-A-R-T about it, I let it slide when he spells it.  \n \nThe other thing Jake's taken up lately is mewoing like Gary the pet snail in Sponge Bob. This isn't a frustration release, he just enjoys the sound, in a delightful stimmy sort of way. And I know that stimming calms autists and makes them happy, so I'm not trying to completely squash him when he makes the sounds that bring him such joy. \n \nBut I really don't want them being bellowed 3 inches from my face, either.\u00a0 So I am asking him at times to stop meowing. And you know what he's doing, then? \n \nYup. \n \nM - E - O - W. \n \nSmart-ass kid.  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \u00a0  \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Sunday, April 8, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n   \n \n \n Batman & Joker at the Seder table, 2012 \n \nFood is the great memory-soup-pot stirrer.  And so moments with my father often rise up to slap me in the face when I am in the midst of fixing food. (I would have said \"cooking\" but anyone who knows me would have done a spit-take, as I don't really cook these days, mostly assemble.) \n \nPassover began on Friday at sunset, so our house was awash in matzo. Making Ethan his lunch, I asked if he would like some, or if he thought he\u2019d be sick of it by the time these next 8 days were over, but he responded with an enthusiastic \u201cYes!\u201d (Or as enthusiastic as a kid who is down for the count with a sore throat and bad cold can sound.) \n \nAnd so I head to the kitchen to fix Ethan some (whole wheat) matzo the way he likes it\u2026 the way I liked it as a kid, schooled by my father because it was the way HE liked it: slathered with a thin, even sheen of butter and then salted. \n \nHe LOVED to eat matzo like that, and for years I did too. There is an art to it, making sure the butter is soft enough to spread, and spreading with a light enough touch so as not to pulverize the matzo as you spread. Then shaking on just enough salt. A delicate operation all around. \n \nSo standing in my kitchen, making my son his matzo I have invoked my father, tickled that such an un-religious man is so heavily associated with this very observant foodstuff. \n \nHe was a dedicated atheist/agnostic. He disliked organized religion. But we always did Passover and Hanukkah. I think because these were holidays in the home, about food and family.\u00a0 And food and family were really important to him. \n \nSo every Passover of my childhood, we would head off to my Aunt & Uncle's (my mother's brother's family) where my wonderful cousins would be waiting for me.\u00a0 We would go through the haggadah - a liberal, modern one, light on the \"chosen people\" & Hebrew and heavy on the social justice and unity of all peoples stuff - as quickly as possible. Then linger over the wonderful meal, finish up fast and roll home very late, very happy.  \n \nMy husband's family is much more traditional and religious than mine, and in the years when my father was still alive and it was the year for us to Passover with Dan's side, my father would gamely sit through the long Seder, eat his matzo without butter, it being a Kosher meat meal.  \n \nAs the years went on, his post-dinner sofa nap became longer and longer, eventually involving a pre-dinner one as well, encompassing most of the Seder itself. But still, it was good to have him with us. \n \nHe and my Mother-in-law passed in the same year, so my mother is the sole representative of their generation at Passover now. This year she appeared markedly more fragile than last, fading rapidly. \n \nI feel her slipping away before my eyes, a pleasant smile always on her face, but less and less going on behind it with each passing day.\u00a0 Caring for my father grounded her, kept her present, focused.\u00a0 She is starting to forget people.\u00a0 I do not know if she will still be with us next Passover. \n \nThis year my father is now two years gone; this our third Passover without him. But buttering and salting a square of matzo for my son, I feel him standing by my side, peering over my shoulder, reaching out for its crisp, crumbly goodness; reassuring me I've salted it perfectly, just right. \n\u00a0  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DOR-GClaL6g/T4IOomiE7NI/AAAAAAAABYU/NmwHr1iBoFw/s1600/IMG_1449.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/missing-my-father-passover-edition.html", "title": "\nMissing my Father, Passover Edition\n"},

Anyway, to recap: it's a  regular monthly round-up of what has caught my eye (and  brain, and  heart) on the internet.  \n \nAnd this month I'm going heavy on the newest feature, favorite instagram photos from other blogging photographer's instagram feeds. And this month these are, as I predicted last month, all by my friend  Neil Kramer, the AMAZING intstagram photographer who also blogs at  Citizen of the Month.  And if you love his photos as I do, you can follow his feed though his twitter handle  @Neilochka .  \n \nSo without further ado, a double handful of wonderful posts and a mess o' instagram photos from March, 2012, presented for your edification and enjoyment... \n \n   Not even a little bit  from Kris of  Pretty All True \n \n So, I'm Going To Be Okay\u00a0  from  (The Empress) Alexandra of  Good Day Regular People\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \"Cash Register\"  by Neil Kramer \n \n Your Baby is My Baby  from Jean / Stimey of   Stimeyland  \n \n We're afraid to die  from Amanda of  Last Mom on Earth \n \n \n \n \"Pacific\"  by Neil Kramer \n \n The best of school, the worst of school  from Alice of  Finslippy \n \n\u00a0 Little soldiers  from Heather of  The Extraordinary Ordinary \n \n \n \n \"Pier, Manhattan Beach\"   Neil Kramer \n \n \n Not Quite\u00a0Closure  from  Dragon Slayer Mama of  tenaciouscee \n \n A Uterus Is Not a Machine, My Daughter Is Not a Farm Animal, and I Am Not Happy  from Adrienne of  No Points For Style \n \n \n \n \"Bicycles\"  by  Neil Kramer \n \n \n Dick Cheney's First\u00a0Heart  from Deb of  Deb on the Rocks \n \n \n How Do You?  from Stacy of  Filling in the Blanks \n \n \n \n \n \"Surfer\"  by  Neil Kramer \n \nAnd, as always this is an idiosyncratic, and very incomplete list.

A big deal in the autism parenting community. \n \nI am, as is usual these days, a busier than busy bee, slammed to the wall with things that MUST BE DONE. And a long school vacation is looming later this week. \n \nBut I could not let today pass silently, without notice on my blog. It's just too important. \n \nLast year I wrote a pretty cool post about my son, Jacob:  Every day is Autism Awareness Day 'round these parts  and everything I said in there still stands. \n \nJake is now one year older, evolved and evolving; his conversational skills and  artistic talents  just bursting forth, more and more amazingly every day.  \n \nAnd he is still, and will likely always be, on the autism spectrum. A unique boy with a unique brain; a singular perspective on the world, which, thankfully, usually delights him. \n \nI love Jacob with every fiber of my being.  \n \nBut I hate that he struggles so mightily with language, with expressing himself, and sometimes with just simply understanding what people are saying to him. I see the efforts in his eyes; sometimes I swear I can watch his brain attempting to process. And then I see the pain when it just doesn't compute, and he switches off. \n \nI hate that his relationship with his twin brother, Ethan, is so difficult and fractious. I know that this too will evolve, but it has been a thorn in my side for so long now, it is hard to imagine anything other than the state of fraternal siege we live in.  \n \nI worry about his future in so many ways. I want him to have the biggest, fullest, happiest, most independent life possible. I want him to always be surrounded by love.  \n \nBut I know how harsh and cruel the world can be for those who are noticeably different.  \n \nAnd as much as I am alarmed by the statistics that have recently come out, how autism is on the rise as a worldwide phenomenon and is just increasing and increasing annually with little end in sight? \n \nI am also weirdly comforted by knowing that Jacob will not be alone. That he will be be coming of age as an adult into a world increasing filling up with others like him, and the world will HAVE to change - and will actively BE changed by the higher functioning of his brethren - to accommodate Jake and his people. \n \n1 in 88 is a number, a statistic. \n \nBut my Jacob is not a number. \n \nHe is a person.  \n \nA boy. \n \nMy boy.  \n \nThis is the face of autism. \n \nTo me. \n \n \n \n \n Jacob, March 2012 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fK9--OzMjqk/T3lusPxEYNI/AAAAAAAABWk/-oS--IGZW8A/s1600/IMG_1039.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2PRmhu8_0lE/T3luypm8_II/AAAAAAAABWs/Dt0q5PHvV9k/s1600/IMG_1210.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/04/my-1-in-88.html", "title": "\nMy 1 in 88\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, March 31, 2012", "body": "\n \n   \nI think about the connection between art and autism a lot. About how outside the box, committed to their singular vision both the artist and the autist, each in their own way, are. \n \nI've been doing this for a while (see my best known post \" From Autist to Artist \") but it's been circling round my brain a lot these days, as Jacob's artwork has really taken off lately. Into the stratosphere. \n \nIf you've been following my facebook or Twitter streams you may have seen some of these: \n \n \n \n \"Bruce Wayne\" \n \n \n \n \"Goku\" (From Dragonball Z-Kai) \n \n \n \n \"Commissioner Gordon\" \n \n \n \n \"Goku\" (Again) \n \n \n \n \"Superman\" \n \nDrawing makes Jacob so happy. Time to draw is his big reward at school, and it's a great carrot.\u00a0 You don't want to know how fast we go through a ream of paper these days. And I'm not complaining in the least. \n \nWhat I am most struck with is the emotion in the faces he draws, even more then the details of certain parts like the ears (the ears!), or the way his noses look like noses; the way he captures a mouth with one line - and it so completely is a mouth.  \n \nThis flies in the face of so much common \"wisdom\" about autistic people paying no attention to faces, or not being able to read facial expressions for emotion.  \n \nWhen I mentioned this along with a photo of Jake's art I posted on Facebook, a cyber-friend, who is herself on the spectrum, responded with this really interesting reflection: \n \n \n \n \nWhat this has to do with his autism, if it's mere coincidence or if the way he perceives the world through its filters open up the artist space in him, all this is unknown and probably unknowable. And ultimately besides the point. \n \nI don't have any answers here. This is just me ruminating out loud, in public (blogs are so lovely for that). And also, truth be told, showing off, sharing some of my son's wonderfulness with the world. \n \nBecause Jake deserves to be celebrated. \n \nI do know this: Jake's drawings are alive, in the way that mere renderings are not. They are art, and he IS an artist.\u00a0  \n \nJake is who he is. \n \nA package deal. \n \nAn artist and an autist. \n \nBut mostly, he's just Jake. \n \nMy son.  \n \n \n<^><^>^<^> \n \nI haven't been writing that much about autism here lately, as much as it suffuses our lives, and bits of it weave through almost every thing I do. The other bits of life have been more dominant. \n \nBut that's about to change. Tomorrow is April 1st, the beginning of Autism Awareness month, and Monday, April 2nd is International Autism Awareness Day.\u00a0 And just in time for all of this, the CDC has released new figures for Autism rates that are making big news. \n \nI'm sure you know the new numbers, but if you've been sitting in a cave and haven't heard: \n \n1 in 88. \n \n(And for boys it's 1 in 54.)  \n \nAnd these are figures for 2008. \n \nFour years ago. \n \n(A limited 2011 study? 1 in 38. No I'm not kidding.)  \n \nSo I'm going to be talking about Autism a lot this month, and you should too.\u00a0 Because it's not going away, and even if you don't have an autistic kid (or nephew or cousin) you are and will be affected by this. \n \nAnd the autistic kids of today are going to be the autistic adults of tomorrow, contributing to and (re-)shaping our world. And figuring out how best to support them, how to establish a future world that nurtures and meets the needs of us all, really needs to be on all of our minds. \n \nIt sure is constantly on mine. \n \nTo be continued people... to be continued... \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y4sz3Ws8vwg/T3dBeNWrt7I/AAAAAAAABWE/JMRKXsqtInI/s1600/IMG_1387.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eJ8Z20e4CY8/T3dBjk8KXEI/AAAAAAAABWU/o6gqJwJa1SM/s1600/IMG_1395.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jbaa5j6Mxzk/T3dBKWjw3aI/AAAAAAAABVs/1NzvhuriP6E/s1600/Commissioner+Gordon+close-up.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4g4b_Sqqqlc/T3dBMJW_0sI/AAAAAAAABV0/SSMeDMgH8yE/s1600/Goku+again.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dIF56jNQ6nw/T3dBMnKgzjI/AAAAAAAABV8/CQGL8cQRzRU/s1600/Jacob%27s+Superman.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AoZeBQaaZg0/T3etBQylKMI/AAAAAAAABWc/xPcN87G2FO8/s1600/Facebook+Comment.png"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2012/03/art-and-autism.html", "title": "\nArt and Autism\n"},

{"date": "Monday, March 19, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Venus & Jupiter in the sky - so NOT in New York City \n \nTonight Ethan and I ran a little excursion after dinner. Just the two of us. When we walked out the door it was not quite seven o'clock. These days that means a sky full of light. \n \nAdded to the ridiculously unseasonable warmth, us stepping out of a March eve in mere t-shirts, and I was hard pressed to remember it wasn't a languorous summer evening, but yet a school night, and thus we had to execute our errand quickly and hurry home.  \n \nBesides, I had promised the upstairs neighbors with whom I had parked Jake that we'd be back within the hour, and I sorely did not want to abuse my favor currency with them, would surely be needing to spend it again soon.  \n \nJake himself was delirious to be upstairs with his \"best friends\" -- the four year-old sister of a pair of brothers who are Ethan's good school friends, and their white terrier, Mac, with whom Jake is nearly as obsessed as he is with our cat.  \n \nEthan and I were on a mission, because I had failed in my mom-duties today: I was to have picked up a particular book for Ethan, another in the once-seeming-endless Warriors series that we are now close to outflanking.  \n \nThe latest installment comes out in April, and the one before that will appear in paperback the same day, when we will finally snatch it up. I adamantly refuse to purchase these throwaway books in hardcover, so Ethan is going to have to get over his aversion to the library if he wants to read that last one anytime soon. \n \nWe absolutely HAD to go to the bookstore because he had finished the last Warriors book in our possession the day before, and thus we were now in the dreaded state of NOTHING TO READ.  \n \nI will not mention again the hundred wonderful books, sitting uncracked in our apartment; forlorn, unbeloved, rejected out of hand. Ethan is a picky reader. But for that he is now these past two years an avid reader, I am eternally grateful. I will forgive the undeserved scorn he heaps upon those poor maligned tomes, for the joy suffusing his being as he greedily devours the chosen volumes. \n \nEthan is in high, silly spirits as we walk the busy Broadway blocks to our local Barnes & Noble, and I am grumpy, nursing a throbbing elbow that may be a cracked bone or terribly distressed tendon. No way to tell until I visit the doctor, which I have such a deep aversion to doing. \n \nI don't mind doctors and their offices, really I don't, feeling quite at home there from the countless hours spent looking after my elderly parents' health. And I kind of like peering inside my body, the few times I have myself merited scans or x-rays, mysteries revealed in dramatic, if ghostly, black and white. \n \nBut it's the time I dread; the time, the time, the time I do not have.  \n \nAnd so Ethan skips and darts around me walking down the street, as much crazed mosquito as boy, as I protectively cradle my elbow and brood. \n \n\"Look at all the people out in the evening!\" Ethan proclaims with wonderment, and I dive again into pointless regret that we are not living anything like the life I had imagined, filled with evening family strolls and nighttime explorations of the city. \n \nJacob does not like to leave home all that much, and to be out with Jacob and Ethan together is most often a form of torture. I must steel myself for it. I must have some wealth of resilience in my bones, some stored reserve of calm and good mothering at the ready. There are days when I can and days when I can't and today was decidedly in the inconceivable column, my tanks in the red zone, surely running on fumes. \n \n <^>^<^>  \nMission accomplished, book in hand, Ethan and I pushed through the store's glass doors into a city become near night, the sky's blue glow nearly extinguished, the streets bathed in yellow-orange incandescence.\u00a0  \n \nTurning west to walk the two short blocks to Riverside and home, the brightest of stars appeared in the overhead sky. Not stars, planets: Venus and Jupiter blazing, blindingly bright in the deep cerulean sky that slices between the highrises, thankfully not obliterated. These two gods are in a much celebrated love fest this March, a conjunction the likes of which will not manifest again until next May. \n \nAnd yet, while they appear to be quite close, kissing distance on the Ides, they are in fact not truly crossing at all. It's just an artifact of our perspective, the way they look from here on our own dear mudball. \n \nThey are in fact deeply distant from each other, Venus lying sunward from us, drawing us in toward the heart of our solar system, while Jupiter circles round us from the outside. To gaze upon Jupiter is to reach out toward the distant galaxies and the universe's noisy edges at the jagged beginning of time. \n \nI do not like that my children are distant planets, each locked into their own distinct orbits, occasionally approaching but never truly crossing paths, both merely circling 'round me, their sun. \n \nHow I wish instead they were more like a double star system, like so many of the other twins we know: circling each other, at times closer, at times more distant but always in orbit, one about the other; connected, entwined, hurtling through space as one.  \n \nBut I must, as ever, resist the siren pull of the \"what ifs,\" of the dark matter that draws me to its crushing embrace. \n \nI must instead stay here, in the now, in the track of my actual sons. \n \nThe one who lives on planet Autism. \n \nAnd the one who does not.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

But this is NOT a birthday post for my Father, now dead these two years. And twelve days. \n \nHe would have been 95. \n \nI wrote a beautiful post for him last year. You can go read it, here -  Not his 94th Birthday . I told a funny story about how he got his name, James, which was NOT the name he was born with. \n \nIn fact looking back in my archives to find that one, I was surprised to see how many favorite posts I wrote last March. I remember it as being a bleak month and feeling the weight of the first anniversary of his death (and my recent operation) bearing down oh so heavily upon me. \n \nBut I suppose last year, of that pressure some diamonds were born. \n \nNot quite so much tihs year. I am hardly writing, here. The lumps of coal are not transforming.  \n \nThe NYC Listen to Your Mother show, which I am producing, has pretty much taken over my life. Which is a good thing, a marvelous counter to all my self-absorption. And it's a wonderful show, a fabulous enterprise with amazing partners (Amy, Holly, Betsy, Ann, Deb, our NYC cast, and the entire gang of production teams around the country - I LOVE you!) \n \nBut it is also requiring a lot of workaday writing. And I am not a fast writer. So it's nearly all going there, very little coming back here. Lots of pragmatics. Very little creating going on. Sigh. \n \nI am also hardly being a good enough mother, a good enough daughter. I spent the day locked in yet another homework meltdown with Ethan. We didn't go see my mother, who hopefully did NOT remember what day it was. (She didn;t bring it up when we spoke on the phone and so neither did I, figuring why remind her when all it would bring would be sorrow.) \n \nAnd I know a big chunk of my blue today is the date. Weighing upon me. A date I loved for 49 years: my beloved Father's birthday. \n \nOnce a day to celebrate. Now a date for grieving. For missing. For looking backwards. \n \n \nAnd I know I was lucky to have had him for so long. I have so many fatherless friends who lost theirs way too young, too soon, who never got to see them grow up or marry or have kids of their own. \n \nAnd I know that as far as fathers go he was pretty damn wonderful, and I was lucky there, too. He was certainly not perfect, I could easily list his flaws as a man and father. But he was always gentle, and I always, ALWAYS knew I was loved, valued, cherished... and that goes a long way. \n \nBut today I am not feeling lucky. Just sad.  \n \nI want my Dad back. (And while I really want the one from my childhood who would vanquish all monsters, today I'll even take the frail one I was basically parenting, from his final, fading years.) \n \nJust one more hug. (Not possible. Memory will have to suffice.) \n \nHappy Birthday, Daddy. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \u00a0  \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

And in spite of it being rather much of a  blind date for most, it couldn\u2019t possibly have gone better. \n \nExcept for the part about standing in front of the building, waiting  in the cold for the theater owner to realize it WAS Daylight Savings  Time and he had to be there to let us in\u00a0an hour earlier than he\u2019d  THOUGHT he had to. \n \nHowever, it seems that shivering together helped to  create an instant connection (the bonding powers of shared adversity?)  as when we repaired to a local coffee joint to wait in relative comfort,  a cohesive unit was already forming. \n \nAfter taking care of introductions and practical business at the  coffee shop, we were able to enter the theater and begin to read our  works aloud. And then, there was magic. \n \n \n \n \nEven though we were our own audience, reading just to each other, the power of our words shone through. \n \n \n \n \nWe were all different, our stories were all unique, our own. And yet  in the telling and the listening I could see, could feel the glistening  thread bonding and binding each to the other. The quilt of our show  was being stitched together, each story a square of specific beauty,  creating a wondrous whole that is much more than the sum of the parts. \n \n \n \n \nI\u2019m not going to tell you what our stories were. That\u2019s the wonderful  surprise, folks. You\u2019ll hear them on May 6th, if you can come in  person, or soon thereafter on the \u2018net. \n \nBut I can share this: we  laughed, we cried, we were moved in all the ways storytellers can move  us. And when it was over we left so impressed by the company we were  keeping, by the power of our words, and the brave people who are willing  to share them. \n \n \n \n \n \nI was beyond proud to be a member of this troupe, and I know for certain that everyone else in that room felt the same way. \n \n \n<^>^<^> \n \n \nAnd if you want to hear specifically how others felt about the first rehearsal? \nRead\u00a0our director Amy\u2019s blog post:  how do you stop the whole world? \nRead Kir\u2019s blog post:  Just Be Enough: The Circle \n \n(And yes, this is the SAME post here and on the LTYM-NYC site.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Dad & Me, Riverside Park, 1998  \n \nTwo years ago today, my father died. \n \nIt was not the least bit unexpected. \n \nHe was nearly 93 (less than 2 weeks shy of his birthday). \n \nHe was gaunt, frail, a shell of his former self. \n \nHe had been actively dying for three months. \n \nBut still, there was a shockwave. \n \nSuddenly a crack in the atmosphere of the world. \n \nA sharp dividing line, a before and after: \n \nThe world with my father in it on one side. \n \nOn the other, the world without. \n \nDiminished. \n \nThere was a howling Nor' Easter that day. \n \nSo unlike the near seventy degree early spring this March has brought us. \n \nMarch 2010 was cold and snowy. A bitter thing. \n \nGray outside to match my inner grisaille.  \n \nHe died as he lived. \n \nOn his own terms. \n \nSurrounded by people he loved. \n \nWith great drama just beforehand. \n \nAnd then, very quietly, neatly done.  \n \nHe just... stopped. \n \nMoments either before or after midnight. \n \nMarch 13th, 2010  \n \nI write this now at the juncture.

{"date": "Friday, March 23, 2012", "body": "\nThere's something new and different here today: I'm doing a review post, really my first. And, shockingly, it's NOT for The Hunger Games, which it seems everyone else is writing about today. It's about theater. I am never one to go along with the gang.  \n \nLast Thursday my friend Holly, along with her MamaDrama partner, Erin, brought some magic into my life in the form of an invitation to The Public Theater to see their latest offering, playing in their cabaret, Joe's Pub - the one man (plus band of 3) show: NO PLACE TO GO. \n \n \n \n \nTo call it brilliant and entertaining would be just to repeat the wonderful reviews it's been garnering in the press, including both a feature article and glowing review in the New York Times. Ethan Lipton, the playwright-singer-actor whose creation this show is (along with his collaborator, director Leigh Silverman) roundly deserves every accolade that is currently being heaped upon him. \n \nIf you live on a desert island, or anyplace other than NYC (= basically the same thing, right?) and haven't heard anything about this play, it's a semi-autobiographical work.  \n \nBased on Ethan Lipton's own experience, the show is about facing unemployment when the company he has worked at for ten years (on a part-time, perma-lancer basis) is relocating. We get to be inside Ethan's head as he revisits his history and feelings about this company and work in general, and as he contemplates his options and choices, and those of his co-workers, as the relocation proceeds. \n \nAnd because Ethan is a musician, as well as a writer and actor, the story is told in a mix of prose and song. So while it's a play with music, it's not a musical in the traditional sense of the word.  \n \nFor me the show struck home in so many ways, most especially as a blogger, because this play has so much in common with the best of blog writing: confessional, seeming raw truth, but in reality so carefully shaped, refined; and written by someone clearly in love with language. \n \nIt does what good blogs do: takes reality and makes it more real; in this case, making the truth even truthier by adding a bit of fiction - because in this story, the company is relocating not just to another part of the country, but to Mars. \n \nThis absurdist twist somehow makes Ethan's story more compelling. While keeping all the details, the ironies and petty indignities of his situation no less specific, real and relatable, it simultaneously elevates it to a plane of universality. \n \nThus it is no longer the story of his one man's job loss, but rather a tale invoking the tectonic shift of displacement we are all experiencing as the economic freefall in our current time requires us all to reconsider our lives and careers, to contemplate moves we might not have otherwise, ones that seem like, well, moving to Mars. \n \nI would love to give you many more specific details from this show, share some of the many gems found therein, but I really can't. \n \nI knew I was writing a review, knew I was supposed to be furiously scribbling notes during the show in order to jog my memory and write this review. But I just couldn't. I was transfixed, in the moment. I didn't want to take my eyes off his face, didn't want to remove myself from the experience, to take that step back you need to, to write notes for a measured review. I just wanted to go along with him on the ride. To be transported.  \n \nSo I jotted down just three measly phrases - 8 words, of the many astonishingly fresh, biting, funny, brilliant things Ethan said: \n Gooey malaise  - a turn of phrase he used to describe reactive depression, that struck me as perfect. \n Shitstorm coming  - the refrain from a darkly funny song. \n Words first, then meaning  - what could easily be the mantra of all those of us who are in love with language. \n \nThese will have to do.  \n \nAn old theater professor of mine, Richard Trousdell ,  one whose wisdom well I find myself going back to again and again, used to talk about how we go to the theater to recognize ourselves, to see ourselves in others' stories and be transformed by the experience somehow. Or at least that's what happens when theater works, when it gets it right and the magic happens. (This aspect of theater that is sometimes called catharsis, but to him was even more than that, deeper.) \n \nAnd this play? Yes. It gets it right. Very, very right. This is what storytelling does, when it does it best. \n \nAnd while this is possible, can and does occur in the best of movies, it is fundamentally different in theater because there is the added factor of actual presence, of live human beings in front of you, not distanced by the intermediary of cameras, screens, editing; not displaced in time and space. Someone may record this, turn this into a film, and it may well be brilliant. But it will never be the same as being in that room with Ethan Lipton, the man, feeling his emotions as they pour off of him, in the presence of his presence.  \n \nAnd Ethan's presence is powerful, is tremendous, precisely because he is merely life-size, not larger than life. He is an appealing everyman while remaining very, very specifically himself.  \n \nAnd what he is, mostly, is a wonderful storyteller.  \n \nSo if you live in or near New York City, run, don't walk to see this show. Magic like this doesn't come along very often, and it's only up for a limited run. \n \nAnd, for my readers, a little discount to the show:  \n \n \n Use code NOPLACE for $25 tickets! \n By Phone: 212-967-7555 \u00a0\u00a0 ONLINE:  click here \n \u00a0 IN PERSON: The Public Theater Box Office, 425 Lafayette St.  \n \nAnd if you can't come see it, here's a little glimpse at one song from the show,  3-Tier Plan , not live but a lovely little animation, nonetheless: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThank you, Holly and Erin of MamaDrama for this wonderful opportunity. \n Disclosure: I was provided complimentary tickets by  MamaDrama,  but all opinions are my own.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, March 9, 2012", "body": "\nI am so very, very happy to be incredibly busy this month. So busy in fact, that I don't have time to ponder and wallow. \n \nBecause March, the last two years running? \n \nHas nearly done me in. \n \nThis time last year, even though my body was officially \"healed\" from my first ever surgery (goodbye, gall bladder!) my spirit was still struggling. I was not yet nearly \"myself\" again. \n \nAnd suffusing that whole winter, laying over it entirely, were ghostly tendrils of the previous winter when my father had been busy dying, and I had been completely consumed by caring for him and supporting my now widowed mother. \n \nSo last March was the final crushing end of Year One Without a Father. That year of  sad first anniversaries,  of remembering and reliving so much awful. \n \nAs I was grinding through it, trying to keep my head above water, everyone told me I would be astonished at how much better it gets, with time; that  year two  would be nothing like  year one . \n \nAnd they were right. Thank all the powers that be, they were right. \n \nTwo years ago, today, was four days out from Dad's passing. I was witness to his emaciated, worn out body, fiercely clinging to the last shredded remnants of life. \n \nHis incredible strength that I had admired throughout his life now a liability, he was really ready to go, longing for release. But his stubborn, fighting, never-say-die spirit won out. Over and over. \n \nUntil it didn't. \n \nMarch to me is my parents'  anniversary on the 1st . My father's  death on the 13th . And my father's  birthday on the 25th . \n \nTwo years ago, he nearly made it to 93. This year, it would have been my parents 53rd anniversary. He would have been 95. \n \nAnd yet thoughts of him, of my Annus Horribilis, bubble up momentarily to the surface, then sink back below. \n \nI am busy. \n \nBusy with life.  \n \nRising with my children. The thousand tasks involved in their care and feeding and shepherding throughout the day. \n \nLaughing at their jokes. Supervising 4th grade homework. Cheering at their basketball games. \n \nBusy preparing for Jacob's annual IEP meeting, for which \"the letter\" came in the mail yesterday. Always giving the shortest notice legally allowed, it's in two weeks. Scramble. Scramble. \n \nBusy producing the New York City Listen to Your Mother Show. an amazing endeavor that is heating up white hot in my life, now that we are cast and less than two months out from showtime. (May 6th - mark your calendars!) \n \nBusy doing everything that needs to be done for my nearly 90 year-old mother. \n \nIt's good to be busy. I am grateful. I complain (it's my nature). But I'm not REALLY complaining, you know? \n \nTwo years ago, I was in the thick of death. There is such a surreal quality when I look back to that time, the awful and beautiful of it, all wrapped up together. \n \nAnd while \"beautiful\" seems a strange word to be found here, describing death; now, two years out, I can see that part, too.  \n \nIt was a gift to be able to be there with my father, and for my mother. To lie beside him and gently, so gently, stroke his back so he could continue to sleep, comforted by the last simple human connection of touch. \n \nAt the end, at the very, very, very end, there is no future. The past is a distantly receding dream. There is only the bright white light of NOW. And then it goes dark. \n \nSitting in my father's light, at the end of the end, was a gift, with its own beauty. And now, two years out, I am beginning to see that, beginning to treasure it. \n \nAnd so I run about these busy March days, grateful for the life that flows through them.\u00a0  \n \nStarting year three.  \n \nAnd waiting for April, and true spring to come. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I'm linking up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for...  because I so am. \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Just estimate however long you think something is going to take, and then double or triple it. And do that again. Now you're close.)  \n \nSo my blog, my writing? Suffering dearly. \n \nHalf written posts in my queue? Yup, dozens. \n \nAnything close to being able to be actually sent out into the world with the touch of a \"publish\" button? Hardly.  \n \nI have written wonderful, beautiful posts... entirely in my head in the shower.\u00a0 And then never gotten them to screen or paper. (Yes, I actually do sometimes write on physical paper and then transfer into digital words. Fancy that!) \n \nOne advantage of being out in the world interacting with adults: I shower daily once again (they can no longer smell me from Jersey). \n \nAnother advantage? Not only do I have no time and mental space to write, I also have no time to obsessively check my blog stats. I simply could not tell you how many people have visited my blog in the last day, or even week. And that? Is frankly a relief.  \n \nThat said, however, as much as I feel expanded by all this exciting producing stuff, I also feel diminished in that my writing is clogging up inside me once again, an expressive and creative logjam. \n \nI've had struggles with blogging before, had fallow times. But this time around, it's not so much about losing my writing mojo, as getting filled up by the words tumbling around inside me, the pressure building up with no release in sight. (And don't go where that image takes you, okay? Just. don't.) \n \nI am suddenly understanding my friends who regularly write compact, sweet, 300 word posts. It takes less time! \n \nSo, as I can see no relief coming in the near future, and I hate how s-l-o-w-l-y my archive is filling up (it's the 6th of the month and this is only my 3rd post - and it's not much of a post), I am just going to have to try harder to get something - anything- up here. And maybe write those short, pithy posts that have eluded me in the past. \n \nAnd since this has all been so much something about pretty much nothing; a self-referential rumination; a curved, tail-biting snake, circling itself round and round - I will leave you with a little actual something... the song that's been playing in my head these days, my personal soundtrack. \n \nAnd yes, I HAVE been feeling like a Muppet of a (wo)Man lately. \n \n \n \n \n \nSee you back here tomorrow folks, hopefully with a little something something. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, March 3, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Photo by Neil Kramer, my FAVORITE instagram photographer, by far \n \n \nWelcome to the SECOND edition of \"What I Loved on OTHER People's Blogs\" a regular monthly round-up of what has caught my eye (and  brain, and heart) on the internet. (Now that  my period  is no longer \"regular & monthly\" I figure SOMETHING in my life should be!) \n \n(OK, I'm 3 days late, but let's just pretend this was a NORMAL month with 31 days, okay? Because I really needed those extra days. Not fair February, not fair!)  \n \nAnd this month I am adding another feature, a favorite instagram photo from another photographer, too. Though I have to tell you, I am guessing they are ALL going to be by my friend Neil Kramer, who blogs at  Citizen of the Month. \n \nNeil is the most amazing photographer who doesn't believe he is a photographer, thinks he's just \"having fun\" with his photos. However, he has \"the eye\" - something that as the daughter of a celebrated photographer, I do NOT say lightly.  \n \nAnd now, a handful or so of wonderful posts from February, 2012, presented for your edification and enjoyment... And I tried to keep it light this month folks: sweet, uplifting, and/or funny posts. And I was mostly successful, see... \n \nAnd now, starting with a perfect post from the aforementioned Neil:  \n \n The Perfect Couple  from Neil of  Citizen of the Month \n \n That's What I Wanted  from  (The Empress) Alexandra of  Good Day Regular People  \n \n Somebody give the tooth fairy a double espresso. And some gratitude.  from Eden of  edenland \n \n YOU\u2019RE RUINING NATHAN FILLION FOR ME, NATHAN FILLION.  Alternate title:  But I forgive you.  from (the Bloggess) Jenny of  The Bloggess \n \n Some days it's not even worth trying to chew through the restraints  from Jillsmo of  Yeah. Good Times. \n \n The Transcendent Familiar 7: Choking on the Ashes  from Adrienne of  No Points For Style   (yeah, this is not one of the light ones, but so moving) \n \n Losing Sleep.  from Tulpen of  Bad Words \n \n There are places I remember  from Ellen of  Love That Max \n \nAnd ending with a second photo from Neil, because I couldn't decide which one I loved best: \n \n \n \n Photo by Neil Kramer. Salt shakers or Daleks - you decide. \n \n \nNote: Once again, this is an idiosyncratic, and very incomplete list.

{"date": "Thursday, March 1, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nNoticed it was a fairly quiet month on my blog this February? Yeah, me too. Sorry. I\u2019ve actually been very busy, just not HERE.  \n \nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time  THERE , working on the NYC Listen to Your Mother Show, gearing up for its first annual appearance this upcoming May. (The 6th at 2pm at the JCC. Go  HERE  for details. Tickets on sale soon \u2013 but not yet.) \n \nThis week? Three glorious, wonderful, exhausting, grueling, uplifting, wrenching days of auditions. Sitting in a little room with my wonderful partners - the director, Amy of  When Did I Get Like This  and associate producer Holly,  The Culture Mom  - being amazed and humbled by the outpouring of stories brought to us. \n \nAnd, of course, this being New York City where space is at a premium, we held our auditions in a big professional casting and rehearsal studio. Which was\u2026 interesting, as big Broadway shows were being cast and / or rehearsed all around us. Which meant that big Broadway voices were belting out showtunes accompanied by boisterous piano plating throughout the audition process.  \n \nYou\u2019d think a place like that would have better soundproofing wouldn\u2019t you? Well, think again.\u00a0 But we got really good at tuning out all the distractions and tuning in to our people. \n \nAnd I do think for some of the folks who were not performers (maybe especially those who had traveled in from distant \u2018burbs and beyond) it was a thrill to be waiting for their auditions in the same halls as professional actors and dancers with Broadway credits to their names. \n \nAnd now? Auditions are DONE!  \n \nAnd now, the very, very painful choices need to be made.\u00a0  \n \nWe saw over 50 writer/readers. (What were we thinking?!) Wonderful stories flooded our ears and eyes. Woman after woman - and two men - came in and laid their hearts and kishkas on the table (that\u2019s \u201cguts\u201d for you non-Yiddish speakers). \n \nWe could probably just drop all of the auditioners names in a hat and pull out a dozen or so and have a great show. But you know we\u2019re not going to do that, right? We\u2019re going to think and talk and agonize; and think and talk and agonize some more. \n \nAnd sweat blood, as we move names from yes to maybe and back again, our hearts breaking a little each time, as we sacrifice an individual piece we love in order to make the show stronger, as a whole.  \n \nCreating flow, creating a beautiful quilt in the pattern of motherhood, one lovely square at a time. (Full credit to Amy for this metaphor. It has been very useful as we work together to choose the big and little stories that we\u2019ll stitch together to create our show.) \n \nThank you so much to everyone who bravely came forth to share your stories with us. We appreciated each and every one of you. We loved hearing your stories. You truly were ALL stars. \n \nAnd if you were thinking about coming to audition and didn't; if you thought \"Why would anyone want to hear MY unimportant story?\" -- please think again. \n \nCome see our show on May 6th. If you live in another city or area of the country where there is a LTYM sister show, by all means go see that one! If you can't come in person, watch the videos when they come out shortly thereafter. \n \nAnd next year? \n \nGrab your story. \n \nThe one that scares you because it is so honest, because you are so \"out there\" when you tell it.\u00a0 The one about which you think \"Can I really say this?\" \n \nThe one that makes you laugh or cry, yourself, when you read it. \n \nBring it to us. \n \nStand up and read it out loud. \n \nWe're giving motherhood a microphone. \n \nThe good, the bad, the beautiful and the ugly. \n \nWe want your laughter and your tears. We want your unvarnished truth. \n \nYes, YOU. \n \nBring it on! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2012", "body": "\nOne short week of school vacation - time off the clock - and the days have gotten noticeably longer at the fringes. When I took Jacob down to wait for his bus this morning, we were watching the early-walking dogs and their people stroll by in daylight, not darkness.  \n \nThe yellow of the school bus rounding the corner popped against a truly blue sky. And my dour wintry spirits lifted, too, sniffing hopefully towards spring. \n \n \n* \n \nTonight, walking home from picking up Ethan at Hebrew School, for the first time in forever it was not completely pitch black night at 6 pm.\u00a0 Ethan and his friend, our next door neighbor whose mom I \u201cfoot-pool\u201d with, were busy talking their 9 year-old-boy-talk of video games interspersed with mock battles that threatened to engulf the sidewalk-sharing passersby. \n \nI just didn\u2019t have the energy to scold, hoped no bodily harm was being done, walked three paces ahead with Jacob on my arm, ever chivalrous. \n \nJake and I had one of our typical conversations the whole way home, he repeating the same three or four questions over and over, never ceasing in his delight at the correct-to-his-mind answers I doggedly offer back.\u00a0 \n \nAnd while the topics often skew to the obvious, they also occasionally delight and surprise.  \n \nJake was talking a lot about the earth and the sky tonight, impressed, as was I, by the moon playing peekaboo with us between the tall buildings. It was in between phases, not quite crescent yet shy of half full, and fuzzy about the edges, giving it a soft, somewhat unearthly glow, as if we'd slipped into a Maxfield Parrish painting.\u00a0  \n \n\"Where is the planet, Mom, where is the earth?\" Jake asked. And I assured him we were walking upon it, each and every time. \n \n\"When you were dead, before you were a baby, did you live in the sky, Mommy?\" \n \nOK, didn't expect THAT one. \n \nA complex and somewhat... unusual cosmological concept  going on here. A moment's reflection upon his current Japanimation obsession, though, solved the mystery of its origin.\u00a0 \n \nIn the DragonBall-Z-Kai universe, people are always dying and being brought back to life, and hanging out on a platform in the sky while waiting for that to happen.\u00a0 \n \nExplaining the improbability of all that to my autistic son was quite beyond my ken tonight, so I just waived my hand in the air and proclaimed it to be a bunch of \"made-up TV story nonsense\" and not the stuff of real life. \n \nHe smiled indulgently, knowing how much more real his beloved Goku and Piccolo are than I will ever know, and, as we were on our block, no more streets to cross, ran the rest of the way home, West toward the fast-fading, last pink echo at the horizon. \n \nI trudged behind, watching the evening's first stars emerge, casting their fuzzy glow about the sky; setting down, one in front of the other, my feet upon this planet, following my boy home. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, February 26, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nI don't believe in magical thinking, really I don't.  \n \nWell... not much at any rate. \n \nBut, sometimes? \n \nI do believe in fairies, I do, I do, I do. \n \nBlog fairies, as it were. \n \nAnd the gods of Autism, who are sometimes merciful. \n \nMy last post,  When Autistic kids get bored... , was about Jacob, and how I had resigned myself to patience about his morning waking habits; about how after nine long years he STILL waits for us to come to him. \n \nAnd then? \n \nThe day after I posted it, I woke up to Ethan at my bedside, telling me he was going to be up for the day now. When I asked if Jacob was awake too, he said he didn't know. \n \nI asked him to go check, and he shouted back from their bedroom (right around the corner from ours, it's a small apartment) \"Yes, he's awake!\" \n \n\"Well, tell him to get out of bed and come see us.\" I suggested, hopefully, for probably about the 100th time, knowing it was fruitless, that I would need to abandon my cozy warm bed and go retrieve him shortly. \n \nBut, wait... what was that I heard? \n \nThe sounds of a 100 pound nine year-old climbing down his bunk-bed ladder? \n \nYES! \n \n\"I'm coming to YOU!\" Jakey announced, very proudly, as he bounded into my room. I gave him a hug and kiss, directed him to take care of morning bathroom business, told him I'd meet him in the living room in 15 minutes. \n \nAnd the next morning? \n \nHe got out of bed BY HIMSELF while Ethan was still sleeping, and came to me. Still a little hesitant with the newness of it all, still unsure it was the right thing to do.\u00a0 \"I'm coming to you, Mommy?\" he asked, as he walked into the room.. \n \n\"Yes!\" I said. \"Oh, my big boy, I'm so proud of you for getting out of bed by yourself and coming to me without waking Ethan!\"  \n \nAnd then he climbed into our bed for a big happy cuddle, and then I took him out to the living room and we started our day. \n \nAnd, yes, it has happened every morning of vacation, ever since: Jake comes to us, Ethan gets to sleep in. Win! \n \nSo you see, it seems there's some magic to writing words like these in my blog:  \"I have found that change does happen eventually, if glacially. Though much fortitude and patience is required.\" \n \nBecause then? It comes suddenly and immediately. \n \nAnd the reason I believe it's more than just a fluke? This isn't the first time that this has happened. \n \nTwo summers ago, I wrote a post,  Cruel to be Kind , about trying to teach Jake to successfully buckle  himself  into the car during summer vacation. I thought vacation time, with no pressing schedule, was the perfect time for a full court press. \n \nIn that post I said this:  \"And even though he doesn't get it today, still looks at me like a  scolded puppy when I make him bumble through, I hope in the future he  will look back on these times and know that it was as painful for me as  for him.\" \n \nAnd then, the next day? I got to write THIS post,  No Sweat , about how he did it perfectly, all by himself, without prompting, the very next day! \n \nSee, Blogging magic! Write about how a process he's in the middle of learning is going to take forever? And Jake successfully masters the thing we've been working on for months or years... overnight. \n \nIt doesn't seem to work with Ethan, though. Because I have written that he will eat vegetables \"someday, in the distant future\" many a time. And he still treats all things green as if they were poison. \n \nDamn! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2012", "body": "\n... there will be blood. \n \nThis morning I woke up at 8 AM to a quiet house. Too quiet.  \n \nThough a school vacation day, and the kids had been up late the night before, Jacob is usually incapable of sleeping past a rather early point. 7:30 at the outside. \n \nIf I'm lucky, I hear him stirring and calling out to me softly, make it into the boys' room to hustle him out of his top bunk and into the living room before Ethan is disturbed. \n \nOtherwise? If I have been sleeping too deeply? I am awakened to the dulcet tones of Ethan stomping into my bedroom wailing \"Jakey woke me up TOO EARLYYYYYYYYY, he won't shut up!\" \n \nBut this morning? Nothing. \n \nWondering: could it, might it be? I tiptoed into the boys tiny bedroom, very quietly, just in case Jake was actually, truly still asleep. \n \nAnd was greeted by a very happy boy, extending his hand out to me with something carefully cupped in it. And a bloody grin. And whispering in a loud sotto voce: \n \n\"I lost my tooth, Mommy! The tooth fairy is coming. She will give me coins!\" \n \nBut lo, in his outstretched hand was not just one tooth, but two. I was very confused.  \n \n \n \n a nice pair of deciduous first molars \n \nJake had been mentioning a loose tooth for a little while now, as had the dentist at his last, fairly recent visit. But this usually translates into a very wiggly tooth with a lot of complaining a few months down the road, followed by it falling out within a few days. \n \nThis was rather unprecedented. \n \nWhen I'd last given what I thought was the tooth in question a good wiggle (never thinking it might be teeth - plural and bilateral!) it had seemed to be loosening a bit, but nowhere near ready to pop. \n \nBut enter a bored kid with an hour to kill quietly in his darkened bedroom and... instant self-dentistry. \n \nNow after I got him into the bathroom, took a good look at where the teeth came from (one from each side, definitely baby teeth, the upper first molars) and got the streaky blood cleaned off his lips, chin and hands, I rushed him into the living room, plopped him in front of the TV, and made a beeline to Mr. Google. \n \nTurns out he was right on time. I knew that after the first, central eight baby teeth come out around age 6-7, there was a bit of a latency period with no loss before the bigger, back baby teeth start to shed. And everywhere I looked that timetable said \"9 to 11\" for when the next tooth falls. And it is usually these first baby molars, before the canines. Whew! \n \nAnd examining the teeth, the treasures he had offered up to me with such pride, I saw they they indeed were just the tops of the teeth, the roots clearly eroded by Jake's permanent teeth pushing their way out through the jaw. \n \nTheir time may have come too soon, but only by a bit, their last toeholds in Jacob's jaw being no match for his strong, insistent fingers. \n \nOh, and in case you were wondering why Jacob had to lay, bored, in his bed for about an hour waiting for me to come to him, instead of just getting up and either starting his day or coming to ME?  \n \nAutism. A certain intractability and rigidity to lessons learned early in his life. \n \nWhen Jake was a toddler, and finally capable of getting out of his bed by himself? We told him to wait, and with a monitor on in the room, I always came to him the moment he called out to us, sometimes even before, as I was quite sensitive to the initial sounds of stirring. There was no reason for him to get out, when what he wanted (me!) would come to him. \n \nAnd for years, I was so glad Jake waited for us. I never had to worry about my autistic boy wandering around the apartment by himself with us asleep. Not that there was much trouble to be gotten into in our place, and Jacob has never (THANK GOD) been an escape artist or bolter. \n \nEven as Jake got a bit older, and I could choose to go back to bed once I'd gotten him set up with breakfast and TV/Computer/DS, steal an extra hour of sleep on the Sunday mornings when Jake arose at 6, it was comforting to know he was not attempting these things on his own. \n \nBut now, when Ethan would sleep until 10 AM if he could, when a monitor on in a 9 year-old boys room would be too intrusive, when it would make so much sense for Jake to quietly get himself out of bed and come into my room to get me? \n \nHe just won't do it. \n \nHe is too entrenched in his habits, his brain telling him: \"this is the way it is\" in spite of my having said to him EVERY Friday and Saturday night at bedtime, for A YEAR now: \"Jakey, when you wake up tomorrow morning, don't lie in bed and call to me, climb down and come GET me, it's OK!\" \n \nNope. \n \nOr rather: not yet. Because I have found that change does happen eventually, if glacially. Though much fortitude and patience is required. \n \nAnd someday (soon?) he will surprise me by appearing at my bedside of a Sunday morning at 7 AM, ready to start his day. \n \nHopefully without more teeth in hand. \n \n UPDATE: Looked in his mouth the next morning (upon his proud\u00a0 reminder announcement: \"Mom, I lost my teeth!\") to check how the gums were healing and saw the bright white point of a permanent tooth already poking through on one side - so they WERE ready to pop, indeed.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2012", "body": "\n\"I feel so empty\" Ethan wails, sobs racking his lithe body. \"I will never, EVER be happy again.\" \n \n \"Oh, babe, I know. Loss hurts. But there will be others, really, you have to believe that.\"  I try to soothe with my feeble, old, mom-wisdom. \n \n\"No, not like this one, it will never be the same, it was PERFECT. My first!\" Ethan is the picture of abject misery, poster child for a broken heart. So deeply teenagerish, how could he only be nine? \n \n \"I know honey, you are sad and disappointed. this hurts, this sucks.\"  I am doing this by the book: first the empathy and mirroring, then the (as yet futile) attempt to incite perspective.\u00a0  \n \n\"I hate her, I hate her, she was so wrong to do this, she needs to pay!\" \n \nI want to join him in his wrath, want to rain down fire upon the person responsible for my son's pain and loss, his inconsolable sadness. But I know it is my job to steer him clear of these dark waters, to be the cooler head at the table. \n \n \"Nothing lasts forever, honey.\" \n \n\"But this was my first, it was PERFECT.\" \n \n \"Yes, babe, it seems that way now, but you WILL be able to love another, I'm sure.\" \n \n\"Nooooooo! No basketball will ever be the same, that one was THE ONE!\"  \n \nYes. \n \nWe're talking about my son's first, dearly beloved full size basketball, a Wilson; the one he got this past spring, almost a year ago now, carried around with him nearly every day of his life, ever since. \n \nHis one true love. \n \nWhat, did you really think we were talking about a girl? \n \nPlease. He's only nine. \n \nAnd yet, the feelings, the words? A lost first love, for sure. \n \nStartling in their intensity, but then my son is, ever, intense.  \n \nAnd now, you may be wondering how did his life-love, his perfect first ball disappear? \u00a0  \n \nWhat happened was this: \n \nIn the schoolyard that morning, waiting for the teachers to emerge and ferry their charges to classrooms, A Rule was broken. While balls may be played with in the yard at pick-up time, morning line-up time needs to be more orderly, less chaotic, so balls must be stowed or held, quiescent in still hands. Otherwise, temporary confiscation is the penalty. \n \nBut 9 year-olds are 9 year-olds and the sight of an unoccupied ball drives them to frenzy. They often get played with. Even if Ethan is trying to be obedient, a friend of his will come up, knock the ball out of his hands, and start to toss it about. Cries of protest will go unheeded. Fun will ensue. \n \nBut, it must be said, regular reminder letters sent from the Assistant Principal to the contrary. enforcement of such rule is lax, haphazard and spotty. And in all the years of ball-carrying, Ethan had never suffered a confiscation until now. \n \nAnd thus he wasn't quite sure of the way of it: who actually held the ball, and how and when could he ask for it back. \n \nWhen I arrived that evening to pick Ethan up from afterschool (with Jacob in tow this day, of course, just to complicate matters), I found a wide eyed Ethan with trembling lip, telling me that no one could find his ball, nor had any idea where it was. \n \nSure I could quickly resolve this, we began to investigate. We chased a lot of wild geese, up and down the stairs of the school, Ethan growing ever and ever more despondent with each dead end.  \n \nFinally, we spoke to the principal, who was still in the main office, and she suggested it was best to throw in the towel for the night, resume investigations during school hours the next day, when the confiscating aide (the \"She\" of Ethan's vowed vengeance) would be present. \n \nBut then, on our way out the door, someone confided in us that it's not the first time a ball has gone missing and that we shouldn't get our hopes up, it was likely gone.  \n \nAnd thus started the full on breaking of Ethan's heart. \n \nAnd it did not help, in any way shape or form, that Jacob was with us that night, as Ethan howled out his pain on the sidewalk. Because Jake was being Jake: excited and engaged by Ethan's sadness and  upsetness, alternating between empathy and laughing delight. Both reactions exceedingly annoying to his brother. \n \nNot only was Jacob enjoying Ethan's big emotions, he was also narrating them. Loudly. \n \nNothing a nine year-old  boy wants to hear when he is trying to keep it together, in his autistic  brother's piercing voice: \"Ethan is CRYING, Mom! (big giggle) Ethan is SAD!\" \n \nAnd Jake's attempts at \"help\" even worse: \"Take a DEEP breath Ethan! Calm down, Ethan! It's OK Ethan!\" Yikes!  \n \nEventually, there was calmness. Bargains were made. In spite of the late hour and still as yet unfed children, we trudged to the nearby Models to see if we could purchase a replacement ball only to find nary a Wilson in a sea of Spaldings and Nikes. \n \nThen we found out that, well, yeah, Ethan's true love WAS a super special, only rarely available model, and it had been a special purchase at the time we'd gotten it. \n \nA different ball was finally deemed acceptable and purchased. Back home Ethan's equilibrium returned, with only occasional declarations of \"I still feel empty\" interspersed with evening business as usual. \n \nAnd it all blew over in a few days. (Especially as the original ball was eventually located at the school.) \n \nBut I have to say the reaction, the extreme over-reaction? Did give me pause. Not one to let things roll off his back, he feels deeply, this boy of mine. \n \nAnd I know this is just a slim preview of what is coming, the first actual girl to break his heart. The earth will quake, a lake of tears will be shed, I have not the slightest doubt. And I will be sorely pressed to control my urge to clock her one.  \n \nAnd then, this, really gave me pause: \n \nWhen I had tried to console him with the idea that it could be worse, that his ball could have rolled into the street and been squashed dead, absolutely gone forever? He countered that THAT would actually have been better, a clean break. \n \nAnd added that a big part of his pain was in the knowing that: \"My ball is out there, but someone else is playing with it. It still exists, my perfect ball, but NOT for me. Someone else gets its perfect bounce, gets to shoot hoops with it. I just HATE thinking of MY ball in someone else's hands.\" \n \nHmmm... just change \"it\" to \"her\" and... well, it gets kinds creepy. \n \nTime for a little talk about what makes healthy relationships. \n \nI want to make sure he really understands that the \"better dead than in someone else's hands\" concept is NOT okay when applied to human beings. Capiche?\u00a0  \n \nSo, on that romantic note: Happy Valentine's Day folks! \n \n(Yes, this is my Valentine's post. I know it's a day late. I have a bad cold & feel like crap. At least it's about love. Unlike last year, when I wrote  Not a Valentine's Day Post ) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, February 19, 2012", "body": "\nWell, anticipating belonging to my children completely, lock-stock-and-barrel style, for this next week of school break, with very little time for my own pursuits (such as reading and writing and thinking) I was sneaking a bit of blog surfing early this morning, as I had trouble getting back to sleep after being awakened by a child with a scary dream. \n \nHe's now happily snoozing again, and I have possession of the computer. Score. \n \nSo when I landed on the lovely Australian  Eden's blog  and found this week's theme to be something I could easily connect to, I figured: why not just join in, write a quick, fun post and link up?  \n \nThat way I might actually get something completed and OUT into the world, as opposed to creating another lovely, important, but perpetually half-written post clogging up my draft queue. OK, then... \n \n \n \n \n \nThis week Eden freaked out a bit about blogging, then reminded herself of how much she loved the other \"weirdo bloggers\" out there, like herself. (Her words, not mine, but I'll own it.) \n \nAnd then she asked us: \"Who's your favourites?\" (Like I said, she's Australian. They go for those British spellings. They also drive on the wrong side of the road, and call garbage \"rubbish\", too.) \n \nAnd, thankfully, when she did her post, Eden only picked and wrote about three. Because, really, my list is so long and it is my immediate instinct to try to include everybody and write the \"100 wonderful bloggers\" post, so nobody gets left out.  \n \nBut EDEN herself has set the precedent: I have to pick just three. (Because I always follow directions, and do as I'm told, you know. Snort!) \n \nEden, of course is right up there, but she didn't come on my radar until I met her at BlogHer11 this summer, reading her wonderful Voice of the Year keynote post, and I want to go back further to my (increasingly graying) roots. \n \nSo here are three of my long-time \"always, must\" reads. The women who have gotten me through, on the days when I felt like I was a tribe of one, a singular weirdo, spinning alone in my crazy brain. Reading them made me glow, made me feel part of a shining troop: the order of delighted madwomen, using words to tether ourselves together... \n \n\n\n \n\n \n Alexandra of  Good Day,  Regular People  probably needs no introduction, but I'm giving her one anyway. She is one of the most beloved women in the blogosphere and it is easy to see why. Her writing is lovely and truthful, her spirit generous. And she is hysterically funny (but never mean spirited). Best of all, she was my roommate at BlogHer11 and it was the most magical match-up, ever. Also, she also gets the \"best commenter\" award. A comment from her on any post is a gift. I read it and my heart goes \"ping\" every. single. time. \n \n Deborah of  MaNNaHaTTaMaMMa  is someone maybe you haven't read yet? Start now. She is smart, funny, deliciously irreverent, a \"two boy\" mom like me, and a GREAT writer. I actually got to meet Deborah in person fairly early on, as we were both members of a wonderful New York City Moms Group blog together. We just really clicked. Instant friendship. That she now lives thousands of miles away, in Abu Dhabi, no less? Pains me. But the sting is lessened by being able to read her daily, even if I only get to see her briefly on visits home. \n \n Jean / Stimey of  Stimeyland  was one of the first Autism-Mom bloggers I connected with on the internet. She was a member of the D.C. sister site to the NYC Moms Group Blog I mentioned above. I loved the way she wrote about her family (3 boys!) and about autism, with love, humor and her super-smart brains. That Jean is also really quirky and has funny & strange obsessions she writes about, too (like her love of mice and all things rodent, for example) makes me love her all the more. She has a tremendous sense of humor about herself and her own imperfections; which makes her perfect in my eyes, of course. \n \nSo, to quote Eden again, \"I'll stop at three... but there's a gazillion more.\"\u00a0  \n \nTo read more about how I feel about this beautiful tribe of bloggers, read  this guest post  I wrote for the lovely Katie at Sluiter Nation. (See, I knew I'd find a way to sneak another wonderful weirdo blogger in here somehow.)\u00a0 \n \n(And  Kris  and  Adrienne , I have linked to you so many times and referred \nto you as my bloggy mentors so often in the past, I thought I'd give \nothers a moment in the spotlight today. You know how important you are \nto me.)\u00a0  \n \nThere you have it, quick and easy, a new post is up - and before the kids have awakened. \n \nHey, maybe I can even sneak in a shower, too. Here's to hoping that regular showering is among the few \"me\" pursuits I still get to indulge in this week. (And if you're a local friend here in NYC, I know YOU are, too.) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "body": "\nWell, it's not Sunday, but I'm feeling all stream-of-consciousness-y anyway; it's not Monday, but I am happily, simply being me; it's not Tuesday, but I want to just. write. \n \nSo I'm going to go for it. You'll bear with me, right? OK, then, spinning the brain cells and seeing where they land... \n \nWhat a week it has been. Not the week I planned to have, for sure. \n \nNobody plans on getting a letter sent home in their kid's school backpack telling them that a teacher's aide in the school has been arrested for abusing a child there last week. (No, NOT my son, thank goodness.) \n \nNobody plans on being sick as dog and dizzy as a dervish for three straight days running. \n \nNobody plans on spending most of their one non-ill day at a Social Security office, trying to straighten out their elderly mother's paperwork, only to find out that everything the people on the phone had told them they needed was wrong, and they have to go home and get a whole OTHER set of documents and come back to try again next week. \u00a0  \n \nBut, as we used to tell the kids, sometimes, you just get what you get, so why get upset? \n \nAnd hanging out in the Social Security office wasn't a total loss. We got to be entertained by a very cheesy video about filing for retirement, starring Patty Duke and George Takei. Don't believe me? Here's a bit of print support material: \n \n \n \n Boldly going out to pasture, and looking just so damn happy about it. \n \n \nAnd you know? Right now at this very moment (wait, hold your breath, it may not last long) I miraculously feel happier than I have felt in a long time. And for absolutely no justifiable reason. \n \nMaybe it's the lift that comes from finally feeling physically a bit better, near human-like, even, after days of dregs-living, ass-dragging, simian-reductive misery. One of those viruses that get into your middle ear and knock your gyroscope all wobbly, so any motion sets off the dizzies and horizontal is the only way to go. \n \nMaybe it was the lasting glow from attending Ethan's \"Colonial Stories\" class publishing party this morning. Ethan's essay on colonial entertainments was fun and lovely, and I learned what the Scrabble word \"Quoits\" means, again. The way too delicious homemade pumpkin bread may have helped, too. \n \nMaybe it was the wind scouring the sky clear of clouds so the golden light of day's end washed over the city, turning cold stone buildings into fiery fairy castles. \n \nThey say a strong wind will blow the aura right off your body, so maybe I was scrubbed clean too, maybe it blew the negativity clear off me along with the shredded plastic bags that danced before us as Jake and I walked along Riverside Drive, holding onto our hats. \n \n\"The wind! The wind, Mommy!\" he exclaimed, still, in his glorious innocence, excited and surprised by nature. \n \nMe? I'm excited and surprised by this serendipitous happiness; hoping to waft on these upward breezes, as long as they blow. \n \nLong may they blow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n I'm linking up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for...  because, well, I am feeling grateful. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

I've kind of gotten used to it. \n \nNevertheless, I started running a fantasy in my head of things I might have added to what my husband yelled out, just to taunt the lady - like: \"And one of them will be dating your perfect daughter some day!\"\u00a0 or, even darker: \"And just think, your daughter will be losing her virginity to one of them someday in the less-diastant-than-you-like-to-think future.\" \n \nYes, there are days I'm so glad to have just boys. \n \n \n \n Ethan & friend at Riverside Park cannonballs \n @@@@@@@ \u00a0  \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Thursday, February 9, 2012", "body": "\n10 years ago on this day, I was... 15 weeks pregnant with my babies. While other women might be just beginning to show at this point, I, carrying two, was quite past the \"Is she pregnant or has she just been drinking a lot of beer?\" look, and well into the strangers-rubbing-your-belly-without-asking phase of my pregnancy. \n \nI was recently back from my last ever Sundance film festival, where I had encountered the delightful cumulative effects of \"morning\" and altitude sickness and thus nearly  hurled on James Caan . But I had also had my pregnant belly rubbed for luck by charming actress  Julie Benz   (Darla of Buffy/Angel & Rita of Dexter) and yes, she asked first. \n \n10 years ago today, I hadn't had my amnio yet, so I was sitting on tenterhooks, not knowing the gender of the two babies I was busy gestating. Boys? Girls? One of each? Waiting, waiting, waiting to find out. \n \nI did know my life going to change, irrevocably and forever very shortly, and was working hard to study  up and prepare for it. (Ha!) \n \nOne thing I would have been right in the thick of was planning a \"minor\" apartment renovation, mostly centered on the kitchen & bathroom, trying to make our small space livable with babies. That \"3 week\" renovation turned into a 3 month job, and nearly left me bringing my babies home from the hospital without a working kitchen. \n \n10 years ago today, I was trying to work a little bit, but not too much, heeding the words of my very cautious, high-risk OB: \"This may be your ONE shot at parenthood, don't blow it! Stop working at 25 weeks. Rest for a minimum of 2 hours each day on your left side. Rest. Rest. Rest. And drink plenty of fluids.\" \n \nI never went to see my OB without having to wait at least an hour, maybe 2, occasionally even 3. She was always apologetic, but I was sanguine. My age, twin pregnancy and fertility status (these were IVF babies) we're what put me into her hands, while so many of her other patients had much more fragile, stressful, troubled pregnancies than I. \n \nShe would always say \"Sorry, but there was an emergency.\" And I would always answer \"That's OK, I'm just glad that *I* wasn't your emergency.\" And I always, genuinely, was.  \n \nBecause me? I was one of the lucky ones: Never put on bed rest. Only developed a host of uncomfortable side effects of pregnancy, none of the dangerous complications. Delivered a pair of healthy seven pound boys at 39 weeks. \n \n10 years ago, I was probably working on the plans for my father's 85th birthday party. My parents were still robustly enjoying an active retirement in Florida back then. \n \nFive years earlier, I had gone down to Sarasota for my Dad's blow-out 80th birthday bash.  But March 25th was into my no-fly zone, so my folks were coming up to my home, New York City, for this one and I wanted it to be wonderful. Memorable. \n \nAnd it was. I rented the Hungarian House social hall for a Sunday brunch. Surprise guests flew in. There was a jazz band. Lots of hugs and laughter. And lox and bagels galore. Perfect.  \n \n10 years ago today, I was almost halfway through my pregnancy, poised on the precipice of the biggest game-changing event of my life. Everyone always tells you: \"It will never be the same after you have kids.\" \n \nSome mean that in a kindly way, citing the love and joy that come with creating a family. Others are more cautionary, thinking of years of lost sleep, the further losses of freedom, self, center, intimacy that can happen. \n \nAnd like every blissfully ignorant pregnant woman I, would nod my head and say, \"Yes, I know, I know.\"\u00a0 Thinking my observations of my friends families and my mental projections of myself into motherhood had me well prepared. \n \nBut you know? (And if you are a parent you DO know, are smiling at my innocent folly.) I hadn't a fucking clue. \n \n10 years ago today, I knew next to nothing about autism or ADD or special needs parenting or neurobiology. When I looked at our families trees, I had no idea these apples would be falling from them. \n \nBut that's OK, because if I had known, I don't think I would have had the courage to have children. Blissful ignorance is necessary, if a pregnant lady is to stop worrying and get any sleep at all. \n \n10 years ago today, I probably fell asleep kicked back in the hideous blue rocker-recliner that I had sworn was ONLY in our house until the boys no longer needed to be rocked to sleep, but still squats in the living room to this day.  \n \nI dreamed of oceans often during my pregnancy, of waves and seashores and creatures of the deep, swimming and undulating beneath the sparkly blue surface. \n \n10 years ago today, I placed my hands on either side of my rounding belly and thought great things about the tiny twin beings, slowly becoming human inside of me.  \n \nTonight I kiss the sweet, damp, vanilla-shampoo scented heads of my nine year-old sons as I tuck them into their beds, and they drift off to sleep, dreaming their own dreams, and growing into lives of their own shaping. \n \n \n \n \n I'm linking up with Mama Kat who prompted us to start a post with the phrase \u201cTen years ago on this day, I was\u2026\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n I'm also linking up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for...  because I am so grateful for my wonderful boys. \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, February 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n photo by @Mammaloves aka  Amie Adams \n \n \n \n \nSunday evening, walking out the front doors of the Museum of Natural History as it closed down for the night and they shooed us out of the halls of planetary and earth sciences, as we tore ourselves away from the looming bones of ancient giant lizards, a big, beautiful, near-full moon held court in the deepening blue sky, a gleaming white marble suspended over Central Park. \n \nI stood at the top of the stairs, arrested by its majesty, and refused to walk down the steps until both my sons had stopped and paid homage to its luminous presence. \n \nAnd I thought of my amazing astrophysicist blog-friend, Susan, of how she has always encouraged us to share the night skies\u2019 magic with our children. And I thought again of HER courage, grace and luminosity as she was currently  facing the very endgame  of her long battle with metastatic  inflammatory breast cancer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Susan Niebur AKA @WhyMommy \n \n \n \nThen last night, with my children eagerly tucking into their supper, I stole a moment at the computer to try to write a post for my 2 year Blogaversary, but instead my eye was caught by something at the top of my sidebar blog-roll: a new post from Toddler Planet titled, simply \u201c Goodbye .\u201d \n \nA lead weight crashed into my heart. \u201cNooooooooo!\u201d I howled in my mind as I fearfully clicked over and saw that Susan was indeed gone.\u00a0 I burst into tears, had to calm frightened children and explain.  \n \nIn that post, her husband, Curt shared the devastating news with the same grace, love, honesty and generosity with which Susan had lived her life; faced her impending death. \n \nThe saying \"to know her is to love her\" is oft used. But I can think of no one that applies to more aptly than to Susan Niebur. \n \nSusan's battle with Inflammatory Breast Cancer, a little known form of the disease that presents without a lump and is often mistaken for mastitis, went on, with ups and downs, for 5 years.\u00a0 It was very public as she blogged, wrote, and spoke about it; worked with foundations and organizations to\u00a0 spread awareness and encourage research. \n \nShe created  Mothers with Cancer  to support other mothers with cancer, and also, very practically, she helped to get compression sleeves to women in need, who, like herself, had arm swelling problems since the removal of their vital lymph nodes.  \n \nSusan pushed and rallied herself, set aside self pity and made Every. Moment. Count. in a way I had no idea was possible outside fairy-tales. She was no saint, she was a feisty, full of life, flesh and blood woman. And while others would have been consumed by rage about dying young, her attitude was \"I don't have time for anger.\" \n \nShe endured the excruciating pain of her disease and its treatments with  something that was not stoicism, but rather a fully emotionally present acceptance. She willed  herself to push past the pain and exhaustion because every moment that could be  salvaged and spent with her children was a moment to be cherished.  \n \nShe loved her children fiercely, and tenderly. She had, in Curt, a partner who loved and supported her with amazing strength and resilience and patience and fortitude. She had an incredible support system of family and in-laws and friends upon friends who rallied around her. Team WhyMommy stepped in and stepped up. \n \nWhen it became clear that the battle was lost and nearly over, that it was just the end game to be played out, she faced that too with astounding grace and compassion. COMPASSION as she lay dying, I sincerely doubt I would or could be capable of that. And yet it was just who Susan was. \n \nShe was, quite honestly, one of the bravest and most admirable women I have ever had the fortune to know. \n \nAnd on top of everything else? Susan was an astrophysicist. She was a connector in a field where there is often isolation, awkwardness, the very nerdy field of Astronomy. But even more than that she was a champion of women in the planetary sciences, an encourager of girls to go into science, a wonderful role model. \n \nMost people don't know this about me, but I almost became an astronomer. I loved the courses I took in college, and my teachers there were very encouraging, told me I had \"the gift\" of understanding astrophysical models. I had loved the stars and astronomy as a child, dragging my mother through the halls of the Hayden Planetarium numerous times. sitting rapt and breathless, quivering with excitement during the planetarium star shows while my Mom took an expensive nap.\u00a0 But I ended up making other choices. One of the factors driving me from it was the isolation factor. \n \nSo Susan was living my discarded dream, joyfully, and I loved and admired her for this, too. \n \n \n \n I will think of Susan every time I look into the night sky, \n \nAnd I am mad, mad, mad that the demon cancer took her. Took her away from her husband and young sons. Too soon, my god, too soon.  \n \nWe had only met in person once, in the summer of 2010 at the BlogHer conference here in NYC.\u00a0 At the time I was a blogging newbie, 6 months in and still green behind the ears. Somehow I had a huge group of bloggy connections in the DC moms, and they had come up in en mass, in large part to support Susan who was a BlogHer Voice of the Year keynote speaker that year, as well as my friend Stimey who was on the amazing \"Blogging Autism\" panel. \n \n \n \n Susan in hotel room at BlogHer1o (photo via  TeachMama ) \n \nI was going out to an event with a member of the DC cadre and we'd had to pop up to her room for something. Susan was there, resting on the bed, slowly getting ready for the  evening. She sparkled. We hugged; very carefully, very gently. And there was more overflowing love in that hug than in any 10 full-on bear hugs I have had before or since. \n \n \n \n Susan BlogHer10 VOTY Keynote address (photo via  TeachMama ) \n \n \nI am eternally grateful we had that  moment. I ran into her again and again over the course of the next few  days, heard her amazing VOTY address. \n \nLast night I spent the hours after I'd put the boys to bed hunkered down by my computer, refreshing my twitter feed, tuned to the search word: WhyMommy. I read and read and read all the words that were flowing out into the cyberverse from the people whose lives  she had touched: from the dear friends in her \"real\" life in DC, to her  close blog friends she would meet up with at conferences, to the thousands who knew her only through reading her blog,  but never before commented or exchanged words. \n \nWe are a community of mourners. But also a  community whose lives are full of more light because she walked among us  and spread her light, inspired us in everything she did.\u00a0  \n \nPlease harken to the words of her husband, Curt in his farewell post: \n \n \"Please consider furthering Susan\u2019s legacy through a contribution to the  Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation .\u00a0 Or please choose to make a difference somewhere, anywhere, to anyone.\" \n \nAlso, hug your children tightly, play with them, listen to them with more patience tonight. And know that in doing so you are honoring Susan's legacy, too.  \n \nThe internet is now FULL of tributes to this amazing woman. Go, read them all, know more about her and how she touched each and every one of us to the core no matter how essentially or tangentially she was actually in our lives. \n \nTonight, the moon is full at 4:53 PM East Coast time, and I am sad that it shines down upon a world without Susan in it. \n \nI am not ready to say goodbye to her. None of us are. And yet here it is. Time.  \n \nI will always remember the love that radiated from her as we  hugged hello, and the light that shined from her eyes, always. The honesty and emotion that suffused her words, how she gave of herself fully, every day of her way-too-short life. \n \nSusan thought long and hard as she knew her days were coming to an end, and distilled her philosophy down to these words: \n \n \u201cAll that survives after our death are publications and people. So look \ncarefully after the words you write, the thoughts and publications you \ncreate, and how you love others. For these are the only things that will\n remain.\u201d   \n \nShe is  now up there in the firmament, among her beloved stars. And remembered  with love here on earth, by a multitude, forever. \n \nGoodbye, Susan, goodbye. \n \n \n \n Star trails above Australia (via time-lapse photography), in purple for Susan \n \n \n Photo credits: Spiral Galaxy by  Calar Alto Observatory  via  NASA , Star Trails by  Lincoln Harrison  via  Pinterest  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, February 5, 2012", "body": "\n \nYup, it's Sunday. Time to take a short tour of my brain. You're welcome. \n @@@@@@@ \u00a0  If you're in the United States of America and not in a coma, you probably realize today was Superbowl Sunday. I live in New York. Our team was in the damn thing (yeah, they won - whoot!) and yet most of the day I kept forgetting. Because this is New York City and full of artsy-fartsy people and folk who hail from distant lands and all sorts of others that couldn't care less about the whole football thing. (Also sports bars and Times Square full of rabid crazed fans. We co-exist.) \nI spent much of the afternoon and evening with my dear Australian friend and her kids. Her son is quite enamored of the British sport that THEY call football & we call soccer. Ethan had wanted to watch the game, not because he cares all that much about the sport but because \"all the kids are going to be talking about it at school tomorrow.\"\u00a0 \n But you know? In that case, he shouldn't have been so obnoxious today and especially not made fun of his brother and the way he cries. Because that? Got him banned from screens for the rest of the day by about noon. (By bedtime that loss-of-screens-privilege had been extended through Tuesday. Yeah, it was one of THOSE Sundays.) \n But moments after I declared \"That was really unacceptable behavior! You just lost screens for the rest of the day, sir\" I wanted to kick myself. Because I had forgotten about the damn Superbowl. I wanted to watch. Not the whole thing, but bits here and there, and certainly the halftime show and the 4th quarter.  \n And of course I had to be a \"good, consistent parent\" so couldn't backpedal on the ban. Damn!\u00a0 \n My husband is so not into sports (despite his childhood love of baseball and all things Yankee) was happily off to a work-related dinner tonight. And i am certainly not a big sports fan either. But the Superbowl is special. \nAnd I used to watch it all the time.\u00a0 \n With my Dad.\u00a0 \n Everything I know about sports is because of him. He was an artist and intellectual, but also a true sports fanatic, and of all the sports he loved, it was football he loved the most, and his New York teams: The Jets and The Giants. \n He raised me to know the difference between a halfback and a fullback, to quickly eyeball the yards left to a first down at the end of a play, to hold my breath waiting to see if both feet landed inbounds, inside that all-important white line when a catch was made at the field's edge. Like tonight. He would have loved to see that masterful catch.  \n I missed the game tonight. And then, hearing triumphant shouts and screams erupting from my neighbors' apartments all around, turning on the TV just as the confetti cannons were going off and everyone was streaming onto the field, I watched a bit of the postgame, saw the highlights replayed, the gatorade upended, the players stroking and kissing that football shaped trophy with all the reverence of my tribe during services, touching tallis fringe to the passing torah, and then to lips. \n I heard the gracious, wooden speeches with one ear, but my heart was tuned in to another voice. \n \n\"Daddy\" I said, quietly, to the empty room.\u00a0 \n\"Daddy, we won.\" And the cat in my lap, oblivious, kept purring as the tears slid down my face.\u00a0 \nI miss him now in a not-every-day way, the commonness of his absence settled in, these nearly two years passed since his passing.\u00a0 And that last winter, he had slipped so far from the earth by the time he finally departed, I couldn't even rouse him for a game, not even the Superbowl.  \n I remember so clearly the great Jets of my childhood, the name \"Joe Namath\" spoken by my Dad with reverence, watching that legendary game, the '69 Superbowl, with him on our old black and white TV. \nI wish you had been here with me tonight, Dad. And not the frail, faded old man of your final years (though I love, loved him none the less), but the passionate-about-art, full-of-life middle aged Dad of my childhood. Or the feisty 80 year-old in Sarasota, who was playing tennis and swimming and photographing and dancing with friends and enjoying the hell out of his retirement. \n We would have raised a glass of Shiraz together and toasted our Giants. And I probably would have let Ethan watch with us, ban be damned, because your joy at a game well played could not be missed. He should have seen that, shared that. \nI wish Ethan and Jake could have known you then, Dad, the full you. At six foot, a giant for your generation. A giant of a man in my heart, always.\u00a0  \n \n \n Dad in Florida, 1999 \n \n \n Dad & Me, 1969 \n \n @@@@@@@ OK, sorry this wasn't quite a \"real\" SOC post. It started as one, but when I saw where it was going, I had to turn off the clock, let it spin out to its conclusion.\u00a0 \nAnd also? Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! We WON! OK, I'll stop gloating now.

{"date": "Monday, January 30, 2012", "body": "\nNope, that's not a typo. I really meant composting, not composing. \n \nYes, in New York City... Manhattan, even! \n \nAnd no, we don't have a townhouse or ground floor apartment, no backyard or roof deck or access to any outdoor space that is not public property.\u00a0 And while we jokingly call Riverside Park \"our backyard\" I don't think the parks department people would take kindly to our appropriating a bit of it to create a family compost heap. \n \nI had not thought it possible. But then the wonderful folks at Mom Central Consulting contacted me to participate in the Glad / New York Compost Blog Tour and giveaway... \n \n \n \n \nAnd even though I already have so much (too much!) on my plate, I just couldn't say \"no.\" For, you see, even though I am a thoroughly urbanized city-gal now, at times in my (distant) youth, I have lived in the country and been elbow deep in the fragrant, fertile earth of a garden, and the compost that facilitates that. \n \nAlso for a number of years running my family has gone to visit my cousin Jessie and her family in Burlington Vermont in the summertime. And they? Have a wonderful, abundant organic vegetable garden, a BIG healthy compost pile, and... chickens! \n \nSo for a week every summer I am mindfully sorting every scrap of garbage we create into their respective chicken, compost, trash and recycle containers. And then when we come home to New York City it has felt so odd and so thoroughly WASTEFUL to be throwing out all that wonderful compost material and chicken food.  \n \nSo you can see how I jumped at the chance to do something about this in an easy and fun way, and in my very own (small galley) kitchen here in NYC. So this, my friends, is a double first - my first giveaway and  my first sponsored post!* (And you are here to witness it!) \n \nWhen the composting kit arrived and I unpacked it, I found: \n \n Glad Compostable Bags.\u00a0 \n An \"Easy Household Guide\" to composting by Nicky Scott, called, well \"COMPOSTING.\" \n An appropriately sized, lidded, dark green compost bucket, labelled an \"ODOUR FREE Compost  Caddy. \" And yes, it IS made in England, how could you tell? ;-) \n A sunflower growing kit (that I shall pass on to a Brooklyn friend with a back garden).  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe compost bucket settled very comfortably on my kitchen counter. Due  to an ingenious filter in the top of the lid and lined with a Glad  Compostable Bag, it indeed lived up to its \"ODOUR FREE\" claim, in spite  of the many apple peels and garlic pulps that have been dumped into it. \n \nAlso? As yet, no fruit flies (the bane of open compost buckets everywhere). \n \nIt was interesting to see how much fruit and vegetable scrap waste we generated in just a few days. Did I ever mention Ethan eats 2-3 apples a day and they must be sliced and peeled? \n \n \n \n \nWhen it became clear that the bag would quickly fill, I emailed Adam at  New York Compost  and arrangements were made for an easy right-to-my-door pick-up. And of course, the vehicle for this is human powered by  clean, green bicycle! \n \n \n \n \nI hand my tidy, unsmelly, tied-up bag of luscious, gooey compostable stuff over to Adam and away it goes to ferment away in a community compost site, ultimately to enrich the soil for some lucky gardeners. \n \nOK, I am feeling so environmentally virtuous and green now. I plan to keep doing this even after the official compost blog tour is over.  \n \nSo, if crazy stressed - SQUASHED - me can do this, then you certainly can, too! You in? Good! \n \nTo learn more about the Glad environmental programs, go to their site  Glad to Waste Less.  I did, and was pleasantly surprised to see all that this plastic-bag-selling company is doing to help people go green. Who knew? \n \nSomething else cool and green and philanthropic that Glad is doing is supporting youth sports  programs by  providing 10, $2,000 \"One Bag\" grants (and counsel from sustainability  experts) to  help youth stadiums or sports leagues\u2019 waste diversion  efforts.  Entrants will be asked to share a brief description of their  need and  plan to take their high school stadium, community fields or  youth  sports league \u201cOne Bag.\u201d \n \nGrant submissions will be accepted at their   GladtoWasteLess.com   site and   the grant entry period runs from October  18,  2011 through February 29, 2012.  \n \nAlso, if you are my neighbor here in NYC and want to know more about the wonderful New York Compost folks, visit their website:  New York Compost! \u00a0  \n \nAnd here's a handy dandy little video of the venture, featuring the kind of cart that comes by to pick up our NYC compost.  \n \n. \n \n \n \n. \nAnd now, to give you a further nudge in the right direction (drumroll, please)....\u00a0  \n \n THE GIVEAWAY!  \n \nI have a Glad Composting Kit to send to one, randomly selected, lucky reader. It contains:  \n \n Your own handy green \"Odour Free\" composting bucket  \n A box of 20 Glad Compostable Bags for the bucket  \n A small, easy to read book on the ins & outs of composting  \n A sunflower growing kit \n \n How to Enter:  \nFirst off, I'm easy.  \n(And don't tell me you've already heard that from my husband.)  \n#1. Just leave a comment here. That's it, you're entered once. \n \nFor additional chances, you can do any or all of the following (each one gets you an additional entry):\u00a0  \n#2.

{"date": "Sunday, January 29, 2012", "body": "\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nSunday. Yawn. Sunday. Thank goodness for SOC Sunday because coherence and my brain are not converging tonight. And this? Gives my incoherent rambling legitimacy. Yay, me! \n \n\u00a0 \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n\u00a0 \n \nJanuary... 2012... so far? Not off to a brilliant start. Feeling, truthfully, like crap most days. Last week I said we were finally all feeling better. And yet it's not quite true.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nI am no longer officially ill, but have been left exhausted. Feeling bone tired. I feel so weary, like my mitochondria have just said \"Eh? I don't feel like pumping any energy into cells today.\" and gone off to do something else. Fishing? \n \n \n \nI literally cannot keep my eyes open, cannot drag my ass off the sofa to do much. I rally for an hour here, an hour there. The kids are fed and shuttled about. But the weekends are killing me because there is no school to keep them occupied so it's all on me & we are not going out to do anything more than the minimum and I hate being THAT mom, the lazy-ass mom. Which i have been nearly all month.  \n \n \n \nAnd there is SO much to do this month. LTYM-NYC is heating up. Summer needs to be planned - camps & the like. I have my first sponsored post & giveaway (almost like a \"real\" mommy-blogger!) going up tomorrow or the next day. And to do that one? I am composting, folks. Yes, right here in New York City. And no my kitchen doesn't smell like rotting produce, thank goodness. \n \n \n \nAnd amidst all the angst and feeling so low - How much is physical, how much is emotional/depression?\u00a0 DAMNED if i know! - I have to keep reminding myself to count my blessings. And there are some. \n \n \n \nJake is really growing and changing again this month. It was a rough start. The first 2 weeks of the new year held nearly nightly crying jag / meltdowns. But he is talking and interacting more than ever.\u00a0 He practices conversation with me, the cat and his stuffed bear. Hopefully soon there will be real friends. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nTonight when I sat with him in the bathroom while he took his bath, he wanted to talk and talk and talk. His usual topics: what did my ear look like, what are the shapes of my eyes and eyebrows and head. How he was once a baby and will grow to be a man, how his hair is yellow-blond but mine is red-brown.\u00a0 But still, there was more expansive language. The eye contact was full on and awesome. \n \n \n \nThe light in his eyes was fully on, his delight in talking with me, in the back and forth of our conversation was clearly evident, infectious.\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nIt is so easy to despair, to see how far he has to go. The progress is so glacial, so frustratingly\u00a0 incremental that i have to make myself stop and look at where he has come from... So far! I need to close my eyes and remember back to when I questioned if he would ever be able to carry on a conversation of any sort, when he seemed so lost in his own world.  \n \n \n \nAnd so when I am getting all judgey with myself, when i feel like I have just lost all my mojo, that I am merely getting through the days, I need to hold on to this: My kids are thriving. And maybe it's in spite of me right now, but still, I'll take what I can get.  \n \n \n \nReasonably happy kids = not sucktastic at all. And hopefully I can join them there soon. \n \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n \n \nSorry I'm still in the cave here, folks. Hopefully the grateful cancels out the whining. \n \u00a0  \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n\n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.  \n     No   proofreading or spell-checking.

{"date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "body": "\nI hate disappointing my kids. \n \nEthan is all aggression, calling me a liar when I have to backpedal on an agreement, undo a plan; telling me next time he's going to make me pinkie-swear and if I break THAT promise I then owe him a million trillion dollars. But it's Jake that breaks my heart again and again. \n \nI had promised we'd go to the movies together, just he and I, this past weekend. Two weeks ago we had finally seen the Muppet Movie, and I have been walking around singing the very catchy \"Am I a Man or Am I a Muppet?\" in my head ever since.  \n \nJake loves movies, lives for movies. But Ethan and I both had been laid low sick on Friday and were recovering slowly over the weekend. \n \nDan, as nearly always, worked all day Sunday, and I just didn't have it in me. Didn't have what it takes to hustle up a playdate to fob Ethan off on, to get out the door with Jake and Ethan, dropping Ethan off, head down to the movies with Jake then pick Ethan up afterward and hope the timing wasn't off, and oh my god, feed the kids, too and get them to bed early enough for school the next morning. \n \nBut Jake, being Jake, just didn't understand, even though I explained and explained and explained. Even though I let him watch hours and hours more TV on Sunday than usual, come 4, 5, 6 pm, come bedtime, he just kept asking \"Can we go to the movies, Mom? Are we going to the movies, now, Mom?\" in this small plaintive voice. \n \nHe didn't have to say \"But you'd PROMISED!\" the way his blatant, brazen brother would have. The movies are his magic and I had dangled it in front of him then snatched it away.\u00a0 And because it wasn't Ethan's own disappointment he was able to keep perspective. Too much in fact; was scornful of his brother in the guise of being helpful: \n \n\"Jacob, Mom is not feeling well, she can't take you to the movies, you'll go next week.\u00a0 So stop bugging her. It's just the movies, no big deal. Star Wars 3D doesn't even open for 2 more weeks, anyway.\" \n \nEthan was happy as a clam to lounge around all day in PJs with the resident screen police too tired for any real rule enforcement. \n \nBut Jacob? My sweet Jacob? \"Moovies Mommy, I want to go to the moooooovies.\" \n \n\"Next week, my love, next week, OK?\" \n \nPlease, gods of autism and head colds, don't let me break my promise. \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2012", "body": "\n \nY'all may recall my announcement this past fall, that I was going to be a key part of the team bringing LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER - the national series of live readings by local writers in celebration of Mother\u2019s Day - to New York City for the first local production here, right? OK, if your memory needs jogging, here it is:  Listen To Your Mother! \n \nWell, kids, things are now heating up big time... \n \nWe have  a date and a space  and  a charitable cause , and now we need a cast. So that means... AUDITIONS! ... and that means YOU! Yes, you! No, don't look over your shoulder, I'm not talking to them (well, I may be talking to them too, but that's not the point here!) I am talking to YOU, my friend... \n \nIf you are a writer, and you write about mothers (being one, having one, or any mom-role person who has been in your life) then come audition to be in the show. While many of us are also bloggers, you don't have to be one to participate (but if you are it's a great way to promote your blog!) \n \nHere's the skinny on auditions: \n \nThe show is on  Sunday, May 6, 2012 , at 2 in the afternoon, at the Goldman-Sonnenfeldt Family Auditorium at the JCC in Manhattan (on the Upper West Side). \n \nAuditions will be held on the following dates by appointment only: \n \n Sunday, February 26 th\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 11am - 2pm Monday, February 27 th\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6pm - 9pm Tuesday, February 28th\u00a0\u00a0 10am - 1pm  \nTo schedule an audition, email  listentoyourmothernyc@gmail.com . Please include your name and your availability during the time slots listed above. Auditions are being held at a convenient midtown Manhattan (west side) studio. The exact location and other details will be sent with your confirmed appointment time. \n \nChoose a piece you really love, and that takes about 3 to 5 minutes to read.\u00a0 While you don\u2019t have to be a mom (or even a woman) to participate, your  piece MUST be primarily about motherhood in some way, and the words must be your  own. \n \nI really want to hear your stories of MOTHERHOOD, the good, the bad and  the ugly; the funny and the sad; the profound and the profane. (Yes, you  can curse, this isn't a kid's show, it's for US!)  \n \nThat's it! Easy! (And if you want to see what sort of pieces have made it into the show before, you will want to watch  the past Listen To Your Mother shows.) \n \nThe time commitment if you are chosen for the show? Not that much: two rehearsals TBD in March/April, a pre-performance run-through at the JCC, and the 2 p.m. performance itself on May 6 th . Also, while it's not REQUIRED that you come out for a celebratory drink with us after the show, I'll be damn disappointed if you don't. \n \nAll that said, I am warning you in advance that there are going to be readers and works that I absolutely LOVE that will not make it into the show this year because: \n \na) it's not my decision, alone, to make; I am but one voice on a team, and \n \nb) we need balance, to represent a wide spectrum of mothering voices and experiences, and sometimes the specific wonderful has to be tossed to serve the show as a whole. \n \nPlease don't let the possibility of rejection hold you back from auditioning. At the very minimum you'll get 10 minutes of my undivided attention and a hug at the end (if you want one).\u00a0  \n \nAlso you should know that even *I* - the PRODUCER - am not guaranteed a spot on the final roster. Like everyone else (with the exception of our MC and Director, the amazing  Amy Wilson ), I am also going to be auditioning, and might not make the final cut.\u00a0  \n \n Finally, if you're feeling at all nervous or anxious about (gulp) standing up and reading your work in front of (horrors) live human beings? You should read a wonderfully encouraging essay by my friend Stacey Connor of the blog  Is There Any Mommy Out There? \u00a0 This year she's reprising her role as the Director/Producer of the Spokane, Washington LTYM show, and wrote this about the experience of being a writer, reading:  A word on stage fright and storytelling . \n \nAlso, if you want to read the more formal (more informative, much less chatty) version of the call to auditions, come to our local Listen To Your Mother - NYC Website, and read the official post, here: \n   NYC Listen to Your Mother show CALL for AUDITIONS! \n \nI can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to begin this audition process, to be sitting in front of you, meeting you, and hearing all your stories.

{"date": "Sunday, January 22, 2012", "body": "\nYup, Sunday again. Technically. It still feels like Saturday to me because I haven't gone to sleep yet. Or rather I should say \"haven't gone to bed yet.\" Because that hour spent semi-sitting up, slumped on the sofa with the TV playing to my closed eyelids was sleep. Sorta.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nWell, I am happy to report that rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated, and I am, in fact feeling much better. FINALLY. Feeling something like a human being again. SHOCKING. \n \nNot quite human enough, unfortunately, to take the kids sledding, in spite of the inches of snow today. Human enough, however, to have fun tossing snowballs with Ethan on the way to the corner diner where we met his best friend for lunch today,. We scraped fresh snow off the parked cars on the two blocks of our walk and packed it down as best we could. \n \nThe snowballs were fluffy, disintegrating as they flew. Which was fine by me as Ethan still has the tendency to make up for accuracy deficits by standing WAY too close when he lobs them. \n \nIt was lovely to get out of the house, to snarf down a quick lunch and steal a few minutes of uninterrupted grown-up conversation with my friend, the mother of Ethan;s friend. Sacrificing my iphone to the boys greasy food fingers was so worth it. \n \nAnd then, Saturday being Saturday, there was basketballl. This week was my turn with Jake, who did not want to leave the cozy confines of home/cat/TV, but I made come out anyway because the wide world must not be ignored. \n \nHe kept thinking that every snow-covered car we passed was OUR car, and it distressed him no end that we had not found our car yet, no matter how many times I explained to him that we were, in fact, parked one block away in the OPPOSITE direction of the school he plays basketball in, so would definitely NOT not be seeing our car on our walk there. \n \nBut Jake being Jake, he still had to ask about it. Every. parked. car. we. passed. And I also answered the question \"What color is our car, Mom?\" about 1,000 times on that 10 block walk, too. (It's still green.) \n \nI was worn out by the time we arrived. Getting Jake out of his snowboots and into his sneakers left me wanting to collapse in a puddle. And taking his mittens off reminded him how he had left his other pair at school and nearly set off another crying jag like the one he'd had upon arriving home on Friday. But only nearly. (Thank goodness.) \n \nBut still my heart swelled with pride as I heard the coach setting up Jake's new helper this week by telling him: \"You'll be paired up with Jacob today, he;s our best shooter.\" And even though Ethan's games are more exciting and coherent, actually recognizable as \"games,\" there is something so sweet about the special needs division; our kids trying so hard, their one-on-one helpers so kind. \n \nAnd then afterwards we met up on Broadway with Ethan and Daddy for a snack and slogging home through the snow together. And then, home, the boys even played together for a few minutes -- if you count sitting on each other with the sitee attempting to throw the sitter off to be playing. (And i do, i SO DO!) \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nOK, I cheated tonight! Clearly this was longer than 5 minutes - more like 10-15. But it felt to good to feel human enough to want to write, I just couldn't stop. I figure I will be forgiven. (Right, Fadra?) \n \nAnd now?

Greta of  Not Enough Patience and Never Enough Jewelry . \u00a0  \n \nShe said: So, your topic (should you choose to accept it) is:  \"I'll Never...\": The Top Ten Things You Said You Would NEVER Do And Have Caught Yourself Doing.  \n \nI don't know why she thinks parenthood would cause us to frequently eat our words. Oh, wait, I  so  do.\u00a0 So here it is: \n \n Ten Things I Said I Would NEVER Do (as a parent) And Have Caught Myself Doing: \n \n #1.\u00a0 Feed my kids junky \"kid food.\"  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! If you've been reading this blog for any length of time you will know that Ethan rarely eats anything but. He is going to turn INTO an organic hot dog someday, because he eats so many of them. And? He considers the color green in a food to be indicative of it being POISON. At least he eats. I've got a friend whose son hates just about everything, including pizza. \n \n #2.\u00a0 Make separate meals for everyone, be a short order cook in my own home.  I even once said \"I will make one family meal and if the kids don't like it they have a choice of a peanut butter sandwich as an alternative or nothing. And once they are old enough they can fix it themselves.\" \u00a0  Wow, was that a lifetime ago! I thought things would run so orderly in my house. That was before autism and special diets and THESE particular children landed in my home (and heart). Because letting your (nonexistent) children go hungry in theory? Not at all the same as watching your already too skinny actual child eat nothing and be fine with that.  \n \n #3.\u00a0 Lose my evening time to the kids, every night.\u00a0  I have a very organized, disciplined friend who had kids long before me. I thought she did a great job with them, and asked for lots of advice, thought I could just copy her parenting tricks and all would go as smoothly in my house. She had told me: \"9 PM is when kid-time is over in my house. They can stay up later if they want, but in their rooms and quietly. After 9 PM is grown-up time in the common spaces.\" What a lovely philosophy. And COMPLETELY impossible in our situation. The boys share a TINY room and Jake crashes at 7, while Ethan can not ever fall asleep before 10, often later. \n \n #4.\u00a0 Ask my kid the soul-killing question \"What is WRONG with you?\"  OK, I am REALLY not proud that I crossed this line once. It was Ethan (of course) getting on my very last nerve, doing something completely ridiculous over and over and ignoring my request to stop. Something I thought he REALLY knows better, and aught not to do at all. Before we had identified ADD and poor impulse control were just a part of his makeup. Sigh. \n \n #5.\u00a0 Let my body go to hell.  Yes, B.C. (before children) I had looked at a formerly skinny friend of mine who'd had a kid and thought: \"Geez, it's been 3 years, shouldn't that gut be gone by now?\" HA! It's been over  NINE  years now that I have been resembling a Weeble, with no end in sight. \n \n #6.\u00a0 Yell.\u00a0  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! (Wiping the tears from my eyes and picking myself up off the floor from laughing so hard.) \n \n #7.\u00a0 Let my kids watch too much TV.  This is a REALLY hard one. I HATE how much the TV is on, in our home. It goes against everything I believe in, how the kids should be doing REAL things, engaged in the world and with other people. However, with this particular set of kids? \"Engaged\" with each other? 99% of the time that means fighting. Yelling, screaming, hurting each other. It's the autism. And it sucks. But they will both sit peacefully together in the living room if the TV is on. And sometimes (OK, a lot of the time) I really, really need peaceful. \n \n #8.\u00a0 Completely lose touch with the culture that I love - movies, theater, art, music, avant-garde performance.  When I was a young woman in New York City's Off-Off Broadway, Performance Art, and Independent Cinema world, I had older friends with kids who brought them along to all sorts of unusual and avant-garde events and I thought: \"Yes, that's how I'm going to parent! No Disney dreck, \"kid-culture\" drivel for my offspring! I will open and expand their minds at a young age.\" HA HA HA! I wasn't counting on autism rendering one of my kids perpetually much less mature than his biological age. Nor his brother's insistence that all this culture stuff is BORING. Sigh. I haven't been to an art opening in 9 years.  \n \n #9.\u00a0 Tell my kid: \"I'm cold, you need to put on a sweater.\"  Yup. Well, I did expand on that and add: \"and it's really, really cold out and I know you don't feel cold yet, but you will soon, and I don't want you to catch a chill.\" And it WAS really, really cold out! But still...  \n \n #10.\u00a0 Spit on a napkin and wipe my kid's face with it.  Well, in my defense, his face was REALLY, really dirty! (Hangs head in shame.) \n \naaaand that's all folks! What's on YOUR list of backpedaling? \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Sunday, January 15, 2012", "body": "\nIt's been a long time since I have hooked up with Fadra's SOC Sunday meme. I head over to catch today's link and what do I find? A beautiful new logo! \n \n \n \n \nThank goodness for SOC Sunday. Because that's about I can manage today. And barely that. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nI feel hollow, scooped out; a brittle husk surrounding a great nothingness. And not the lovely nothing of Zen but the bleak nothing of having been shaved away until there is very little left, just a concave space surrounded by little curled up, crumbling bits of me. \n \nI have been AWOL from my blog for 3 days now, the longest gap in a long time. Three days ago I started a post called \"Another Day, Another (Autistic) Meltdown\" trying to find the gallows humor in what I've been going through this week. But it just didn't come. I couldn't laugh. And I was tired of crying. \n \nJake has not been a very tantrummy kid. Until now. He's going through something. God knows what. Hyper-emotional. Is it the ugly middle stage of some forward progress, or his medication in need of tweaking? How can I know - they often look the same from here. \n \nAll I know is that for the last week, nearly EVERY evening (and some daytimes too) there is about an hour of crying and screaming. Because I have done something HORRIBLE like turned off the TV. And yes that's only one hour out of twenty four, but what it does is suck the life and energy out of the other 23 for me. \n \nI;m really being unraveled by it. And i feel like a wimp, like a wussy because some families with autistic kids have been going thorough tihs for YEARS on end. And multiple hours / incidents per day, day in and day out. While I know (hope & pray, but mostly know because it has happened before) that this will pass here in our home, waiting it out is exhausting me. \n \nJacob WILL find his even keel, his usual sunny disposition will right himself once again. Because when he is not weeping he is still happy as a hundred proverbial clams, chatting away, demanding as usual I \"Look Mommy!\" at everything he is doing and listen to every thought that floats through his brain. \n \n\"Daddy is a man, Mommy\" \n \n \"Why yes, yes he is, Jacob.\" \n \n\"He was a baby!\" \n \n \"Yes, he was, Jacob. We were all babies once, that's how human beings - people - start out. Me, Daddy, you too. you and Ethan.\" \n \n\"I was a baby!\" \n \n \"Yes, Jacob, a beautiful baby. And now you're my wonderful, big boy.\" \n \n(SIGH) \n \nAnd so it goes. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nStill here? You've a brave soul.\u00a0 Thanks for making it through the cave with me. And there's a reward: Tomorrow's post is funny, funny I tell ya! \n \u00a0  \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nWell, it's Monday, so it must be time for  Stasha\u2019s  Monday Listicles again. And today's topic came from... ME!  \n \nAnd, it seems, I'm being late to my own party. (And not for the first time, I must admit.) You would think with my having known the topic for, oh, two weeks, I would have had this post written long ago and ready to pop up at one minute past midnight, be at the top of the link-up over at Stasha's. \n \nWell, think again. \n \nIt's been a rough beginning to the new year is all I can say. And my ADD is acting up something fierce. So anyway, it's still Monday here (barely) and will be for a few more hours in at least some parts of the world, so let's proceed shall we? \n \nToday's topic (as chosen by moi) is:  \n \n Top Ten Strange (odd/unusual/funny/interesting) Jobs you have held in your life. \n \n #1.\u00a0  Well, to start with, when I was a baby my father was an advertising photographer and sometimes he needed a baby for a shoot or for his portfolio. So, for a very short time, I was a baby model. He also was a fine art/documentary \"street photographer\" (with work in Life magazine, etc.) and took loads of pictures of me for that, too.\u00a0 Wanna see? \n \n \n   Jim Steinhardt:  \"Girl with Balloon (ME!) at Central Park Zoo\"  1963  \n \n #2.  Then my Dad realized he hated advertising and got out of that business, bought an art gallery and frame shop on Long Island and it grew into an international and American crafts gallery of some renown. And I grew up in the family business, spending Saturdays and many of my summer days at the gallery. \n \nI couldn't even tell you exactly when playing there became working there, but I distinctly remember setting up and helping to serve drinks at show openings from about the age of six on. And I know that from the time I was twelve I was selling in the store and working as a buyers assistant, accompanying my parents to big national craft fairs like Rhinebeck and the wholesale showrooms in the city. \n \nHoliday time was always busy, and as a teenager I worked full long days every Saturday in November and December, and then when the \"blue laws\" were repealed (yes, I'm old enough to have lived when NO businesses outside of restaurants were open on Sundays) Sundays in December, too. \n \nWhen I was 15, I ran the gift wrap \"department\" (me & a friend of mine) on the weekends for the holiday season. To this day I can eyeball any unusually sized or shaped object, instantly figure out what size box it will or won't fit in, and wrap it neatly with nice ribbon bows to boot. \n \nMy most memorable sales interaction with a customer? It was the day before Christmas, when the desperate men who hadn't a clue would arrive, and you could sell them practically anything. He was buying jewelry. Three nice pieces. One for his wife, and one each for his two \"girlfriends.\" He wanted to spend about the same for each. Wrote lovey notes on gift cards to be included inside the boxes. Had us put a little code on the bottom of the wrapped boxes so he could know which was which. \n \nHow much did we want to \"accidentally\" mess up the code for him? The whole staff was abuzz with wicked plans to do this while his gifts were being wrapped. In the end of course, we didn't. A customer is a customer, and he was a good spender. (Times 3!) But we talked about him for years to come.   \n \n #3.  Away at college, through friends I fell into a summer job as a founding member of the Sunflour Bakery Collective in Bar Harbor, Maine. Of course, first I had to learn how to bake bread, which I did in a hurry that spring.  \n \nThis was not a typical \"job.\" We all lived together, communally on the uppermost floor of the building which was not in any way set up or zoned for habitation, while the landlord conveniently looked the other way. We each made little nests for ourselves using odd materials found on the second floor of the building, in what had been a woodworking shop at one point. My \"chair\" was an ornate antique toilet stuffed with my sleeping bag to make a cushion. \n \nWe often took in like-minded (i.e. hippie) folks who were passing through town and let then \"camp out\" on the second floor and share meals with us for a few hours of work in the bakery.\u00a0 It was all very whole grain and natural (naturally), and actually quite delicious.  I think I ate better that summer that at any time in my life before or  since.  \n \n #4.  The following year, I spent my summer in Cambridge / Boston with a combination of 2 jobs to keep me afloat: showing up at 5 AM on the weekends to be the breakfast chef at the very vegan Golden Temple Emporium Cafe (yes, run by people with big white turbans on their heads). Can you say \"scrambled tofu\" anyone?  \n \nThat was combined with my weekday job of slinging the greasiest of burgers and fries (while wearing hot pants!) to a lunch crowd of finance guys at The Saint, which happened to also be the local lesbian bar at night, which I frequented... frequently. And the irony of all this was not lost on me, I laughed about it constantly. \n \n #5.  Then I landed in California for a few years. You may have heard me mention this one before, but yes, in 1981 I actually WAS a Bean Sprout farmer in the wilds of Mendocino county. \n \nWe were a womens collective on 160 acres on a ridge with a number of odd buildings on the flat land at the top, and among them 3 geodesic domes. One of these was given over to the business of hydroponically growing bean sprouts that were sold to restaurants and in health food stores in Northern California. \n \nMy tasks included washing the sprouts daily, cutting them when they were  the right length, bagging them, and assembling the \"mixed  sprout\" salads. Also driving up & down the coast for delivery. And yes, we had to remember to put shirts on when driving off the property. \n \nLooking back, I don't think we had a license and can't ever remember a health inspection. But those were different, looser, freer times. And I don't THINK we ever gave anyone salmonella poisoning. \n \n #6.  Also in California, now living more conventionally in Santa Cruz, I became the assistant manager of the Polar Bear ice cream shop in Capitola. And my right (scooping) arm became twice as strong as my left. I was living with a woman who had a 6 year old daughter who was THRILLED to be able to come in and order anything she wanted for free. \n \nAnd no, I wasn't stealing. The owners wisely gave us a monthly allotment of free ice cream, which kept us all honest about what we ate or took home or gave away. And made us very popular with our friends. \n \n #7.  Back on the East coast and back in college, I found occasional work as an artists model. Yes, nude. And people this is HARD work. Holding a pose that seems just dandy at 2 minutes will feel like torture by minute 10 with your muscles screaming for release. And, totally exposed, if you twitch, they will see. And yell at you to keep steady. \n \n #8.  My main job while in college was at the local pottery gallery (using my family business talents at last) but on the summers, to not lose me during them, the gallery owners - who were 3 potters themselves - had me come out to their studio to do odd jobs for the seven potters who worked there and shared kilns. \n \nI was not a potter, and it quickly became clear that my natural talents did not lie in this direction, but everyone found things for me to do to help out that did not require actual potting, including wedging clay (great anger release), packing orders for shipping (I still have nightmares about plastic peanuts), and, most terrifyingly, carrying precious fragile pieces to and from the gas kiln which was outdoors, out back, DOWN a little hill. No, I never dropped anything, but did have daily palpitations, thank you. \n \n #9.  1988. Out of school and back in New York City, while working my way into jobs in the film and television industry and also directing and stage managing plays and performance art off-off Broadway, I landed a regular gig with the brand spanking new World Financial Center as an assistant stage manager for their arts and events program, including a month of opening galas. \n \nAs I was a bit more mature and put together than a lot of the kids they had working for them, I was usually assigned to babysit the talent, including escorting them to the \"stage,\" which was always rigged in different places and often far, far from the holding areas. \n \nThis also meant that I would be seen in the \"front of the house\" and had to work evening events in formal wear and heels. On miles of marble floors. (Ouch!) Highlights included: a frantic search for one of the coconuts of Kid Creole & the Coconuts who had decided to go look for a friend in the audience, minutes before their call and watching Grace Jones go into makeup and be transformed into... Grace Jones. \n \nBest of all was escorting Cab Calloway up onto the stage itself because he was rather elderly and unsteady on his feet and the steps didn't have a handrail. \n \nThis was also the first time I was given a newfangled \"cell phone\" thingy - about 8 pounds of equipment with a handset connected to a rectangular box that hung from a shoulder strap - this was 1988, people! \n \n \n \n 1988 Cell Phone. Really. \n \n #10.  Fast forward many, many years (see the calendar pages whirl by) and come to my current occupation: Autism Mom. I am an amateur neurobiologist, behaviorist, teacher, translator, pharmacologist, allergist, gluten & casein-free chef, and deep hug giver. In my 9th year of an ongoing experiment in radical sleep deprivation. \n \nDefinitely the strangest \"job\" I have ever had. But the most fulfilling. Worth every minute of it.  \n \nAnd, believe it or not, (believe!) I could go on and on. But I'll stop here at ten.  \n \nSee y'all next week!  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, January 7, 2012", "body": "\nAs any of you who tapped into my Twitter stream last night would know, Jacob had a really rough time of it at bedtime (as did I). I am still trying to figure out exactly what happened, to fill in the gaps, figure out the whys and wherefores, but how it manifested was this: \n \nA one hour non-stop crying and screaming fest from 9 to 10 pm, followed by another hour of cycling through whimpering, tears, giggles, and more tears until about 11 when he finally fell asleep, exhausted. Poor guy. \n \nAnd Ethan, of course, could not go to bed until Jake went down. He lay on the sofa, escaped - as much as he could in our small apartment - into his book. \n \nJake does not melt down often, is generally pretty damn happy.

{"date": "Friday, January 6, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nEthan was talky, talky, talky tonight at bedtime. \n \nAgain. \n \nSigh. \n \nThe gems: \n \n E:  You know what, Mom? \n \n Me:  Ethan, it's very late, you're going to be tired and cranky in the morning. Go to sleep now.  \n \n E:  Know what I love the most? Life! Being alive! \n \n Me:  That's great! I'm glad you feel that way. \n \n E:  Know what the best thing in the world is?  \n \n Me:  Go to sleep, Ethan. \n \n E:  Getting to be alive. \n \n Me:  OK, Ethan that's a great feeling, now stop talking and go to sleep. \n \n E:  Want to hear a great tongue tickler word? \n \n Me:  No, I want... \n \n E:  Zucchini! Isn't that a great word? I love tongue ticklers. \n \n Me:  Ethan, talking is keeping you awake. Stop talking, lie still and you will fall asleep. \n \n E:  But what would happen if someone tried to REALLY tickle your tongue, like stick their hand in your mouth and... \n \n Me:  Tongues aren't actually ticklish, Ethan they're... STOP we are not having a discussion, you are going to sleep. \n \n E:  But what about... \n \n Me:  No but. Stop. Go to sleep. \n \n E:  So is Tigerclaw really all bad or is there still some good in him? \n \n(Yes, he's just started reading the  Warriors  series. Months of confusing, similar sounding cat-character names lie in my future.) \n \n Me:  You'll find out yourself, as you read. You're not roping me into book talk. Shhh. Sleep. \n \n E:  But do you think... \n \n Me:  Shhhhh.  \n \n E:  Mooooom, I was in the middle of saying something! \n \n Me:  Yes, and that's the problem. You cannot talk and sleep at the same time. \n \n E:  But I'm not sleepy, and I WANT to talk! \n \n(lightbulb going on over the mother's head) \n \n Me:  You miss Dad, don't you?\u00a0  \n \n E:  Yes, I do, I really do! (big sniffle) I just feel so sad that he's not here and it's going to be days and days before he comes back home. I wish we could just instantaneously transport ourselves to Seattle so he could kiss me goodnight. \n \n Me:  Me too, honey, me too. I keep thinking he's about to walk in the door at any minute, then I remember he's on a trip. We'll call him tomorrow, OK? \n \n E:  OK, Mom. \n \n(forehead kiss)  \n \n Me:  Sleep now, babe. \n \n E:  I love you, you're the best mom in the whole world. For me that is. I'm sure everyone else thinks their mom is the best, too. \n \n Me:  I love you, too, kid. Now, no more words, REALLY. Time. For.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 3, 2012", "body": "\nThe mornings are cruel again. 5:45 does not come easily to me. Especially after such a long spate of respite: ten whole days of late risings. No bus to be met, lunches made, homework double checked, backpacks packed, sleepy children to be cajoled and scolded into hurry, hurry, hurrying through pajama shedding, clothing donning, teeth brushing, and breakfast wolfing. \n \nI don't realize how much I adore our languidly paced mornings until they are gone, gone, gone. Children in pajamas until lunchtime or later (me too, some days, me too). Sigh.  \n \nBack in the grind now. 3 hours of my workday slogged through by 8:45. My workday which feels like 24 hours sometimes. The 24-7 that is parenting, even still when they are located elsewhere for 6 hours of that, because there is always the clean-up and the prep and the appointments to be made and the insurance companies to spend hours on the phone with because clearly my time could not possibly be valuable.  \n \nAnd then there are the phone calls to come pick them up from school because what was seemingly just cranky in the morning has turned into puking or fever by lunchtime. So all plans are scotched and I must be given over to being a lap, a pillow, the warm safe place my ill child needs to be curled up into. But thankfully not today. \n \nMy \"to do\" list would frighten even the most efficient and stalwart, and that is certainly not me, not even by a long shot. I can only pick and choose today, selecting the screamingly urgent and the seemingly doable to push up to the top, attempt to tackle. I promise myself to not start out the new year feeling failed, inadequate; to accept that I will only get do much done, that reading with my children is more important than a tidy house.  \n \nBut we must have food, my mother must have her medications, the mountain of clean laundry must get sorted, drawered and shelved before my children wail that they have no underpants to wear.  \n \nI blink and it's time to meet Jake's bus home. Don't ask how much of the list I've gotten to, I don't want to talk about it. \n \nToday, sitting on the sofa, munching his chips, Jake asked me \"What did you do today when you were waiting for me, Mommy?\" (meaning while he was at school). He's never asked anything at all like that and I was floored.  \n \nAnd even though he got bored with the answer before I was halfway through, still my heart sang with the question asked, with his knowing I am a separate person who does things he doesn't know about when I'm not with him, with his curiosity, his interest in the world outside himself. (Pffft to the notion of the autistic lacking a \"theory of mind.\")  \n \nIt aroused this thing called hope that flutters its butterfly wings in my chest sometimes. It comes when he asks to see my face when I'm looking elsewhere, when he springs to my side to share something he's happy about (usually a win on his DS game but I'm not going to be picky), when he showers kisses up and down my arm like Gomez to Morticia and says \"I love you Mommy\" out of the blue. \n \nI love you too, baby, I love you too.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, January 2, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nWell, it's time for  Stasha\u2019s  first Monday Listicles of the new year, which is reflected in the theme... Today's topic came from Theresa, the  Mountain Momma , who said we should write a list of ten New Years resolutions we will never keep. Softball, I tell ya; could do this one in my sleep (and I kind of did). \n \nYou can probably guess what these are all going to be. But I will go ahead and spell them out for you anyway. And in an annotated list, because simple & easy are just not in my vocabulary. And then at the end a wee surprise for you. So... \n \n 10 New Years Resolutions I Will NEVER Keep: \n \n1.  Stop Procrastinating.  Also probably nearly every other resolution on this list would be moot if I could keep to this one. Chance of that happening? The proverbial snowball in hell. I am ADD-rific, remember? \n \n2.  Exercise more.  Well, I better say exercise regularly. Because I am likely to exercise at least a tiny bit this year, and that would mean I would be keeping this resolution... since ANYTHING is more than the absolute nothing I did this past year. \n \n 3.  Stop eating sugar.  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! \n \n 4. Get to bed early & get enough sleep.  OK folks, I have two sons and one is a natural early-to-bed-early-riser, while the other is a classic night owl (like me & their father). The early riser catches a 6:40 school bus, which means I am up at 5:45 on school days, while the other one doesn't have to walk out the door until much later, can roll out of bed at 7:30, so often stays up until 10pm. Can you do math and see how impossible this resolution is? Yes, doomed before I even start. \n \n 5. Get off\u00a0 the computer when the kids are home.  I'm going to really TRY to keep this one. Because I really don't want my son to declare once again: \"Mom, you love the internet more than you love us!\" But? Realistically? Too addicted to my blog and FaceBook and Twitter and other people's blogs to keep it. I WILL cut down though, and only when they are on their screens, too. \n \n 6. Cook more.  I make this resolution every year and never keep it. The fact that there are so many limits to what Ethan WILL eat and to what Jacob CAN eat, and all of the above is mostly what Dan and I do not WANT to eat... means cooking = making 3 separate meals. Not happening. Someday... someday... but that day will not likely fall into this year. \n \n 7. No more dinners in front of the TV.  Sigh. I wish I could say this one was do-able. I grew up with lively dinner table discussions, truly enjoyable conversations with my parents, nearly every night.\u00a0 But the way Jacob's autism manifests is that if the TV isn't on? He will talk non-stop loudly about his own topics and ask the same questions over and over and over again, making dinner table conversation nearly impossible. So the TV goes on and the boys eat separately from my husband and I (who rarely eat together on weeknights anyway). \n \n 8. Keep the house clean and tidy.  HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!  \n \n 9. Keep my car clean and tidy.  See above.  \n \n 10. NOT pick up my iPhone when I am interacting with actual human beings, even when my \"new stuff\" alerts ding.  Wow, when did I become one of those rude people looking at the screen in my hand instead of the people at the table I am sitting and drinking coffee with? (Answer: when I got my first smart phone.) Will try hard to keep this partially, only picking it up for important DMs from people I am waiting to hear from. Wish me luck! \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nAnd now, here's the surprise: I get to be responsible for next week's Monday Listicles theme! \n \nAs I have lately been obsessed with plans for getting back into the working game this year and trying to figure out how I can morph all the skills I've acquired in all my old career(s) and jobs into something I can currently earn a living at, I have been thinking of all the many odd and various jobs I have held and skills I've amassed in my long life. And I thought it would be fun to make you all do that too. \n \nSo Next Monday's Listicle topic is: Top Ten Strange (odd/unusual/funny/interesting) Jobs you have held in your life. \n \nAnd if you are young or have had a much less varied life than I have and haven't had 10 jobs yet, then make it 10 interesting things you have done / tasks you have been responsible for as PART of a job.\u00a0 And I am totally willing to define \"Job\" loosely here... as in parenting is clearly a job, and so is being a student, or volunteer positions including things like PTA President. \n \nI can't wait to see what you come up with! See y'all next week!  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Saturday, December 31, 2011", "body": "\n \nWell, it's been some ride on the rollercoaster this year, folks, hasn't it? And today, on the final day of the old year, I'm going to do something new and different here on the old blog: \n \nBesides my Squashed Mom year in review post,   \"The Squashed Best of 2011\"  (which went up Thursday) all about where my blog has gone in 2011 (and, no, \"to Hell in a handbasket\" is NOT the right answer, here, folks) I also want to share some of the awesomeness I have found in OTHER people's blogs, on the interwebs, among my blogging friends and brethren. \n \nSo I have compiled for you a short, very unscientific, VERY incomplete list of a few of my faves and raves of 2011.\u00a0  \n \nAnd if you know I love you and you don't have a post on this list? Please know it's just an artifact of my tired, ADD-rific mommy brain. I'm probably slapping myself on the forehead right this instant, going: \"Doh! How could I have forgotten THAT amazing post by wonderful HER!\" - so please add a link to your one of your favorite 2011 posts in the comments section!  \n \nHere goes... \n \nIn no particular order, I have been moved to laughter. tears, astonishment, or action by these wonderful posts  (among many more) this past year:  \n \n Mothering, Disability and Race  from the lovely Elizabeth of  a moon, worn as if it had been a shell   \n \n In the Beginning   from my blog-heart-friend Adrienne of  No Points for Style \n \n the ghost of john wayne and the perils of eleven   from the adventurous Deborah of  MaNNaHaTTaMaMMa \n \n Invisible   from the delightful Momo of  Momo Fali. \n \n Adventures in Depression  from the wonderful and very brave Allie of  Hyperbole and a Half \n \n Who Are\u00a0You?   from the wise and deep Alysia of  Try Defying Gravity   \n \n I Dreamed You  from the amazing  Amanda of  Last Mom on Earth \n \n The Only Way To Make It Through This  from our dear Empress (Alexandra) of  Good Day Regular People \n \n Whispered fingertips  from Kris of  Pretty All True   who needs no qualifier, because she just IS all that. \n \n The Obsessive Joy of Autism  from Julia Bascom of   Just Stimming  and also  Quiet\u00a0Hands  because her words are THAT important. \n \n This Is Not Really About Cake  from the \"badass\" Kelly of  Mocha Momma \n \n Of Spiderman, a bully, and lessons learned  from the great-assed Cheryl of  Mommypants \n \n I keep thinking about the nurse.  from the kick-ass Eden of  Edenland \n \n Top Ten Things You Should (and Shouldn't) Say to The Parent of an Autistic Child  from the highly opinionated (and often hysterically funny)  Stark Raving Mad Mommy . \n \n On growing up with strange sensory reactions, and the difference between passing and being passed\u00a0off.  from outspoken Amanda of  Ballastexistenz \n \n I want my son back  from the inspiring Blue Sky of  Looking for Blue Sky \n \n worst case scenario  from the incomparable Maggie of  Flux Capacitor \n \n what i would tell\u00a0you  from the beloved Jess of   a diary of a mom \n \n Sunshine on the water is so lovely  from eloquent Emily of  Emily Rosenbaum \n \n in the midst of this  from the, well, extraordinary Heather of  The Extraordinary Ordinary \n \n The Bridge: One Terrible Night  from Anna See of  An Inch of Gray   who has gone where none of us wish to go, with more grace and fortitude than I can possibly imagine. \n \nI could go on and on and on, but 21 feels like a nice number, so I'll stop here. In hindsight, looking over it, I find this list was probably a bit heavy on the autism and special needs stuff. But then again, so is my life. So. is. my. life. \n \nWishing all of you a wonderful New Year, a terrific 2012, wherever the next turn of the great wheel takes you! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, January 4, 2012", "body": "\nActually, this would be more accurately: What WE did on OUR winter vacation.\u00a0 Because I was never alone, not even for 5 minutes... and as I'm the family photographer, there are never any pictures of ME... so herewith are some highlights: \n \nThe day after Christmas, we drove up to our in-laws' house in the Berkshires for a few days, where we go every summer and some winters, too. There was absolutely NO snow - except on the slopes where they make it, of course. \n \nThanks to Ethan's Aunt (my sister-in-law) we got some free package passes to Butternut that include EVERYTHING: equipment rental, day lift ticket and a group lesson.\u00a0 The helmet is extra, but I think my son's brains were worth $12 a day, so we sprang for that. \n \nIt was awesome, because Ethan really wanted to learn how to ski and neither Dan nor I do, ourselves.  \n \n \n \n Skiing! \n \n \n First day, Ethan was in a group of 1, so he got a free private lesson - WIN! \n \n \n By the 2nd day he was riding the lift \n \n \n Skiing! \n \n \n A friend of mine says, if you're not falling you're not learning. Ethan did a lot of learning. \n \n \n What Jake did while Ethan skied.  \n Tuesday the 27th was the last night of Hanukkah.\u00a0 We light the menorah for the last time this year.\u00a0 You can tell this is at my in-laws' house and not our apartment because it is so nice and new and clutter-free. \n \n \n Waiting for presents. \n \n \n All 8 candles \n \n \n \"... and while we are playing, the candles are burning low...\" \n And, as ever, the views from their windswept hill were stunning, especially at sunset. \n \n \n End of day sky in Great Barrington \n Back in the city, Ethan had a playdate and I had fun shooting the pretty, late afternoon, wintery, city skies with my new favorite toy: instagram. \n \n \n \nOn January 2nd, the last day of break, we took a jaunt with friends over to the Liberty Science Center, just across the Hudson river, in New Jersey. It's a great hands-on, interactive science museum, and while Jake and I have been there recently, it's been a while for Ethan. \n \nIt is so interesting to see how much more the kids are getting into the actual science learning of the exhibits, now that they are older; how they can read the displays themselves, follow the directions, really do investigating and exploring. \n \n \n \n Who doesn't love messages and hidden meanings? \n \n \n Ethan and a friend coloring pixels \n \n \n (doo doo deeeee doo) Science!  \n \n \n Spaceship or telecommunications teaching module? \n \n \n Jake LOVED to play with & manipulate his own image. \n \n \n Some of the signage in the communication exhibit made me sad. \n And then it was home, early to bed, school the next morning, How was your vacation?\u00a0 \n And, as usual, I\u2019m linking up to Wordless / Wordful Wednesdays... at  Angry Julie Monday ... at  5 Minutes for Mom ... at  live and love...out loud ... at  Dagmar*s momsense ... at  Parenting by Dummies . \u00a0  \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, December 29, 2011", "body": "\nIt's the end of the year, and, as I said in  last year's  \"Squashed Best\"  post \"a traditional time to both reflect back and look forward.\" I stand by that. \n \nAlthough I will say that looking backward is so much easier than looking forward. Especially when you're old, like me. (Now is when you're supposed to protest that I'm not that old, or at least that I don't LOOK it.) \n \nAs I'm now approaching my 2nd blogaversary, it is fun to be revisiting things I've done from last year, creating bloggy \"traditions,\" as it were. So obviously I had to do this, the SECOND annual Year in Blog wrap-up for The Squashed Bologna, 2011 edition. \n \nThis year there seem to be a gazillion people doing wrap-up linkys on their blogs, and I'm probably going to link this up with about half of them. So if you've come over from one and you're new here: Hello, nice to meet you! Pull up a chair and stay a while, have a nice meander through my blog. I'd love to offer you a cup of tea, but that would fry your motherboard. \n \nAnd if you're an old blog-friend (I mean long-time, I'm not calling you old, really) maybe you missed one of these. If not, go visit an old favorite, or just say \"Hi and Happy New Year.\" Whatever! \n \nSo, without further ado, some posts I'm fond of from 2011: \n \n January:   O is for Oxygen  {All about my sons' early language development, or lack thereof.}  \n \n February:  In my Grandmother's House \u00a0   {My first memoir post - and it's a doozy - about some strange goings-on at Grandma Dunia's.} \n \n March:  The Last Room  {Standing in the room my father spent the very end of his life in, remembering.} \n \n April:  B is for Best Friend  {About Jacob's lack of, and desire for a real friend, and one day in the playground when a kind boy played with him.}  \n \n May:\u00a0   Thoughts on my son's getting older and getting stranger\u00a0  {What it is: Jacob is still autistic.} \n \n June:  H is for Holding Hands  {A small, quiet, tender moment with my elderly, widowed mother.}  \n \n July:  Breakers  {At the beach with my sons, remembering summers past, reveling in the ocean.}  \n \n August:\u00a0 Missing my Father  {His absence as a presence in my life that comes and goes, sometimes more acutely than others.} \n \n September:  Choosing kindness  {Choosing kindness when it would be so easy to be harsh; both with my children and with myself.}  \n \n October:  Blink  {Watching a baby while sitting with my sons, remembering, and observing how quickly the time goes, trying to be mindful and appreciative.}  \n \n November:  What remains possible   {Another dispatch from the trenches of a hard day of special needs parenting.} \n \n December:\u00a0 Skipping  Maybe not my objective \"best\" but a fun and funny little post, because I am getting tired of the heavy, and I reveal my sci-fi geek self therein. Enjoy!} \n \n and on to 2012 we go.... \nSo, as to the \"looking forward\" part? I really have no idea what 2012 will bring. More challenges, for sure. But also, hopefully, opportunities. Growth and bounding forward for my sons. Maybe even a bit of maturity (for me, I mean; my sons will certainly be doing some maturing). \n \nI know one thing I am certain of in 2012 is that it will bring new connections and strengthen old. What I never imagined when I began this little blog nearly two years ago was how it would expand my life. I never foresaw the amazing community of (mostly women, mostly mom) bloggers that I would become a part of, and who would become such a vital part of my life in such a short expanse of time.  \n \nIf 2011 has taught me anything it's how vital community is, both local IRL, and virtual on the interwebs. And I am grateful, grateful, grateful for the overflowing support and friendship therein.  \n \nAnd so I wish you all the happiest of New Years, and a 2012 that is wonderful and bountiful, exceeding your wildest dreams. \n \n Linking this post up at:  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, December 26, 2011", "body": "\n \nWell, it's time for the last of  Stasha\u2019s  Monday Listicles for the year, so fittingly it's a year's end theme. Today's topic came from Bridget at  Twinisms:\u00a0   \n \nTop Ten things we've done for the FIRST time in 2011.  \n \nHmmm I'm pretty old so there's not a lot of \"firsts\" left for me, but I'm sure I can come up with something... or rather, 10 things, right? \n \n1. Well I started out the year with a first. In December 2010 my  gall bladder went rogue , so on January 5th, 2011  I had it removed . And that was the first non-pregnancy related surgery of my life; the first time I have been separated from any of the original parts my body came with. \n \n2. I had my first triple-month-skip: getting only one period from August through the year's end so I am clearly moving into the endgame of my shift from peri- into full blown menopause.  \n \n3. I began better living through chemistry and went on anti-depressant medication for the first time in my life to deal with the  on and off depression  brought about by wonky biochemistry from the above 2 items.  \n \n4. OK, I'm hating to sound like too much of a downer here, wracking brain to come up with a cheerful & happy first... how's this: Jake & Ethan both went to sleep-away camps (for the first time!) for about a week this summer, at partially overlapping times, so Dan & I had the apartment to ourselves for 4 whole nights for the first time since the boys were born. We're talking 9 years here people! We were spontaneously going out at night without the babysitter tax, we were sleeping naked, we were sleeping in, we were... well I'm not telling you about THAT.  \n \n5. Related to #4 above: I drove through  a hurricane  for the first time in my life. Well it wasn't quite a hurricane yet, but rather the leading edge of one, and believe me that was enough.  What happened was that Jake's camp in Massachusetts was directly in the projected path of Hurricane Irene. I had just picked up Ethan at his Pennsylvania camp & spent the night with friends there. So instead of bringing him home and having a night's rest before heading up to pick up Jake, Ethan & I drove through the outer bands of the storm to get him and then the 3 of us high-tailed it home like bats out of hell, racing the full-on storm, trying to make it into Manhattan before the bridges & tunnels got closed down (which never actually happened but there were rumors of its certainty). And that kind of excitement? Happy to have my first also be my last.  \n \n6. I finally started to write from memes and prompts and ended up going to surprising and wonderful places in my writing and blog.  \n \n7. As related to #6 above, I wrote  FICTION  for the first time in... oh, about 25 years. It came out of the blue as I was mulling over a prompt. And I really enjoyed having strange people talking away inside my head, even when they were yelling at me.  \n \n8. When I went out to San Diego for  BlogHer11 , I spent 4 nights away from my husband and kids for the first time since the twins were born. It was glorious. And may I confess? Until the last day... I barely missed them at all. Having 4 days in a row in which my time was all about ME was simply amazing after 9 years of full time, day-in & day-out care taking of young and old people.  \n \n9. Due to the lovely synergy between menopausal metabolism changes and stress eating (have I mentioned it's been a fairly shit year overall?) I topped 180 for the first time in my life, non-pregnant. Oops. Really need to do something about THAT in 2012. \n \n10. I wrote  my first \"Top Ten\" list post . Something I swore I'd never do.  And I liked it, I really liked it. Stasha, you've created a monster... I can't stop. Lists, lists, lists, I love lists now!!!  \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

The things he says out of the blue being startlingly observant and detailed, or his conversation loops are going deeper and deeper, continuing to make sense in wonderful and wondrous ways.  \n \nJake to our neighbor sitting in the lobby with her leashed dog the other day as I brought him inside from his school bus: \n \nJake: You have a dog! \n \nNeighbor: Yes I do! \n \nJake: Hi, doggie! What's your name?... (then, looking up at neighbor) What's his name? \n \nNeighbor: His name is Jack. \n \nJake: Hi, Jack, I'm Jake! \n \nNeighbor: He really likes kids. \n \nJake: (waving) Nice to meet you Jack! (then, to me, done here) Mommy can we go in and pet Cocoa? \n \nA very nice, little social exchange! \n \nAlso, yesterday morning, my husband stumbled into the kitchen bleary-eyed as Jake was getting ready for school. \n \nJake: Daddy what's wrong with your eyes? \n \nDan: Nothing Jake, I just woke up, I'm still sleepy. \n \nJake: Dad, open up your sleepy eyes! Bigger, like this! (gives demo of his ridiculously wide-eyed stare) \n \nAnd? Driving home from the  big family Hanukkah party  this past Sunday, we took a different route than usual into the city, as we were going to the East Side first, to drop off my mother. \n \nAs we pulled off the FDR into the city streets, Jake looked around and asked: \"Are we home?\" \n \nI explained we WERE in the city but a different neighborhood, on the Upper East Side dropping off Grandma and would then be driving crosstown to the Upper West Side (where we live) through Central Park. \n \nWe were moments out of the park when Jake spotted a familiar building, and complained \"That's not home, that's (name of our synagogue)!\" \n \nBoy does this all make me happy! Combined with his  insights the other day  (born, unfortunately, out of pain), combined with his  amazing artistic spirit  erupting, my son is really blossoming forth.  \n \nSo as we head into this longest night tonight, having passed through the shortest day of the year today, I tell myself: \n \nHave patience, have faith, it will be getting brighter; brighter and brighter, soon.

And if you don't know why I hate this, the \"R-word,\" you're probably at the wrong blog, here by accident. If you want a refresher, read my friend Ellen's posts all about it. Start with this one:  If you ask people not to use the word \"retard\"  then plug in the R-word into her search box and read everything that comes up. \u00a0  \n \n 3. What turns you on? \nIntelligence, humor, kindness.  \n \n 4. What turns you off?\u00a0 \nWillful ignorance and cold-heartedness. Also black socks and white sneakers  with Bermuda shorts. \n \n 5. What sound do you love? \nAn ocean beach. Also? Truthfully? My own voice. (Hangs head.) \n \n 6. What sound do you hate? \nMetal scraping on metal. If you use a metal fork to eat out of a metal bowl I will be forced to make you stop by any and all means necessary. It's like nails on a chalkboard to me. Also, not coincidentally, nails on a chalkboard. \n \n 7. What is your favorite curse word? \nReally, it's a toss up between motherfucker and bullshit. I guess I like compound words. Ethan is studying them in school right now. But never fear, I'm not going to suggest THESE for his \"Write 10 juicy sentences using compound words\" assignment. \n \n 8. What profession other than yours would you like to attempt?\u00a0 \nBrain surgeon. *Kidding!* But seriously, neuroscience interests me greatly, the biology of how we think and feel. I could have gone into medicine, have a great affinity for it. In other words, my mother was right - I shoulda been a doctor! \n \n 9. What profession would you not like to do? \nThe thought of accountancy fills me with dread. And I like numbers. I just hate paperwork. \n \n 10. If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates? \nA variation of what my husband quipped when first we met: \"Oh, sorry, I got you confused with (renowned French filmmaker) Agn\u00e8s Varda... Your number's not up yet, back you go!\" \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Monday, December 19, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nYesterday my husband's family gathered for their annual giant Hanukkah party extravaganza. On the car ride back from the latke and present fest, Ethan asked his Dad when it started and he calculated that it had been going on since about 1943 or so. Coming from a tiny family like I do, it's nice to be a part of a giant, sprawling, warm, inclusive clan. \n \nLeaving my first ever of these, when Dan and I had been dating for about six months and I was still his \"new girlfriend,\" I told him, \"I've never been hugged and kissed by so many people I just met in my life.\" \n \nIn my husband's family, if you love one of them, they love you. It's nice. Exhausting, but nice. (Not a year passes without at least one - and often more - Bar Mitzvah, wedding, landmark birthday or anniversary, and, unfortunately funeral or unveiling. Lots of opportunity for togetherness.) \n \nThis year the Sunday that is also Hanukkah just happens to fall on Christmas, and the one after that on New Year's Day, so the party was held a week early. \n \nWe brought my mother, of course, who, because of her poor short term memory recognizes nearly no one, but is happy to be out in the swirl of family, with her own grandsons and lots of random (to her) toddlers and babies to boot. \n \nJacob actually yelled \"Happy Hanukkah!\" to everyone this year instead of \"Merry Christmas!\" which he used to be wont to do, as there is so much more of that in the world around him to catch his echolalic attention.  \n \nEthan again asked to be the one to light our family menorah, and this year I finally said yes. \n \n \n \n Saying prayers \n \n \n \n Jake and my Mom watching \n \n \n \n Ethan, lighting the candles \n \n\"Real\" Hanukkah begins this Tuesday at sundown. But Sunday we got a little sneak preview; an all too rare family outing; a lot of hugs and kisses. A happy togetherness. \n \nWishing you all Happy Holidays and good times with your families (or without them if they're on the torturesome side)! \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

It's December 24th, and while some of you will be thinking \"Christmas, Eve, yo!\" over here it's the 5th night of Hanukkah, which I am sucking at this year. \n \nWe are not having a small group of friends over for latkes and menorah lighting tonight; not hosting the sweet little mostly-kids Hanukkah party as we have done for a number of years running. \n \nEthan is disappointed, and so am I. But I just... don't have it in me this year. I don't have the energy for the hustle and bustle it takes to pull that together, not even a haimish little party, like ours are. \n \nIf our apartment were bigger... if our apartment were tidier on a regular basis... if I had a sitter and more help... if Danny weren't so busy and otherwise occupied... if Jake didn't have autism... then, maybe. \n \nI guess though, this is one of those times I'm actually grateful for Jake's autism because he doesn't care, doesn't really have any expectations of a party.\u00a0 He's just glad he doesn't have to go to school today and can spend the day with his beloved cat and his video games. \n \nSo in order to do something holiday-ish at least here on my blog, I give you the following awesomely kick-ass Hanukkah song.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 14, 2011", "body": "\nThe boys are sleepy this morning, waving me off like an annoying gnat when I come to rouse them, Jacob quietly at six and Ethan more noisily at seven. In this, too, they are separate and unequal, and it saddens me, one more drop in the bucket of disconnection that sits on my chest, heavy. \n \nJacob is still growling at everything that displeases him and there is much that displeases him about mornings. I want him to get undressed and he wants to pet the cat. I want him to get dressed and he wants to pet the cat. I want him to eat breakfast and he wants to pet the cat. \n \nJake is mad about his underwear again, having outgrown the brand he has worn since he was four and toilet trained. \"I want puppies, I want basketballs, I want orange!\" he yells, hitting his body in protest as I pull the boring solid grey underpants up over his sizable hips. And so I make a mental note of something to add to today's already overflowing \"to do\" list: find boys size XXL or mens size small briefs in bright colors with fun pictures on them.  \n \nI wish we had the luxury of time in the mornings, to take a long snuggle on the sofa and pet the cat to Jake's hearts content. But he is up too early already. I can't set the clock back any further and his bus is now coming ten minutes sooner for no reason other than DOE regulations suddenly being enforced. \n \nSo the mornings are a non-stop nudge fest from me, nearly every interaction an iteration of \"Hurry, Jake\" or \"NOW, Jake!\" All the fun and sweetness poured out of it.  \n \nI resist the urge to growl at the bus myself, as I see it pulling round the corner, lights already flashing. A quick kiss on his cheek, with the matron impatiently waiting to whisk him away, must sustain me for the rest of the day. \n \nEntering the apartment again, divesting myself of the down coat thrown on over pajamas, I survey the kitchen carnage, prepare for round two. Another breakfast, another lunch, another tired boy to shake loose from his dreams. \n \n\"Hug me, Mama!\" Ethan demands as I lean over him pulling the warm blanket away, hoping the shock of cold will do what my hand lightly tousling his hair and my voice sing songing \"Wakey, wakey, school time, babe...\" could not. \n \nHe's in a good mood, dancing around the apartment peeling off his PJs, putting on his clothes. Which means, of course, that they are strewn throughout.  \n \nChecking his homework once more as I place it in the folder, put together his backpack (intone for the thousandth time that this really is HIS job) I notice a question skipped, so a pencil is hastily procured, math dipped into briefly and then his nose is back in his book. \n \nEthan is at the very, very, very end of the last book of the Harry Potter series and he just can't get done soon enough. Mysteries are being revealed; all those secrets he'd attempted to wheedle out of me for the past two months, and I'd blithely answered \"Read the books you'll find out at the end\" are finally within his grasp. \n \nWatching him read and eat, curled up in the armchair as I bustle about packing up his lunch, picking up Jake's pajamas, I am struck again by how much he looks like me at that same age. \n \nI take a mind's snapshot of him (\"Zen photos\" we used to call those in my family) knowing that soon he will lengthen, the angles of his face sharpen and a man will emerge from this boy-child. \n \nBut not quite yet. \n \nHe dons sneakers and jacket right on time, with nary a nag. Book stowed in backpack for reading at school, basketball retrieved and tucked under his arm, we set off. \n \nWalking together down our quiet morning street, he gleefully dribbles the ball a bit, showing off his latest moves; then stops, slips his hand into mine. \n \n\"You're the best mother, ever.\" I try not to beam too much. \"Well, for me that is. You wouldn't be a good mother for him.\" he adds, pointing to a dog being walked in our direction. \n \n\"And you're the son for me\" I tell him, \"You're the son for me.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, December 12, 2011", "body": "\nSaturdays, these days, my husband and I divide and conquer to bring the boys to their simultaneous basketball practices, and it was my turn for Jake. \n \nJacob truly loves basketball and the \"Challenger\" Special Needs division we finally found for him to play in last year, but was having a hard time sharing the ball after all those months of getting his own when we went to shoot baskets in the schoolyards. \n \nJake shoots wonderfully well, but the rules of the game, remembering to dribble, the need to pass, to pay attention to what other people on the court are doing... all these things continue to elude him. Autism, you know. \n \nJake kept chasing after the kids with the balls and yelling \"STOP! That's mine!\" Cringe. \n \nI try not to interfere, to intervene too much when we're at basketball, try to give him his independence, to not be \"that mom\" kid-coaching from the sidelines. Yet the actual coaches seemed too busy to deal with this really-not-OK behavior and I couldn't let him terrorize the other kids, who were mostly younger and / or smaller than my giant son. \n \nI kept popping out of my seat, running up to Jake to remind him that game is played with ONE ball and everybody shares it. Or yelling something to that effect when he was within earshot of my seat on the parent bench. \n \nA couple of times he came over to me looking sad, and I kept sending him back into the game after a quick hug or a deep drink of water, reminding him to stay with the other kids wearing red vests and to keep his eyes on the ball.  \n \nJake held it together during practice, drifting in and out of connection with the drills and game. But afterward as we were getting our coats on I saw the eyes blinking, the lip trembling, the sadness welling up; and on it came. \n \nSo I sat with my son, sobbing and wailing. I held my son, lost and losing it, his words coming out in a jumbled salad I could not make sense of. \n \nAnd then in the middle of it all, he looked me in the eyes and asked the most amazing thing: \n \n\"What's happening to my brain, Mom?\" \n \nWHAT? \n \nThis level of self-awareness, recognizing that something in his brain is going haywire? \n \nMonumental. \n \nUnprecedented. \n \nAn incredible thing that I feared I would never see. \n \nAnd then Jake was telling me that he was going to go home and cry at Cocoa the cat, and that then she would be mad at him, and he started to caterwaul anew. \n \nI was trying to piece it together, realizing he might be thinking I was mad at him for having had a hard time in the game, and maybe even mad at him for crying, now.  \n \nI kept telling him to look in my eyes and see that I wasn't mad, that no one was mad at him, that I was proud of him for how hard he had tried playing basketball today, that it's fine to cry if he's sad, but that maybe his brain was stuck, and if he wanted to stop crying I would help him. \n \n\"Remember to breathe Jacob; slow breaths; in, out; one, two.\" \n \nHe gained his composure, only to lose it again. Again and again. We were going to be late for the movies.  \n \nAnd then one of the coaches came over and praised his shooting abilities, promised he would get more ball time next week.  \n \nAnd maybe my murmured words of love, of soothing, had washed over him enough that they were sinking in. \n \nOr maybe his brain finally stopped misbehaving, let him move on \n \nBut suddenly it was OK again. \n \nMy boy smiled. Said: \"I want to eat popcorn at the movies, Mom.\" \n \nAnd so off we went. \n \nAnd loved the movie as Jake loves all movies, although this movie, Hugo, was particularly lovable. (Paris in the 30's, a history of cinema, what's not to love?) \n \nAnd when we stopped for a quick grocery shopping before coming home, Jake was remarkably present, helpful. He reminded me that we needed bananas, picked out a nice ripe-but-not-over-ripe bunch himself without any prompting at all. \n \nHungry for dinner, we hopped a cab home, and as we pulled up in front of our building he said: \"Thank you driver, for taking us home!\" to the cabbie, more polite by far than his twin ever is. \n \nAnd so deep into the evening I pondered my son and his question. \n \nA sign that more self-awareness will one day come. \n \nThat one day I may actually know my son Jacob's innermost thoughts, a cypher no longer. \n \nPatience is now needed. For this can not be pulled from him, but rather, I must wait for it to blossom. \n \nWait for his next step, in this dance that he alone knows. \n \nLet him be. \n \nEnough as he is, and embracing what he will become. \n \nEmbracing what will come. \n \n \n \n \n I am linking this post up to  Be Enough Me  Mondays at Just.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 6, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Driving in Italy, July 2000 \n \nIt was our honeymoon. In Italy. (The last time I used my passport, a long time ago.) My husband is a native of New York City, not naturally at home in cars, so I had been doing the driving around Northern Italy: to Lake Como, through Bassano del Grappa and the Valdobbiadene wine region, up to and back from Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo at the edge of the alps.  \n \nWe were on the last, short leg of the driving part of our trip, about to surrender our rental car to spend our final honeymoon days walking and being ferried about Venice in the vaporetto waterbuses.  \n \nMy husband had witnessed my driving for a week and declared himself ready to take the wheel, now that we were on the flat lands and relatively wide roads of the southern Veneto. \n \nWe were entering a traffic circle, or so my husband thought, and, as we had been specifically admonished at the car rental counter that in Italy traffic in a circle ALWAYS has the right of way over traffic entering, my husband was looking exclusively to the left, at the other traffic in the circle, and ahead to where we would be exiting.  \n \nHe did not look to the right, no need in a traffic circle. But, ah, we were not in a simple traffic circle, but rather a traffic circle BISECTED by a highway, which, naturally, had the right of way. \n \nSo my husband was not looking to the right, did not see the tiny \u201cyield\u201d sign, nor the semi bearing down upon us at full speed from that direction. It missed us. But the small car behind it did not. \n \nIt happened just like in the movies, the slowing down of time and our reflexes; the ear-shattering crunch, the bone rattling grind, the grand clashing and crashing of it all. Fortunately for us, the impact point was well behind the front seats we were sitting in, the empty rear of our car sustaining all the damage. \n \nWe pulled over, shaken but unharmed. There is a long story here of all that happened next, too long to tell in this flash moment, but I will say this:  \n \nEveryone was uniformly kind to us, from the young woman driving the (totaled) car that hit us, to the car\u2019s owner, her boyfriend\u2019s father who stayed with us to help translate to the Carabinieri. Well, It didn\u2019t hurt that I would waggle my finger back and forth between my husband and I and intone the one phrase I knew well in Italian \u201cLuna di Miele\u201d(honeymoon) as the Italians are quite a romantic people.  \n \nAnd also? In Italian, the term for car accident is  \u201cincidente d\u2019auto\u201d \u2013 \u201cincident\u201d in English, versus our \u201caccident\u201d conveying a vast difference in attitude. Accidents require responsible parties to be determined, blame to be laid, while incidents\u2026 just\u2026 happen. \n \nIn due course, the Carabinieri and tow truck from the rental company arrived. There was much standing around, and then retelling of the \u201cincidente.\u201d  By the time we arrived at our hotel in Venice we were bone weary and famished, but happy to be alive. \n \n \n \n In a vaporetto in Venice on the last day of our honeymoon, July 2000 \n \nMaybe the saddest part for me is that we lost a roll of pictures (yes, children, this was back in the old days of cameras running on film) as I had stashed our most recent shot roll in the glove compartment and forgotten to retrieve it in the aftermath, so a few days of our honeymoon disappeared from the photographic record forever. \n \nA small price to pay for escaping from the crash with life and limb intact, nothing lost but a few hours of our time, our insurance deductible, our dignity, and...  the notion of my husband ever driving in Europe again. \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  Write on Edge . T his  week's RemembeRED assignment was to write a post inspired by the word \"Crash.\" It was supposed to be a 10 minute flash writing exercise, but I must confess I bent the rules a bit.

Plus people are going to get swamped and miss their deadlines to get posts to me. I know that - can see it coming - and want to avoid all the stress that entails. So I'm giving it a break for a bit. \n \nSpecial Needs Sibling Saturdays will be back in early January (probably about the second week) and continue as a weekly series until I make a full year of it - through the month of March, that is. After that I'll re-evaluate to see if there's enough steam left to continue as is. \n \nThe series will never go away completely, this is too important a topic to me for that. Also there is much to the hosting that I enjoy, but it is also an (unpaid) weekly obligation that sometimes gets to me, so I'm not going to continue it indefinitely.\u00a0 At some point it will likely become a biweekly (fortnightly to my Anglo friends) or monthly feature, as seems fitting. \n \nSo while it's on break I will be contacting potential and confirmed guests and scheduling out the SNSS posts for the new year. If you think you've got one in you, and I haven't contacted you yet - or if I have made initial contact but haven't followed up (ADD brain strikes again, many apologies) - please let me know! You can leave a comment here, send me a tweet or an email. \n \nJust don't send your note by carrier pigeon or owl (yes, that's a geeky Harry Potter reference), as Cocoa the cat thinks they're delicious. \n \nAlso, if you have previously committed to write a SNSS post but have somehow not been able to come through yet (no name calling or finger pointing here, you folks KNOW who you are) this is the perfect time to cough one up and send it to me! All will be forgiven. The hounds will be called off. \n \n(Actually you are already forgiven, because you are a SN parent and how could I *not* understand how life gets, and bloggy obligations are just NOT at the top of the priority list.

{"date": "Monday, December 5, 2011", "body": "\nGalit, over at  These Little Waves  is running a linkup in conjunction with Alison at  Mama Wants This , called \u201cMemories Captured\u201d and I found out about it when I went to visit my friend Deborah over at  MaNNaHaTTaMaMMa.  Ain't the internet grand?  \n \nSo I thought I'd participate with this gem, a blast from the boys' past: \n \n \n \nPhoto: April 2004, Jacob & Ethan at 20 months. Not talking yet, so below is my interpretation of their expressions in this photo that PERFECTLY captures their personalities for the first two years or so of their lives.  \n \n Jacob:  \"Hey buddy, how-ah-ya? Nice ta meetcha!\" \n Ethan:  \"Who, may I ask, are YOU? Why have you presented yourself? And what can you do for me?\" \n \nAlso? The hand in the photo, holding Jacob's hand at the far left is my mother's. She was very much in their lives when they were little, the kind of Grandma who, in spite of being in her 80s with creaky arthritic knees never hesitated for a moment before getting down on the floor to play with them or going for a walk to the playground, like this day. \n \nI love looking at this photo as a reminder of that more innocent time before we knew about Jacob's autism, when we just thought the boys had speech delays. \n \nIn those early years, Jacob actually had the more outgoing personality. He was a giant flirt. Back in the day, we thought his lack of \"stranger fear\" - which Ethan had in spades - just meant Jake was uber-friendly. Little did we know it meant he wasn't processing that there might be anything to be afraid of, part of his autism constellation.  \n \nA short time after this photo, when Ethan had a language explosion and Jake didn't, their personalities switched and Ethan began to reach out much farther into the world than Jacob, who was getting more spacey and \"dreamy\" (as his rather stupid first speech therapist called him). \n \nEthan went on to make friends, many friends, while Jacob has really yet to make a one. So it's nice to look back on this time when Jake seemed to be so socially connected. When \"connected\" meant smiling and laughing and batting his long eyelashes at pretty girls. Because THAT? He is still good at, my beautiful boy. \n \n \n \n \n \n So, come join in and link up your own photo with  Alison  or  Galit. \n  \u00a0   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, December 3, 2011", "body": "\n \n My guest today, Frelle of the blog  Made More Beautiful  is a very, very special person. She has just come through a very hard time, including a separation from her husband and impending divorce.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n But in spite of the difficulties on this path through her life, Frelle is always reaching out to help others. She is a part of many online communities.\u00a0  \n \nI first \"met\" Frelle through some lovely supportive comments she left on my posts. I followed her home to her blog and discovered that not only was she a good online friend, she was also a wonderful writer, honest and deep.  \n \n Frelle is the mother of four children, the oldest of whom is a daughter with challenges that fall on the autism spectrum. Today she shares the  story of the strong relationship between her eldest daughter and her just younger sister, who is like an older sister now. \n \n Read her beautiful words, here: \n @@@@@@@ \n Amazing Sister to Grace  - by Frelle \n \nMy oldest daughter, Grace, is almost 12. \u00a0She was diagnosed with Aspergers about 3 years ago. She has three younger, neurotypical siblings. \u00a0Two sisters, Lily (9) and Felicity (6), and one brother, Jackson (4). I keep them anonymous on my blog as Oldest Sister, Middle Sister, Smallish Girl, and Little Fella. \n \nThe journey toward diagnosing Grace didn't start until she was about 5. I had no idea that Grace wasn't developing typically until Lily came along three years later and had excellent hand eye coordination and motor planning skills that her older sister had a lot of trouble with. \n \nBecause of the 3 year age difference, I decided to have Grace evaluated, and she scored a 36 month delay in both gross and fine motor skills, and was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder, Sensory Modulation Dysfunction, Auditory Processing Disorder, and Dyspraxia. \n \nAt age 6, she possessed the emotional maturity of a preschooler, and would often get overstimulated in public and have meltdowns. \u00a0The laying-in-the-aisle screaming and crying variety. Her siblings never made scenes like she did, and more than once I heard the words \"brat\" \"can't control her child\" and \"isn't she a little old to be throwing a toddler fit?\" By age 8 she had mostly grown out of public meltdowns, but Lily began to be embarrassed at  the loud wailing and yelling  her sister would do in the car or in front of Lily's friends.  \n \nI told Grace about her diagnosis at age 9. She had been having an incredibly rough day, and had been hitting the door in the van and crying and screaming all the way home. \u00a0She went to her room to calm down, and when we spoke later, she asked why she was so different from other people. So I told her I thought she inherited her blue eyes from her grandma, her freckles from me, and the way her brain works from her dad. A variation of normal.  \n \nLily is the sibling closest to Grace in age in our family. I told Lily about her sister's diagnosis when she was in second grade. \u00a0Grace was still having meltdowns often, but I never sent her to her room to get control of herself. \u00a0I knew she needed to be talked through the panic attack/meltdown. \u00a0On the other hand, when Lily was being loud and obnoxious and having a tantrum, I would send her to her room and expect her to pull herself together and come out when she could be nice to people.  \n \nShe thought this was really unfair, and confronted me about it one day after Grace had caused a particularly disastrous meltdown scene during her birthday party. I explained in very general terms that Grace can't talk herself down out of a fit very well, and that she could easily pull her own self together. I explained that Grace's food and clothing and loud noise sensitivities were all tied together, and that her brain thinks a different way than hers and mine do.  \n \nLily passed her sister in emotional maturity last year. I wasn't sure how Grace and Lily's relationship would change when Lily did this. I'm not sure either of them realize it happened, and there's no resentment from either of them toward the other. \n \nLily continues to relate to the world in a much more mature way than Grace. \u00a0She has taken on the role of the oldest probably because she sees that it needs to happen, as well as it just being because of her particular personality.  \n \nLily, at 9, is a very typical tween. She's very into popular music and tv shows, she loves to go shopping and is very into fashion, she enjoys going out for coffee with me, and helps her siblings with shoes, clothes, bathtime, getting snacks or sippy cups, and is attuned to needing to jump in and help when both of my hands are busy or I haven't noticed an issue in another room.  \n \nIn contrast, Grace has few tween characteristics, preferring to draw, read, play webkinz online or Barbies with her youngest sister, Felicity. Outside the house, Grace behaves much like a typical tween, and does well at blending in with other students. \n \nShe is protective of her diagnosis, but when she makes a new friend and learns she can trust them, or that they have a sibling with special needs, especially autism, she confides what makes her unique. She's never had it used against her, and she has a circle of close knit, very protective and mothering friends that she counts on to help keep her centered throughout her day.  \n \nShe has a difficult time not losing control at home these days, partially due to the necessity to act older than she feels and blend in and deal with sensory issues very quietly all day long, and partially because her father and I have separated and are divorcing.  \n \nFelicity and Jackson, Grace's youngest siblings, have never questioned why she acts differently. They have never spoken up accusing her of getting special treatment, or complained very much about how she throws fits more than all of the rest of them combined.  \n \nRecently, Grace was being cyberbullied by a girl at her middle school. This girl had started trouble between Grace and her friends in elementary school as well. I overheard Grace telling Lily what was going on and reading her the emails that the bully had sent.  \n \nLily listened patiently, told her she was sorry that the girl had said mean things to her and about her to her friends, and that it wasn't right. She gave her advice on how she would handle the situation. Then she said something I think a lot of older siblings tell younger siblings: \"I can pick on you, but NO ONE ELSE can!\" \n \nI appreciate that Lily doesn't make fun of Grace in a cruel way or use her diagnosis or hypersensitivity features to put her down. She seems attuned to that without ever having been told to avoid it. Lily also has a general appreciation for those with special needs and invisible disabilities because of the openness in conversation about them in my house.  \n \nGrace and Lily have recently started confiding in one another due to the separation and divorce their father and I are going through. I can't tell you how it warms my heart to see them develop a closer emotional bond. \n \nA few years ago I never would have believed they would make good friends, let alone feel any loyalty to one another. Being a special needs sibling can be challenging, but Lily has naturally and without instruction, become a wonderful \"big sister\" and I'm proud of the young woman she is becoming. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n I love everything about this post. And the supportive relationship between the sisters truly moves me to tears.\u00a0  \n \n Now that you have read Frelle here, please do follow her home to her blog   Made More Beautiful   and read her beautiful heartfelt words there, too. \n \n You may want to start here, with this post about  a big step Grace took one day , or this one, about   Rigid Thinking, Expectations, and Public Meltdowns,  or another post about  Grace's Meltdowns and Real Life Coping Skills. \n \n Do read this important post,   Happy Half Birthday, You Have Aspergers  about what it was like to talk to Grace about her diagnosis.\u00a0 \n \n And if you want to know more about Frelle herself and her difficulties, read this post where she talks about  striving to feel like she is enough .\u00a0  \n \n Finally,  go follow her on Twitter where she tweets as  @frelle. \n \n Thank you so much Frelle for sharing your lovely family with us here today. \u00a0   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nEthan, at bedtime this evening was not quite ready to let go of the day. He was in a talkative mood, rare recently as he has been reading until deep drowsiness sets in, sometimes even falling asleep on the sofa, a seven-hundred-plus page tome of Harry Potter's exploits resting spread open upon his slowly rising and falling chest. A comforting weight, perhaps.  \n \nBut tonight something had him stirred up, and thus my need to talk him back down. \n \n\"Mom, will you always love me?\" he asked. (Not a chit-chat night, then. Alright.) \n \nAlthough he has heard the answer a thousand times, he somehow needed to hear it anew tonight, for the thousand and first: \"Ethan, these two things are absolutely true: I will always be your Mom, and I will always love you.\" \n \n\"Well,\" he says being practical about it, \"we will love each other until whoever dies first.\" \n \n(Love AND death. Stirred up, indeed.) \n \n\"That had better be me!\" I tell him, \"But preferably not until I'm an old, old lady.\" \n \n\"A hundred and two?\" he suggests. \n \n\"Yes, that would do, nicely. And with plenty of grandchildren at my knee.\" (It's never too early to plant the seeds.) \n \nI tell him the old joke: \"Do you know how to live to be 102 years old? Get to 101, and then be very, VERY careful.\" \n \n(Possibly one of the best unforeseen benefits of having kids: old jokes are new to them and considered hilarious; I get to trot out all my favorite shopworn groaners to an appreciative audience. Win!) \n \nHe laughs, but then I round the corner back to serious again. \n \n\"And also... you  do  know, love goes on after death. I still love your Grandpa, my Dad, and he is dead.\" \n \n\"Yes,\" he nods solemnly, contemplating his blanket, and then looks up, breaks out in a big grin. \n \n\"But hugs don't, so hug me now, Mama!\" and he opens his arms wide. He opens his arms wide,  to me. \n \n \n In honor of today being the very last day of NaBloPoMo November, I decided to sift through my drafts,  resurrect  one more post from my  zombie files .  I had thought of this as a snippet, not quite a full post for wordy,  rambling me. But reading it over I realized: \"yes, it could be enough.\"\u00a0 \n \n And thus... it is done. 30 posts in 30 days. Goodnight!\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, November 29, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n\"I hope I'm not leaning on you too heavily.\" my mother said, taking my arm as we slowly made our way through the bustling streets of New York City. \n \nI had just brought my Mom to the doctor for an injection to ease the ache of her arthritic knees. \"Of course not,\" I said \"I'm a big, strong woman.\" \n \nBut inside I felt her weight; light on my body, heavy on my soul. \n \nShe leans more and more these days. And that's all right, I can bear it; am just weighed down by what it presages, that she is moving farther from independence, closer towards an ending. \n \nWe were on our way to the hot chocolate shop just around the corner from her doctor's office, a block, a block and a half away. A short stroll. But for my mother now, taxing. \n \nShe has been limited for so long it's easy to forget the energetic middle-aged mother of my youth, the athletic young woman I have heard she once was. \n \nI was just reminded of that this weekend. We were all gathered at her brother, my uncle's house for the holidays, and my cousin Jessie had unearthed my uncle's journal from 1941. \n \nJess had gone down to the basement storeroom, looking for a bottle of seltzer and instead found an artifact from 70 years ago, from Uncle Walter's 8th grade year, from when he was on the man-boy cusp of 14. (I'm going to blink and my boys will be there, too.) \n \nHe hadn't written in it much. Noting the significant year, we went to look up December 7th, the  day that will live in infamy , and found... nothing. Entries filled January, trickled into February, and then petered out, an undertaking abandoned. \n \nBut in those few short entries at the beginning of the book, there lay a treasure trove. \n \nHe wrote of his joy at having walked a pretty girl home after school; musings on the nature of love, sports, and friendship. \n \nAnd then these two entries about my mother, his beloved big sister: \n \n \n \n \"I feel lost with out my big sister around. I wait in the store every day just to see and speak to her\" \n \n(At this time my mother was 19, had graduated high school and was busy working, but she still came back to her parents' candy store in the evenings.) \n \n \n \n \"My older sister is a swell gal. My ideal. I wish she was born a boy then we could have some real fun.\" \n \nAs we read these journal entries aloud my mother teared up, as did my uncle. He reminded her of how athletic she had been in her youth. What an influence she had had on him. \n \n\"I looked up to you.\" Walter said. \"And whatever you did. I did too: ice skating, tennis, track, basketball, volleyball...\u00a0 I did all that because you did, I followed in your footsteps. I wanted to be like you.\"\u00a0 His ideal. \n \n \n \n My Mom & her \"little brother\" Walter last spring \n \nIt's so hard to picture my frail, slow-moving 89 year-old mother as an athletic teenage girl, but I know she was. \n \nAnd wasn't she lovely as a young woman? \n \n \n \n My mom, Sylvia, at about 20 \n \nSince my mother did not have me until she was 38, I never knew her like this. Thank goodness for old photographs. \n \nAnd journals, left laying around in basement storerooms near soda bottles, waiting to be rediscovered, words reaching out across decades. Words of love, family, friendship. \n \nAs I write this post, my son Ethan is reading over my shoulder. \"Let me see those diary pages again, Mom\" he says. \"Is that really something your Uncle Walter wrote about Grandma, so many years ago? She's really his big sister?\" \n \nAnd he reads them again, laughs out loud at the line: \"I wish she was born a boy then we could have some real fun.\" \n \nThe past reaching out towards the future. Words traveling across decades, generations. \n \nWords of love, family, friendship. \n \nMy son, reading, leans on my shoulder. \n \nI will probably (hopefully) someday lean on him. \n \nHopefully, not too heavily. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, November 28, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThis week's Monday Listicles assignment seemed EASY: 10 favorite photos. Piece of cake, I thought. Simple. (But with me, of course, nothing ever is, dip below the surface I must, EVERY. freaking. time.) \n \nBecause for me \"Photos\" brings up my late father, the photographer. Heavy. And also I have such a hard time with the concept \"favorite\"... favorite for content? For aesthetics? And what if there is one more favored photo of one child than another? That just cannot be. My head spins. \n \nSo I have made a decision to STOP the torture (you're welcome) and state unequivocally that these are NOT my all time 10 favorite photos. They are merely 10 that I like a lot and that happened to conveniently and handily reside in my blog's web album or my iPhoto library. \n \nBecause I REALLY want to get to bed before midnight tonight, dammit! \n \nSo, in NO particular order (oh, this is killing me, but I will be strong and not over-think - for ONCE in my life!) 10 photos that I really like: \n \n \n \n My Dad, Jim Steinhardt, around 20 \n \n1. My Dad as a young man. Yes, this is also in my sidebar. Here it is again. I really DO love this photo, as I never knew this young man. He was 43 when I was born, already bearded and balding.  \n \n \n \n \n My Mom, Sylvia Heimer Steinhardt, around 20 \n \n2. My Mother, likewise uncannily (to me) young. \n \n \n \n \n July 29, 2002 \n \n3. Me, deliriously happy, holding Ethan on the day my twin boys were born. (Also just plain delirious on morphine for my c-section pain.) \n \n \n \n \n The boys' first big snow day, January 2003 \n \n4. Me, Danny & the boys, out enjoying their first big snowfall. They were about 6 months old, and we were near zombies from sleep deprivation. But happy zombies, clearly. \n \n \n \n \n \"Mother & Child\" 1960, by Jim Steinhardt \n \n5. Yes, of course that's my beautiful raven haired mother and me. I think I'm about 3 months old here. Mom is 38. Still gorgeous, of course. \n \n \n \n \n A bunch of Heimers, Ellis Island, 1920-ish \n \n \n \n6. I love this photo of some of my mother's relatives, LITERALLY just off the boat, coming to America. This is two of her father's sisters, a brother, and their father, my mother's grandfather whose name she never knew, she just called him \"Zayde\" (Yiddish for grandpa). \n \n \n \n \n Jim Steinhardt, 1961 by Bruce Steinhardt \n \n7. This is the most amazing photo my father, taken by my brother who was 19 at the time. I believe it was taken in my father's photo studio. This is how he looks in my earliest memories.  \n \n \n \n \n Spanish-American Barber Shop, NYC, 1948 by Jim Steinhardt \n \n8. A photo of my father's. Not one of his more famous or iconic ones, but one of my favorites. I couldn't tell you why. I have a print of this one hanging in my apartment. If you look closely you can see my father, fuzzily, in the mirror, taking the shot.  \n \n \n \n \n Lake Champlain, Burlington Vt. 2005 \n \n \n \n9. I love this picture of 3 year-old Jake by the lake. For a while we went to Vermont every summer to see my cousin Jess and her family. We haven't been in 2 years and I miss those visits terribly \n \n \n \n \n Me at BlogHer11 \n \n \n \n10. And, just because all these photos have all been sooooooooo meaningful, I thought I would go from the sublime to the ridiculous for my last photo here. Have a laugh. Because this caught my eye as I was scrolling through my options in the \"upload\" window. \n \nThis was taken this summer at the BlogHer11 conference, in the Temple of Swag (I think the official name was the Exposition Hall). At the time Ethan was expressing his utter disdain for all things Bieber, and I took this photo with the JB cutout just to yank his chain. \n \nBut then this AMAZING thing happened  just last weekend with Anna See  (the blogger who lost her son in a tragic accident this fall) involving her surviving daughter getting to meet Justin Bieber on an all expense paid trip to to the AMA awards in LA. \n \nSo it is not a completely ridiculous photo after all, but rather, suddenly holds major significance. Reminding me that this big star took time out to meet a little girl grieving for her beloved brother, whose one big wish was to meet the Biebster.  \n \nSo there it is. 10. Done. And it ain't even midnight yet. (Only 11:30) So, goodnight! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, November 26, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today's guest, Jessica Severson, of the blog  Don't Mind the Mess , is unique as she only has one child. Yet. She is, however, at the time of this posting, pregnant with child number 2, a girl.\u00a0 \n \n Jessica's  two and a half year-old son is on the Autism Spectrum, and thus when her daughter is born  this winter,  she will be born a special needs sibling. \n \n Jessica writes about her parenting journey in blog, both as it pertains to autism and all the usual toddlerish stuff, too. She also writes about the other interesting and entertaining things that cross her mind, including popular culture and yummy recipes. She is funny and intelligent and is a pleasure to read. \n \n Come experience that here, now, as she talks about the hopes and fears that come with the expansion of a family that already includes autism: \n \n @@@@@@@ \n New Baby and New Beginnings  - by Jessica Severson  \n \nI used to want 4 kids. In the early months after my son was born, I thought 3 wouldn\u2019t be so bad. By the time he was diagnosed with Autism at 17 months, I didn\u2019t know if I could handle 2.  \n \nI used to be jealous of families where the Special Needs child was born 2nd or 3rd and it would be easier for them to make family planning decisions. For us, with our first child diagnosed with Special Needs and a heightened risk of any other children also having Special Needs, the decision to have more children was fraught with worry. \n \nI used to think that if I had another child, I would want to wait until my son was in school. I didn\u2019t think I could handle two young children where at least one had Special Needs. \n \nAnd yet despite all of that, here I am, 6 months pregnant with my second child. My son will be just past 2 and a half when his sister is born.  \n \nEven stranger, despite the years I spent worrying about having more children, I feel really happy about it. \n \nThe best I can tell is that I have worried about as much as I can. I\u2019ve reached the point where I know I want to try at least one more time. I\u2019ve stopped looking for the perfect time just like I\u2019ve stopped waiting for a perfect child.  \n \nIt is happening. And if we find ourselves in a worst-case scenario, at least it won\u2019t be anything really new. We have been around the block. We have handled it. We can do it again. \n \nThat\u2019s not to say I haven\u2019t worried at all. An early test showed an increased risk of chromosomal defects. Those first few hours after I heard the news were some of the darkest I\u2019ve had. The truth is, no matter how ready I feel to handle another child with Special Needs, the hypothetical idea of it is so different than the actual truth of it. \n \nMy amniocentesis came back perfect. But it was a bit of a wake-up call. I was idealizing the prospect of my second child. I was already imagining her as neurotypical and normal. She isn\u2019t an opportunity to do things better, she\u2019s a child just like any other with her own unique set of needs. \n \nTeaching my son to prepare for his sister\u2019s arrival has been more fun than I expected. He has learned the word \u201cbaby\u201d and even knows to associate it with my belly. His therapists have included programs where he hugs and kisses a baby doll. We are working on treating things gently. A lot of it is pretty typical 2-year-old stuff. \n \nIf anything, I feel lucky that my son will still have the comforting rituals of his therapy hours to get through the early transitions. I feel lucky that my family will be there to provide him with play and structure.  \n \nAnd our decision to have the baby this early means my son will still have his Early Intervention therapy for 5 more months after the baby is born.  \n \nThere\u2019s never a perfect time to provide your Special Needs child with a sibling. Especially if they bristle at change. But that is what family is for. And knowing that my children will be able to be a support for one another comforts me.  \n \nMaybe it won\u2019t happen for decades, but someday they will understand each other. Someday they will be able to stick up for one another. And disability or not, they will be able to relate to each other. \n \nSo far I haven\u2019t let my son\u2019s needs get in the way of a vision for the future of my family. What do I really want for all of us? I want us to be close to each other. I want us to trust each other. I want family gatherings to be joyous occasions. I am comforted knowing that my son\u2019s needs don\u2019t have to get in the way of any of that.  \n \nI\u2019ve learned from my son that taking things a little bit at a time is the way to go. I don\u2019t expect that to change when his sister comes. If anything, I think I\u2019ll be able to treasure both of them more.  \n \nI hope that having two different children means I can appreciate two different personalities. Of course that means two different sets of weaknesses and frustrations, but it also means two different sets of strengths and joys.  \n \n @@@@@@@ \n I love how Jessica is sailing forth into this brave new world of parenting more than one child with optimism and a heart full of love, knowing there will be challenges, but preparing to meet them with good cheer and fortitude.  It is inspiring. \n \n Also, full disclosure, I actually met Jessica in person at the Boston Bloggy Bootcamp conference last May and she is just as delightful in person as she is on the internet. \n \n Now that you have read Jessica here, you are clearly going to want to follow her home to her blog    Don't Mind the Mess  and dig in. \n \n You may want to start here, with how the stresses related to parenting and  her son's autism\u00a0 lead to   a spiraling depression .\u00a0 \n \n Try this post about the guilt that can come on when you and your child are actually  doing better , or this one about the day Jessica got the  results of her amniocentesis  back and found out the new baby was a girl, and OK chromosomally. \n \n Also,  go follow her on Twitter where she tweets as  @jessicaesquire , go like her (I know you do) on her  Facebook fan page , and finally, go see the stuff SHE likes on her  Pinterest boards . \n   \n Jessica,  thanks so much for sharing your thoughts and feelings with us here at SNSS, and  wishing you much happiness and joy as you bring your new baby girl into your lovely, loving family.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, November 24, 2011", "body": "\nThanksgiving is such a peculiar holiday, actually all about food and family gathering, as opposed to some other thing that is the excuse for that stuff, that is really at the core of most holidays anyway. \n \nAlso, it's impossible to approach this day without reflecting on Thanksgivings past, especially if you are someone who is as prone to rumination as I am. (What? Don't tell me you haven't noticed that about me.) \n \nTwo years ago, Thanksgiving Day, 2009, was the last time my father came to my home. He was clearly ailing, not himself at all. \n \nThe deterioration from September to November was stark, startling. He spent most all of the day sleeping on the sofa, didn't come to the dinner table, woke only to accept a slice of pumpkin pie. \n \n \n \n Dad, asleep on our sofa, Thanksgiving 2009. \n \n \n \n Dad in a borrowed wheelchair, too weak to walk \n \nLess than two weeks after these pictures were taken, he was in the hospital, and it was the beginning of the end. \n \nLast year was the first Thanksgiving after my father (and my husband's  mother) had died. I wrote a post about it on Thanksgiving morning,  Regarding a Table Half Full,  anticipating a difficult day ahead of us, working hard to find the glass-half-full perspective, connect to my optimist self. \n \n \n \n Three generations at Thanksgiving 2011 \n \nThe day played out pretty much as I had expected it to, was mostly about about getting through it, with a few lovely moments. \n \nThe drive was hellish, dinner was delicious. Jake was very well behaved, Ethan was only occasionally obnoxious, and only spilled water.\u00a0 I had my one glass of good red wine and took my post-turkey sofa nap. \n \nMy Mom only looked lost and teared up once or twice, was glad overall she came. But she was missing Dad something fierce, I know. I was too.  \n \nBut I have also been thinking of Thanksgivings past; the distant past of my own childhood, my early years with Danny, the many Thanksgivings we have had with the boys... \n \nOne particular Thanksgiving stands out in my memory: Thanksgiving 2001. It was a tense, intense time for a couple of reasons. First, we live in New York City and a scant two months had passed since the  destruction of the twin towers  on 9-11. \n \nAnd on a personal front, I was in the middle of the notorious \"two week wait\" after our first ever IVF attempt. To say I was on an emotional roller coaster, sitting on pins and needles that month would be a massive understatement. \n \nAfter an initial bout of optimistic euphoria, I was then feeling anxious and worried that the IVF hadn't taken and growing more and more concerned that I wasn't in fact pregnant. I couldn't count on how I was feeling, as nightly injections of progesterone were masking any hormones my body might be producing (or so I had thought).  \n \nAnd then on that Thanksgiving morning? I committed a big no-no. I snuck a home pregnancy test into the bathroom with me and peed on the stick. Never mind that it was ridiculously early, my retrieval and transfer  having taken place just the week prior. I couldn't help  myself. \n \nNothing. The same one line I had been seeing monthly for over a year. I was deeply disappointed.  \n \nPart of my brain knew it could easily be a false negative, but I took it to heart nevertheless. Lay around on the sofa moping all day, barely dragging my ass into the shower in time to get dressed for dinner at the in-laws. \n \nSomehow I did manage to toss my favorite crushed green velvet dress onto my body and cab crosstown with my husband. But it was hard to shake my funk. I'm sure I was not the most gracious guest. And right after dinner? I parked myself on the second sofa, kitty-corner to the one my elderly father had claimed after the meal for his traditional postprandial nap, and took one myself, thinking I needed to sleep off my bad mood.\u00a0  \n \nIn the perfect 20/20 vision of hindsight,  I can see: it was the pregnancy hormones kicking in.  Because two days later on Saturday morning? I cheated again. \n \nAnd this time... TWO pink lines!  The most beautiful pee-saturated piece of plastic encased fiber the  world has ever known, the first time ever I saw that fabulous sight. \n \nAnd the following year? Twin baby boys at Thanksgiving. \n \nAlso? Bringing up Thanksgivings past?\u00a0 A chance to throw in some  gratuitous photos of my beautiful children at Thanksgiving.\u00a0 Here's a  few from 2006 when the boys were four and my father still a sprightly 89 (same age my mother is now):  \n \n \n \n E & J getting silly with cousins \n \n \n \n Jake, commandeering my rain hat \n \n \n \n Mom, Dad & Ethan on the sofa \n \nI am expecting this year it will be a little easier than last, the grief tempered by time, by the now normalcy of my mother being the sole representative of the elder generation at the table. And we will raise our glasses in a toast of remembrance of those no longer among us. \n \nHappy Thanksgiving, Dad. Happy Thanksgiving to you all. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nLast week I so enjoyed making my  list of why I don\u2019t do list posts , that I decided this week it would be a hoot to participate in Stasha\u2019s Monday Listicles thingie. But if I was looking for a lighthearted post?\u00a0 Um, wow, did I pick the wrong week to start. \n \nBecause for me? This week's list is SO not light and fun, but rather fraught with sadness and regrets and tension and worry about all that is not quite right with my family. \n \nThe list: 10 reasons why you do or do not want more children!  \n \nI struggle often with the feeling that I really should have had more kids. But that boat has sailed. \n \nSo I am splitting this list. Some reasons I wish we could have had more kids and some reasons we are definitively not having them. (And yeah I can never do things the simple way, have to put my own twist on them. My contrarian nature rearing its head again.) \n \nFirst, the reasons we are not having more kids: \n \n1. We are too old. Specifically ME. (Biology\u2019s a bitch and really not fair - guys can still have kids at 70. Not that they SHOULD, but they CAN.) I am 51. Deep in peri-menopause. My period visits occasionally, but mostly just to wave goodbye and thumb its nose at me. \u00a0  \n \n2. We are too old. It\u2019s not just the biology. We are even too old to adopt. Chasing after a toddler right now? Would probably do me in. And my husband is yet 7 years older than I. Too, too old. \n \n3. Autism. Once you have one the chances of having another increase greatly.  Also with parental age. And while having had another typical child would have likely been a boon to the family, another autistic one might well have torn us apart. (Note to my friends with more than one autistic kid: I know you have wonderful families and love all your kids immeasurably. I also know it's tough. I'm just talking about my hopes/fears here.) \n \n4. Money, money, money. We live in a small apartment, barely enough room for the four of us, absolutely not enough room to add another in. About the time I was getting ready to go back to work, we realized Jake was on a different path, and I abandoned my career to become a full time Autism Mom. Money? Is really tight around here. \n \n5. Not just money, but also temperament. While I really would have had 1 or 2 more kids if I could have, my husband, while he loves our sons to pieces? Is just not a kid person. Have a couple of extra kids over on a play-date and his left eye starts twitching. In hell? His job would be kindergarten teacher. \n \n6. We are too old. (Just in case you thought I might be wavering on that one.) \n \n And now, from the department of sad regrets department, why I wish I could have had more kids: \n \n7. I love kids, love being a mom. When the boys were little and they were climbing all over me on the floor I would be laughing away, and my husband would joke that I really had to loosen up and learn to enjoy motherhood more.  \n \n8. Amortizing my expertise. I had no idea what I was doing when I had kids & had to figure it all out under the pressure of twins. Just as I would become really good at whatever stage in their development the boys were at, they would move on to the next. If I'd had more kids I could have had some of that \"more relaxed because it's old hat the 2nd (3rd, 4th) time around\" parenting all my friends with lots of kids talk about. \n \n9. Our family dynamic, with the autism thing? Could really use more kids. Jake really needs a younger sibling to love him unconditionally, look up to him. His dear friends are all 3 and 4 year-olds right now. He loves babies. It would have been great if he'd had one of his own. \n \n10. Ethan could really use a typical brother or sister. Another sibling who is NOT his autistic twin. Someone to play with. And someone to share the burden of caring for his brother when my husband and I are gone, if Jake should still need that. \n \n \n@@@@@@@  \n \nSo, in an ideal world I would have started younger and had more than 2.  Then again, in that world I would also be about 40 pounds lighter, have listened to my mother & become a doctor, and bought Apple stock when it was $5 a share. \n \nBut we don\u2019t live in that world, we live in this one, and this is the family I have. And I do so love my boys and our family, just as it is.   \n \nSo no, we\u2019re not having more kids. \n \nUnless we literally win the lottery, and then with $32 million or so in our pockets?\u00a0 I\u2019d think about adopting a baby girl or two. (Don't worry honey, highly unlikely. HIGHLY unlikely.) \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2011", "body": "\n   \nJacob has put his underwear on backwards again this morning. It doesn\u2019t happen often anymore, but still, occasionally I will come into the living room prompted by Jake\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m dressed Mommy!\u201d shout-out, to find them on the wrong way.  \n \nThen, like this morning, I have to tell him \u201cNo, Jake, they\u2019re backwards, let\u2019s get that fixed\u201d and not just the usual \u201cThat\u2019s a good start, Jake, how about the shirt and pants, too?\u201d \n \nAnd it reminded me of last Thanksgiving when I had watched my husband squirming a bit too much in his seat on the way-long car ride up to Putnam county where we were to be feasting at my sister-in-law\u2019s house. \n \nI asked him why he was acting like he has  shpilkes  and he confessed that HE had put his underwear on backwards that morning, and they were a bit shy of comfortable. He hadn\u2019t noticed until he was taking a quick final pee before setting out.  And, as we were running late (as usual), he hadn't wanted to take the time to remove his shoes, get undressed and redressed again.  \n \nAnd I had to laugh. I had thought the whole backwards underwear thing was a factor of Jake's autistic distractedness, I hadn\u2019t realized it was a family tradition. \n \nAnd, because I never let an opportunity to gently tease my husband go to waste, all day long I kept referring to his awesomely ass forward undershorts. It helped to have a joke running, to undercut the sad that ran through the day on that Thanksgiving, in that shitty year of loss, the first without my father and Dan's mother. \n \nI also took the occasion this morning to notice how tight Jake\u2019s size 10 to 12 underpants are becoming, same as nearly all his clothing. Time soon for my still nine year-old son, my gentle giant, to move up to the next, full-on teenager's size. \n \nI look at Jacob now and so often see parts of my husband's face looking back at me. I did not know Dan as a child, or even a young man; we met when we were shuffling into middle age, and have well grown deeper grizzled in the thirteen years we have been together. \n \nBut in the photos of his childhood I see Jacob, as Ethan so recapitulates my youthful visage. Uncanny really, how one is nearly all mine, the other his. \n \nThis morning once again watching my son dressing, eating, drawing yet another picture of his beloved Dragon Ball Z Kai characters, I see shades of the teen he is on the precipice of becoming, the man's body he will inhabit in the fast blink of an eye. \n \nThis manly illusion broken by his lilting voice: \"Mommy can I pet Cocoa now?\" His mind and spirit clearly remain so firmly still in the grasp of childhood, of autism; his obsession with the family cat waxing not waning. \n \n\"Cocoa, you're my best friend\" he tells her, as he hugs her goodbye for the day. And it's true. She is. And I don't let him see the tears that well in my eyes as we don coats, trudge outside in the semi-darkness to await his school bus. \n \nThankfully they are gone by the time I sweep my hand across his cheek, kissing his tousled head while intoning my daily admonishment: \"Listen to your teachers, work hard, no growling in school!\"  \n \nI start to walk back inside, and then I turn; I turn and wave. \n \nI wave at the darkened windows of the bus, knowing that inside sits my sweet, gentle giant. \n \nMy Jacob. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, November 20, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nHow is it humanly possible for Sunday to roll around again so soon? Who is speeding up time and can we please get them to take their foot off the gas pedal? I mean, really, this is getting quite ridiculous. It's like I'm going to blink and it's going to be something CRAZY, like nearly Thanksgiving. \n \nWhat's that you say? It IS nearly Thanksgiving? No. Shut up. It just turned November. No? Damn. \n \nOK, whatever. It IS Sunday still, right? It hasn't become Monday while I was busy scratching my ankle or anything, right? Good. So here's what's on my mind, straight from my brain to yours with very little filter in between... \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nEthan is pretty unhappy with our plans for today: we're driving out to Queens to attend the 1st birthday party for the baby girl of friends of my husband's and mine. In other words, not about Ethan. \n \nHe complained he wouldn't know anyone there but his family. And I decided to not coddle this shit anymore. I told him \"you know when I was a kid my parents took me all kinds of places with them, not just kid places - where they went, I went too, I told him, it's family plans and sometimes you just have to suck it up and go along with the program, sometimes it's about you and sometimes its NOT about you and families do things together. \n \nI was goinig to launch into all the cool things we go off to do that are for HIM but realized, I was having a hard time coming up with anything recent. Realized I have been in retreat for some time now. \n \nWe Used to do things all the time. go out to museums and parks and other neighborhoods, other boros. I was the \"fun mom\" always game for adventure. fun fun fun. \n \nWhen did that drop? When did weekends become always one day inside, each kid attached to their own screens? I know I've been overwhelmed for a while. That the situation between the boys been so not fun for such a long time now - over a year, maybe two (one of benefits of blogging is can go back over time and read old posts see what was going on in my life at various times). \n \nI have written time and again how hard it is to go and do anything with the two kids as they get along so poorly right now, as autism intrudes into our family space so deeply right now. \n \nBut I hadn't realized how much I have retreated from trying. And that sucks. \n \nSo I want to re-boot the whole enterprise. OK, our old sort-of-easy-to-hang-out family is gone. Done. And now I need to move on, figure out how to create new kinds of fun, make it work for us some how, get out and do.  \n \nBecause I'm the fun Mom damn it! \n \nOK, now to drag Ethan off to a one year old's birthday party.

{"date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "body": "\nYou may or may not know this about me: like a lot of other dorky writers, I'm a bit of a language and grammar nut. I know in this blog I don't always use 100% proper grammar 100% of the time. But I can assure you that 99.9% of the time, if I don't? It's on purpose, for reasons of literary integrity, cadence, emphasis, etc. \n \nA blog is not a formal paper, after all. Sometimes I want it to sound like we're having an intimate conversation, like I'm sitting beside you, whispering my thoughts, inches from your ear. And friends? I don't always speak in complete sentences, with proper grammar, it's true. \n \nBut some stuff? The really egregious stuff? Drives me completely batty. Like using the wrong \"there, their or they're.\" Really, people, didn't you learn that in second grade? \n \nSee? I instantly become a member of the secret grammar police, schoolmarmish, clucking my tongue and rolling my eyes and generally taking everything you say 50% less seriously if you use certain words wrong. I'm sorry. I know it's elitist. But I can't help myself. \n \nBut also, like (I think) all grammarians, I have my favorite, pet non-grammatical  phrases. I know they're dead wrong but love them anyway. Like this one:  \"needs done.\" \n \nAnd? \"Y''all.\" Because there is NO plural for you in \"proper\"  English. And it needs one, doesn't it? \"Y'all\" will suffice.\u00a0  \n \nAnd then there's punctuation. My blog voice is halfway between literary & conversational, making it sometimes hard to find just the right balance between \"proper\" and functional. \n \nSo often I literally hear the words in my head as I write, and then  am scrambling to find a way to make the punctuation work just right so  that you will hear them EXACTLY the way that I heard them, too - or as close as you can since you  will likely be hearing your own voice reading my words to you. \n \nUnless you are  my friend in real life, then you might hear my actual voice talking to you. Or  not.  \n \nMaybe you hear Katharine Hepburn or Carol Kane or your Aunt Matilda (or Tweetie Bird for that matter) reading my words in your head. I have no control over that. We never really know what is going on inside other people's heads  anyway, do we? (OK, digression over, back on topic now...) \n \nBut, even though I have no REAL control, I do what I can to clone my voice into your brain. Trying to parse things like: What sort of pause is a dash verses a comma, a comma verses a semi-colon? What level of emphasis is ALL CAPS verses  bold  verses being set off with *apostrophes*? How much of a shout is  *ALL THREE AT ONCE* ? (And is that ever justified?) \n \nAlso? Correct pronunciation counts. Sorry but it does.  \n \nI was raised by New Yorkers who had no New York accents, who were literate and believed that sounding intelligent was a good thing. (Did this get me shunned on the playground from time to time, left as the cheese who stands alone in the games of Farmer in the Dell? Probably, but it was worth it.) \n \nIf you said \"axe\" instead of \"ask\" around my mother? She would literally turn green, ask who you were planning to chop up. And our next door neighbor kids, who I played with every summer? Their Mom was from South Carolina. Axe, axe, axe away how they pronounced THAT one. \n \nI've learned in the wisdom of my old age to keep my damn mouth shut, to not actually roll my eyes, to keep my polite on; because I really don't need to get into silly altercations about such trivial things after all, do I? \n \nBut in my mind? The schoolmarm is quite alive. \n \nTake \"nuke-u-lar.\"\u00a0 Pronounce nuclear that way, and I immediately shave approximately 30 IQ points right off you. Which is why if I ever hear any of this come out of Ethan's mouth? (And I do.)\u00a0 I get on his case like a tiger.\u00a0 He pushes back: \"It's not fair, Mom, Jake says stuff wrong all the time.\" And that's true. \n \nBut Jacob has an excuse. He has autism, and furthermore, his particular flavor of autism is heavy on the language processing deficit stuff. Ethan knows this, knows if he goes on I will ask him the up-shutting question: \"Do you really want to trade places with your brother? Because you know, life has  actually been very not fair to  him . But if  you'd  really prefer to be the twin with autism...\" \n \nAnd yes, I know this seems like nitpicking. But remember, in the animal kingdom actual nitpicking is an act of  friendship and camaraderie. An important part of the social contract among our primate ancestors: you pick my bugs off and and  I'll pick yours.  \n \nSpeaking of which, since no one is proofreading my stuff but me, and sometimes I'll miss things that are obviously a mistake - like dropped apostrophes on \"it's\" and missing prepositions - if you DO catch something in my blog that needs fixing and isn't a clear style choice? Would you let me know? \n \nI know it's not in the official spirit of blogging - write it and move on - but I *WILL* go back in and correct things in my posts. Sometimes multiple times (but not on Stream of Consciousness Sundays which are supposed to have all mistakes left intact, YIKES). \n \nBecause those occasional stray commas? Make me twitch if I find them in my blog. Oh, yeah, it's, fun, being, me. (Twitch.) \n \n Note: This post is one from the  Zombie Files .  Since yesterday I said that they were \"coming soon,\" I figured I had better make good on that promise, and sooner rather than later. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

As the Playground Fairy she has been at the forefront of the movement to get inclusive playgrounds built in our communities. \n \n Shelley blogs at  I'm Still Standing  where   she is a font of information, as she writes about wellness and special needs families in general, as well as her own very special family in particular. \n \n And, while Shelley is the mother of older children,  she  still recalls her  daughters ' beginnings like it was yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Come read her reflections of her girls' rocky beginnings and their supportive special relationship today, here: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n They are Both \u201cSpecial\u201d  -\u00a0 by Shelley Kramm \n \nI have 2 daughters one who I would say is \u201cspecial\u201d and the other with \u201cspecial needs\u201d and depending on the day over the past 19 years I would say they have each switched those words several times\u2026 \n \nPregnancy and I do not agree; why I am not sure, my mother gave birth to 6 children over the course of 8 years. For me, not so much\u2026  \n \nMy OB-GYN actually called me \u201cthe girl with the little black rain cloud\u201d throughout my first pregnancy. I spent the first trimester throwing up so much I lost 15 pounds.  \n \nI found out I was RH negative (the only thing in common with my mother) developed pancreatitis and major gallbladder issues, my amniotic fluid level seemed to drop to all time lows, and then my blood pressure started to rise and protein began to appear in my urine and I developed full blown Preeclampsia/Toxemia and was admitted to the hospital 3 and a half months before my baby was due.  \n \nSo not like my mother!  \n \nTo make a long story short, it was a traumatic birth, 36 and a half hours after my water broke with Pitocin I had a c-section and my first daughter was born at 32 weeks weighing 4lbs 6ozs with NO cry! NO sound\u2026 Nothing\u2026. She was blue\u2026 resuscitated\u2026 ventilated\u2026 must have been due to the magnesium sulfate that was controlling my blood pressure and her \u201clife.\u201d  \n \nWe named her \u201cSarah\u201d meaning \u201cPrincess\u201d\u2026 Little did I know how that special Princess would turn into a Queen. The doctors told us she would be \u201cdeaf, blind, retarded (I hate that word) and never live on her own.\u201d However, 24 hours later she was pulled off of these things in the NICU and two and a half weeks later we both went home to begin childhood. \n \nThree and a half years later, I found myself again in the same predicament of a not so great pregnancy with Preeclampsia/Toxemia and again at around 28 weeks was at my OB-GYN with Sarah when my doctor shook his head and informed me that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere\u2026 It was time to check myself into the hospital as the Preeclampsia/Toxemia was getting out of control and I had to be monitored.  \n \nThere I was with my little child laying in my hospital bed wondering about my next. The birth, after a prior failed induction, we knew would be a c-section. So we prepared as the operating room prepared. And on February 6th six weeks before her due date Hadley entered the world with a cry that I will never forget.  \n \nShe cried!! I can remember that cry as if it were yesterday as I was so thrilled to hear it thinking \u201cthank god\u201d maybe we would be spared the drama of the last birth and first few hours... However, a preemie and a tiny little baby weighing 3lbs 16ozs; she was the size of a football. \n \nSarah was waiting to see the outcome patiently; did she have a little brother or sister? And as she was whisked away past Sarah to the NICU I think she wondered\u2026 \u201cUh oh, what does this mean?\u201d Sarah had several friends by now who had new brothers and sisters, but none of them couldn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d their little siblings after they were born\u2026  \n \nOn Hadley\u2019s 6th day of life she suffered a bilateral brain hemorrhage which changed her life and all of ours in one moment\u2019s time. From that point on Hadley\u2019s life became about medications, and doctors, and monitors, which Sarah didn\u2019t understand. What 3 year old could understand this? \n \nWhen Hadley finally came home from the hospital, a month later, she had monitors attached to her and a nurse who helped with the therapy and medications. Sarah would walk in and out of Hadley\u2019s room to see her, and every time she walked out she would \u201csmell her hands.\u201d  \n \nI\u2019m not sure what that was about and as Sarah grew older I asked her about it, and she, as a lot of children do, just didn\u2019t answer. But I feel that perhaps she thought that there was a \u201csmell\u201d that might rub off on her and therefore she could \u201ccatch\u201d what Hadley \u201chad.\u201d \n \nI tried to keep our family life as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible, and as our children grew I took them to the local park to play. Not such a great idea, and one day I got pissed off and came home and told my husband this had to change, my children could not play together. My special little daughter Sarah wanted to push her sister around and \u201cplay\u201d with her, and this was impossible with woodchips and her stroller/wheelchair. \n \nHadley\u2019s life was complicated enough with daily visits from physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, cognitive therapists, doctors, and a daily regime of medications which tasted oh so yucky. \n \nSarah would always defend her little sister\u2019s disability to people who stared at her, children as well as adults. I became the brownie leader for Sarah\u2019s troop and made teaching children about special needs a big part of our weekly lessons as Sarah thought it would help other children learn about special needs children and how they are not so different from themselves. Sarah was always willing to spread the word on how we are all ABLE. \n \nWhen Sarah was 14 she came to Kenny and me and asked if she could be in a pageant. We had not ever experienced anything like this and wondered where this was coming from, but as we thought about it we realized that Sarah\u2019s whole life she has been either Shelley\u2019s daughter, Kenny\u2019s daughter or Hadley\u2019s sister and she wanted her \u201cthing;\u201d she wanted to show the world she was \u201cspecial.\u201d  \n \nFor the remainder of her teen years Sarah competed for numerous titles and was very successful as she showed the world that beauty comes from within and shared her platform of \u201cwe are all ABLE.\u201d In 2005 after winning Miss Maryland Teen America she received the title of Miss Continental Teen America and spent the year raising awareness for the disabled. \n \nI thank god everyday for my two daughters and the lessons that they have both taught me on the word \u201cspecial.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u00a0Shelley's lovely family \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Shelley, I find it so inspiring that your older daughter is such a leader in fostering understanding of people with special needs. Wow, you must be so proud.  \n \n And now that  you have read Shelley here you're going to want to follow her home to her blog,  I'm Still Standing  and read her there.\u00a0 \n \n Try starting with this post about  How she went from designer to special needs advocate . Or this moving one about what it was like when her daughter got  her first wheelchair. \n \n Also read about her work as a Playground Fairy, how she  got one of the   first inclusive playgrounds  in the country designed and built in Maryland.  \n \n And, since Shelley has already gone where many of us are about to tread (with great trepidation), you might want to check out  her views on raising teens today.   \n \n Also? Follow her on Twitter where she tweets as  @shelleyellen  and go to her  Facebook Fan Page  for daily inspiration on your life with challenges, and let her know you like her, you really like her. \n \n Shelley, thank you again for sharing your beautiful girls with us here today.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, November 17, 2011", "body": "\nTonight when I sat down, way late, to post - short people finally asleep, me awake, house as picked-up-after as it's probably ever going to be tonight (read: not very; but the small-toy-booby-traps have been stowed away, so you probably won't trip over stray crap and kill yourself, either) - I realized, once again... I got nothing. \n \nIt had been a busy day: rushing to Jake's school way downtown for our Parent/Teacher conference immediately after dropping Ethan off at his, a half-day for Jacob, Hebrew School after school for Ethan; the kind that leaves me hollowed out by the end.  \n \nSo I figured it was time to do what I had previously said I would do when this situation arose this month (in which I am foolishly committed to posting every day whether inspiration has visited or not): mine my not-quite-dead draft post archives for gems. \n \nSo I opened up my Blog's command center and found this: \n \n \n \nThat's right, for approximately every three posts I've published there is one unpublished post: poor orphaned child, sitting unfinished, forlorn and abandoned in my queue. \n \nNow some of these are mere wisps of things, half thoughts, hastily jotted down, ideas for posts that I planned to write at some nebulous time in my future. Others are half done things: neither beast nor fowl, full of egregious typos and devoid of form, starting to go somewhere and then stopping, all out of steam. \n \nAnd then there are the jewels I'm looking for: nearly done posts, just in need of a little polish before they are ready to be sent out into the world. Well, maybe a bit of rewriting and a new ending, but still, close enough to done that its worth the effort to march them to completion. \n \nSo, from these 113 draft posts languishing in their not-quite-dead-not-quite-live state, I thought I was going to simply pluck one out to share today. I thought I would just click and find a perfect small near Insta-Post. Just add a little extra verbiage and it's ready to go! Voila! \n \nBut then I found that even the \"nearly done?\" Still take a ridiculous lot of work to bring into a place where I'm willing to let them out of their hidey hole. There's a reason I didn't get these particular bunch finished. They were not easy to wrestle into shape. Damn.  \n \nAnd the ones that were the closest to ready? Were the best of the bunch, those I want to spend the most careful time with, make sure I am bringing them to the height of their potential shiny brilliance (to drag the \"polishing up gems\" metaphor possibly beyond where it should reasonably go). ADD and perfectionism, it's a heady mix in my brain, I tell you. \n \nSo tonight folks, I leave you with this: a post telling you about more posts soon to come. So all those papers I wrote in college about deconstructionism and the such were not in vain, they were preparing me to talk about talking about talking about things. Which just goes to prove that I can prattle on about anything. Yay, me!  \n \nAnd tomorrow? REAL CONTENT, I promise. \n \n(Hey, I'm getting really good at using a lot of words to circle round and  round a topic but never really saying anything of consequence -  maybe I should go into politics?) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, November 16, 2011", "body": "\nNo, I'm not telling you to do that. (I figure by now you know whether or not your mother is someone it makes sense to listen to.) And I'm not telling your kids (if you ARE a mother) to listen to you - they should be already doing that, like mine always listen to ME. (Yeah, right, and do you want to buy a bridge?) \n \nWhat I am doing is ANNOUNCING something really IMPORTANT (which is why I am SHOUTING here in ALL CAPS): \n \nThe cities and production teams for the ten 2012 Listen To Your Mother shows have just been announced. And... And... YES! I am the producer of the New York City show! \n \nI've been wanting to tell you forever, but couldn't spill the beans, nearly lost my mind waiting for the official announcement.\u00a0 What a RELIEF! \n \n \n Click above to see the national announcement on the LTYM official site \n \nI'll be working with a wonderful team: besides me as Producer there's the lovely and amazingly talented  Amy Wilson  who will be the Director, with  Holly Fink \u00a0and  Julie Nemitz  joining us as Associate Producers. \n \nAlso? The folks taking this on in the other nine sites across the country read like a who's who of fabulous blogger/writers. It's truly going to be an amazing series of events. Go to  the LTYM announcement post  to see who all is on board. \n \nIf you don't know what all this is about? Here it is (liberally  stolen  cribbed from the LTYM site in the words of  Ann Imig  who started this whole thing): \n \n LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER  (LTYM) is a national series of live readings by local writers in celebration of Mother's Day. Born of the creative work of mothers who publish online, each production is directed, produced, and performed by local communities, for local communities. \n \n LTYM began with one show of local writers reading\u00a0in  Madison Wisconsin on Mother\u2019s Day 2010 .\u00a0 The video of the show was posted online in its entirety, and so LTYM reached a global audience and garnered a huge response.  \n \n Bloggers across the country began asking to host LTYM in their home towns, and so in  2011 Ann took the project national  with shows in 5 cities across the country. \n \n The mission of each LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER production is to take the  audience on a well-crafted journey that celebrates and validates  mothering through giving voice to motherhood\u2013in all of its complexity,  diversity, and humor. \n \n LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER aims to support motherhood creatively through  artistic expression, and also financially \u2013 through contributions to  non-profit organizations supporting families in need. \n \nSo there you have it! A lot of my bloggy friends participated in this year's show (including the incomparable Alexandra of  Good Day Regular People ) and got me excited about the idea of bringing it to New York City next spring. \n \nThis summer at the BlogHer11 conference in San Diego, there was a LTYM open mike event on Friday evening, and, fortunately, my name was drawn out of the hat to read. \n \nI read a sweet, sad post about time spent with my elderly mother ( H is for Holding Hands ) and the experience was wonderful. The room was packed; overflowing even with women sprawled on the floor as well as the furniture. And I made some of them cry. And then the next reader made them laugh. \n \n(And then Deb Rox of  Deb on the Rocks  read a piece that was so funny, she made us all laugh so hard there was a mad rush for the bathroom afterward because some of us *might* have peed our pants a little - definite specific hazard in a room full of women who have had our pelvic girdle kicked from the inside one too many times.) \n \nThat's what's so wonderful about this show, it's the whole panoply of the mothering experience, both being and having a mother.  \n \nAnd, oh, did I mention yet that  BlogHer  is actually a national sponsor of this whole shindig again this year (it just keeps getting better and better) so THANK YOU, BlogHer, you wonderful women you! \n \nSo stay tuned for upcoming posts in the future about both the audition process (if you want to be in the show) and the ticket sales (if you want to come see the show). Also? I realized I have told very few tales of my history in the theater (bet you didn't even know I HAD one, right?) so this should cue a bunch of those to be forthcoming soon, too. \n \nJust think: New York City in the late 80's and early 90's, Lower East Side, Off-Off Broadway, performance artists, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival... Hmmmm, some tales to tell, indeed... \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 15, 2011", "body": "\nWell, it's now exactly halfway through November,  NaBloPoMo  month, and so far I am still blogging every day. (Yay, me!) Fellow blogging friends have reminded me that two of the \"easy\" ways to get a post written when I'm in a hurry and have to toss one out are photo posts (Check! I do those on Wednesdays) and list posts. Hmmmm. \n \nThe \"List Post\" is supposed to be a handy tool in the Bloggers arsenal. (I know I've mixed my metaphors there - so what? It's *my* blog, I can do what I want.) \n \nBut you know what? I don't like them, hardly ever do them.  \n \nIn general, they don't work for me. \n \nWhy? (you may ask) \n \nWell, why don't I just make a list for you of my reasons? (Grammar police? Back off - I constructed the sentence that way for a reason. The reason? it pleases me.) \n \nThere are a myriad. That's a big number. But we don't have all day, so maybe I'll cut it down to size. Bite size, perhaps - how about 10, a nice even number (and the basis of our numeric system, to boot). \n \n1. Have I mentioned I have ADD? We don't do lists. They're just so... orderly. And my brain is anything but. I'm allergic to lists. How do I get everything done in my life without them, you ask? Good question! (Hint: I don't.) \n \n2. There is a very specific form and structure to \"Top 10\" list posts and  for some reason (*cough* immaturity *cough*) highly structured brings up  an oppositional, \"you can't tell me what to do\" voice in my head and I  go into resistance mode. (Hey, I didn't promise these were 10 rational  reasons now, did I?) \n \n3.\u00a0 There is no number three. Move on. (Told you these make me oppositional.) \n \n4. I am not a short-form, bullet points kind of gal. I write long, am long-form, not direct and to the point (although the wonderful  Elissa  did once call me \"pithy\" and I so teased her about that), I am Queen of the Run-on-Sentence (with parenthetical clauses) after all. And those? Don't make for nice short punchy \"top ten\" items, you know what I mean? \n \n5. OverdoneOverdoneOverdone. And can I add: overdone? I don't do overdone. \n \n6. That the list post is supposed to be an \"easy out\"? Feels like cheating, like a short cut. And, unfortunately, I don't do those. I try, but they end up being long-way-rounds, not short cuts, every freaking time.\u00a0 Take guest posts. These are supposed to be easy - hey, someone else is writing them!\u00a0 But then I write these long essay-like intros and linky wraps that involve research and take hours. Also? I promise these are not the first 10 things that popped into my head as I sat down to write this here list. I went back and looked them all over thought \"Are they good enough?\" And changed them made them better. Because I just can't take the easy way out without somehow making it the hard way. (Fun being me - no?)  \n \n7. Tangents. I'm all about the tangents, and lists don't make space for  them, you need to proceed right to the next item. Stay on topic. No time  for delicious tangents, like the time I...  \n \n8. By this point? It feels like homework. I hate homework. I am already doing 4th grade  homework every night with Ethan and the same damn 1st grade homework for  the third year running with Jacob. Did I mention I hate homework? \n \n9. I never put things in the right order, always think of the really important one after I'm all done. \n \n10. I know I had more reasons. I just can't think of them right now. But I have to come up with one more, make it to 10 item for this damn \"Top 10\" list because only having 9 is just awkward and feels incomplete. So I'm just going to have to pull something out of my ass, to make up some stupid thing to add in to fill this space up and make it come out to ten. Oh, yeah, that's another reason - I hate \"space filler\" items. Passionately. \n \n @@@@@@@ \nTEN! Yeah, I did it! OK, maybe this wasn't so bad after all. Maybe it's kind of fun. Maybe I should start doing Stasha's  Monday Listicles  linky. Maybe I should start doing ALL of the other list sort of memes on the interwebs. \n \nMaybe that's ALL I'm going to do from now on! No need to try to create that magic \"flow\" or worry about that other writerly stuff, I'll now just list things in the random order they pop out of my brain in, and move on... Whoo hoo! I've been liberated from this \"crafting\" thing! I'm free! I'm free! I've been set free! \n \n(The authorities have now been called to peel Varda off the ceiling. Don't worry, they will slap her around until she calms down, and her blog and writing will return to it's normal state by tomorrow.) \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, November 11, 2011", "body": "\nI have come to realize, in hindsight, that life was much easier when the boys were little, when we could just toss them into the double stroller, or later. load up the big backpack and grab the park-toy-bag and head out the door to the local playground and lawn, just across the street from our apartment building. \n \nThe boys would run around, play, have a great time. Ethan would find a friend or make a new one and Jake was happy to play by himself exploring his sensory environment, digging in the sand, delighted by the sprinkler or entranced and soothed by the motion of the swings,  \n \nSidewalk chalk, bubbles, rocket balloons, sand toys, bouncy balls of various colors and sizes, juice boxes and crunchy snacks: all we needed for happiness. \n \nThey are growing up, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. \n \nI really knew how to parent little kids, I had it down pat, or at least was faking it well enough for us to roll along merrily, even with autism aboard. \n \nBut now? Oh, man is it complicated. Way too complicated. \n \nEthan is so social, is desperate to spend all his time with his friends, playing elaborate games with them, involving 10,000 characters with Japanimated names like \"Flareon.\"  \n \nAnd Jake? Wants desperately to play, to interact with other kids, but has one, just ONE, who will give him the time of day. And she's the baby sister of a friend of Ethan's. And, at four, will soon grow too old to play with odd, older boys like Jake. \n \nManaging their social time is complicated. Sometimes impossible. Like today.  \n \nBecause today was another dreaded school holiday. The first day of an equally dreaded three-day-weekend. And while I had planned and managed Election Day well, filled Ethan's time, made a fun day of it, today was a total mom-fail. I miscalculated, thought I could pick up some mates for Ethan last minute. Big no-go. Everyone was away or busy (scouting friends marching in the Veteran's Day parade, even). \n \nAfter a too-brief playtime with the upstairs neighbor boys in the morning before they took off early for a long weekend out of town, it was just the brothers, together. All. day. long. \n \nWith a tired Mom who had  whanged her elbow  badly on Wednesday evening and was icing and babying it all day, fairly miserable on strong anti-inflammatory medication and very little sleep (last night, every time I adjusted my sleeping body I hurt my elbow and woke up). \n \nTaking them out somewhere would have been a huge endeavor, fraught with the need to ward off many incidents of near-fratricide; possible multiple swear words being invoked when one of the boys inevitably banged into my tender, throbbing left elbow. \n \nSo we spent the whole day inside, the boys attached to their various beloved screens of many colors with loud noises. Me attached to my ice pack and computer, naps snatched when I could. \n \nAnd then this evening I was able to pack them off for dinner and a movie with friends (yes, Jake's one friend) at THEIR apartment, got a two hour respite. Whoo-hoo! \n \nIf I could arrange for a week to take place between today and tomorrow, a week out of time where I could sit on a beach, get a daily massage, drink pink things with tiny umbrellas, read a novel start to finish with minimal interruptions, sleep, sleep, sleep - THEN I would feel ready for the rest of the weekend. \n \nBut something tells me that's not likely to happen in this, my non-science-fiction real life.\u00a0 No one is lending me their  TARDIS . So I guess I'm just going to have to just suck it up and forge ahead. \n \nOne day down, two to go.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, November 12, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Even though she is not local, I have had the pleasure of actually meeting up with today's  SNSS guest, Diane AKA Momo, TWICE so far this year. And I can attest to her being every bit as lovely in person as she is on her blog,  Momo Fali.   \n \n Momo is the mother of two children:  daughter  Ali (source of the blog's title) a typical teenage girl, and her younger brother with a host of special needs. Momo writes beautifully, with much warmth and humor about life with her wonderful family, and her thoughts on the world around her. \n \n To be the mother of both a teenage girl and a boy with multiple health and behavioral issues and to retain a sense of humor? That takes a special person, which Momo certainly is. \n \n So come read this moving post about her children's evolving relationship, now: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n You Are My Sunshine  - by Momo  \n \nI have two special children. \n \nMy daughter, Ali, was born 10 weeks premature and spent five weeks in the hospital. She weighed 2 lbs. 9 oz. when she was born and in 1998, that was one, tiny baby. We spent some time working with a physical therapist, but by 15 months, she had caught up with her peers in size, weight and development. \n \nI have always called her a freak of nature. \n \nWhen Ali was a toddler, her brother was born 7 weeks premature, with congenital heart defects, urinary reflux, severe GI reflux, eye problems and bad hearing. Special needs took on a whole new meaning. As he grew, we learned of OCD, PDD-NOS and SPD. Acronyms-R-Us! \n \nWe spent a lot of time, those first few years after my son\u2019s birth, in and out of the hospital. He was a very sick baby and had 9 surgeries by the time he was 6 years old. Ali\u2019s life was flipped upside down. \n \nI read somewhere, long ago, that in order to make a child feel positively about a new sibling that you should refer to the baby as, \u201cyour brother\u201d or \u201cyour sister.\u201d I did that a lot and it worked for a long time.  \n \nI vividly remember my son being in pain and watching Ali sing to him. She usually chose, \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d She was a fabulous big sister. \n \nSure, she ran from the room when he would choke and vomit, or excused herself to the hallway at the lab when it was time for a blood draw. I can\u2019t blame the kid for that!  \n \nBut, more often than not, Ali was a trooper just like her brother; at least during the medical phase of his special needs. When his health became stable, the behavioral issues came to the forefront. His quirks, she merely tolerated. \n \nThen she turned 12 and she tolerated them no more. \n \nApparently, having a special needs brother is one thing, but having a special needs brother when you\u2019re going through puberty is something else entirely. If you dislike your parents, then you will really dislike your little brother. Throw in odd behavior and it will be downright disdain. \n \nMy son not only annoys her, but he is brutally honest. This is fine, at home, when he\u2019s telling her that she\u2019s \u201cbossy\u201d (she is, in a big-sister sort of way), but in public it is clear that she would rather be anywhere but with us, out of fear that her brother will say something embarrassing.  \n \nThey fight a lot, but there are fleeting moments when I see them playing together and my heart sings. I miss those, \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d days. Not the part where my son was so sick, but the part where Ali tried to make it better. Now, he sings to her (because he sings constantly) and she tells him to, \u201cBe quiet! Gosh!\u201d \n \nShe loves to read and, on her own, she chose a couple of books from the library about siblings of kids with Asperger\u2019s. When asked, she jumped at the opportunity to sit, privately, with my son\u2019s psychologist to talk about what it\u2019s like to be a special needs sister. She is learning and speaking about her situation at her own pace, on her terms. \n \nBut, she will not talk to me about it and that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s almost 13. She doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. You know why? Because she\u2019s not the special needs baby that she used to be.  \n \nShe\u2019s a regular tween. Her prematurity didn\u2019t affect her as it could have. Other than a couple of minor medical procedures as a toddler, she has grown, completely, into a typical girl. And, that\u2019s a great thing. \n \nWould I love to know what she\u2019s thinking? Yes. Would I love to know what to say and do to let her know that her feelings are perfectly normal? Yes. But, as long as she can talk to someone about it, it doesn\u2019t have to be me. \n \nMy job is to let her know that she is loved, to remind her that her brother can\u2019t help embarrassing her and, when she, someday, realizes how fortunate she was to have grown up with a special needs brother, I will welcome her back with open arms. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n I love how Momo understands and accepts that her kids' relationship will change and evolve over time, trusting that it will fall back into a better rhythm someday in the future. And also her acceptance that her daughter may just not want to talk to her mother about everything at this point in her life. (Teenager - how that word strikes anticipatory terror in every parent of a younger kid's heart!) \n \n Also, I have to say, that song \"You Are My Sunshine\" that serendipitously played a role in both last week's AND this week's SNSS posts? Terrified me as a young child. It made me deeply sad, made me sob and wail. Why? Have you heard the lyrics? \" Please don't take my sunshine away...  You have shattered all my dreams .\"   But I'm over that now. Sniff. \n \n OK, now that you have read Momo's lovely words here you're going to want to follow her home to her blog,  Momo Fali,  and read her there.\u00a0 \n \n Try starting with this post about her daughter that tells  the story of the blog's name\u00a0  or this one in which Momo shares some of Ali's  incipient     transformation into a teenager.  (Yikes!) \n \n To know more about Momo's son, read this post written to him on  his ninth birthday , or this moving piece about the pain of watching him trying to play sports, but not quite being able to keep up, becoming  invisible . \n \n Finally, for the funny (which Momo has in spades) read this post about  her  wasabi gob of death incident  when she was in NYC for the BlogHer Writers conference  last month , to which I was an actual witness! \n \n Also? Follow her on Twitter where she tweets as  @MomoFali  and go to her  Facebook fan page  and let her know you like her, you really like her. \n \n Thank you Momo, for your friendship, and for this lovely, lovely post about your beautiful, special children.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

And it's the 13th already, that means it's nearly mid-month. So really that's not that bad.  \n \nWhat is bad, however, is this: I got nothing today. \n \nI just will. not. post. another. whiny. how-tough-life-is-with-an-autistic-kid. rant. \n \nI. just. will. not.  \n \nWhich is what you would get if I let loose with a Stream of Consciousness Sunday post tonight. Believe me, I live here in my brain, I know which direction it's going in; nothing good coming out of that tonight, trust me on this one folks. \n \nSo I'm going to take a page out of some other blogger's books and use this space to link up some of the beauty and brilliance I have found on the web this week, send you off to read posts on OTHER people's blogs. \n \nLike Schmutzy does with her wonderful \" Five Star Friday \" weekly collection of wonderful posts (that I have had the honor of being linked up in, multiple times). \n \nOr Kate from The Big Piece of Cake with her \" Links I Love \" posts on (mostly) Mondays. \n \nOr Jenny, the Bloggess, with her weekly Sunday wrap-up posts containing the  \" Shit-I-didn\u2019t-come-up-with-but-wish-I-did-because-it\u2019s-kind-of-awesome \"  list.

THAT'S not a post. THESE are posts (go. read.):  \n \nStimey, over at her blog Stimeyland wrote another AMAZING \"big thoughts\" post about autism again. Read this post here:  Not Even Wrong  about her son on the autism spectrum and his wonderful teacher and about how important it is to NOT pound our square peg kids into round holes because, as she quotes from my favorite author Paul Collins book Not Even Wrong:\u00a0  \"Autists are the ultimate square pegs, and the problem with pounding a  square peg into a round hole is not that the hammering is hard work.  It's that you're destroying the peg.\" \n \nMomo over at her blog Momo Fali writes a short, lovely, moving post about feeling lost, and then found. Read this:  Rising Above  and go give her a cyber-hug, please. \n \nAnna of An Inch of Gray is continuing to rip out our hearts with beautiful posts about her lost son and surviving daughter. This one:  Isn't it Ironic , is yet another that must be read. You will find her writing as astonishing as the depth of love that suffuses her blog. \n \nMy friend Alysia's beautiful tribute to her Father, now dead 13 years:   The\u00a0Rose \n \nThere is MUCH more that is wonderful out there, but four links is about all I got in me tonight.

His arm is draped across his forehead, warding off what creatures of dreams I know not. \n \nI sigh, spend a moment breathing in my son, indulging in one of the great secret pleasures of this mothering life: watching my children sleep.  \n \nNine year-old Ethan has become wary of his mother's lingering eye in wakefulness.\u00a0 \"Why are you staring at me, what are you looking at?\" he'll ask if my glance overstays. Worried there is scrutiny, judgment. He accepts, skeptically, when I state the mostly true: \"Nothing, I just love looking at you.\" \n \nBut while he sleeps, I can feast to my hearts content upon his sweet features that nascent adolescence and testosterone soon will transform. \n \nLike the witch mothers in the Harry Potter books we are reading together, I wish for a magic wand with which to ward off all the hurtful things that may befall my son, making his way across the treacherous waters that lie ahead. \n \nWand-less, bereft of all but the ordinary magic of mother-love, I make my silent incantations anyway: \"Let his heart not be badly broken by the first girl he hands it to; let him find joy in the doings of life and not just the achievement of the brass rings, but may he snatch his fair share of those as well, please.\" \n \nHe breathes in, out. \n \nAnd I breathe with him, remembering the time I once breathed for him and his brother, when they resided inside me, and I stood in this room expectantly, attempting to conjure their faces from my dreams. \n \nEnvying my son the deliciousness of sleeping in, I slip out of his room. \n \nA sink full of dirty dishes beckons. \n \nThe tower of boxes, emptied of mittens, fleece and parkas; now filled with summer - tank tops and shorts, sun bleached bathing suits and salt scented beach towels - are impatiently waiting to be carried back to the basement. \n \nBut first these words buzzing 'round my head must find purchase.

(And many plain old garden variety parents do, too.) \n \nIt\u2019s the slogging through the day-in-and-day-out of caring for and about our special kids.  It\u2019s all that we do when we\u2019re with them (talking and playing and supporting and scaffolding and watching and pushing them gently and coaching and coaching and coaching and holding our frustrations in check, smiling when we want to yell or sob; and, for some of us, taking care of their every physical need even though they have not been an infant for a decade or more; and, for some of us, wrapping our arms and legs around them tightly, enduring bruises and worse until the storm passes so they don't injure themselves or their siblings.) \n \nAnd it's all that we do when we\u2019re not with them (phone calls and meetings and research and more phone calls and strategizing and worrying and IEP meetings and phone calls to lawyers and more research and reports to read and reports to write and applications to fill out that make us weep as we list for the thousandth time all the milestones our kids missed and when we first noticed they were different and what we did about it.) \n \nOn a day like yesterday, when herculean feats are being celebrated all over the city, it's easy for me to slip into negative judgements of myself and my lack of lofty achievements.  \n \nI have been slipping in and out of a  low level depression  since last winter; some days, weeks, months closer to the light, others falling into shadow's embrace. \n \nI need to go gentle with myself.

Good Times.   by Jillsmo who herself was an early SNSS contributor with a  lovely post about her sons. \u00a0 \n \n I liked his voice. I wondered, \"More kids? SNSS potential?\" and followed him home to his blog,  Just a Lil' Blog  where I found out that, yes, Lily has an older sister. Yay! \n \n In fact, the blog's tag line? Explains it all: \"The true life adventures of a little girl with autism, and her  struggles raising her two parents with only a big sister to help her.\" \n \n Jim is smart and funny and wonderful to read. I am so glad he is now on my radar.   \n \n And now? This beautiful tale of sisterly love -- and be sure to watch the short video at the end!  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Sunshine  - by Jim W \n \n\u201cWhat do you miss most about your sister, Emma?\u201d I asked her while we drove to Wisconsin. \n \n\u201cMaking her laugh, and when she smiles,\u201d she replied sadly. \n \n\u201cWhat do you miss least?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to ask that question, it felt like a weird sort of betrayal, but I wondered what she\u2019d say and she didn\u2019t miss a beat. \n \n\u201cGetting spit on.\u201d \n \nWhen Lily was born, in a concerted effort to short-circuit any perceived monopoly on attention that she might be hijacking from her hitherto only-child sister, we bought a fluffy white teddy bear and gave it to Emma from Lily. \n \n \n \n We said, \u201cThis is from Lily\u201d and we read the card aloud, \u201cThanks for being a great big sister to me, Love Lily.\u201d\u00a0 Emma at three didn\u2019t question Lily\u2019s precognition of her future bigsistermanship.\u00a0  \n \nWe\u2019re blessed in many ways with the kids\u2019 relationship. Lily, though not particularly affectionate in general, genuinely cares for and about her big sister, asking for her when she\u2019s not around and hovering over her clumsily, touching her face or asking for \u201cskishes\u201d - what Lily calls it when Emma lays down on top of her and says \u201cI\u2019m going to squish you!\u201d and Lily giggles and says \u201cI want more skish!\"\u00a0 And Emma has been the best big sister we could possibly have hoped for; patient, understanding, loving, and playful. \n \nWe had decided to attend the wedding of my wife\u2019s sister in Wisconsin without Lily.\u00a0 Our reasons, filtered through guilty consciences ring hollowly even now in hindsight, but they were valid then, and the details that unfolded over the course of the trip only served to confirm them:\u00a0 Long trip confined to the car, cold weather in an unheated church, loud music and crowded dance floor at the reception, upstairs bedroom, gas fireplace, then a long drive home. Throughout the event we had several \u201cah hah!\u201d moments where we looked at each other and communed wordless agreement, \u201cshe could not have handled this.\u201d \n \nIt was the first time we\u2019d really separated the two kids for any significant length of time.\u00a0 There\u2019s always the tool of divide-and-conquer that married parents of two busy kids are forced to utilize at some point, so my autistic five year old daughter, Lily, and her neurotypical nine year old big sister, Emma, are away from each other often, but in the same ways that any siblings born three years apart are; for brief stretches of therapy, or dance practice, or softball games, always back together again just in time for bed. \n \nMy parents took care of Lily while we were away.\u00a0 She loves them and always has fun playing with them, and that was our primary argument to Emma whenever she would get sad about the upcoming separation, \u201cBut you know Lily is going to have so much fun with Gramma and Papa!\u201d \n \n\u201cYeah, I know.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t want to be away from Lily.\u201d \n \nIn the days before we left I had tried to record a video of Lily saying \u201cI love you, Emma!\u201d\u00a0 I figured if it was happy enough, it\u2019d bring a little joy to a big sister who I knew was going to miss her little sister.\u00a0 I pushed \u201crecord\u201d and asked Lily to repeat the phrase.\u00a0 Sometimes that goes like this: \n \n\u201cSay, \u2018I love you, Emma!\u2019\u201d I\u2019d say. \n \n\u201cSay I wuv you Emma\u201d, she\u2019d reply, echoing the request.  \n \nAs I pressed \u201crecord\u201d this time and asked her to tell her sister she loved her, she just kept repeating, \u201cWhere is Emma?\u00a0 I want Emma.\u201d And no amount of prompting could convince her to go \u201coff message.\u201d\u00a0  \n \nI imagined myself playing this video for Emma while we were on vacation, with Emma asking for her sister, and me trying to reassure her that Lily was fine using a video of Lily repeating over and over \u201cWhere are you Emma??\u00a0 I want Emma!\u201d\u00a0 It didn\u2019t seem like a great idea. \u00a0I scrapped that project and instead tried to get her to sing \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d with what I hoped would be a \u201ccongratulations\u201d to the happy couple as the grand finale with mixed success. \n \nAs we dropped Lily off for school the day of our departure none of us handled it well, but Emma had the hardest time.\u00a0 Occasionally over the course of the days leading up to our trip there had been tears, and this day was no exception.\u00a0 We walked away from the school, leaving Lily crying with her school aide, and I picked Emma up, hugged her tightly as she sobbed softly against me, and tried to stay composed. \n \n\u201cI miss Lily,\u201d she said, her words muffled by my shoulder, and we hadn\u2019t yet even gotten in the car to drive away from the school. \n \n\u201cI miss her too, baby.\u201d \n \nLet me return to the subject of Sibling Saturday with a rewrite of the trite but true, \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one child with autism, you\u2019ve met one child with autism:\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one set of siblings affected by autism, you\u2019ve met one set of siblings affected by autism\u201d.\u00a0 Not as catchy, to be sure, but just as true. \n \nMy daughters love each other and are good with each other in ways both unique to Lily\u2019s autism, but also the same as any other loving neurotypical sisterhood.\u00a0 They irritate each other and get in each other\u2019s way, they fight for TV time, but at the end of the day they miss each other and want each other around all the time. \n \nI know from reading other accounts of siblings\u2019 relationships with each other that I can\u2019t extrapolate any generalized wisdom regarding typical sisters and their autistic siblings, anymore than typical siblings relationships can be generalized to rules of thumb for other typical siblings. \n \nFive years later the teddy bear that Lily gave Emma on the day she was born was with her throughout our wedding trip.\u00a0 She left it briefly in her grandparents\u2019 room one evening, and cried when she couldn\u2019t get it back, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I have from Lily!\u201d until we called and left messages for her grandparents pleading with them to call us and we\u2019d pick up the bear. \n \nThey did, and we did, mollifying Emma.\u00a0 She had a favor from Lily, almost like the knights of old, carrying something to remember her loved one by, tilting not against her fellow knights, but her own loneliness.\u00a0  \n \nAnd that made her the smart one.\u00a0 I could have used a favor too. \n \nIn a way I found I had one. We all did. The resultant video of Lily singing \u201cYou Are My Sunshine\u201d was something my daughter (and my wife and I) watched over and over and over during the trip as the bustle of the pre/post wedding details would lapse into brief leisure and our brains and hearts returned again to the missing member of our family. \n \nLily was asleep when we finally arrived home at the end of the trip.\u00a0 My parents put her to bed at our house that night and waited for us. After they left, we all went upstairs to Lily\u2019s room, creeping into it and standing over her happily. \n \nEmma kissed her finger tips and intoned \u201cI love you Lily\u201d quietly over them, like an incantation, smoothing her fingers through Lily\u2019s hair as she slept undisturbed. \n \nIt\u2019s good to be together again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \"You Are My Sunshine\"  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n I really don't know what I can possibly say to cap this beautiful, beautiful post about a pair of loving sisters, about this lovely loving family.\u00a0 Anyone who knows the contentious nature of my sons' relationship will know how moved by and deeply envious I am of the depth of these sisters love and care for each other.\u00a0 \n \n This line really kills me: \"I just don\u2019t want to be away from Lily.\" because Ethan begs daily to have Jacob sent away. Sigh.\u00a0  \n \n And now that you've gotten to know these girls a little bit here, please follow Jim back home to  Just a Lil' Blog    to read more.

{"date": "Friday, November 4, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Ethan \n For a little while now, my nine year-old son Ethan has been wanting some time on my blog to call his own. We have been discussing the possibilities of a guest post; it's been simmering away in the back of my brain. \n \nAnd then today there was a \"publishing party\" in his fourth grade classroom. All of the children had written personal narratives and this morning we proud parents got to read them amidst festive food and much excitement. \n \nAs I have mentioned from time to time here, Ethan has had issues with writing. Some deadly conflagration of perfectionism, ADD, having writer parents, compliance issues, left handedness, and who all knows what else has created a snarled mess that led to horrible homework wars for the past 2 years; led to a huge differential between his Math and English scores on standardized tests. (He can do math in his sleep.) \n \nAnd this is not a child who has trouble expressing himself. He is full of ideas, has a huge vocabulary, reads up a storm. He will TALK on any subject until the cows come home, but ask him to write it down and he clams up, freaks out. The translation of thoughts and ideas from brain to page has been a minefield for him. \n\u00a0  \nIn an attempt to head things off at the pass, knowing that much writing would be required of him this year, we brought in some outside help: Ethan has a writing tutor. And we have not yet had a homework fiasco, though the beginning of his work with the tutor was rocky going, \u00a0  \n \nAlso, it seems, he has a great classroom teacher. Because when we sat down to read his essay, we were blown away, and I knew I had to share it with you here (with Ethan's permission of course). \n \nIt is a very PERSONAL personal narrative. While many other students wrote about big moments in their lives, Ethan chose a small one, and not really a happy one, in spite of the (ironic) title. I don't necessarily come out smelling like roses in it, either.\u00a0  \n \nRead now and hear my son Ethan, in his own words: \n \n @@@@@@@ \n The Sunny Feeling of My Room  By Ethan  \n \nI was coming home with my mom and Ellen (my tutor). My mom was in a rush to pick up my brother Jacob from his bus. I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to pick him up. My brother has autism. It\u2019s something that makes his brain work differently. \n \nWhen we got to my house we waited in the lobby for my brother\u2019s bus.  \n \n\u201cDo not yell at Ellen,\u201d Mom told me. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied. \n \nJacob\u2019s bus came about one minute later. The four of us got into the elevator. I pressed five. We got to my apartment and went in. \n \nJacob kept annoying me. \n \n\u201cMr. Ethan,\u201d he kept saying to me. \n\u201cStop it!\u201d I yelled. \n \nMom tried to get him to go on the computer. But he said he wanted to watch television. She got him to watch television in my parents room. \n \nWe started working. Ellen told me to write two pages of something. I thought it was too much so I started to yell at her, \u201cThat\u2019s too much!\u201d \n \n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d she told me. That went on for a while. \n \nThen Mom yelled \u201cEthan, go to your room!\u201d \n \nI was in my room punching pillows. My teeth were clenching, my rage hissed inside of me like fire. I knocked a pillow across the room. I felt like no one really cared about me. I kicked the wood keeping up my brother\u2019s part of the bunk bed. I somehow felt a little sad inside, like I was going to cry. \n \nThere was nothing to do in my room.\u00a0 My room has yellow walls, a clothing drawer, a shelf with old toys, three old pictures from when I was five, somewhere around fifty stuffed animals, a window, and my bunk bed. \n \nMy stomach barked.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t ate since lunch at school about three hours ago.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t get out of my room.\u00a0 I waited but I was too hungry. \n \n\u201cMom, can I please have a snack?\u2019 I yelled from across the house. \n \n\u201cWhat?\u201d she replied. (Probably yelling.) \n \n\u201cCan I have a snack?\u201d I said, a little louder. She was coming into my room. \n \n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t hear you,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cMom, can I have a snack?\u201d I told her.\u00a0 She offered me Scooby Snacks. I answered yes. I didn\u2019t really  want  want them but I didn\u2019t want to starve.  \n \nI head butted my bed while I was waiting.\u00a0 She came back with a large green bowl of Scooby Snacks. They smelled like the sweetest thing on earth. But they tasted even better. \n \nJust as Mom was leaving I thought I would ask her if I could play with some toys. \n \n\u201cMom, come in here.\u201d I called. She came in. \n\u201cWhat,\u201d she replied \n\u201cCan I play with the toys in my room?\u201d I asked. \n\u201cNo, read your book,\u201d she said, mad. I couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t eat while I read, I knew. \n \nSo I replied, \u201cI can\u2019t eat and read at the same time. But I can eat and play.\u201d \n \nShe came back with my book  Young Samurai: Way of the Dragon . \u201cRead this when you\u2019re done eating,\u201d she told me. \n \nI did not listen to my mom.\u00a0 I played with balls called Bakugan. I has just beaten myself for the third time when I heard Mom and Ellen talking.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t hear what they said but I knew they were talking. \n \nI was half way through my Scooby Snacks, Jacob was watching television. I felt bad, I wanted to do something. I called my mom from across the house. She came in. \n \n\u201cMom, can I please get out of my room?\u201d I asked. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do what you did again,\u201d she replied.\u00a0 I felt fire in my heart, I squeaked out a yes. \n \nEllen was happy to see me back. We had about twenty minutes left.\u00a0 Soon Ellen left and I started watching television. \n \nWhen I look back to that day I know not to judge something before you do it. Also don\u2019t get mad because you don\u2019t want to do something. I chose this because I had never been in my room so long before. \n \n @@@@@@@ \nAs I was reading this I kept thinking it read like the kind of blog posts I love: raw, honest, real. It is very revealing.  \n \nOther parents who read his story kept coming up to me and marveling at the emotion in it, the awareness of and ability to express his feelings. \n \nIt seems my little apple hasn't fallen far from the tree, after all. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, November 3, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nSo, as those of you in the bloggosphere probably know (and with advance apologies to my civilian readers here) November is a special month for bloggers and internet-savvy writers and writers who blog (if there is such a distinction to be made) - it is National Novel Writing Month (or NaNoWriMo) AND - in response - National Blog Posting Month (or NaBloPoMo); a month where many are committing to writing copious amounts of words EVERY day. * \n \nNaBloPoMo started as a November thing like NaNoWriMo, then the daily blogging part caught on so well that it became a regular monthly thing, and I participated  this past July  - and yes, wrote a post EVERY day. (See the little \"31\" next to July 2011 in my archive on the left?) \n \nI enjoyed it, and it was good for my writing; a daily flexing of the muscle and guess what? It gets stronger (duh). \n \nBut... but.. it took time. Time that would have / could have been family time. Time that would have / could have been clean up the house time, deal with the mountain of paperwork time. You know the drill. \n \nIt was a relief when August came around. But also a bit of a let-down from the writer's high of daily posting. So I thought - November. The BIG month, the uber-NaBloPoMo... I'll do it again then, and planned on it, planted the seed in my brain. \n \nBut then October kicked my ass. With my elderly mother's hospitalization and subsequent recovery sucking all the time out of my life, I felt me family needed me. I needed me. \n \nSo I decided: I can't do this. As much as I can  use my crazy life as excuse to not write, I can also use writing as excuse to neglect parts of my life. Especially the the unpleasant ones: housework, paperwork,  etc. \n \nI would be a liar to not admit the chaos factor in our home has increased tenfold since I really became committed to the writing life. Dealing with dust bunnies or crafting a memoir piece... there is NO doubt where my priorities lie. But when the dust bunnies get as large as the sofa? It's a problem. \n \nSo I decided to bow out, even prepared a preliminary post called \"No Mo\" to explain why. It's not that I wasn't going to write, but I was just not going to put the pressure on, make it so I HAD to every day. \n \nBut then... but then... so many of my friends were doing one (or BOTH!) of the writing challenges and were talking about it excitedly on their blogs. The Twitter chatter began. And NaBloPoMo's home based moved to BlogHer, MY home base, in so many ways, too. \n \nIn short: I started feeling left out. Started feeling resentful of \"having\" to give up something I had so been looking forward to. \n \nSo I signed up. I can still bail at any time during the month if the center just can't hold, if I find Ethan pouting in the evenings, complaining I \"love the computer more than you love us!\" again. \n \nBut the writer in me feels the need to give it the old college try. And I have some tricks up my sleeve. \n \nYou may see some very short posts here this month, mere wisps of thought that I would normally save up until I had three or four on a theme to weave into a \"good sized and proper\" post. But hell, I've noticed many daily posters often go short, so why not me, too.  \n \nAlso, reading back through my post queue, I have found some very interesting drafts, things half, even three quarters written that I really would love to complete and send out into the world.\u00a0 Some of them I abandoned, even though I really liked them, because I thought they'd lost their \"timeliness.\" \n \nSo I'm thinking this is the perfect excuse to resurrect them, make them resurfaced time capsule type things (including one I can call \"Lost Tales of BlogHer11\"... yeah THAT post that I never finished). \n \nAnd now I will end this (completely internal-thought-process, welcome-to-my-brain) post with a question... \n \nShould I be doing NaBloPoMo this month and posting daily, or am I nuts to add that pressure to my life right now?\u00a0 I have no clear perspective, I'm opening the floor to opinions. Thanks! \n \n \n * I think I have just topped myself, with the longest opening sentence in a post of mine EVER - reaffirming my title as Queen of the Run-On-Sentence (with parenthetical clauses).  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, October 31, 2011", "body": "\nDid you know that October is National Depression Awareness Month? \n \nWell, it was. \n \nAnd somehow it seems a lot of people I know - both in \"real life\" and the Bloggosphere - have been struggling with it mightily lately. And writing about it. Which is a good thing (the writing, not the suffering). \n \nAllie Brosh who blogs at Hyperbole and a Half had been silent since May. \n \nNow I know why. \n \nI don't know if anyone has ever before given voice (and image) quite as clearly as to what debilitating depression feels like (while remaining entertaining and funny, she is amazing). Read THIS: \n \n \n \n Click to read: Adventures in Depression \n Also? \n \nJenny, the Bloggess:  I\u2019m out of the hole. \n \nMy friend Stacy (the BlogHer Moms editor):  Whither Wisdom \n \nEva:  Taking Leave\u00a0  \n \nLast winter it was my dear Adrienne:  The Sound of the Darkness \n \nAnd Alice, writing very bravely and honestly about it all:  Chasing\u00a0rabbits \n \nI, myself, come from a family with a long history of melancholy, a tendency towards depression. \n \nMy mother has been sad and depressed since my father died.  \n \nMany days when I go visit her I find her in asleep in her nightgown, asking \"Why bother?\" when I attempt to rouse her out of bed. \n \nThe fact that she is simultaneously, at core, a cheerful and outgoing as well as a depressed person (not as uncommon as you might think) means that once I shove her out into the world - in her case the group dining room - she perks up and becomes animated, thanks me for making her go to lunch /dinner, lights up and chats with her friends and the staff.  \n \nThis is clearly a depression with an instigating event - the loss of her mate of 51 years and truly her best friend - but still it's hard to see her ever pulling out of it completely. \n \nLonely is lonely. \n \nShake my family tree and all kinds of shit falls out. \n \nMy  Grandmother  - my mother's mother - had a complete breakdown once, when she felt she'd made a very bad business decision; lay on the living room floor unable to function. My then twelve year-old mother had to take up the reins of mothering her younger siblings until Grandma snapped out of it, months later. \n \nMy Grandfather - my mother's father - spent the last ten years of his life (and the entirety of mine) in a state mental institution for... you guessed it - severe depression. \n \nMy  Aunt Marilyn , my mother's baby sister, is nearly catatonic, refusing to eat all but liquid nourishment (too much effort to chew). She has had a smorgasbord of diagnoses thrown at her over the years, but is certainly Bipolar (I) with a walloping dose of paranoia thrown in to boot. \n \nAnd me? \n \nI was afraid you'd ask that. \n \nI talk about being \"up and down\" here, but have rarely used the word \"depressed.\" That's in some ways because I'm always still functioning, still rising to the occasion, and many days full clear of the fog. \n \nBut in truth I have spent time in my life keeping company with the black dog. Nowhere near the level of some folks I've known, and much more in my younger days; tending toward the weepies when I was in my 20s, but no stranger to depression, nonetheless. \n \nTruth? I'm a writer, have a temperament that tends towards reflection and rumination more than action - in other words, a familiarity with melancholy and low level depression seem to go hand in hand with the job description.\u00a0  \n \nLately, it's been creeping up on me, beginning with my  surgery last winter , the first in my ridiculously healthy life. I don't talk about it much because I know so many others who have it so much worse, who are deep in the hole, dancing with the demons. \n \nMine has been the kind that usually doesn't paralyze, but still manages to suck most of the colors out  of the day. When I'm dipping in? I call it my \"looking at the world  through shit-colored glasses\" state of mind. \n \nAnd I can, usually, eventually, rustle up a little perspective. And the internal voices that tell me I suck? I've gotten pretty good at yelling \"fuck you, liars!\" at them until they shut up. I'm lucky that way, I know.\u00a0  \n \nSo what I think I'm mostly dealing with now is the cumulative stress of raising special needs kids, which is just terribly wearing upon the spirit; which is just a fact of my life.  \n \nAnd since that isn't something that's going to change anytime soon, I expect to be bobbing up and down for a while, too. Maybe even the rest of my life. (Isn't that a cheerful thought now.) \n \nAnd, like my mother, I am simultaneously an upbeat, outgoing, sociable person at heart, so that drives me to push on and push through. Which, of course, is some days much easier than others. \n \nThe nature of the beast. \n \nWhat is that they say?

{"date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2011", "body": "\nSome days are more possible than others, more seeming infinite in nature. Others shrink down into a nubbin, a hard, mean little kernel that sticks in my throat. \n \nIt doesn't help to have a raging headache. It doesn't help to be worn down so thin from autism that I am surprised I can't be seen through, more apparition than person. (My spirit, that is, my waist is thickening like pudding.) \n \nI love my son to pieces but some days can barely stand to be with him; and by bedtime it has been one of those somedays. And it's no one thing, just every little thing. From the moment I greet his bus, on - late today, so I am granted a fifteen minute reprieve, fifteen minutes of sitting in my lobby watching neighbor children arriving home, chatting brightly with their moms or nannies, willing myself to not let envy poison me down to the bones. \n \nI know what Jake-off-the-bus will ask: \"Can I pet Cocoa? Where's Cocoa? Can I pet Cocoa? Where's Cocoa, Mommy? Let's go see Cocoa, Mommy!\" over and over, and over and over. The same every day these days, his obsession wearing a groove in my soul. \n \nIt's nearly all he will talk about, day and night: the cat. The cat, the cat, the cat, thecatcatcatcatcatcatcatcatcatcat; the bloody cat. \n \nI love the cat but I would toss her out the fucking window if that would make Jake stop talking about her. And chasing her around the apartment. And dragging her into his lap to pet her. And petting her sometimes gently and sometimes too roughly, so I never know which it's going to be. \n \nI never know if it's safe to leave her alone with him, and so I have to hover and watch and all the YEARS I've gained of being able to trust that he's pretty much safe in the house so I can watch him loosely and go about my business have to be heaved aside. \n \nI can't leave him alone for a minute or the cat may get inadvertently strangled. Strangled by love and Jake's hands that do not understand you can't carry a REAL cat by the head like you can a stuffed animal. \n \nAnd Jake? He really is a good, compliant child. Jake doesn't want to, but he does his homework. I work hard to maintain a cheery exterior, to praise and smile when inside I am weeping that it is pretty much the same homework he has been doing for the past four years. That he needs a number line to add and subtract, while his twin has moved on to geometry and equations. \n \nAnd then he sculpts this incredibly interesting \"cat-dragon\" out of thera-putty on his five minute break between math and reading. \n \n \nAnd then he reads so beautifully but it is so clear in his cluelessness at answering the questions that he retains so little. And I am now getting envious of all my autism mom friends with \"little professor\" aspie kids who have no social skills, but boy are they academically advanced. \n \nAnd then I feel guilty for wanting my son the be someone other than who he is, and stupid for feeling envy which is the world's most useless emotion and dangerous, too. \n \nAnd then it's time for dinner which I have to make in the kitchen while listening hard for signs of cat torture coming from the living room, but Jake can't find the cat tonight which is somehow worse. \n \n\"Kitty? Kitty where ARE you?\" comes his frustrated cry. \"I can't find Cocoa! The kitty is missing! HELP! HELP!\" he yells, running through our tiny apartment. But Cocoa? She has her hidey-holes for when she simply must get away from Jacob's obsessive love. Lucky cat. \n \nA bit later, Ethan has been picked up from Hebrew school, dinner been wolfed down by hungry growing boys, and Jake is in the bath while Ethan tackles 4th grade math. \n \nJake is having a loud, growly day and I don't know how much more animal-boy I can take. Every answer I give that he doesn't like is met with a loud snarl and hands made claws, his face a grimace. \"I'm a scary monster\" he says \"I'm a vampire.\" Halloween can not fade fast enough. \n \n\"Can I watch TV?\" \n \n\"No Jake, it's bed-time; after your bath is BED.\" \n \nSNARL \n \n\"Can I watch TV?\" \n \n\"No. Bedtime.\" \n \nSNARL  \n \n\"Can I watch TV?\" \n \n\"I am not going to answer that, Jake, you have asked me TEN times in the last two minutes and you know the answer. What's the answer?\" \n \nSNARL \n \n\"Can I watch TV?\"\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nAnd tonight in bed, for maybe the first time in nine years I do not sing to him, I tuck him in and flee. Because he is growling and giggling alternately with every step up the ladder to his top bunk and I know how it's going to go: I will start to sing and he will giggle and growl and I will tell him I can't sing to him if he is isn't quiet and he will stop for a moment and sound so contrite, only to start again a beat later and it will go on and on and on. \n \nSo tonight I don't even begin. \n \nMy head is pounding and I can't. I just. can't. do it. \n \nI call out that I love him on the way down the ladder. I tell him I don't sing to animals and monsters and I leave. And cry. And paste a better face on before entering the living room to snuggle with\u00a0 Ethan and Harry Potter on the sofa.  \n \nThis I can do. Tonight. \n\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "body": "\nIf asked what words come first to mind about my state these days? \n \nGrateful would not be at the top of the list. Probably not even on the first page. \n \nI'm feeling mostly cranky and overwhelmed again; stress-eating everything in sight and barely sleeping. In a word: swamped. In the muck, stuck.  \n \nBut also, the tedium of hashing and rehashing that all out again  here, serving up a steaming plate of my refried misery for you? Done. Overdone. \n \nI want to be moving on. \n \nAren't I always yammering on to Ethan about how happiness hangs upon the scales of gratitude not possession? \n \nTime to practice what I preach.  \n \nSo I will count my blessings instead of listing off my grievances today. (Even though they are many -- chief among them the story of how the hospital tried hard to kill off my mother, the full tale of which will be told when I can do so without being overcome by blind rage.) \n \n Things I am Grateful for: \n \nThis week a number of my sons' friends have had step throat -- I am so glad we don't have that here (yet). \n \n @@@ \nLast week a dear friend's father died quite suddenly, out of the clear blue, while she was traveling with him in India. He was young, vibrant, vital still - 70 - and it was quite a shock to her. \n \nI am so glad that I got to say goodbye to my father, that I got to see him live out the full spate of his years. Even though those last months were so dreadful, we had completed our leave-taking with each other. We had  no unfinished business . I am deeply grateful for this. \n \n @@@  \nFor the past two and a half weeks my mother has been in hospital and rehab unit beds, not her own. Unmoored and unhappy, isolated, alone and often confused when I could not be there (and I could not be there every minute, my children needed me, too.) \n \nI am overwhelmingly grateful that she is finally back home, reconnecting with her life. \n \nThe whole staff of her assisted living community sought me out to tell me how glad they were to have her back, how much they had missed her. Her friends have brought her flowers, come to visit.\u00a0  \n \n \n The three musketeers will ride again! \n I am so grateful that her home is a HOME - full of love and comfort.  \n \n @@@  \nI spent most of the day at my mother's trying to sort out the support services for her continued recovery and reintegration and the tangle of medications added & adjusted during her hospital stay. \n \nBut tonight? Thanks to a friend for lending a babysitter, my husband and I got to go out on a much needed date, the first in a long time (family and work events don't count). \n \nI am grateful for the simple joys of sharing a movie and some sushi with the man I love. \n \n @@@  \nFinally: in the past two years Ethan has chosen to be an obscure Pokemon for Halloween. This required MAJOR costume creation efforts from me with MUCH sewing involved. We're talking ears and tails here, people. \n \nThis year's costume, while equally elaborate has mostly involved acquisition and ASSEMBLY and not much in the way of sewing.  \n \nSo I am very, very grateful for the lack of a TAIL in this year's Halloween costume. (And that elf ears can be BOUGHT ready-made on the internet.) \n \n \n \n 2009 - Lucario - TAIL \n \n \n 2010 - Electabuzz - TAIL \n \n \n 2011 - Link - NO TAIL! \n Feeling righteously full of my Grateful now, it's off to bed... busy weekend coming up, so g'night all!

{"date": "Saturday, October 29, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's  SNSS guest, Kate Coveny Hood blogs at  The Big Piece of Cake . And I love going to read her there (even though I get hungry for pastry every time I do) because she is both a lovely writer and a positive force in the universe. \n \n Kate writes about all about her adventures raising a family - 6 and a half year-old Oliver and his 5 year-old boy/girl twin siblings George and Eleanor. Oliver is the \"special\" child in the family, on the autism spectrum with a PDD-NOS diagnosis. In her blog  Kate is smart and funny and reflective in a way that I just love. \n \n While Kate writes about her son Oliver and his issues, her blog doesn't focus on special needs. Rather, it focuses on \"family\" and sometimes just on \"Kate\" the PERSON. (Imagine that!) \n \n In fact, it wasn't until I asked Kate to write a guest post for this series that she sat down to actively think about what it means to the twins to have a brother who is different. And here are the results...  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Dynamic Family Dynamics  - by Kate Coveney Hood \n \nOften when asked about the level of chaos and drama in my house, I'll say that \"I have a special needs child, an explosive child and a girl.\" That pretty much sums it up. \n \nBut let me backtrack a bit. \n \nI have three children -\u00a0Oliver, my six year old, and George and Eleanor, my five year old twins. And just in case you're wondering - no, that age difference was not planned. Nor was the two-for-one pregnancy.\u00a0But no\u00a0matter how dramatic and chaotic it may be, I never lose sight of how lucky I am to have\u00a0these three entirely unique people in my life - to be able to watch them grow. \n \nLike any other parent, I once looked into\u00a0my children's\u00a0newborn faces and dreamed about their futures. I imagined them\u00a0as\u00a0happy and healthy kids. So close in age, they would be friends. They would grow up together and then\u00a0go on\u00a0to attend college, find careers... have families. \n \nI always knew that they were really just on loan to me. I would raise them, but they would eventually leave to find their own way in the world. And I looked forward to watching it all unfold. \n \nWe\u00a0had some basic expectations for the roles they would play, of course. Oliver would be the big brother, and look out for his not-that-much younger siblings. Eleanor would be a daddy's girl because they\u00a0all are in my husband's\u00a0extended family. George would be the middle child - even though he is only a minute older than his sister - and as\u00a0a\u00a0loud and demanding infant, he\u00a0seemed destined to be a\u00a0handful. \n \nAnd some of this ended up being true. Eleanor is a shameless daddy's girl and George has taken the term \"handful\" to a whole new level. But Oliver is not your average, everyday big brother. He is my special needs child. \n \nThe twins were born when he was 18 months old. And around that time, it was becoming obvious that he was different from other toddlers. His speech wasn't developing with the lightning speed that I witnessed in other kids. He wasn't as social and trusting. He was more interested in throwing blocks in than he was in using them to build towers. \n \nYears later, after special needs preschool and various therapies, Oliver is sweet, handsome boy with severe sensory processing disorders. He\u00a0also has an Autism Spectrum label: PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified). \n \nThe behaviors and challenges that qualify him for a Spectrum label are primarily noticeable in his communication\u00a0and language skills, but he also has\u00a0some more subtle problems with motor skills.\u00a0We've been lucky to find a couple of alternative therapies that\u00a0have\u00a0been nothing short of magic as far as I'm concerned. And Oliver is\u00a0always making progress - moving forward. But it's never fast enough for him to catch up to, let alone keep up with, his peers. \n \nAnd it's not just other kids his age anymore. Oliver is now officially behind the skill levels of his siblings.\u00a0Over time, George and Eleanor\u00a0have become my barometer for what Oliver will hopefully learn how to do. \n \nPeople are confused by our oldest son because he \"looks normal.\"\u00a0But they\u00a0haven't witnessed\u00a0Oliver's daily\u00a0struggles with things that have come so naturally to his brother and sister. Like sustaining conversation, understanding the rules\u00a0in games and making friends. They don't understand why it's George who plays light sabers with the older boys across the street while Oliver plays with Thomas trains in the dirt. It should be the other way around, right? \n \nThey also have no idea how incredibly painful this is to watch. \n \nFor all\u00a0of my love for them as individuals - all of my gratitude for their health and happiness\u00a0- it breaks my heart to see my oldest fade into the background while his younger brother and sister become such stars. To see the babies of the family\u00a0take over so many of the older sibling roles that should have been Oliver's, by right. \n \nAnd I know that sounds\u00a0petty and unfair\u00a0- to expect that the oldest would automatically be the front man\u00a0for the band...the leader of the pack. But that's the typical family dynamic, right? And didn't I expect to have a \"typical\" family? Didn't we all? \n \nSo\u00a0my husband and I have\u00a0had to put aside some of our new parent dreams and expectations for our children - our family. It was hard. And sometimes I still feel a little sad. I worry. \n \nI worry about the near future when the twins start asking questions about why they can do things that their big brother can't. So far, they haven't. They don't compare our family to others.\u00a0It seems normal\u00a0to them that George\u00a0is the one\u00a0who complains about Oliver messing up his...whatever it is he's doing (remember - George is my explosive child, and there's always a crisis). Or for Eleanor to act as spokesperson for\u00a0her big brother\u00a0when people ask him questions he's not yet developmentally\u00a0capable of\u00a0answering. \n \nBut as we become less insular and spend more time with the rest of the world at large,\u00a0it's inevitable that\u00a0my two younger children will wonder why we're different from other families. \n \nTo be perfectly honest, I've avoided thinking about this for a long time. On some level, I've been wishing that Oliver would just become \"normal enough.\" That therapies and IEP reports aside, the kids in our neighborhood - and George and Eleanor - would see him as just another kid. Maybe a little goofy or quirky sometimes - but not so much that he couldn't fly under the radar. \n \nThen maybe someday when Oliver\u00a0would be\u00a0capable of\u00a0engaging in\u00a0a complex discussion, we could all talk about his personal challenges.\u00a0Together as a family -\u00a0with Oliver\u00a0participating in this conversation about him. \n \nIt shouldn't matter, I know. But I just really hate the idea of talking about Oliver to his siblings before I can talk to HIM about everything. I would feel like a betrayal. Like it was now me denying him his right to be the older brother.  \n \nI may have to do that someday - but I'm not ready. Not yet. \n \nIn a way - these ideas are entirely new for our family. We haven't had to think about them. \n \nSo I don't have personal stories to tell about how our children work around the special needs that make Oliver different from other six year olds. As of yet, the twins don't really recognize that Oliver is different. He's just Oliver. And I'm selfishly holding on to that as long as possible with no plan for the future. \n \nUntil now, I guess.\u00a0Until I began writing this and reading about the experiences of other families with \"special needs siblings.\" \n \nI've written numerous posts about Oliver's special needs on my own blog, but this is the first time that I've actually addressed the issue of how those special needs affect his relationships with his siblings. And because I've always taken the Scarlett O'Hara approach of dealing with what I have to today, and leaving the rest for tomorrow - I'm now in uncharted waters. \n \nI love the idea of Oliver being the big brother an taking care of his little brother and sister. But for now, and possibly for a long time (possibly forever) that's not going to be our reality. In a couple of years it may be the younger brother and sister standing between Oliver and bullies on the playground. It's still too soon to tell - but not so far off that I can't imagine that possible future. \n \nWill they stand up for Oliver? I think Eleanor would. As a girl, she has an innate maternal side. She seeks to nurture in a way that her brothers just don't. But George? I don't know about George. \n \nHe is so full of enthusiasm for life, that he doesn't always notice\u00a0other people\u00a0as he races to grab the brass ring. He means well - but he's a scrapper. He may unwittingly\u00a0trample\u00a0Oliver in\u00a0his efforts to follow the\u00a0older boys with their war games\u00a0and skateboard ramps. I just don't know. \n \nBut I do know that this is going to be painful at times... and I would be lying if I said I wasn't terrified by the uncertain future. That I didn't wonder how many more of my dreams that future will will steal from me. \n \nBut I find great comfort in the fact that some of my dreams are already coming true. My children are happy and healthy. They are friends. They are growing up together. They may or may not all go to college, but each one of them can find a purpose in life - something they can consider their career. \n \nProbably the most important dream I have for them is family. The families I once imagined for them included marriage and children. And right now I have no reason to doubt that this is possible for them. For all of them. \n \nMy dream of them all having\u00a0their own families\u00a0might actually come true. And it might not.\u00a0But it doesn't matter because whether they get married or not - have children or not -\u00a0they will always have each other. \n \nThey will  always  be a family. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n I love how much Kate appreciates and values her son's differences, how she hold the bar high in her expectations for his, and all her childrens' future. Also I love (and am a tad envious of) how much her family functions as a coherent unit, caring about and for each other, enjoying each others company and celebrating their uniqueness. Love. \n \n And now that you have read and fallen in love with Kate too, please follow her home to her blog   The Big Piece of Cake .   where her tag line reads: \"Never settle for a small one, and demand a corner piece with a flower\" which I think sums up her wonderful attitude towards life. \n \n Want to get to know her kids better?

Ethan MUST be Link, the legendary warrior from Legend of Zelda.  \n \nWhat the hell is that you ask? You must be old. Like me ;-) (He's a classic Nintendo game character.) \n \nTo get in the mood - and shop for weaponry and other medieval claptrap - we attended the Cloister's annual Medieval Festival.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA castle? Awesome backdrop for swordplay with brothers and found friends. (And yes, in  conversation with this family it came out that one of their boys in  on the spectrum, too. We are everywhere.) \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0 \n \nI have been assembling bits of this and that, here and there, for Ethan's Link  costume since mid-September. And the almost-done costume got a preview  run at NY ComiCon earlier this month, where Cosplay costumers are encouraged. \n \nWhat the hell is  Cosplay  you ask?\u00a0 You must be old. Like me. ;-) (It's  fan based Costume Play - very big in Japanese Manga/Anime circles.)  \n \n \n \n \n Link arrives at ComiCon \n \n \n \n Hanging out with Dad at his booth? Highlight of the show. \n \n \n \n Jake? Wanted to spend the whole day talking with R2D2. \n \n \n \n The WHOLE day. \n \n \n \n Although the AMNH mini-planetarium show was pretty awesome, too. \n \n \n \n And if there is a screen, Jake will watch. \n \n \n \n No, there was not a single shot in which the boys were not making weird faces. At least I look human. \n \nEthan's costume was a big hit at the con, and yes, there were actually some folks who wanted to have their picture taken with \"Link.\" And yes, some of them were GIRLS who pretended to swoon in his presence. Ethan had no idea what to do about that. Yet. (Whew!) \n \n \n \n Ethan taking this \"warrior\" thing a tad seriously \n \nWhen it was all over, walking back toward the center of the city from the western fringes of the Javits Center?  We were a roving band of odd characters.\u00a0 It was lots of fun watching  the double takes from ordinary folks who had no idea ComiCon had been in  town. \n \n \n \n \nAnd below, you will find the referent Link character pic from the video game. Not bad so far, if I may say so myself. Yes, I have a shield to build this week. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJake, on the other hand is content to be Iron Man again! (Yay!) \n \nExcept his last year's costume got completely trashed from playing in it all year, so I have to buy ANOTHER one. (Boo!) \n \nAnd so it goes.... \n \n(And as to why I called this \"Pictureful\" instead of \"Wordless\" Wednesday? I'm guessing you've figured that out by now.) \n \n As usual, I\u2019m linking up to Wordless / Wordful Wednesdays... at  Angry Julie Monday ... at  5 Minutes for Mom ... at  live and love...out loud ... at  Dagmar*s momsense ... at  Parenting by Dummies .   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, October 24, 2011", "body": "\nI have felt for a while now that living my life is (more than) a little bit like being on the rack: pulled in opposing directions most all the time.  \n \nSometimes I feel stretchy, like Gumby and that I can handle it; snap right back into shape once the tension lets up. Other days I feel more fragile, afraid parts of me are starting to break off, hoping that starfish-like I can regenerate new limbs as needed.  \n \nThe forces in action are both ones that I have chosen and those that have been chosen for me. \n \nI have an elderly, widowed mother, who grows more frail of body and mind with each passing month. \n \nMy children at nine are nearing an age when normally there would be a big push toward independence. But of course nothing in our lives is normal or typical, for I have one son on the autism spectrum and the other is high maintenance - very bright with a touch of ADD, which, just to spice things up I have realized I have, too. \n \nWhile this is the pot that is nearly always simmering on my stove, what had brought it all to an over-boil lately is my mother's recent hospitalization that began with a day and night of fun and games  in the emergency room . \n \nThere had been a bad fall. Bones were broken. Mistakes were made in the hospital that took her from bad to worse. Recovery is glacial. Although my mother  is now out of the hospital and in a rehab unit, she needs me still, every day in every way.  \n \nAs do my children. \n \nOne day, sitting by my mother's bedside in the hospital, waiting for her to awaken, confused, in yet another room, I started to write a blogpost that never got finished and has now, of course, lost its timeliness. I would like to share the beginning here though, as it embodies this state I find myself in... \n \n 5 Beds in 5 Days, and very little time in my own. \n \n No, this is not THAT sort of post, the fun kind of post with this  title I might have written had there been blogs and I been blogging in  my 20's. Sorry, folks. \n \n This is, instead, about my mother, still in the hospital, and me feeling hard pressed to be  adequately useful to her and to my children these days. And my husband,  poor man, I am all but completely useless to him right now; he is pretty much  fending for himself until all this insanity dies down. \n \n And then there is me. \n \n Who? \n \n Exactly. \n \nSo there it is in a nutshell. No matter what I do I cannot do all that needs doing - for my children, for my mother, for my husband and for myself. \n \nI am just one person. \n \nAnd so, at this crossroads I have a choice. I can tear myself up feeling inadequate, feeling like I am always less than I need to be, that I can't get anything right. \n \nOr, I can recognize the impossibilities inherent to this situation and simply choose to forgive myself, decide that I do not have to be.. \n \nthe perfect mother... \n \nthe perfect daughter... \n \nthe perfect wife (husband is doing spit take at the notion of this I'm sure). \n \nThere is no perfect me. \n \nExcept, of course, for me. \n \nThe me that I just am. \n \nEnough. \n \nEnough mother (my kids know that I love them) \n \nEnough daughter (my mother looks at me with grateful, tear-shining eyes, every moment we are together) \n \nEnough wife (well, I'm working on this one, my dear husband has gotten the short end of the me-stick for a while now) \n \nEnough me. \n \nSomeday one of these pressures will ease up a bit. \n \nUntil then, I'm just going to have to make do with the rack. \n \n(And how I wish I lived in a  Monty-Pythonian universe  and was being tortured instead with the soft cushions and the comfy chair.)     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I am linking this post up to  Be Enough Me  Mondays over at the wonderful Just.

{"date": "Saturday, October 22, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n I am sorry to say, I don't have a SNSS guest for you here, today. There was a schedule mix-up. And then my crazy life... \n \n My mother having been in the hospital for a week, and now in a rehab facility, ended up requiring hours and hours of my time each day, and has left me functioning on bare minimum efficiency (if even that) in the rest of my life.  \n \n And then there was the BlogHer Writers conference yesterday, which was wonderful and inspirational, but I didn't really have the time to attend. Even though I did.  \n \n All this leads to the matter at hand: I have neither a guest post nor time and brain cells left to write a new one myself. So what I thought I would do is to recycle a post of mine from this past spring that I believe not that many folks got to see... A snapshot of a day in my life with the boys together.  \n \n It's not pretty. The post's original title was \"Fight Club.\"  Read on: \n \n \n@@@@@@@  \n \nI hear the volume increasing, and my stomach tenses. Still, I ignore,  stay turned to the task at hand, dinner in the making: skins thinly  peeled from slices of ripe-bursting peach, rice steamed to softness.  \n \nAnd then the pitch rises again. And the thuds. And the keening. And the  wail. The wail that cannot be ignored: Mooooooooooommmmaaay! \n \nIn their bedroom is a tangled mess of snot and confusion. Jacob with  glasses awry. Ethan with hands on temples, shrieking \u201cHe head butted me,  he head butted me!\u201d \n \nJacob, alternately growling like a caged lion and laughing theatrically,  a perfect rendition of a cartoon villain's  world-destruction-anticipating cackle. Ethan now lurching at his brother  with clenched fists and a growl of his own, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him!\u201d \n \nAnd me? I\u2019m in the middle again; sorting, soothing, trying to make sense  of the senseless. I don\u2019t even bother asking what or who started it,  for these things just start. \n \nEthan is maddened by this idea, full of indignation and bluster, dead  sure of his own absolute blamelessness in the matter. \u201cHe\u2019s the worst,  the meanest brother in the world! He took my Pikachu, he laughed at me  when I tried to take him back!\u201d \n \nI could explain, for the hundred thousand and second time, that there is  not the same purposefulness behind Jacob's actions as there would have  been had Ethan been the perpetrator, that the motivator is not cruelty. \n \nBut why? \n \nEthan knows his brother has autism. He's never going to be happy about it. \n \nOnce again, the physical damage is minimal. The psychic, massive. \n \nEthan\u2019s anger is a wildfire, burns blue-hot, consumes all in its path.  He spits words at Jake through gritted teeth \u201cDo. Not. Laugh. At. Me.  Ever. Again!\u201d Which Jacob, of course, cocooned in his autistic  obliviousness to much that is normal human discourse, finds hysterical.  \n \nJake love, love, loves his brother brimming full like this, is getting  his lasered attention, for once. And just to ratchet up the annoyance  factor? Begins to repeat his usual mispronunciation of his brother\u2019s  name in his most grating sing-song voice: \u201cOh, Eeee-fan\u201d giggle  \u201cEeeeee-fan\u201d giggle. \n \nIf glares could kill, Ethan would be the only man standing. \n \nThoughts of dinner temporarily abandoned, separate them I must. Jake to  remain in their room, Ethan to come with me into my bedroom; to float in  the middle of my big bed, try to find his calm, regain his rudder. \n \nSponge Bob on the TV providing perfect distraction, I return to the  scene of the crime, find Jacob rubbing the spot on his shin that will  surely sprout a game-token sized plum splotch by bath time. \n \nMystery bruises his usual specialty, at least this time I know the culprit: bed-frame. \n \n\"Are you Okay, Jake?\" I ask.  \n \n\"Efan was MAD!\" he says with glee. \n \n\"Yes.\" I agree, breathe deep, dive into an explanation made as simple as  can be, but still fitting the bill. \"When you took his toy he got mad.  And when you laughed about it he got madder. It's mean to laugh at  people when they are mad or sad, Jake. Do you want to be mean?\" \n \nAnd then he's got his contrite face on. The one he pulls up when he  knows he's done something wrong, but can't understand for beans  precisely what. \"No\" he answers, fairly sure that this is the right  answer, the one that will grant him hugs and cuddles, absolve him of all  transgressions. \n \nAnd it does. \n \n\"Come here, honey,\" I say as he climbs into my lap, my eight year-old,  eighty pound toddler.\u00a0 I put some music on the radio and we sway  together for a minute, but stomachs are grumbling and dinner sits,  bereft, barely halfway complete. \n \nEthan's laughter trickles through my bedroom doorway, mood lifted by the  magic of television, as I make my way back to the kitchen, to settle  once again into the rhythms of cooking. \n \nThen, to pick up the scattered fragments, to shake the jangly shards of our family back into a familiar shape. \n \nDinnertime. \n \nLet's eat. \n \n \n \n@@@@@@@\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n That's all folks. A real guest next week, I promise! \n \n Also? Last week's WONDERFUL SNSS guest post,  The Bucket and the Mandrake,  inexplicably didn't get any comments.

{"date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nSo, this week I actually got to hang out with the lovely Fadra - who runs & hosts this whole Stream of  Consciousness Sunday shindig - at the BlogHer Writers Conference here in NYC. \n \nHow could I not do a SOCS post after that? Inconceivable! (Yes, I watched Princess Bride again with my kids last week. So you should hear that last word in your head being rendered by Wallace Shawn. With a lisp.) So here it is: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nI spent all day Friday with my true tribe - writer/bloggers - at the first ever (hopefully becoming annual) BlogHer Writers conference. There was so much useful informatiuon and so many amazing conversations going on all day (and at the cocktail reception the evening before) that my brain feels about to explode. \n \nAnd I am still digesting most of it. But if there is one message I took away from the conference? It was this: \n \n JUST. FUCKING. WRITE. \n \nAnd then? Re-write. And trash whatever is not wonderful (even if its 80%) and re-write again. Make it great.  \n \nAnd don't put ALL of it up on your blog. Because if you want to be published elsewhere, to SELL your words, it has to be new & fresh content. So you can't give it all away first. \n \nAlso? It helps to have an agent. As in, if you don't have one you are 99% of the time totally screwed. But also? If your writing is good? You will find an agent. When you are READY. \n \nAnd being ready? means that you have followed the above directives and have an actual COMPLETED book in your hands when you contact them. \n \nFor fiction & memoir that is (memoir being narrative and sold / bought like fiction). For non-fiction you \"just\" need three sample chapters and a kick-ass book proposal. \n \nANd, to get the attention of an agent?\u00a0 It helps to have credibility. A track record. Which means articles sold to magazines or stories / essays published in literary journals.  \n \nHmmm, a lot more hard work and commitment than just spewing out a post and slapping it up on the old blog, huh? \n \nYup! (ANd yeah, other than these Sundays I don't usually just spew, I AM a change-the-word-ten-times-until-I've-got-the-one-I-like-best perfectionist writer. Guilty as charged.) \n \nSo I've got a lot to contemplate. Because the instant gratification of writing and posting, being my own publisher? Pretty intoxicating. Works for me so far. \n \nBut also? I have a book in me. a few books actually. And I'm thinking they want out.... \n \n \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.    No   proofreading or spell-checking. This is writing in the raw. \n \n You can do it, too!\u00a0 Click on the picture link and let's hear your 5 minutes of brilliance... \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Amherst. A quintessential New Englandy, uber-collegey college town.  \n \nNew England exists for Autumn. \n \nThe Summers are hotter and more stiflingly humid than you would think, the Springs often mud bogged and shockingly brief. Winters too cold and long, of course; weeks of gray February skies that bind the soul in melancholy. \n \nAnd then there is Autumn, New England\u2019s glory and redemption. \n \nMaple covered hills wait all year for it. Sun warmed days and crisping breath-visible nights, the air crackling clear enough to cause humbling by the plenitude of stars upon stepping out into the night, on your way home from that final beer at the campus tavern. \n \nThere is always one day. One day that astonishes, when the chlorophyll has given up the ghost and called a mass retreat.  \n \nOne morning, my first college fall, I woke up and looked out the window and thought \u201cNo, I am still asleep and dreaming that I have awakened, because this is not planet Earth, as trees just do not come in that color.\u201d \n \nThey were hot pink. Fuchsia. \n \nAll of them. \n \nAs far as I could see.  \n \nAll as deep and bold and saturated a pink as the wedding dress I had bought to marry Dan in, that my friends told me I simply couldn\u2019t wear and made me exchange for the cornflower blue. (But this is yet years into my future; unimaginable to my college self.) \n \nI went right up to the window, cocked my head left, looked to the mountains, beyond the bowl of fuchsia surrounding. I could see reds, oranges, golden yellows and ashen browns; spots of green, deep and piney, too. Autumn.  \n \nIllusion broken. Earthbound, I remained.  \n \nBut breathless, nonetheless; in awe of nature\u2019s unnatural day-glow splendor, and magnificent, yet ephemeral, beauty. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  Write on Edge .

I had found out about the basketball league at one of the regular monthly informational meetings that Michaela organizes. \n \n Her blog  The Foorce  (a fun play on her name) is mostly focused on providing support and resources for our local New York City special needs community, but is also a place where Michaela shares some of her personal story from time to time. \n \n She is the mother of three children: 11 year-old James and his two young sisters. James has a rare chromosome defect which has resulted in numerous medical issues,  global developmental and physical delays, and labels such as PDD-NOS,  Sensory Integration Dysfunction and ADD.  \n \n Chances are, if you have a special needs child(ren), they have at least something in common with James. I can tell you firsthand he is a delightful boy with a huge heart and I was always happy when he and Jake were paired up together in basketball practice. \n \n Read on, now, for a glimpse into Michaela's wonderful family, a pair of life-slices that add up to a beautiful thought:  \n \n @@@@@@@ \n The Bucket and the Mandrake: Two Small Stories, One Big Lesson  - by Michaela Searfoorce \n \n\"Mom, help!\" \n \nJames looked tearfully after the preschooler who was sauntering away with his bucket. Though he is 11 years old now, James is unable to stick up for himself in many circumstances, even with children half his size and age. \n \nAfter asking politely (meekly, in my opinion) for his bucket back, the boy who grabbed it said \"no\" and walked over to the other sand area, leaving James to dig around pathetically in the sand with his shovel. I could tell he was upset, both frustrated and embarrassed by his fear of confronting the other child. \n \n\"Give James his bucket back right now!\" \n \nNo, that wasn't me. It was my 2 yr old daughter, jumping down from a nearby jungle gym and charging after the offender. She reached him and ripped the bucket from his hand, yelling \"Leave my brother alone. That's his bucket!\" \n \nThe boy stood there, mouth hanging open. So did I. My daughter marched the bucket back to James and proudly announced, \"Here James. Here is your bucket! It's okay!\" James wiped his eyes and said gratefully, \"Thanks, Margaret.\" \n \n ~~~ \n\"Mom, help! No - don't do it!\" \n \nFlash forward to the Harry Potter exhibit in Times Square. I had decided to brave the trip alone while Ryan was at work, and as a consequence was having trouble keeping as close an eye on both James and my 2 year old as I would've liked. \n \nThe exhibit was a cool collection of trinkets, costumes and props from the Harry Potter series. James has read all of the books, seen all of the movies, and was even Harry Potter for Halloween last year - I fully expected him to be in love with the place. And he was, aside from some initial anxiety when the sorting hat was placed on peoples heads and loudly started sorting them into Hogwarts houses. \n \nAbout halfway through the exhibit, Margaret and I were standing by the mandrakes while she eagerly pulled each model plant out of the soil to hear it screech. \n \nFor those of you who are not Potter fan(atic)s, mandrakes are small, ugly potted creatures that live in the soil - when you pull them out they emit a cry that renders a person immobilized. Full grown mandrake cries will kill you (don't worry, I'm not ruining a big part of any book!), and in the books students would wear special head gear in order to protect themselves. \n \nSo when James saw Margaret across the room, gleefully pulling mandrakes from the soil to listen to their cries, he flew into a total panic. He ran to the far side of the exhibit (self preservation) while screaming, \"No! No Margaret! Stop touching them! Mom! Help Margaret! Don't do it, Margaret!\" \n \nEveryone froze at the sound of the screams. Tourists young and old looked around the room for \"Mom,\" probably wondering whether this was part of the show or if this large pre-teen was actually terrified of a fake potted plant. \n \nI rushed over and explained to James that they weren't real and that it was okay to pull the mandrakes out, but he wouldn't hear of it. He remained hysterical until we moved Margaret out of danger. \n \nFive minutes later they were both throwing quaffles at quidditch posts. (I don't have time to explain everything about Harry Potter here!) \n ~~~ \nI know that some day Margaret will bear the brunt of the \"hero responsibility.\" At 2 years old she already looks out for James in a way that makes me proud. \n \nBut, it is my most sincere hope that when she's older she will still be able to remember these times when James bravely tried to come to her rescue as well. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Reading this lovely post, I found myself once again wishing I had somehow  been  magically able to provide Jake with a little sister to look up to and after him. \n \u00a0  \n And then I read some of Michaela's \"Patience and Foortitude\" posts on her blog about the challenges of life with a big special needs kid, a toddler and a baby... and I rethought that one. \n \n Having had a little glimpse into  Michaela 's family here, you should definitely follow her home to her blog,  The Foorce ,  to read more. If you are New York City local, read it all, there's some great resources there. If you're from elsewhere and want to skip the local stuff,, the posts in the \" General \" category are where you'll find the personal, family ones.\u00a0  \n \n Start here with this one, about a particularly exhausting evening:   Patience and Foortitude, Part 3: Just Foortitude This Time, With Special Guest Appearance By\u00a0Windex\u00a0  (and yes, I've finally found someone who makes my often long post titles seem pithy). \n \n Also, try this post about a milestone -  riding a Ferris Wheel  - that may seem small to some, but we special needs parents know better.\u00a0 Or this one, a letter of appreciation on  James's 11th birthday .\u00a0  \n \n Finally, if you want further proof of what a supermom Michaela is, read this pair of posts about James's  heartbreaking  massive \"poop incident\" at his school  (due to his medical issues) and how his mom  talked to his inclusion class about it  (and answered other questions about James' differences) so that he would be safe retuning to the school, afterward. \n \n Thank you so much,  Michaela , for sharing your wonderful son James, and the rest of your lovely, special family with us today. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, October 8, 2011", "body": "\n \n I don't know how to properly introduce today's SNSS guest blogger, to convey her awesomeness. She is Amy Hillis of the blog  Transplanted Thoughts. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Amy is an amazing mother and a wonderful, moving writer. She has also been through more tragedy than any other person I know, and somehow still finds life entertaining and amusing.\u00a0 \n \n What do I mean by tragedy? Amy has had seven children. Five of them are still living. The other two have been lost to the same rare genetic disorder that affects two out of her three still living younger children (the eldest two, from her first marriage, are now grown).\u00a0 \n \n When Amy began her blog, her youngest son David was sickly, but still alive, and those of us who read her followed along with his final days, filtered through Amy's anguished posts. He spent the last 5 months of his short life in the hospital, his mother by his side. \n \n Theirs is obviously an intense environment, and yet Amy works hard to bring much balance and order, normalcy, joy and a sense of purpose into their lives.\u00a0  \n \n Read Amy's moving words, here, now, as she  writes about the sometimes rocky relationship between Jacob, her  unaffected son and his just-a-bit-younger brother, Jonathan, who is often ill: \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Walking the Line  - by Amy Hillis \n \nOctober 10th is a big day in our house. \n \nIt's the anniversary of my middle son's liver transplant. This year marks 6 years since he was given a second chance at life. Jonathan was born with a rare genetic liver disorder called citrullinemia. The only 'cure' - a liver transplant. \n \nThe road for Jonathan has been bumpy - speech delays, IEP's, hospitalizations and illnesses that 'normal' healthy kids would never have to deal with. \n \nHis older brother doesn't see the struggles that Jonathan has endured. Jacob only sees how much attention Jonathan receives. \n \nSpeech therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, home-care nurses, doctor's visits and time off of school. \n \nAnd to rub it in a little bit more - cupcakes and celebrations on a day that's not his birthday or Christmas. \n \nWhen the boys were smaller and Jonathan had to be hospitalized, Jacob would spend his time at Grandma's house. At first he loved going to Grandma's, but as he got older he began to see it as a punishment, as an unfair consequence of his little brother being sick again. \n \nIt was during this time that Jacob started to express a lot of anger towards his little brother. He would take toys away from him, hit him and yell in his face when he was unhappy about something Jonathan had done.  \n \nIt was such a trying time on so many levels. Helping Jacob to not feel lost in the shuffle became just as important as getting Jonathan well again. \n \nSimple things, like extra cuddle time, one-on one reading time or big boy 'perks' like being able to stay up later or having first choice on movie night. These things became part of our daily routine in an attempt to curb some of the anger and hostility that Jacob felt towards Jonathan. \n \nAs the boys have gotten older, balancing the needs of each has been like walking a tightrope. Each one crying \"Unfair!\" when they think the other is getting the lion's share of the attention. \n \nFortunately the further out Jonathan gets with his transplant, the less and less time we spend in the hospital, at doctor's appointments and with therapists. Outside of the everyday quarrels that 2 boys born not quite 2 years apart encounter, most of the perceived slights happen on days like October 10th. \n \nA day I choose to celebrate even though at not quite 7, Jonathan doesn't comprehend why it's such a special day for him and for us. We celebrate because I want both boys to honor the life that was given and the life that was lost. \n \nIt opens up discussions on the season ahead. On being thankful for what we have and living our lives to the best of our abilities. \n \nJacob has worked through most of his anger towards his little brother. He is shouldering the responsibility of being the 'big' brother, the one who should take care of the younger boys, with great pride. \n \nI see an empathetic young man emerging from the shell of the little boy who once cried \"Unfair!\" at being the one who stood in the shadow of his little brother. \n \nI want to thank Varda for asking me to share a piece of our story for SNSS. Sometimes the ones left at home to carry on the every day have a harder job than the ones working through the illnesses and therapies. \n \nGiving a voice to both can do amazing things. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n I am often amazed by Amy, how she carries on with life amidst the loss. She feels and acknowledges her sadness but isn't engulfed and destroyed by it, somehow manages to be there, fully present for her still living children who need their mother as much as ever. \n \n What is most inspiring about her is her realness, and her willingness to share that with her readers. We see that she is some days sad and mad but also loving, humorous and even grateful. \n   \n Now that you have read Amy here, you are surely going to want to follow her home to her  blog  Transplanted Thoughts  and read more of her family's story and her beautiful writing. \n \n If you want to know about what happened to her first son with citrullinemia ,  who lived only 5 days as the doctors puzzled out what was wrong with him, read this post here:  Introductions .  \n \n For an incredibly touching and sad moment when Amy's son talks with her about missing his baby brother David, and wants to make sure he is being looked after in heaven, read this one:  Moon Talk  (warning have hanky ready). \n \n And then, because her tag line IS \"Life's still funny\" try this funny post about her sons'  Sailor-speak  (something I think all of us with boys will relate to).  \n \n Amy would also like it if you would come stalk her on Twitter, where she tweets as  @transplantedx3  and on her  Facebook Fan page ,\u00a0 \n \n Thank you so much Amy, for bringing your beautiful words to SNSS today. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

But she also has much in common with a very different segment of the Special Needs parenting population, too.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n That is because not only are Bonnie's identical twin sons on the autism spectrum, but they also have a genetic condition:  Fragile X Syndrome . \n \n Bonnie writes all about life with  her    6 year-old twins  and their  older sister  in her blog,  The Fragile X Files,  with love, compassion and honesty.\u00a0 \n \n Her wonderful boys are especially challenging, with aggressive behaviors born of their deep anxieties, major sensory issues and tremendous struggles with communication and language. Her older daughter Aliza is an amazing girl, compassionate and caring with her brothers, a mini-therapist, a true friend.\u00a0 \n \n Come read as Bonnie beautifully shares her family,  bound by fierce love and loyalty,  with us here, today: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Fragile Brothers, Strong Sister  - by Bonnie \n \nI have identical twin boys with Fragile X Syndrome and autism.\u00a0 They are six years old.\u00a0 Fragile X is the most common known genetic cause of autism.\u00a0 They are adventurous, hyperactive, adorable, aggravating, sweet, affectionate, anxiety-ridden, and very special. \n \nBut this isn't about them.\u00a0 It's about their 8-year-old sister, Aliza. \n \nAliza's sibling experience is quite a bit different from most of her friends'.\u00a0 Her brothers don't play with her much.\u00a0 They don't tease her or mess up her room.\u00a0 They don't take her toys. \n \nThey do pinch and sometimes bite her.\u00a0 They scream and demand to get their way and usually they get it, because they are louder and more stubborn than she is, and let's face it - there are two of them. \n \nShe sees the world quite a bit differently than most kids.\u00a0 You know \"Welcome to Holland?\"\u00a0 She knows Holland inside and out.\u00a0 She knows what sensory processing disorder is.\u00a0 She knows what an IEP is.\u00a0 She knows the procedures for ABA (applied behavioral analysis).\u00a0 She knows hyperactivity when she sees it. \n \nOther little girls like to play \"mommy\" or \"doctor\" or \"school\" with their dolls and their friends.\u00a0 Aliza plays \"occupational therapist.\" \n \nShe's extremely perceptive.\u00a0 Her brother Zack has a tendency to reach out to strangers in stores, and pinch their arms.\u00a0 If he's within reach of someone, more than likely they will be a target.\u00a0 Aliza knows this and when we are shopping, she'll discretely put herself between Zack and other shoppers.\u00a0 She does this, knowing he might very well just pinch her. \n \nI can't tell you how my heart bursts when I see her do this.\u00a0 Without my even asking her to.\u00a0 I'm so proud of her I could explode. \n \nSometimes they are a real drag on her good times.\u00a0 We end up leaving parks and malls and parties early because her brothers can't tolerate crowded or loud places.\u00a0 I have tried volunteering at her school a couple of times when I had to bring the boys along, but they screamed, and it embarrassed her.  \n \nI didn't plan for her to be the big sister of kids with special needs. But, planned or not, she's taken to that role pretty well.\u00a0 She not only reaches out to her brothers to play with them the way they play, but she helps them to find their way in this not-always-accepting-of-differences kind of world. \n \nHer dad and I, along with her grandparents, work hard to make sure she feels special too, and gets plenty of opportunities to live her life fully, despite the ways her brothers disabilities limit our family.\u00a0 Whenever possible, we take two cars to every event and outing.\u00a0 If the boys have to leave, one of us stays with Aliza. \n \nWe try to make sure she gets to have as normal a life as possible. \n \nEven though some days it's anything but. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Reading this post, I must admit to feeling no small part of envy for how sensitive and caretaking of her brothers Aliza is. I know that every family is unique and that an older sister and a twin brother are very different entities.\u00a0 \n \n But still, I only hope that some day Ethan can follow in her footsteps, that he will feel more empathy and less antipathy for his brother.\u00a0 \n \n Having read Bonnie here, you'll want to follow her home to her blog,  The Fragile X Files,  and have a good read. \n \n You may want to start with this moving post about how in the world to answer people who ask  \"How are the Boys doing?\" \n \n Or try this beautiful tribute to Aliza and her  sisterly skills , or this lovely post about taking care of her sons, a meditation on  sensory brushing . \n \n Also, you should go follow Bonnie on Twitter where she tweets as  @FragileXFiles  and come like her  Facebook Fan Page , too. \n \n Thank you so much, Bonnie, for this sharing of your lovely, special family with us today. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, September 27, 2011", "body": "\n \nMe? I am not by nature a brawler, a fight-picker; someone fond of my own angry self. I'm a conciliator, a peacekeeper. I really dislike confrontation, have been accused of avoiding it by sidling away, like a smiling crab doing the side-step. \n \nBut somehow, as I sit down to write a lovely \"just write\" post tonight? I can't do it. I have no lyrical in me. I find myself steaming and gunning the throttle. Again. \n \nMaybe I need to start a theme day...\u00a0 Cranky Rant Tuesdays. \n \nMy tag line? \"Come visit my blog on Tuesdays when you want to feel better about YOUR life by reading about all that's gone pear shaped in MINE!\"  \n \nThink it will catch on? Hmmm. \n \nSo, you may be asking yourself (those who aren't backing away slowly, that is)... What has my knickers all in a bunch? My panties in a twist? My... well, you get the picture.... \n \nHealth Insurance idiocy. Also Big Pharma greed. And Chain Pharmacy stupidity and incompetence.  \n \nOK, now it's time for my Canadian/English/Irish/Australian/Norwegian/etc.etc. friends and readers to snicker and gloat. Yes, all of you who live in those godforsakencommunist countries that have - GASP! - socialized medicine.... go ahead, I'll wait. \n \nOK, done now? Good, let's get on with it. \n \nFirst the set up: My son Jacob takes a number of psychoactive medications. He's on a \"cocktail.\"\u00a0 Sounds fancy, but it's not. He's just... complicated in his neuro-biological differences. And so the help needs to be complex, too. Really. \n \nAnd with a very intelligent intelligence at the wheel, prescribing and tinkering. We (very luckily) have that. \n \nAnd the 3 different medications  he's currently on (very low doses, all, don't worry)? Are keeping him rolling along beautifully right now. Calm, happy; NOT riddled with anxiety and gnashing his teeth; NOT crumpling into a sodden weepy heap over a dropped pencil. And also WITH increased concentration and attention; able to really listen and learn better than ever. (Spitting over left shoulder 3 times and warding off the evil eye.) \n \nSo, we recently needed to change health insurance policies (due to an expiring COBRA situation). My husband and I are both freelance / self-employed. We pay for our insurance ourselves. You can see where I'm going here, yes? There really are only lousy overpriced policies available for people like us. And we picked the best of that bad bunch. But still... \n \nWe are now in the situation where the medicines that Jacob has been prescribed and HAS BEEN TAKING, the ones that are demonstrably working for him, are needing to be \"pre-approved\" by the insurance company. \n \nYeah, that's as much fun as that sounds.  \n \nAnd the approval process? So NOT what was described to me by the pharmacist: \"Have your doctor call this number and explain why it needs to be, and they'll approve the medication.\" As if. \n \nWhen the doctor called me back after my frantic message, I could hear the stress, the weariness in his voice. He told me that it's not just \"a phone call\" that's required, but rather it's TEN phone calls. And being transferred from department to department, and being put on hold, and hung up on. And then calling back, and being transferred again. \n \n\"They make it hard on us doctors on PURPOSE, to discourage us from prescribing certain medications -- the newer, still patented ones. They think we'll give up and pick something older and cheaper -- even if it's inappropriate for the patient -- just to avoid the hassle and time drain. It's harassment and coercion, pure and simple.\"  \n \nAnd then this time it wasn't just a conversation, but FIVE full pages of paperwork he had to fill out - questionnaires and ESSAYS to write to justify giving this medication over others which are in the same CATEGORY as the one the doctor had prescribed but are truly DIFFERENT medicines. \n \nBecause a bunch of accountants' opinions about what  medicines my autistic son needs to be taking count SO MUCH more than  those of his highly regarded pediatric psycho-pharmacologist who has  been practicing for a bazillion years and regularly lunches with and  picks the brains of the guys who literally WROTE THE BOOKS on most  childhood psychiatric & developmental issues and are at the forefront of all the cutting  edge research.  \n \n(Sorry, I shout a lot in ALL CAPS when I'm truly peeved. And I'm truly peeved, in case you hadn't noticed.) \n \nThis was all today. \n \nYesterday it was me showing up the local D-R pharmacy counter at 6:15 to pick up a medication we had run out of, that Jake needed THAT NIGHT to find a long line of unhappy people, EVERY ONE having trouble with their prescriptions being filled properly. \n \nAnd I was only AT the motherfucking D-R because they (and other big chains like them) had effectively closed down all the small family run pharmacies in the nearby neighborhood where the pharmacist KNOWS you and gives a rat's ass about your family. \n \nNow, being all sensible-like, I had called at 5 PM and spoken with the pharmacist there to make SURE  they had gotten the script called in and that I could pick it up right away. I was told yes, definitely in. He had  me hold on while he checked to make sure it was in stock (it was),  told me they were busy and to come for it after 6. Took Jake's birth date  info.  \n \nBut when\u00a0 I get to the front of the line? No filled bottle waiting for me, no prescription sitting in the in-box waiting to be filled. Seemingly no record of it being called in at all. Questions of my sanity ensued... am I CERTAIN it was THIS D-R and not the one up the road? YES! \n \nAnd not only had they no record of my doctor calling in the prescription, but they had no record of my son Jacob in their computer. Which is quite odd since we've been having prescriptions filled there since the boys were BORN, 9 years ago. \n \nOh, what was that? Since they merged with another Pharmacy Giant and put in a new computer system a few weeks ago it WIPED OUT all their patient and medication data and now EVERY patient is considered a new patient and they have no history on anyone. Nice going, guys. Well done! \n \nWould I please step aside and wait while they try to find  Jimmy Hoffa  my son's prescription. \n \nFinally the pharmacist that had taken my call and gone off shift at 5:30 returned the page and straightened it out... the prescription (unfilled) was sitting on the back counter, face DOWN. Because it couldn't be entered into the computer, because they didn't have Jake's info in the computer, because he's a \"new patient.\"\u00a0 Riiiight.  \n \nSo it's going to take ANOTHER HALF HOUR to get him into the computer and get the prescription filled. And can I stand over there with the growing crowd of fuming customers to wait, please. \n \nAnd then? After that fun-filled 1/2 hour? \n \nTHAT'S when I find out that it's not automatically covered on our new, stinky plan. That it needs to be \"pre-approved\" with a call from my now-closed doctor's office to the insurance company's bean counting gate-keepers.\u00a0 \n \nOr? I can pay retail... $266. \n \nMotherfuckers. \n \nAnd do you know? It's really not a new medication at all. It's a new formulation of an OLD one that has been around for years. But someone figured out how to make a really good time release delivery method for it. So THAT'S the part that's patented. That's why it's so much $$. \n \nAnd if my son is going to take this medication, he really needs a steady supply in his blood stream, I really can't give him 6 pills a day at four hour intervals, waking him up in the middle of the night for meds now, can I? \n \nSo, yes, he NEEDS this expensive time release formulation. Which is THIS expensive because... they think can get away with it. \n \nAND THEY DO.  \n \nMy son needs his evening and morning dose. \n \nI get them to break up the prescription and sell me 2 pills at retail.  \n \nI go home, crisis averted.  \n \nAnd yes, I may have exploded a few times in the drug store. Especially when they pretty much accused me of hallucinating the 5 pm conversation with their other pharmacist. \n \nAnd, yes, some of this is my own damn fault for waiting until the very last minute to get the refill, turning something that should have been an annoyance into a crisis. That's ADD's calling card there, folks. \n \nAnd did I mention that during all of this the kids were being watched by the upstairs neighbors, because Jake was still finishing his dinner and they really didn't want to come out to the store with me, and I was only going to be gone 15 minutes? \n \nYeah. I owe them. Big time. \n \nOK, rant essentially over. Jets cooling now.... \n \nAnd that concludes today's edition of Cranky Rant Tuesdays at The Squashed Bologna. \n \nTune in next week folks, to hear all about the \"check engine light\" in our 1997 Toyota that just won't stay off. \n \n(Don't you just wish you were me, now?)  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

A love to counter the fear, the hate. \n \nXenophobia is all around us, it seems, built into our psyches, a part of the genome, holdover from our collective ancestral heritage, our hunter gatherer days when strangers brought danger and death with them more often than not, competitors for scarce resources. \n \nBehaviors are somehow adaptive, help the survival of a species or they die out.\u00a0 (Yes, I'm an evolutionist. Because I am not crazy.) So once it served a purpose. \n \nBut we live in another world, now, where our tribe is actually the entirety of the human race. And we may find ourselves to have more commonality with someone from across the globe than  across the street. \n \nBut it doesn't always come naturally, this comfort with the strange and different, it often has to be taught. And so I am trying to teach my sons through word and deed. Although Jacob, in his own way is also my teacher in this, being essentially  colorblind  and delighted by all that is new. \n \nAnd while the official definition of xenophobia cites: \"a fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers or of that which is foreign or strange,\" how it manifests here in melting pot America, often cuts around the lines of race, as much as culture, and where and how we cross them. Or not. \n \nSo, yes, I guess I'm talking about race again. And racism, of course. I think about it a lot. And since  Mocha Momma  asked us to stop being silent, I've been  talking about it , here, too. Just the tip of the iceberg, but you have to start somewhere. \n \nAnd I know a white girl talking about race is not always welcome, sometimes suspect. But that's OK, I'm willing to take whatever comes out of opening up the dialogue here. Because to remain silent is to collude with the forces of fear and ignorance. \n \nI have a friend who has raised four children in this city, mostly because it is the best place for them to be exposed to the full panoply of humanity and cultures. She has given me wise counsel on how to counter the fear kids often have of difference, how to cajole them out of their nascent xenophobia. \n \nHer friends and acquaintances are black white Asian mixed-race gay straight Jewish Christian Muslim abled and differently-abled. As are mine. As are her children's. As are my chidren's. \n \nEspecially because I have a child who is different, other, often seen as strange? Working hard to create an environment of tolerance and acceptance, a community that crosses lines, is not only a nice ideal; it is vital. And it's personal. \n \n Xenophilia : [zee-nuh-fil-ee-uh]\u00a0 \u2014  noun \u00a0  \nan attraction to foreign peoples, cultures, or customs. \n \u2014 antonym : xenophobia  \n \nJust think for a moment about what our world would look like if I could be granted my wish: a magic wand that turns phobia into philia. \n \nSwish. \n \nA small alphabetic and phonemic transformation, 2 letters in all. \n \nBut a universe of difference in meaning and manifestation. With the potential to transform the world. \n \nBecause at the core of war sits xenophobia, working its poison, seeking destruction of the different, the \"other.\"  \n \nBecause me, I'll take love over hate any day. \n \nAnd the world that I want to live in, the world that I want for my children? \n \nChooses love, too. \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock's  Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And X? Hardest damn letter in the English language to come up with a good word to riff off of. Xylophone? Xanthosis? Xiphoid?    Give me a break. \n   \n \n \n Looking for comments?

A lot. \n \nWith my kids. \n \nWith my husband. \n \nAnd especially with myself. \n \nThis Sunday morning, things went a bit awry with Jacob's just-woken-up-and-kind-of-groggy first-thing-in-the-morning pee.  \n \n\"I'm wet\" he called out to me from the bathroom. As I helped him strip off his soggy PJs, I answered his request for \"dry pajamas, please Mom\" with the rejoinder that since he was getting up anyway, it was best to get dressed for the day, that he should go to the living room and I would bring his clothes in there. \n \n\"I want pajamas\" he said.

I got all practical on him, reminded him it wasn't HE who did the mountains of laundry every week, and I'd be bringing him soft shorts and a T-shirt which were just like pajamas, anyway. \n \nI stepping into the living room, clothes in hand, to find tears streaming down my sweet boy's face. \"I want pajamas, Mom\" he wailed, \"I want to play computer in pajamas.\" \n \nNow, I knew some of this was autistic rigidity. That the recent tradition of my early-rising boy getting to play undisturbed on the computer for an hour or so while the rest of us lazy sods got an extra hour of sleep on Sunday mornings was somehow tied into wearing his pajamas in his mind -- while getting dressed was probably tied to being rushed through his morning breakfast and hustled downstairs to meet the school bus. \n \nAnd like a good Autism Mom, I usually try to break up rigidities before they ossify. And just as I was about to get all hard-line with my boy I looked into his eyes, saw how much this meant to him, how much he didn't understand about why I wanted him in clothes. \n \nAnd I just couldn't do it. \n \nHow important was this battle, anyway?  \n \nAnd isn't there something thoroughly delicious about lounging around in pajamas of a Sunday morning? And something about donning clothes that says one has to get down to business and be productive? \n \nJake understood this. He wanted a REAL Sunday morning. In pajamas.  \n \nI hugged him. \n \nI dried his tears with the hem of my nightgown. \n \nI brought him a clean set of PJs. \n \nI set aside my critical mind, the one that said that was ANOTHER pair of pajamas I'd have to wash on Tuesday. \n \nSo what. \n \nI chose kindness. \n \nToday was a busy day full of to-ing and fro-ing and the thousand little errands that just suck all the time out of a day. \n \nJake had an early morning dental appointment, so I had to bring him with me to drop Ethan off at school, then take him on the subway all the way downtown to HIS school after the dentist. \n \nI had groceries to buy, prescriptions to drop off, prescriptions to pick up. I had to pick up some cheap bathmats to replace the ones the cat keeps peeing on. Etc. Etc. Etc. \n \nYou know the kind of day. \n \nIn the middle of of it all, I am power-walking past the fancy-shmancy make-up store  bluemercury  on Broadway, when I suddenly feel compelled to stop in to shpritz myself with \"Beach\" (yes, the same perfume & store that inspired my  Coppertone  story). \n \nI am, as usual, make-up less and slightly bedraggled (though, I proudly brag, freshly showered, whoo-hoo!) It is empty inside the store, a slow Monday, so the crew eyeing me up and down very politely ask if I would like a free \"freshen up\" with the make-up artist. \n \nI'm about to decline, no time, no inclination, when I take a pause. My critical mind is telling me I have 997 errands left, it is telling me that even with all the make-up in the world I will still be overweight and 51 years old. That no one but the cat and my kids is going to see me in my lovely done-up state (the effects having long worn off by the time my husband gets home late from work). \n \nBut then I shove all that aside and I think: \"Why not?\"  \n \nI think: \"Someone wants to give me something. I get to sit and be pampered for five, maybe ten minutes. Why the hell not?\" \n \nSo I say \"Yes.\" \n \n\"Yes\" to the universe. \n \n\"Yes\" to me. \n \nAnd, of course, it turns out not just about how a little concealer, eye shadow and lip gloss can make me look like I actually get enough sleep. \n \nIt turns out that, if you  listen , everybody has a story. \n \nI sat and chatted with the make-up artist, a lovely man named Tony, while he did his magic.  \n \nAnd, me being me, I'm talking about my kids. And autism. \n \nAnd wouldn't you know that Tony has a young cousin on the autism spectrum, a girl. And wouldn't you know that he has a brother with cerebral palsy. So he is a  special needs sibling , himself. \n \nAnd we talk about group homes and caretaking and independence. And elderly parents. \n \nWhich proves you can have a real conversation anywhere, even in this chancel of artifice.  \n \nAnd, yes, I buy a few small things - that concealer really was MAGIC. (You want to know? T. LeClerc. Tres French. Tres chic.) \n \nAnd I walk out of there feeling, well, refreshed. Glad I took a moment for me, a moment to breathe, to connect with a stranger. Ready to take on errand number 214.\u00a0  \n \nAnd then, at the supermarket, when the guy in front of me was twenty cents shy of being able to pay for his groceries, I was happy to pull out a quarter, spot him the small change. \n \nFinding the inner critic quieted.  \n \nBeing kind to myself, and flowing that out into the world.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I am linking this post up to  Be Enough Me  Mondays over at the wonderful Just.Be.Enough.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, September 24, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today's  SNSS guest, Laura Shumaker is the mother of three sons, one of whom, Matthew, is on the autism spectrum. While she is more of a veteran, no longer quite in the trenches with us, as her sons are older, she does remember it all, quite clearly.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n If her name sounds familiar, it is because you may have read her wonderful memoir: \"A Regular Guy: Growing Up With Autism\" about life with her son, Matthew. The book's sub-title, \"A family's story of love and acceptance\" lets you know exactly where she is coming from. A beautiful place.\u00a0  \n \n Besides this book, Laura writes an autism blog for  The San Fransisco Chronicle's online site SFGate , at her own eponymous site,  Laura Shumaker , as  well as for a number of other venues, including CNN.com,  NPR Perspectives,  and  5 Minutes for Special Needs . \u00a0  \n \n Her work is inspirational, the mission statement on her blog: \"launching teens and young adults with autism.\" And this is exactly what I need to hear: tales of launching, of success. \n \n While her sons have, by now, grown into young men, the story Laura chooses to share with us here comes from a few years ago, when her son Matthew and his NT brother Andy were both (yes, BOTH) in college. So come, now, read, and be inspired: \n \n @@@@@@@ \u00a0  \n A Tale of Two Brothers  - by Laura Shumaker  \n \nIt was an icy cold morning our Northern California town. I tapped lightly on my son, Andy's, door to wake him for an early morning flight back to the east coast, where was freshman in college. During his three week winter break, my husband and I were struck by how little time he needed to spend with us. \n \nThough he was perfectly pleasant, he was always in a hurry to be anywhere but home. \n \n\"Have you had a meaningful conversation with him?\" I asked my husband after a week and a half, \"I sure haven't.\" \"No,\" he sighed, \"but he's thrown me a few lines.\" Paranoid that we had gone wrong somewhere along the way, we polled our friends in similar circumstances, and they assured us that his behavior was normal. \n \n\"Join the club,\" they laughed, so we relaxed and made ourselves available for conversation and meals, and were grateful for the scraps that came our way. \n \nIt was clear, however, that Andy couldn't wait to get back to school, so much so that I was ready for him to leave.  \n \nJust as I took a quick swig of coffee before our trip to the airport Andy stepped out fully dressed, packed and ready to go. The night before, he had printed out his boarding pass and arranged for a ride from JFK to his school in Connecticut. \n \nAmazing.  \n \nIt was quite a different scene one week earlier, when Andy's 20-year-old brother Matthew, who has autism, prepared for his trip back to Pennsylvania, where he attends a special school. \n \n\"Mom,\" he had said the night before his trip, \"I need to make pancakes in the morning.\" \n \nHis flight was at 7:10.  \n \n\"Of course,\" I said. It was an outrageous request, but one I'd anticipated. Travel days were hard for Matthew, and sticking to his routine would increase the odds of the day being a successful one. So we were up at 4:15, setting his place at the table and warming the griddle. \n \nAfter breakfast, he counted the money that he had earned during the break doing garden work, and left it piled neatly in the drawer next to his bed. It was no use telling him to put it in a wallet or the bank. \n \n\"I like the dollars stacked,\" he said, \"and we're not going to talk about it anymore.\"  \n \nI looked to see if he had cut his bangs the night before, another one of his pre-travel rituals. \n \nOh, man, he sure did. \n \nMatthew is high functioning but socially inept, and it's necessary for him to fly with a helper. Today, he would be flying back to school with a young woman who worked at his school. She had flown Matthew home and had been touring California during his stay. \n \nDuring visits home, Matthew, a self-proclaimed landscape specialist, is obsessed with garden work--mowing, blowing and edging with precision.  \n \nWhen he is not doing it himself, he studies other garden crews in our neighborhood and around town. They all know him and are kind to him, as are the neighbors for whom they work.  \n \nThis year, after three or four days, he grew tired of gardening and announced that he was ready to hang out with his friends. The only problem is he has no friends. \n \n\"You can go to the movies with me and my friends,\" Andy offered as he always does, but Matthew refused. \n \n\"I have my own friends,\" he said proudly, and proceeded to call people who had been kind to him five years ago during his first and only year in public high school. \n \nHe called them over and over and over. Their mothers took most of the calls, and I'm sure they wondered why I didn't put a stop to his obsessive behavior. \n \n\"Matthew,\" I said, \"calling once or twice is fine, but if you keep calling, that's bothering, and you'll make people angry.\" I told him that when I was his age, a guy I liked called me too much and it drove me away. \n \n\"But did you still think he was nice?\" Matthew asked, his lip quivering. \n \nBefore I could answer, the sound of a lawnmower around the corner distracted him, and with the promise of a friendly garden crew he was off with a grin. I could exhale for the moment, but I remained constantly on edge until delivering him into the hands of his travel companion for his flight back to school. \n \n\"Having a brother like Matthew will make Andy a better person,\" said well-meaning friends when Matthew was first diagnosed with autism at age three. While their words were meant to comfort and encourage me, they implied that tough times were ahead for baby Andy, which strengthened my resolve to protect him. \n \nAndy was five when I first noticed playmates in the park teasing him about his brother's hand flapping, and I flew to his side, ready to take on the little jerks. \n \n\"He has a brain problem,\" Andy was explaining to them cheerfully, \"He can't help it.\" \n \nThe boys nodded anxiously and backed away. \n \n\"Andy,\" I said with a lump in my throat, \"I'm so proud of you. That was very loyal.\" \"Thank you,\" he said, \"I'm proud of you, too.\" \n \nIt wasn't long, though, until the novelty of educating his peers wore off, and by the time he was seven, I watched Andy's exuberant explanations turn defensive, and I swooped in with suggestions of snappy comeback lines for him to use in a pinch. \n \nTakes one to know one \n \nWHATever \n \nGet a life! \n \nBut by the time he was twelve and entering his middle school years, Andy got tired of using all of the clever lines as Matthew's impulsive behavior and public meltdowns increased. \n \n\"Andy needs a break,\" I told my husband. \"Why don't you go to his game today, and I'll stay home with Matthew.\" Andy seemed pleased with this arrangement, but when he came home, he looked strangely sad for a boy who had scored three goals. \n \n\"I had such a great game,\" he said. \"I wish you could have been there.\" \n \nSoon after, Andy stopped having friends over and started refusing invitations. \n \n\"The last time I went to a friend's house,\" he said, \"they asked me why we never hang out at my house. I don't want to say 'because I'm tired of apologizing for my brother.'\" \n \n\"Would you like to talk to someone?\" I asked, \"or maybe join some kind of a sibling support group?\"  \n \n\"Or could I just talk to you sometimes?\" he replied quietly, \"and sometimes can we do stuff-just you and me-without Matthew?\" \n \n\"Oh, of course!\" I said, choking up. And, wouldn't you know it, the next day Andy had a slight fever, but we decided he was well enough to go to Pier 39 with me for the day. \n \nThe next few years with Matthew were especially hard, and Andy prided himself on being one of the few people in the world who could calm Matthew down when he was upset, and on being the one who could make Matthew laugh the hardest. \n\u00a0  \n\"I've got him,\" he would say when Matthew climbed off the yellow school bus in tears. The two would go out to the mulberry tree in the back and sit on opposite branches until Andy got Matthew to smile. When they walked back in the house, Andy flashed me a secret victorious smile, and I put my hand over my heart in reply. \n \nWhen I was having doubts about whether or not to send Matthew to a residential school, it was an innocent comment from Andy that helped me make my decision. \n \n\"If he goes, maybe both you and Dad can go to my games.\" \n \nA month to the day that Matthew left for his school in Pennsylvania, Andy, who was now in ninth grade, burst into the house after school looking nervous but exhilarated. He asked if I could help him clean up the house-now. \n \n\"Luke and Greg are on their way over!\" \n \nI couldn't even remember the last time he'd had friends over.  \n \nWithin minutes, the clutter of the house was stacked on my bed, the house was vacuumed and the toilets cleaned. I was shoving the mop back in the closet when the doorbell rang. \n \n\"Hi, guys,\" I said, grinning like a modern June Cleaver. \"He's back in his room.\" \n \nBefore I could bake the cookies that I had thrown together in my manic state, the boys rushed out laughing and announced they were walking downtown. They flew out the front door, and I burst into tears.  \n \nThe morning Andy was born, I still thought Matthew was just a regular two-year-old, and I worried whether I could ever love this second baby as much as I did the first. The feeling evaporated the moment I was alone with Andy for the first time in my hospital room, kissing his fuzzy baby head and studying his chubby hands. \n \nNow I had not just Matthew, but brothers, and I imagined the two growing up together. Andy would look up to Matthew, and learn from him. When they were in school, the teachers would say, \"Oh, you're Matthew Shumaker's brother!\" and Andy would beam. \n \nThey would drive around together as teenagers, have the same friends, and I would raise them to be loyal to one another. They might go to different colleges; that would be healthy. But wouldn't it be great if they lived near each other as men and if their wives were friends? \n \nI could never have known that Andy and Matthew would blossom at about the same time-3000 miles apart. I couldn't have imagined that Matthew would be an autistic young man, and that I'd be grateful that he was living and learning with teachers who understood him and valued him. \n \nAnd I could never have guessed that Andy, after suffering through his reclusive period, would experience a joyous rebirth as he entered high school and that he would reclaim the class clown status that had eroded since grammar school.  \n \nHe would enjoy sports, friends and classes. By senior year, his homebody stage would be a distant memory as he made plans to go to college at Yale.  \n \nWhen I drove Andy to the airport after winter break, he asked me if I had heard Matthew speak Spanish. \n \n\"No. He speaks Spanish?\" \n \n\"He pretends to speak Spanish,\" Andy said with a smile, \"when he hangs out with some of the garden crews.\" \n \n\"Oh, no, that's terrible!\" I said, \"They must think he's racist or something!\" \n \n\"Come on, Mom,\" he laughed, \"They think it's hilarious. They can tell he's...you know.\" \n \nAndy jumped out of the car, dragging his huge duffel bag behind him. \n \n\"I love you, Mom. Thanks for everything. And don't worry so much about Matthew. He'll find his way. And you know I'll always look out for him.\" \n \nHe walked into the airport, and I drove away, conscious that my 18-year-old son had just thrown me a line. But he meant it. \n \nAnd I grabbed it gratefully. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Reading this post,\u2028 my heart aches, nearly breaks open with the hope that some day Ethan will come into an easier relationship with his brother the way her Andy has. \n \n  I also had the pleasure of meeting Laura in person at the Special Needs Parent Bloggers mini-con that took place within BlogHer11 this summer. And I can state unequivocally that she is as lovely and encouraging in person as she is in print.  \n \n So having read this here, you are certainly going to want to read more words of wisdom from Laura. You'll find her on her website,  Laura Shumaker,    and her San Fransisco Chronicle blog. \n \n First, you simply MUST read  this incredibly touching post  written by her NT son Andy about his brother.\u00a0 Then, if you haven't yet, you will want to read her whole book, a taste of which is  here on her site . \n \n Also you will want to read her  San Fransisco Chronicle  blog for the community information as well as personal stories, especially this VERY important post about how to  deal with the POLICE . This information is vital, potentially LIFE SAVING when you have a large son like I do. \n \n Finally, you should also go \"like\" Laura on her book's  Facebook Fan Page.  and by all means follow her on  Twitter , too!\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Thank you, Laura for sharing your wonderful family with us here today. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2011", "body": "\nThis weekend I spent too much time caught in the sand trap, mourning the family I thought I should have instead of enjoying the one that I actually do. \n \nAnd, truth to tell, it's pretty hard to enjoy my family right now. \n \nJacob is getting on Ethan's every last nerve, every minute of the day they are together. And Ethan is being mean to his brother. And there's only so much I can do.  \n \nOne has Autism and the other doesn't. It is what it is. \n \nI fled the coop for 4 hours on Sunday afternoon to attend a family event (for my husband's family, so he couldn't say no to watching the boys for the afternoon) and the boys just sat around the apartment with screens of various sorts on a beautiful day. \n \nI tried, I tried, really I tried to get Ethan a playdate for the afternoon, but it didn't pan out, so our wonderful upstairs neighbors (who have nearly adopted the boy) having other plans, deposited him back home at 2:30, and the idea of going anywhere with his brother brought tears and moans and groans of \"I HATE him, he ruins EVERYTHING mom!\" \n \nSo there I was at a lovely old world, old school, top tier  French restaurant in NYC eating and drinking up a storm with the female contingent of my husband's large and embracing, enveloping family (we affectionately call them the Borg Collective for a reason) but still fielding phone calls from home, pulled in two directions and fully present in neither. \n \nMy usual state.  \n \nThis weekend I struggled to be a good enough mother. Struggled and failed. I didn't have the energy, the herculean energy it takes to pull on the happy face and make fun happen for our family. \n \nWe used to be able to just roll out and spend the day together. Jake was a bit odd, but often lost in his own internal little world. We had to make sure he didn't wander off, but for a spectrum kid he was pretty easy to take out into the world. \n \nBut now that he wants to interact and talk all the time, he requires a lot more energy and focus. He still loves going out, but now I have to be completely vigilant, to keep him from going up to everyone he sees and starting strange conversations.\u00a0 And he so drives his brother 'round the bend. \n \nI am sure some day Ethan will develop more distance, more compassion, but right now he is all rage and annoyance. And I don't want to be here in the middle of it. Not at all, not even for one minute of it. \n \nAnd so I dread the weekends. I get a stone in the pit of my stomach as 3:45 pm on Friday rolls around, knowing\u00a0 the boys are mine and more or less together until 6:45 am on Monday. \n \nI ask too much from my friends, the mothers of Ethan's friends. I am always foisting him off on them. And if those kids want to come over, we're really limited to the ones with high tolerance for Jacob. \n \nI am tired of whining about this, tired of complaining. Also I am worried that I am making my wonderful son Jacob sound like a burden, which he never is.\u00a0 He is lively and delightful and full of light. But exhausting. Yes exhausting, always, too. \n \nAnd the biggest issue is the dynamics between the two, so far from healed, so far from resolved. Maybe worse now than it's ever been, I can't really tell, I have no perspective. \n \nSo I separate and separate and separate some more, as much as I can. And still at bedtime tonight Ethan asks when we'll make enough money so we can get a bigger apartment and he can have his own room, asks if I could send Jacob away for a day \"Send him on a trip to D.C., Mom.\" so he and I can have a day together, at home just us \"because I almost never get time at home without Jacob around. \" \n \nAnd also the separateness feels just too separate, feels like individuals and not a family. I want a family unit, damn it, something that feels cohesive and whole. Not just this hole in my heart. Not a big one, but a small one, drippity leaking, draining the joy out drop by drop.  \n \nIt's 4 am and I have not gone to bed yet. Sitting here ruminating and writing. Because if you don't go to bed, tomorrow never comes, right? \n \nDamn, got that wrong too. \n \n \n \n And I'm linking this up with Heather's \" Just Write \" Tuesdays meme at The Extraordinary Ordinary, even though it's not the lovely little slice of life I wanted to write tonight. Oh, well.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

Carrying casseroles. \n \nBut, still... my lovely, loving, eminently lovable, recently widowed 89 year-young mother is lonely. She likes male companionship. A friend to laugh with, to watch old movies with.  \n \nMy mother wants a man. Someone to grow older with.

She WILL whip up a nice cup of hot cocoa in the microwave, and order up a mean takeout, like the true New Yorker that she is. \n \nSpeaks a bissel Yiddish, but loves her lobster; would be folk dancing if her knees worked better.

You do not have to create content for the prompt, unless  you    want to. All you have to do is copy and paste the url of the post   into   the linky list. Voila, an old post gets a second shot!  \n \nTo take part:  \n \n1. Follow MY blog for now (and  Jen's blog  once I hand her back the reins) to get future Blog Gem posting information and linkys.  \n \n2. Grab the Blog Gem button and place it on your sidebar (html code  here ).    Putting the button on your blog is not a deal-breaker, some people just don't like doing it and I have no problem with that at all.  What I will say is that something like this can't be successful without    'word  of mouth' so I would appreciate if you could find another way to    let  people know that this is available and they are welcome to join in.  \n \n3. Enter your link.  \n \n4. Read and comment on the submissions of the two blogs posted before you on the linky list. (Please!)  \n \n5. Help spread the word by telling your blogging friends, either by tweeting this or blogging about your entry.  \n \nThe rule is that you're supposed to select a post from your  archives    that fits the prompt... but it's a lenient rule, and broad  interpretations are welcome, so be creative! \n \n And here's what I have to add: \nIt's a wonderful chance to get fresh eyeballs on your great posts from   the past. People tend to put in recent posts because they're freshly in   our radar, but I would encourage rooting around in your archive and   dredging stuff up that's deeply buried, if you can.  \n \n So come on... link up a school-related gem from the past.\u00a0 Aaaaand Go! \n \n                document.write('<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=http://www.inlinkz.com/cs.php?id=84783&' + new Date().getTime() + '\"><\\/script>');\n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, September 17, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today's  SNSS guest poster is a mom and she's a blogger, but she's not a special needs mom blogger. What Lyz Lenz is, instead, is a SISTER of a very special brother.\u00a0 \n \n Lyz blogs, fittingly, at  LyzLenz.com  where her tag line reads: \"Eschewing pants, eating McNuggets and getting knocked up.\" She is a wonderful writer: smart, insightful and very, very funny.  \u00a0 \n \n Calling herself a \"Social Media Ninja\" she also manages social media and writes for a number of other sites as well, including  YourTango  where she is a community manager (busy woman). \n \n Motherhood is a recent development for her (her baby girl is not yet even one) but as an older sister she has been taking care of people in her family for a long, long time. Especially her  youngest brother,  who has Downs Syndrome as well as further complicating issues.\u00a0  \n \n Come read her here, as she writes movingly about her brother Noah, and his special place in her family: \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Noah, my Brother  - by Lyz Lenz \n \nI have seven siblings. One is perky with curly hair. One is hilarious and likes to play with legos. Two are good at art. One dedicates her life to serving others. Another dedicates her life to giving people great hairstyles. I have a brother who is in the Army and can run a mile in six minutes. I have a sister who is the best message therapist I\u2019ve ever met. She\u2019s also the most sarcastic person I know. And then there is my youngest brother, Noah. \n \nNoah loves to snuggle. He loves to watch Toy Story and collect army men. He once got kicked out of school for dancing on a table. He also got kicked out of school for yelling at a teacher. Noah is sweet and a little spicy. And among the many things that he is, Noah is also Downs Syndrome. \n \nBut it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. Noah also has other disabilities. He is 15 and he can\u2019t talk and just learned how to go to the bathroom by himself. And as much as I hate it, those are the things that define him to most people.  \n \nTo most people, Noah is not my brother who got kicked out of school. He\u2019s not my brother who carries around a Sheriff Woody doll. Or the brother who gives the best hugs. To everyone I meet he is Noah my disabled brother. \n \nBut to me and my siblings he is so much more. \n \nMy brother Noah was born on June 12, 1997. He was three months early and was so small my dad could hold him in the palm of his hand. But my dad didn\u2019t do that. He carried him with both hands, cradled against his chest, while all seven of us siblings circled around so happy that Noah was part of the family. \n \nTwo weeks after he was born were told he had Downs Syndrome and six years later, we would find out that he also suffered from additional complications that meant he\u2019d never be able to hold down a job or live on his own.  \n \nI was thirteen when Noah was allowed to come home from the hospital and I would often sit by his crib, watching him breathe. Making sure he was okay. When he woke up, his blue eyes would watch the ceiling fan circle round-and-round his head.  \n \nMaybe he will make fans one day, I thought before remembering that the doctor had said he may never have a career. I ran downstairs and crawled into an old sleeping bag, hiding my tears and my horrible thoughts. It doesn\u2019t matter how good he is, no one will give him the chance.  \n \nBefore Noah was born, I had known a girl with Downs, her name was Janna, and every time I saw her she would tell me about her boyfriends. \u201cI kissed them!\u201d she would yell and I would sneak away. \u201cGo play with Janna,\u201d mom insisted. But I hated every minute of it.  \n \nI hated the way she smelled of mothballs and body odor. I hated the way she laughed at everything and hugged me. I hated that she was twenty and could barely read. Most of all I hated the way people looked at her as she loped along, oblivious to their scornful stares.  \n \nI didn\u2019t want Noah to be like that, but most of all I didn\u2019t want to think of him like that. I fell asleep in the sleeping bag and woke up to my mom kissing my forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be mad,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you love him.\u201d \n \nAnd that\u2019s what it is to be a sibling of someone with special needs\u2014you exist simultaneously in a place of love and acceptance and frustration and guilt. But I wouldn\u2019t ever choose anything different. \n \nI\u2019m older now and so is Noah. But I still get angry. I get angry when I don\u2019t know how to talk to him, when I have a hard time understanding what he wants. I get angry when he comes for a visit and then leaves and I feel like I didn\u2019t get a chance to tell him that I love him and what he means to me. And I know he gets frustrated too.  \n \nOne by one, his brothers and sisters are leaving home and leaving him. He uses sign language to tell my mom to call us. And when he sees us, he just wants to sit and hug. And I do sit and hug him, but it\u2019s never long enough and that makes me mad too. \n \nNoah is so many other things. He\u2019s the kid who tried to flush the dog down the toilet. He\u2019s the kid who can eat his weight in Cheetos. He\u2019s the brother who influenced one of my sisters to become a teacher and another to become a social worker. He\u2019s the brother that taught me patience.  \n \nHe\u2019s also just Noah, my brother. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Reading this post, I was so moved by the loving relationship between the siblings. Noah is lucky to have so many caring brothers and sisters, and I am touched by how lucky THEY feel to have him in their lives, too. \n \n Also this sentence: \" And that\u2019s what it is to be a sibling of someone with special needs\u2014you  exist simultaneously in a place of love and acceptance and frustration  and guilt.\"  just gripped my heart. Ethan is not so much in that place of love and acceptance yet, but I sincerely hope he will be some day.  \n \n Having read these beautiful words here, you're going to want to follow Lyz back home to her blog,  LyzLenz.com . But I gotta warn you, as poignant as Lyz is here? She is mostly side-splittingly funny and sardonic there. \n \n If you want to start with one of her more serious posts, go to  this lovely one  about another brother (which includes some beautiful moments in his relationship with Noah, too). And read this beautiful post about what coming up out of that  all-encompassing first month  of mothering feels like. \n \n And for the funny? Where do I start... try this hysterical  letter to future babysitters  of her daughter, or this post about  her obsession  with all things related to crime and criminology. \n \n Besides keeping her own blog, Lyz is also a Community Manager at  YourTango  where she writes about all aspects of love and relationships.  \n \n Finally, you can find and follow Lyz on Twitter as  @lyzl , where she is as fun and funny as you would imagine . \n \n Thank you so much, Lyz, for this beautiful post.  You are a brave and honest writer and I am honored to have you here. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, September 15, 2011", "body": "\n(as in some fool who likes to tweet on Twitter, not an upper-crust British nitwit a la Monty Python.) \n \nHello, my name is Varda and I am a Twitter addict.  \n \nOK, I've been cutting down some lately, as I have recognized that it can get in the way of, well, that (highly over-rated) \"real life\" stuff. When your son complains that you \"Love your computer more than you love us!\" you know it's time to scale back a wee bit. \n \nA year and a half ago I didn't know even know what Twitter was. Well, I mean I'd heard of it, but hadn't given it much thought other than as that \"wacky thing\" some folks do. \n \nNow I can't imagine how I wasted my time before Twitter. It's so efficient, so effective at sucking all the \"spare time\" out of my day. \n \nBut also, truth to tell, useful.  \n \nSometimes I just want to shout into the cave and hear a voice back that is other than my own, echoing. Sometimes I have important things to say to the universe (well, to the approximately 1800 souls in it who follow me, that is), while other times I just want to share my momentary thoughts with at least the illusion that someone is listening. \n \nLike today.  \n \nI was sitting in the car waiting for the clock to strike 11 so I could leave (following the arcane rules of the NYC Alternate Side Shuffle... if you live here -- and especially if you own and street-park a car - you understand; and if you don't, be glad you don't have to) my brain just bouncing around in the void. \n \nSo I sent out this tweet: \n \n \nAnd got this back: \n \n \nAnd that's it. Just what I needed. To know I'm not alone. \n \nAnd then when I got home (car legal, good 'til Monday at 9:30), just checking in, I read this: \n \n \nand decided to click on over to  read her post . It was about aggravation vs. thankfulness and contained this poster: \n \n \nA timely reminder if ever there was one, as I have been uber-cranky lately. Forgetting to feel grateful. Forgetting all that I am always hammering home to Ethan the complainer, reminding him how lucky he is. \n \nI can hear my own voice yakking away at him, telling him: \"The key to happiness is not how MUCH you have but how GRATEFUL you are for whatever you do have\" in response to his whining for this or that toy he has seen advertised on TV and MUST HAVE or he will be miserable forever. \n \nI remember when he was little, maybe four, and was being all fussy about his clothes, wanting to wear a very specific something that was dirty in the hamper, declaring every other possible item terrible, I just lost it with him. I was yelling about how spoiled he is, about how in so much of the world kids have only one or two sets of clothing that they own and THAT IS IT. And if they want them clean they have to wash them by hand, every day, maybe even in a river miles from home. \n \nAnd he got a quivering lip and I thought \"OK, maybe I'm laying it on a little thick\" but he then said to me with so much compassion: \"Oh, Mommy, that is just SO sad. Can I send them some of my clothes?\" \n \nAnd we hugged for a bit, and talked about what we could do to help those less fortunate than ourselves. \n \nAnd that sweet memory of my son, and remembering to be grateful for all that I have in my life? Thanks to Twitter and the random moment I popped on to read. \n \nThat's one of the things I love about it, how it increases the serendipity quotient in my life. \n \nOther things I love: That it is teaching me brevity, how to be more concise, I, who am so in love with words, who easily earns my reputation as \"Queen of the run on sentence (with parenthetic clauses)\". But Twitter? 140 characters, baby, or you're toast. \n \nAlso, I am by nature an eavesdropper, and Twitter was MADE for that, I can listen in on other people's conversations all day to my heart's content, no one the wiser.  \n \nI would like to call myself the Queen of Twitter, but really I'm not. I go through phases, I'm in and out. Sometimes I just read and lurk a lot. Mostly that's fun (see above paragraph) but other days I'm feeling down, vulnerable. And then I feel all left out, wonder why no one is @ing me. (Duh, dorkus, you have to jump into the conversation and @ others to be included, REMEMBER?) \n \nThe real Queen of Twitter right now (in my humble opinion) is, quite fittingly, my friend Alexandra aka The Empress who tweets as  @GDRPempress  and writes the blog  Good Day, Regular People . She was on of my two wonderful BlogHer11 roommates, and it would be hard to find a lovelier, more gracious woman on all the planet, let alone the interwebs. \n \nAny delightful or vital conversation going on - there she is! She re-tweets like crazy, offers tweets of support and encouragement constantly. Her stream looks like this, all day long:\u00a0  \n \n \nAlso Alexandra is first on the spot with important messages and alerts. (And yes, it was she who clued me in to Anna See's tragic  loss of her son  last week.)  \n \nSo if you're looking to pick up ONE new follow on Twitter - make it Alexandra. (After ME, of course. Do follow me, please!  @Squashedmom , of course.) \n \nSo yes, when it's not leading me to fritter away my time, I can truly say that Twitter has embiggened my life (is TOO a word, coined on the Simpsons). \n \nSo that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I'm (proud to be) a Twit. \n \n(And you can Tweet me, and we can talk all about it, or anything else you want to, in 140 character bursts.) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "body": "\nOn Friday I received a chilling set of Twitter messages from my friend Alexandra: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI went, I read, I left a message. Words, just words, but they were all I had. No one could do what we all wanted to: turn back time's hands and undo the undoing of this boy. \n \nI cried and cried for a boy I didn't actually know, the son of a woman I had never met. But whose words I knew. A woman like me: a blogger, a mother. \n \nThe mother is Anna See, of the blog  An Inch of Gray . \n \nHer son is/was Jack. \n \n12. \n \nNow, forever. \n \nHe was playing in his friend's yard. A back yard just a few houses away. Just a typical boy, at play. The creek had breached its banks. He tumbled in, was swept away. \n \nAnd just like that, a light is snuffed out, a life is gone. \n \nUnimaginable. \n \nBut not to me, the mother of an autistic son. \n \nTragedy is not distant, but in fact stalks me. It's the shadow that walks by my side always, the fear that because of his autism, because he understands the risks of the world so much less than a typical child of his nine years, my son Jacob will be lost. \n \nSwept away. \n \nThat chasing a pigeon or ball bounced wrong he will run into the street... \n \nThat drawn to water, as so many autistic children are, he will step into a river too rapid, fall into a pool too deep... \n \nThat with his friendly, too trusting nature he would walk off with a seemingly kind stranger without a backward glance...  \n \nThat, strong, willful boy that he is, he will loosen himself from my hand when we are in the ocean and be carried out to sea...  \n \nThat, large boy that he is, he will walk up to an armed police officer, saying and doing something innocent but seemingly provocative when he is no longer a still cute 9 year-old but a six-foot-plus seeming adult teenager...  \n \nThat, curious boy that he is, he will take one step too close to a raging, flood-swelled creek, and be swept away.  \n \nI know, I quake, that one short twist of fate could put me right into Anna's awful shoes. \n \nSo I weep for her, and for all the mothers who have lost their young. \n \nAnd I hug my sons a little tighter, watch over them a little more hawk-like. Knowing it can never be enough. That the unforeseen moment of disaster can not, by its own nature, be seen, known, avoided. \n \nBut still, the instinct is there. The magical thinking: \"I can keep my children safe.\" \n \nBut I live with these statistics: Autistic kids are often bolters, runners, escape artists. Approximately half of all autistic children wander, at least once. And the number one cause  of death among autistic children that wander? Is drowning. \n \nWe like to think this cannot be us, our family. But it can be. In the blink of an eye, a moment's distraction; a step taken into exactly the wrong place at the wrong time. \n \nAnna is an incredible woman, capable of tagging her  memorial post  for her son \"thank you for loving us\" as well as \"heartbroken.\" \n \nSo go there, now, leave her family your love. \n \nWrite your own post for Anna, and link up  here , where Kate of  The Big Piece of Cake  is gathering them all. (And read them.) \n \nOur hearts pull toward Anna's. We offer words of solace knowing they can  never fill the empty son-shaped space on this earth. \n \nBut they are what we have to offer her.  \n \nOur words of love. \n \nOur prayers, from those who pray. \n \nOur sisterhood, no less real because it is digital, ethereal. \n \nAs her son is no less real, now that he lives on in memory, in spirit, and  on Anna's blog , smiling his incandescent smile. \n \nBeautiful boy. \n \nForever 12. \n \n (Anna, you and your family are in my heart, tonight and forever.) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nAs everyone knows, ten years ago today, my city, my country, and the world changed irrevocably; all were diminished forever.  \n \nThis is one of those touchstone moments, that everyone who was alive and old enough to be cognizant knows exactly where they were, who they were with, what they were doing at the exact moment that they heard the news of the planes hitting the Twin Towers, the towers falling. \n \nSome didn't have to \"hear the news\" as they were close enough to see, hear, feel the event itself. My friend Peter was working in the towers, his life saved by a forward thinking manager who told his people to get out and go home, in spite of what the building management people were telling him. \n \nI do not know a single New Yorker who did not know someone who lost someone that day, there being way less than six degree of separation here. \n \nI myself, in spite of living in the city, was kept in a bubble, unaware of what had gone down for a good hour afterward. At exactly 8:45 AM, I had arrived for a breakfast date, and entering the Barking Dog Diner, greeted my friend who had taken a cozy dark booth on the inside -- there being two basic choices in seating: cave or greenhouse.  \n \nI say I was meeting a friend, but strangely enough, she was someone I was actually meeting for the first time. In 2001 I was just dipping my toes in the water of an online life, and that morning I was meeting my first internet friend IRL. We had connected at a fertility website, back when \"interacting\" online meant posting notes on a message board site and waiting hours (and sometimes days) for a reply. \n \nMy friend had just completed a successful IVF cycle at the same center where I was planning to undergo one, if my September IUI failed (it did - the twins are IVF). She was in town for her first ultrasound, and I was rushing to find out her news. She lived upstate, near Albany, but had traveled down to NYC to do her fertility treatment because of the sterling reputation of the center we were at (Weil-Cornell, for the curious). \n \nDeeply nauseated, she had been worried it might be twins, was hoping she was carrying a singleton. When I arrived she was glowing, happy to have witnessed that miraculous thing: her (single) baby's heart-beat in grainy black and white on the ultrasound monitor.  \n \nUnaware of all that was going on in the world around us, cocooned in the glow of long awaited happiness finally unfurled, we talked and dreamed of our futures as mommies. I looked to her and hoped I was seeing shadows of my future. \n \nFinally, it was time for us to leave; for her to head back to Penn Station and catch the Amtrak back North to her husband (who sadly could not come with her this day) and for me to head to work, conveniently right across from Penn station. We were going to catch a cab together. \n \nWhile she made her way to the bathroom, I went up front to pay and was annoyed to find the cashier/hostess had abandoned her station, was furiously pacing and smoking (?!?) on the sidewalk outside. When I stepped out to find her, she was jumpy as a cat, apologized profusely and added tensely: \"It's just I'm so upset by what's going on, I had to have a cig.\" \n \nI must have stared at her blankly because her look softened. We spoke over each other; me: \"What do you mean, what's going on?\" and her: \"Oh, honey, you don't know, do you?\" \n \nShe then proceeded to tell me that two planes had hit the Twin Towers, and they were aflame. She pointed me southward to witness the plumes of smoke rising, ominously black in the brilliant blue sky. \n \nJust then a cab stopped smack in the middle of the intersection of York Avenue and 77th Street. The driver rolled down his window and cried out to the world: \"The towers are falling, the towers are falling!\" \n \nI paid our breakfast bill in a blur, came back to our booth to find my friend and break the news to her. It seemed surreal, impossible. Could that really have happened while we sat and ate breakfast so calmly, so unaware, in this selfsame city, just a few miles to the south? \n \nWe were both in a daze, needing to contact husbands and head west. I had it in my head to still go in to work, she thought there was a chance she could catch a train, desperately wanting to be heading out, home. \n \nMiraculously while we were both calling and getting busy signal after busy signal, cell towers vastly overloaded, my cell phone rang. My husband had gotten through. He disabused us of the notion of heading toward Penn Station, told my friend they had already sealed off the city to rail traffic, told me I was in no circumstances going anywhere but home. And my friend, obviously was coming with me. \n \nNew, barely knowing each other outside the details of our ovulation cycles, we were abruptly bonded by strange circumstance. Sitting in our living room together, numbly watching events unfold on the TV, we barely spoke, just witnessed. \n \nLuckily my friend had an aunt who resided in the city, and in my neighborhood no less. Contact was eventually made, my friend departed, and my husband and I found ourselves alone, together, un-moored except for each other. \n \nAhead lay days of nervous baby steps back out into the world; lay our trip to my niece's September 15th wedding in Maryland, making jokes along the way about traveling from one target zone to another; lay contemplating and then going through with our final, ultimately successful attempt to become pregnant, made ever more poignant in this, our post-9/11 world.  \n \nBut that evening there was only us, walking slowly down Riverside Drive, hand in hand, gazing southwards at the haze of smoke hanging over the smoldering pits where just that morning buildings had stood. \n \nThey were not beautiful, those Twin Towers, products of 1970's minimalist uber-functional architecture; but they were ours, and somehow majestic in their dominance of the New York City Skyline. \n \nTen years is both a short and long time. The entirety of our sons' lives. But also the blink of an eye. Especially for the many who lost loved ones that day, whose time-dulled grief is made knife sharp again each year, as September 11th rolls around. \n \nI cried that day for the shattering -- of lives, of innocence, of an easy sense of all being right with the world that can never return again. \n \nI cried again this morning, remembering; and with the small sadness that my sons will never know that little uplift of the heart that came when flying back to New York from distant shores, of spotting the Twins, those beckoning towers, welcoming you, and knowing you are finally home. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

A supernova unto himself.\u00a0  \n \nI have  a friend  (who himself is on the spectrum w/ NVLD) who says of his SN son: He has a 100% diagnosis of being {NAME}. Of that we are certain. \n \nSometimes when I tell people I have a \"high-ish functioning\" kid on the autism spectrum they say, \"Oh, Aspergers\" and I have to laugh. Because, truth to tell, he is the anti-Aspergers, language processing being his primary deficit. \n \nA little professor he most certainly is not. \n \nWhen I tell another autism mom he loves baseball she nods and talks of how obsessed with the stats her aspie son is, and I have to laugh. Jake wouldn't know a stat if it bit him in the ass. And his knowledge of the basic rules is sketchy at best (let alone the thousand arcane ones that the baseball obsessed usually revel in being privy to).  \n \nNo, Jake loves baseball for the... well, I actually have no idea exactly why, other than that his (wonderful) school took the kids to a minor league game on a field trip this July, and somehow he fell in love with the boys of summer that day. \n \nI think perhaps he loves the drama of it all. He likes to shout out: \"You're out!\" and \"He's pitching the ball, Mom!\" or \"He's hitting the ball, Mom!\" excitedly while watching a game on TV. And Jake is over the moon that our family is going to a Mets game soon (his idea). \n \nMy little corner of the neurodiverse universe. \n \nAnd, in another corner of it, today is Ethan's first day of school. 4th grade, a big  year. He's anxious (it took him FOREVER to fall asleep last night). \n \n4th  grade is  his  uncharted territory: new teacher, new kids (and none of his  close friends in his class), academics ramping up, ADD acting up (anxiety always triggers it). \n \nAnd, most importantly, standardized tests that count, REALLY count, as in NYC  they pretty much determine what middle school he'll get into. And he knows it  (the kids talk). And he feels the pressure, and wishes he could go back to simpler times. \n \nNine years old, and already nostalgic, declaring, \"My friend Peter is so lucky he's in 2nd grade, they don't have any big tests yet. 2nd grade was a great year.\" and sighing. \n \nIt was not easy for me to get this post out today, having just rounded the bend from those last lingering weeks of summer vacation, the unstructured days starting out glorious and degenerating into bored, fighting children and exhausted parents barely parenting. There be dragons here. \n \nI almost called this post \"U is for Unfinished\" and made it a one sentence post:  \n \nU is for Unfinishe\u2026. \n \nBut couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that (even though I gave myself a nice little chuckle at the conceptual humor involved in that stunt) because, well, when have I EVER been short form, really? \n \nSo I started to search for other U words, and realized so many of them were \"Un-\" words. How appropriate, as my life feels like it's full of a lot of Un-s right now. \n \nSome days I feel:  \n \nUninspired \n \nUnhinged \n \nUnhappy \n \nUnconnected \n \nUnprepared \n \n \nMy real self just buried so far: \n \nUnderground \n \n \nThat the pressures so thoroughly:  \n \nUnending \n \nUnbelievable  \n \nUnrelieved, nearly \n \nUntenable  \n \n \nBut I am also:  \n \nUnrelenting in my search to find new ways to help and support Jacob \n \nUncompromising in my insistence that the bar be set high for him \n \nUnbending in my belief in him, that no one should ever, ever  \n \nUnderestimate his intelligence or \n \nUnderstanding of what is going on around him.  \n \n \nAnd my life is also, always: \n \nUnbelievably fulfilling \n \nUnimaginably beautiful, and full of love, here, in the \n \nUncharted territory I sail off into every day. \n \nAnd? It's a good thing I like dragons. \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock's  Alphabe-Thursday writing meme.

Find your funniest and bring it on over here.\u00a0 \n \n And if you're a super serious blogger, and have never tagged a post \"humor\" in your bloggy life? Find one that's on the lighter side, that spotlights a sweet/funny moment in your life. Because I know you have at least one of those.  \n \n So, come on... link up a side-splitting (or gentle-smile-generating) gem from the past. Make me laugh! \n \nNOTE: try to dig deep into your archives, if you've got  them. Your regular readers will have read last week's post anyway. So  go back a year\u00a0 -- or two! -- find something in the attic that not  enough people read, or that you just simply adore. This is your chance  for fresh eyeballs... go for it! \n \nIf you've done this before, you can just skip on down to the linky at the bottom. \n \nIf you're new here: Welcome, read on.... \n \nCome! link up! Tell all your friends! I promised my friend Jen her  lovely linky meme would be alive and well when she brings it back home  to her blog,  The King and Eye,  some time in the fall (or whenever she's ready). So don't make a liar out of me.  \n \n About Blog Gems (from Jen): \nHow many posts do you have languishing in your archives? Great posts    that will never be dusted off and brought out to breathe again! Maybe    you created fabulous content before you had lots of followers, or maybe    you have been blogging for years and your current followers haven't   seen  your older material.  \n \nBlog Gems - Air Your Archives is a fortnightly linky list where  we will   give a prompt and you select a post from your archives that fits  the   prompt. You do not have to create content for the prompt, unless  you   want to. All you have to do is copy and paste the url of the post  into   the linky list. Voila, an old post gets a second shot!  \n \nTo take part:  \n \n1. Follow MY blog for now (and  Jen's blog  once I hand her back the reins) to get future Blog Gem posting information and linkys.  \n \n2. Grab the Blog Gem button and place it on your sidebar (html code  here ).   Putting the button on your blog is not a deal-breaker, some  people   just don't like doing it and I have no problem with that at all.  What I   will say is that something like this can't be successful without   'word  of mouth' so I would appreciate if you could find another way to   let  people know that this is available and they are welcome to join  in.  \n \n3. Enter your link.  \n \n4. Read and comment on the submissions of the two blogs posted before you on the linky list. (Please!)  \n \n5. Help spread the word by telling your blogging friends, either by tweeting this or blogging about your entry.  \n \nThe rule is that you're supposed to select a post from your  archives   that fits the prompt... but it's a lenient rule, and broad interpretations are welcome, so be creative! \n \n And here's what I have to add: \nIt's a wonderful chance to get fresh eyeballs on your great posts from  the past. People tend to put in recent posts because they're freshly in  our radar, but I would encourage rooting around in your archive and  dredging stuff up that's deeply buried, if you can.  \n \nReady? Good. Go link up! \n  \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Saturday, September 3, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today's  SNSS guest? Has more kids than you do. OK, more than 99.9% of you do. She has seven. Which is why Caryn Haluska tweets as  @ihave7monsters  and refers to herself as the \"Monster Momma\" (& her home as \"Monster House\") on her blog  Living with Logan.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Caryn writes about life with Logan, her 3 year old son with  issues  (ASD, SPD, seizures & severe food allergies) and the rest of the gang, including Logan's twin who has some SPD issues of his own. \n \n It's a busy, busy household. But one that is also clearly full of love and understanding, if rather shy on peace. \n \n Although she gets some flack for it, she stands by referring to her kids as monsters. It's because she means it like Jim Henson's monsters: adorable and unique .  \n \n Her blog's tag line is: \"What we've learned as a family because we have the HONOR of Logan being a part of it\" and that beautiful sentiment says it all about where she is coming from, always. \n \n So now it's time for me to stop talking and for you to read Caryn's lovely essay about her family, here: \n \n @@@@@@@ \n How Will They Know?  - by Caryn Haluska \n \nI sit outside, contemplating the opportunity I've been given to contribute to this series. I think about what to write, while enjoying the cool of a late summer night in Southern Utah, breathing in the smell of flower pots dripping with pansies, alyssum and violets, and listening to the crickets sing.  \n \nThe stars wink at me as I compose in my head what I will write about my beloved Monster House. This is my sanctuary~ a front porch step late at night, and the serenity nature offers.  \n \nIt is, in fact, the only time I get to have absolute quiet and \u201cme time.\u201d And it never lasts more than ten minutes. So, I've had my ten minutes, and have come in to write. I'm hoping it comes out as well in print as it did in my head.  \n \nLife in a family with seven children, even if they were all NT children, would be hectic. Life in a family with seven children, one of whom is on the autism spectrum, has SPD (extreme non-seeker), seizures and crazy amounts of food allergies is somewhat more than hectic. Add in a couple of older sibs with learning difficulties, and a twin with SPD (total seeker), and things just get more interesting. \n \nTo prepare for this submission, I asked the monsters (1-4, as #5 was already asleep) to give me three words each about Logan, in no particular order, with no particular subject... just the first three words that popped into their heads when I said Logan's name. They didn't even have to be polite, as long as they were honest.  \n \nThe Daddy liked this idea so much, he joined in as well, so I'm including his contribution, too. \n \n #1 \nCuddle Lion Logan \n \n #2 \nsweet \nhonorable \ncuddly \n \n #3 \ncool  \ncuddly \nsoothing \n \n #4 \nhonorable \nemotional \nenjoyable \n \n The Daddy \nAttitude \nDaredevil \nSmart!! \nLogan is his siblings' favorite teddy bear. They fight over holding him, and they cry when he's had enough and wants nothing more to do with them. He can make them laugh, and he knows just how to get them to come running with a well thought out shriek. \n \nHe can make them jealous, and he can make them proud, all within the same few minutes. Truly, Logan and #6 have brought all my children closer together. \n \nThe first thing everyone should know is: Logan and #6 are the babies. They just turned three at the beginning of the summer. The \u201colder kids,\u201d as we call #1-#5, range in age from 17 to 6, so I am extremely blessed to have a lot of help where Logan is concerned.  \n \nLogan's phenomenal progress in speech, motor skills, and other areas is largely in part to the efforts of his older brothers and sisters.\u00a0 So much so, I have had to put my foot down upon occasion and remind them, \u201cLogan is not a trained monkey! Let the child alone for a bit!\u201d \n \nCertainly, we are not without flaws. There have been occasions where one monster or another would become upset with the amount of time it took to arrange therapies, doctors' appointments, write for the blog, talk to other special needs parents, etc. We have had to squash all the monsters' hopes of having a pet because of Logan's allergies, much to the dismay of #3.  \n \nMy #4 especially, has a rough time. She kept asking why Logan was the only one I wrote about, the only one with a picture in my blog header; at one point she asked why he was the only one I loved. \n \nShe is largely the reason for the blog makeover, and my shift to more posts about everyone. I am proud of ALL my monsters. I never want them to wonder. \n \nAs part of an agreement I have with the older monsters, I don't write a lot -if at all- about their learning difficulties. They are my #1 and #2, and they read my blog, along with their friends. \n \nThey are so proud of Logan. I think their struggles have helped them be more compassionate and understanding with him. My #2 and Logan have a special bond that defies explanation, and it has been so since the very first time they saw each other. \n \nIt's difficult for the older ones, I think. They are old enough to understand the definition of the \u201cR word\u201d, and have heard it said in reference to Logan by small minded people around town. But they just don't understand why the \u201cR word\u201d would apply to him.\u00a0  \n \nIt is hard for them to think of Logan as having any kind of disability. They truly don't see it. At the Monster House, he's just Logan... not autism, not SPD, or anything else. He's their brother. And that's how we like it. \n \nWhen I told them the other day at dinner that I had a meeting to help the school get ready for him, every last one of those monsters looked at me like I was nuts. And #1 asked the question for all of them: \u201cWhy? What's to get ready? He's coming to school.\u201d \n \nWe agonize as parents. I question myself constantly, wondering if I'm being as accessible to all my monsters as I am to Logan and #6. The Daddy makes a concentrated effort to spend time with each child one on one after work, though he travels for business frequently and his time is not his own as often as he would like. It is things like this, I think, that causes siblings to lean a little more on each other, and grow closer.  \n \nI love watching the monsters together. There are fights, certainly. Far more than I am comfortable with. And there are times that the verbal warfare escalates to physical. We have raging teenage hormones and 11 year old drama queen syndrome. \n \nThere are twinnie meltdowns that are so intense I simply am not able to be available to anyone else while they are going on. There is jealousy, and resentment upon occasion. I hate having to say to one monster or another, \u201cI'm sorry, baby. I just can't. I haven't slept. Logan and #6 had a very rough night.\u201d It's all too frequent an occurrence, and I have a physical ache every time. \n \nWe incorporate family time with therapy. Most times it works. We have disco floors out of couch cushions. We have crazy fun cutting paper with scissors for no purpose other than, Logan likes it and it's great for fine motor and hand/eye coordination. \n \nWe go on walks together while the twinnies learn to ride tricycles. We play around with new \u201cLogan safe\u201d recipes. That rubber bread will go down in family history. \n \nOur largest quality is the ability to adapt. I hope we never, ever lose that. \n \nBut I wonder, when it's all said and done... will my best have been good enough? Will they all know that they have special places in my mothers heart, that Logan and #6 are not the only ones there? \n \nAnd how can I make sure of that? How will they know? \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Reading this post, I just kept thinking about what a gift it is for Logan and his twin to have such an involved, loving family. And I want to hug Caryn and tell her: \"Of course they know, it shines through in every word you write.\" \n \n So now that you have read  Caryn  here, you are going to go follow her home, right? You will find her at  her blog    Living with Logan . Try this post, where Caryn shares why she lovingly  calls them \"Monsters\" , or this one about how hard it is to  grocery shop   for  (and cook for and feed) a child with severe food allergies. \n \n Want to see the magic she talks about between her big boy #2 and Logan? Look at  this post here .\u00a0 Want to laugh? Read this hysterical post about  how #5 became notorious. \n \n Also? You are  definitely going to want to follow  Caryn  on  Twitter , and   go \"like\" her on her  Facebook  page. \n \n Thank you so much, Caryn, for sharing your large, wonderful, funny, loving family with us here today. \u00a0   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

I fish the the NY Times styles section out of the recycle pile my husband has tossed it into and read it. \n\u00a0  \nBut I'm an autism mom, and let's face it: being fashionable is far, far from the center of my life right now. It's not even on the map. \n \nSo imagine my thrill when, based on my post  Shape Shifting , I was chosen to be one of the moms rescued by the  Moms Fashion File  and given a make-over at BlogHer in the  Secret Style Suite , and then sent out to walk the pink carpet at their lovely   Style Suite Party . \n \nThe day was amazing.\u00a0 I arrived at my appointed time and entered a lovely suite on the top of the Hard Rock Hotel, complete with terraces affording a great view of San Diego. \n \nAfter warm greetings from my lovely, gracious hosts -- Andrea of  SavvySassyMoms , Nicole of  Momtrends , and Alison of  Sassy Moms in the City  -- we took a \"before\" shot: \n \n \n Look, it's \"the green dress\"! \n \nThen I was whisked into the room of many clothes, and I was fully outfitted: \n \n \n\u00a0  \nFirst I was given a set of comfortable underwear from BALI intimates (no I'm not showing you me in THAT!) \n \nAnd  then, after a few false starts, the loveliest party dress just  slipped onto my body and was clearly the one for me: this black lace  over purple satin number from  Kiyonna . The purple is subtle peeking out through the lace, but there.  \n \n \n \n Not the best pic of me - but don't look at me - look at The DRESS! The SHOES! \n \nShoes. What woman doesn't love shoes? And they were giving me a pair. Yay! \n \nBut? They wanted us in heels. I don't wear high high heels. I have some foot issues and also have trouble  walking in them. Yet I was persuaded to try on these puppies from  Dr. Scholl's   (yes, I know I'm horribly pigeon toed, have been all my life, and so is Ethan).  \n \nAnd? People? They were comfortable, shockingly  comfortable. And with a really cushioned footbed and I could (and did)  walk in them and did not fall on my face once all evening. (Yay, me!) \n \nThen I was accessorized with some very interesting jewelry by  Stella & Dot  including a fabulous bracelet (loaner only on the jewelry, sob). \n \nFinally, we picked out a great matching purple bag (in vinyl for good karma) by  Namaste Handbags .  \n \nAnd then it was time to glam me up. A daunting task if ever there was one.... \n \nMy first stop was with celebrity makeup artist  Tia Dantzler .  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd she was a lovely, lovely woman. We chatted about our lives while she made a more glamorous version of me appear like magic. \n \nThen? Hair! Everyone always wants to blow out my curls, and make my  hair straight. Nope. They're a big part of my signature style, close to  my identity. I am a curly-haired woman. \n \nBut once I'd said no to the blow, the talented women of  Detour Salon  did the next best thing - they tamed my curls, made them big and wavy,  softer and without any frizz - magic I tell ya. OK, magic and a lot of  time  spent with curling irons. \n \n \n \nSee the difference?  \n \n \n Half done. Look at those amazing big curls on the right! \n \n \nI still felt like me, but definitely a more fabulous me. \n \n \n \n The hair at its best, before the day softened the transformation \n \n \nEveryone  commented on how lovely my hair looked when I went back to the  conference for the afternoon sessions. \n \n \n \n Me with fabulous hair and BH roomies Alexandra & Shari \n \n \nFinally, I got my nails done by Ginny Cardenas, the force behind  Scotch Naturals .  This is very special nail polish. It's made from non-toxic ingredients, and it's actually good for your nails, instead of drying them out --  can you imagine?! \n \n \n \nThis woman, who created the product line and runs the company,  has an amazing story and there is a whole post in that (which I will  tell at some future point). But lets just say she is another mother  with a mission, and I loved the time I spent with her while she  graciously adorned my fingers AND toes (it having been determined that my  sparkly blue toenails just MUST be transformed into purple to go better  with the dress). \n \nDone! \n \nAnd then, to top it off, I was sent away with over-the-top  amazing gift bag from Lands End: one of their wonderful canvas totes  filled to the brim, including EVERYTHING I needed to take a dip in the  hotel pool on Sunday. \n \n(No, I did NOT swim on Saturday and  ruin the amazing hair & make-up job. I even chose to forgo the  cocktail cruise I had been invited to, figuring wind + hair = disaster.  See I'm not a total beauty/fashion idiot.) \n \nAnd then came evening. It was a lovely party (which I nearly didn't make it to, due to a stalled freight train cutting off the  conference hotel from the rest of town for about an hour, but that's a $15 cab ride and another story). Food! Wine!  Ice Cream!  \n \n \n\u00a0 \nAnd then, for the first (and probably only) time in my life... I was in a fashion show! \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd I did NOT trip and fall on my face. And those shoes  were still comfortable at the end of the evening, when I was back at the  conference hotel, dancing my ass off at BlogHer's traditional late  night Cheese BurgHer party... Amazing! \n \nMany thanks to the party's sponsors: Plum District, Ciao  Bella Gelato (num num num), Johnson's, Stokke, Trop 50 and Windows Phone  for a lovely, lovely evening.\u00a0 And thanks again to the lovely ladies  who styled and beautified me, and most of all to the hostesses with the  mostesses: Andrea, Nicole, and Alison. \n \nYou made this often dowdy fifty year-old mom feel fashionable and fabulous, and I'll never forget that.\u00a0  \n \n \n P.S.\u00a0 I used to wonder why bloggers  would list all the goodies they had  received at their exclusive \"invite only\" events, as it felt like  bragging. But now I understand, because I genuinely want to thank all  the  people who helped make this day possible. As I am feeling very  grateful, I wanted to name the companies involved, and spotlight their  generosity. So if  you hate hearing about other people's swag, I apologize and ask for your  understanding: for me it's all about the thanking.   \n \n P.P.S.\u00a0 Deep apologies for how long it's taken to get this post out. My life exploded when I got back from BlogHer (I'm just unpacking now!)  and then Hurricane Irene threw me for a big loop as I had to scramble to  pick my autistic son up from his camp early and get back before the  storm hit full force, so there went my planned writing time. And did I  mention I have ADD and I just plain suck at deadlines? Yup. Sorry. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, August 31, 2011", "body": "\nI am having a really hard time this week. A really, really hard time. \n \nIt's a limbo week, and that's where I am. Feeling stuck and rudderless in every way imaginable. This is the last full week of \"summer vacation\" and we have no plans and I have no spontaneity left in me. I was going to try to find somewhere for us to go this week, last minute and depending how we all felt. \n \nWe had some options: Vermont to my cousins, a few mid-week days at the beach. But I hadn't counted on Irene and her aftermath. Or on how much my boys after their first week away at sleep-away camp would want to just go home so much. To be, in fact, desperate for HOME. \n \nSo here we are. \n \nI have mountains of laundry and unpacking to do, which I am way too slowly working my way through, thoroughly unmotivated but tired of looking at the suitcases in my living room.  \n \nAnd I am so not doing my best mothering right now, finding my boys on these beautiful last summer days mostly inside: one on the Wii, the other on the computer. We live in New York City. I can't just toss them out into the backyard. There IS no backyard. \n \nAnd I'm on the computer, too. But I'm not writing as I need to, just aimlessly surfing and noting how many more comments and readers other bloggers have. Those by now completely irrelevant BlogHer recap posts that are almost but not quite done? Still undone. I just don't have it in me to finish them. \n \nUntil the upstairs neighbors came home late yesterday all of Ethan's friends were out of town. Jake still has no friends. (And I feel sad and guilty beyond guilt that I haven't been able to do anything about that yet.) So playdates aren't happening.  \n \nAnd the two of them together are just awful right now. Awful. Jake in Ethan's face, talking non-stop. Ethan screaming at his brother to shut up and leave him alone. So separate screens is the best I can do right now. Sigh. Biggest sigh ever. \n \nAnd I am feeling how much this is not how I wanted to parent. I always pictured us as a minimal TV home. Envisioned myself to be the mother leading her kids on nature hikes, visits to the zoo, days at the beach, rainy afternoons spent painting and sculpting, reading books, exploring the city's museums together. Hanging out with other families, frolicking. \n \nBut then again I didn't count on autism, and boys who fight all the time, and my utter exhaustion.  \n \nWhen friends write about how they wish they had another week of summer and how much they are enjoying this relaxed time with their kids it just hammers at my heart. Because that is how I want to feel, it's how I expected I would feel. I DO love my time with my kids but individually, because going out or doing anything with them together is. just. awful. \n \nAnd we are all together 24/7 until school starts right now. And I don't know how I'm going to make it another week and a day. \n \nSo I am one of THOSE moms, desperately waiting for school to start (Thursday the 8th for Ethan, Monday the 12th for Jake). And I hate that. I hate feeling this way. \n \nAnd it's so my instinct is to hide when I feel like this, to disappear. And that's what I was planning to do. But then in my surfing this morning I saw all the tweets about folks who had linked up their posts with ( this week's SNSS guest ) Shell's \"Pour Your Heart Out\" linky. \n \nAnd then I remembered that amazing fact that Aunt Becky had recently written about in  a post , how writing actually helps us heal.  \n \nAnd then I thought \"I'm a blogger, Damn it! I'm not going to curl up inside myself and hide away, I'm going to write about it.\" \n \nSo here's my ugly, all splayed out on the page... screen... whatever. It's not my best post. But it's all I've got today. So it will have to do. \n \n (P.S. Updated this afternoon: It worked! Feeling much better now, about to drag the kids out to the park.  ) \n \n \n \n I'm linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say    (Thanks, Shell) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, August 27, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's  SNSS guest needs no introduction (but of course I'm going to give her one anyway). It is the lovely  Shell  of the blog  Things I Can't Say . Yes, she of the wonderful \"Pour Your Heart Out\" link-up and the weekly \"Blog Friend Feature.\" A community building blogger, if ever there was one.\u00a0 \n \n Did you realize she was a special needs parent? No? Well, she doesn't talk about it all the time, it's not the main focus of her blog, but neither does she hide it. It's there; sometimes explicit, sometimes implicit (especially if you have SN-kid-dar like I do). \n \n Shell has three boys, and her middle child has learning, behavioral and attention disabilities due to severe lead poisoning. If this strikes fear into your heart, it should. This is a terrifying thing for her family to deal with. \n \n Shell is a fierce momma bear, a protector and advocate for all her children.  She is also a special, special person, creating community and good will throughout the bloggosphere. \n \n But the main thing of importance here? Shell is a wonderful writer, telling it straight from the heart, as you will see:\u00a0  \n \n \n\u00a0@@@@@@@ \n \n It\u2019s Just Not Fair  - by Shell \n \nAll siblings fight, right? It\u2019s normal that my boys sometimes call each other names or get physical with each other. \n \nBut sometimes I think it\u2019s made worse by my 5 year-old, my kindergartener A\u2019s difficulties from lead poisoning. \n \nAnd other times, I think it\u2019s made worse by me. \n \nIf A bites his 3 year-old brother, it\u2019s often a result of M having provoked him numerous times. Because A doesn\u2019t really start things with other kids. He is in his own little world.  \n \nWe call it \u201c1-2-3 Explode\u201d since he tends to shrug off the first two things that someone does to him in a short period of time. But, if they keep bugging him, he\u2019s going to explode. And it\u2019s almost always in a worse way than what another child was doing to him. \n \nIn his mind, his brother was doing something to him so he was going to fight back. He doesn\u2019t have that concept of \u201cworse\u201d actions. Like how we view a brother biting as being worse than hitting. To him, it\u2019s all bad. \n \nAnd while I cannot give him a free pass on the biting, I tend to get frustrated at M, for starting it in the first place. He knows better. Yes, even at 3, he knows better. \n \nOr maybe A and his 6 year-old brother J will be having an argument. Names are flying. \u201cPoopy brother\u201d and \u201cButthead\u201d are common. I remind them that we don\u2019t talk potty talk unless we are in the bathroom.\u00a0 But, then J will get really frustrated and call A \u201cStupid\u201d or \u201cDumb.\u201d \n \nAnd I get so angry. A is NOT stupid. \n \nBut, then again,\u00a0 J is not a butthead either. And yet, I didn\u2019t get that mad at A. \n \nSometimes it\u2019s the little things. It\u2019s snack time and I let A choose his snack first because small things, like not having the snack he had his mind set on, can make him meltdown. \n \nAt dinnertime, if J or M don\u2019t like what we are having, that\u2019s just too bad. But if A is about to shut down because he\u2019s hungry and he is focused on having a peanut butter and jelly, I\u2019ll give in. \n \nWhen it\u2019s time to clean up and A sometimes squats down on the floor with his hands over his ears, I ignore him while encouraging the other two to continue to pick up their toys. \n \nThese incidents don\u2019t happen all the time, but they are a regular part of our life. Because of the way that A can shut down, I have to decide what is worth the battle.\u00a0  \n \nSometimes I look at what\u2019s going on, sigh and think that\u2019s not a hill I want to die on today. \n \nBut, I don\u2019t give his brothers a free pass like that.\u00a0 Because they don\u2019t need it. \n \nI wonder how much they resent their brother for it. I wonder how much they resent me for it. \n \nBecause it\u2019s really not fair at all. \n \nBut, it\u2019s not fair that their brother has lead poisoning, either. \n \nIt\u2019s not fair that M can join in with A\u2019s soccer practice better than A can. It\u2019s not fair that J can waltz off to his classroom without needing any help and A needs help in staying focused on where he\u2019s supposed to go. \n \nSo, yes, they are treated differently. Because they are different. \n \nI just hope as they grow up, they can learn to love each other for those differences. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n This post is sad and moving and way too true. It is a struggle so many of us share.  I know this is a painful topic for Shell, and I want to thank her for opening up her heart to \"pour it out\" here with us.  \n \n I can't even begin to tell you how many times Ethan wails \"it's not fair\" when I make him do stuff Jacob gets a total free pass on. \n \nI have occasionally snapped \"Okay, do you want to trade? Do you want to be the one with autism?\" at him when I just can't stand it any more. I'm not proud of it, but it actually shuts that down pretty fast. So, yes, Shell, I can totally relate. \n \n OK, so now that you have read Shell here, you are going to want to follow her home. So go read her at  her blog  Things I Can't Say .\u00a0 \n \n You may want to start with this incredibly heart rending post, where Shell talks about  her son's lead poisoning , or this one about how  being fair  does not mean everyone always gets the same. Or, in a lighter vein, try this one about a mom-fail involving  TWO self-imposed haircuts  in one week. \n \n Finally, you should follow  Shell  on  Twitter , and   go \"like\" her on her  Facebook  page,  because if there is a blogger with a bigger heart than Shell? I haven't met her. \n \n And once again, Shell, thank you from the bottom of MY heart. You have truly touched me with your post this week. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, September 6, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nI miss my childhood, sometimes, when adult life weighs heavily upon me, the constant needs of others, mostly my children, threatening to drag me under.\u00a0  \n \nWhen I am on hands and knees cleaning up a bathroom floor thoroughly splattered in one son\u2019s vomit while my other son calls out to me complaining of the smell, begging me to come to him because he does not want to lie alone in the odoriferous dark. \n \nI miss my childhood most when I am ill, yet still taking care of little people, instead of being tucked into bed myself, steam from the bowl of chicken soup my mother has carefully placed on the rickety metal folding table wafting up, salty pretzels and ginger ale rounding out the prescriptive meal for a nasty strep throat.  \n \nWhat I miss from my childhood are moments: running wild in the  Daktari  sandpits with my cousins; bouncing on my bed for hours with a friend while eating dot candy;\u00a0 crashing through the waves with my father at Jones Beach on a hot summers day; sitting, mesmerized by the fireplace at Sacks Lodge on a frigid winter night; falling asleep in the back seat of a long drive home, my head in my mother\u2019s lap, breathing in her Shalimar and the night air; my first real kiss.  \n \nAnd also the era.  \n \nMy childhood is the 60\u2019s.\u00a0  \n \nI turned 8 and 9, those seminal kid years, in 1968 and 1969; years which were also seminal to modern culture, when so much changed, happened, emerged, transformed: Woodstock, the assassinations (MLK, RFK), moon landing, Laugh-in, the Tet Offensive, Prague Spring, Andy Warhol, heart transplants, Charles Manson, the Chicago Seven, The Beatles, UNIX, bell bottoms, Sesame Street\u2026 \n \nAn era I have layers upon layers of thoughts and feelings about. My now adult understanding of it above all, but underneath?\u00a0 That childhood glow surrounding times lived through, golden and suffused throughout, the images crystalline, sharp-edged while simultaneously encased in amber. \n \nI miss my childhood, sometimes, but there is mostly so much I am glad to have broken free of, from my childhood.  \n \nDo not get me wrong, my childhood was not doom and gloom. There were certainly many joys; there were those thousand brilliant moments; there was laying in fields of wildflowers baking in the sun; lobster birthday dinners eaten with hedonistic abandon; I was - and knew I was - well loved by my gentle parents. \n \nBut what I do not miss is my childhood self: anxious, awkward, isolated, painfully shy, over-sensitive (SPD), easily overwhelmed, un-centered, uncomfortable in her own skin, cocooned in fantasy, brilliant but clueless. \n \nThat is not me now, has not been me for so long I must cast far to remember it. \n \nI miss my childhood, sometimes.  \n \nBut mostly I revel in my children\u2019s childhood.  \n \nCreating the memories with them that they will suffuse with their own golden glow upon recollection; me the mother, whose Tea Rose they will breathe in with the night air as we travel the long way home from our adventures. \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  Write on Edge  (formerly The Red Dress Club).

{"date": "Monday, August 29, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Photo source: NASA Goddard Photo \n \nI figure having shared  my neurotic fixation  on the coming hurricane with you (you\u2019re welcome) I have to write about the actual event, right? \n \nWell, here in my neighborhood, New York City's Upper West Side (UWS)? A nearly non-event.  \n \nWe live on high ground with solid bedrock underneath, in a brick apartment building built nearly 100 years ago when things were made to last, well, centuries. We\u2019re on a single digit floor, high enough to look at thrashing tree tops, but well below the strong shearing winds. Safe. \n \nThe drive to pick up Jake from camp and bring him back to NYC was a bit hairy, with bands of drenching rain coming out of nowhere and then disappearing completely. But it was mostly the tension of having to make it back before the bridges and tunnels closed (most never did) combined with everyone's anxiety, as well as my own, that made it intense. \n \nReally, I've driven through worse thunderstorms. Two so far this summer, in fact. \n \nAnd while I had called and e-mailed like the crazy woman I was on Thursday campaigning to get Jake's camp to close a day early (it did), I was sad to have to miss the closing ceremony planned for Sunday, which was to have been a lovely family event. \n \nI had been hoping to connect with other local autism families and possibly even make connections with the parents of kids Jake had been particularly drawn to during his week, ever seeking to help him have a true friendship spark. \n \nAlso? I love any chance to hang out with special needs / autism parents. We're a big-hearted, tempered-tough breed, usually with a good sense of gallows humor (at least the folks I like to hang with have one). \n \nAnd I missed that. It was more of a \"grab your kid and run before the storm\" situation. Packing had clearly been done in a hurry. And since 3 of the 12 kids at camp were named Jacob? Yeah, we have some other kids' T-shirts and I'm sure they've got some of my guy's stuff. \n \nI still haven't completely inventoried what has gone missing yet. But the most important thing - the irreplaceable  blue bear ? Safe and sound with us. \n \nOthers have not been so lucky. My heart goes out to them \n \nI have spoken with friends in the suburbs and the country without power, those whose children were deeply frightened by crashing trees and rising waters. \n \nA blogger you may know - Kelcey of the Mama Bird Diaries - has been flooded out of her home, and for God knows how long. She has young children, it's going to be rough, so go show her some support,  here . (And, amazingly, she's kept her sense of humor intact.) \n \nVermont is in bad shape, having never dreamed, landlocked and deeply northern, that a tropical storm could impact, devastate them so. \n \nHere there are a few trees down, but the sun was shining today and all the world seemed back to business as usual. We were out and about, too. The boys and I treated ourselves to Shake Shack for dinner tonight, and the joint was hopping. \n \nI was pissy about folks complaining, whining  about the \"big deal about nothing\" and feeling that the city shouldn't have shut down. \n \n\"I'd rather be over-prepared than under-prepared, wouldn't you?\" I asked them, reminding them that there were people who lost lives, places where it wasn't \"nothing\" at all. (Yeah, I was a bit of a bitch today.) \n \nAnd now we're back to trying to find ways to fill these last days of summer before back-to-school-ness takes over our lives. We will be getting busy, soon. \n \nThere are still mountains of musty smelling camp laundry to be done, bags to be unpacked from all our journeys (including my BlogHer swag bag - what the hell is IN there, anyway?) And summer's curls to be shorn, and school supplies to be hunted and gathered. \n \nWe are moving on. \n \nGoodnight, Irene, now fizzling out over the deep blue Northern sea. \n \nYour winds whipped down our street, you rains lashed our windows; and soon you will be a story we tell... where and how we danced with Irene. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, August 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n I am not someone who feels anxiety easily; or often. \n \nThat's the good news. \n \nThe bad news is that my tolerance for anxiety? Very low. \n \nSo on those rare occasions when I DO feel anxious? \n \nI'm a nut. A total blithering mess. Fruit loops. \n \nIf I talked to you, or left you a voice message, or sent you an e-mail today, you completely know what I'm talking about. \n \nYes, today was one such day. \n \nAnd what has me so cranked up to 11?  \n \nThe boys are both away at summer camp for the first time this week, so  as I'd mentioned,  I'm a bit off balance from that. \n \nBut what has completely unhinged me is the hurricane thing. Irene. Headed for my fair city of New York as we speak. \n \nAnd then? Up through New England, like where Jacob is at camp right now, and where I was supposed to have picked him up at about 2 pm on Sunday, which is currently right about the time Irene is predicted to make landfall in the New York area. \n \nSo, um, yeah. something's gotta change. \n \nAnd I leave at 7 AM tomorrow morning to pick up Ethan at HIS camp in Pennsylvania.  \n \nWe had all sorts of plans and rendezvous with friends planned, and now it's all gone to hell in a handbasket and I'm scrambling to figure out when and how I will be scooping my Jacob boy up and running him back home... \n \nI was going to say \"to safety\" but really? I'm bringing him home into a category one or two hurricane. \n \nBut we live on high ground in a brick building, so I assume we're OK.\u00a0 And we don't really need to take public transportation anywhere, being in walking distance of so pretty much everything. \n \nAnd Ethan would love to live on breakfast cereal and cookies and crackers and other such \"non-perishable food items\" for three days, so that's all good. \n \nBut I had things I was supposed to DO today -- enjoy my last day of \"empty nest\"... clean up my apartment... do laundry... finish my TWO post BlogHer11 posts including my \"Secret Style Session\" re-cap which is DUE today at the latest. \n \nBut all I can do is watch the hurricane updates on TV and my computer, and send nutty emails to Jake's camp director, and call everyone to set up contingency plans and find places to sleep along the route, and mostly spend all my time running \"if this, then that, but if this other thing, then that other thing\" scenarios through my head. \n \nYou ever see a dog who has decided to try to catch his tail and will. not. stop. until he has it in his teeth, spinning faster, ever faster in circles on the rug, as that thing he MUST catch just keeps jumping out of his reach? \n \nMe, today. \n \nMy brain on anxiety: not a pretty picture. \n \nI believe the term \"hot mess\" was coined for such a state.  \n \nSo ladies of Mom's Fashion File and all your wonderful sponsors, please forgive me for not getting my post in on time. I will try to finish it from the road on Friday, but may be too busy jumping out of my skin while watching CNN. (In the meantime, readers, go read my friend Cheryl's WONDERFUL account of the event here on  BlogHer ) \n \nOK, time to catch a few hours of shut-eye before I head off to  my doom  pick up my sons from camp. \n \nI feel sad that I have to pick Jake up early, that he won't get his full week away, but safety first my friends. Safety first. \n \nMy tail! I think I've finally got... oh, damn, there it goes again....  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

This is going to look awfully familiar, because we were back at the in-laws' Great Barrington house again this year. \n \nWhich means a lot of swimming in the pool, Jake in  love with the car, and me obsessed with the magnificent flowers in  Patty's lovely garden.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n At camp welcoming ceremony with Jake \n \nWell, the boys are both at camp and we haven't gotten a phone call to come scoop them up yet, so I've got my fingers crossed that nobody gets injured and the phone call never comes, and this experiment will turn out to have been a whopping success. \n \nI'm still stunned, and reeling. Delighted by the freedom and missing them fierce, all at the same time. \n \nI got home yesterday at about 6 pm, after driving Jake up to camp in the Berkshires on Sunday and then staying overnight up there with friends, not wanting to do the round trip all in one day. \n \nI was supposed to leave in the morning, but I was having so much fun being a grown-up, socializing as me and not as \"mom,\" I stayed through lunch. It was the most vacation-like 24 hours I'd had all summer, and it was glorious. \n \nLast night my husband had plans to go out to dinner with friends and I spontaneously called up a dear friend and had dinner with her, myself. Did you catch that word \"spontaneously\"? Been missing from my vocabulary for, well, nine years now. \n \nWalking out the door yesterday evening without making plans for children, hiring a sitter, calculating how long to stay out (the \"is the extra hour of fun worth the extra hour of sitter\" quotient)? Glorious. And strange. \n \nStrolling with my husband down Riverside Drive on our way to our respective dinners, I was positively giddy. \n \nBut today, I've felt a little un-moored all day. \"Mom\" is so at the core of my identity, I don't know who I am if I'm not caring for or planning for the care of little ones.  \n \nEven when I was across the country at BlogHer, I was still calling, getting texts, still the one \"in charge\" of arrangements, even if the execution of them was in other hands.\u00a0 I had even gotten a 3:30 AM call from my husband one morning, California time, needing to know where to find the boys' lunch boxes. (Scared the bejeesus out of my roomies, too.) \n \nBut this? This is hand them over and then pick them up. Totally out of my hands. Totally unprecedented. \n \nBut the instincts, they don't just go away, even when the brain says \"stop.\" \n \nTonight at about 6 pm, at the time when even if the boys had been out and about all day they would surely be home and needing to be fed, I was jumpy. I just couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to be doing SOMETHING for SOMEONE. Nope.  \n \nI am going to try my hardest to enjoy my last 2 days of freedom. I have a lot to do, busy, busy days planned, but I will be sleeping in Wednesday and Thursday. 6 AM wake-ups, 7 days a week for years on end has been brutal. \n \nAnd I'm going to try to quench the little back-of the-mind voices that are worrying about my boys. Especially Jake who seemed so barely ready for this, about whom I went back and forth, and back and forth before deciding to go through with it. \n \nIt's so hard with him, to know how much he actually understands about what is going on around him. I have often both under- AND over- estimated his comprehension of situations. \n \nI'd been doing my best to prepare him: writing social stories, reading  Arthur Goes to Camp  together. The whole ride up I talked about how long a week was, reminded him I'd be leaving him but would definitely, no matter what, be back to pick him up the next Sunday. \n \nWe had arrived at camp just in time for the opening ceremony, and as we sat together through the songs and heartfelt, cheery welcomes, Jake turned to me every few minutes and asked \"Are you leaving now, Mom?\" So, yeah, I guess that part had sunk in.  \n \nYou know you're at ASD camp when someone stands in front of the group to introduce himself \"Hi, I'm Dan...\" and a voice from the peanut gallery pipes up \"You're short!\" Luckily Dan had a sense of humor and we all laughed. \n \nYou also know you're at a special needs camp when there are large kids screaming and crying and carrying on about separating from their parents. My heart went out to those kids and moms while I secretly thanked every supreme being I'd ever heard of that it wasn't MY kid. \n \nJake was amazing, giving me a warm hug and kiss and saying goodbye... and then going off with the group, like he did that every day. He never ceases to surprise me. \n \nEthan was nervous about fitting in, but as he's at camp with three good friends, I'm sure he's having a great time. And even if he's miserable, it's only five days, right? \n \nOn Friday morning I leave early (6 AM wake-up again. SIGH.) to go fetch Ethan. And he'll have a day with me, Jacob-free, which should please him immensely. And then Sunday we drive up to get Jake, and then it's full-time family time once again. For the two more weeks until school begins. \n \nThe moment I see their faces once again, I know how much I've missed them will come flooding over me, and I'll try not to embarrass them too much with my tears and kisses.  \n \nWithin hours of their being home, I know these five child-free days will seem like a fever dream, a distant memory... like lazy Sunday mornings, or having a waist.  \n \nBut for now I'm going to try to lay the strangeness and anxieties aside, and milk this time dry. Go to the movies - spontaneously! Eat something Ethan loves - and NOT have to share it with him. Shout something to my husband from one room to the next in the late evening and not worry about waking a sleeping child. Sleep naked. Step out at midnight, just to look at the moon and the stars. \n \nGlorious.  \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, August 21, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nCan you believe a whole fortnight has passed since the last  Blog Gems - Air Your Archives  link-up? Me neither. What has happened to TIME this summer? \n \nWe've been so busy vacationing and preparing for vacationing (so much work I need a vacation from THAT) and this year for the FIRST TIME preparing to send the boys off to a week of sleep-away summer camp (sob, my baaaaabies, sob). Ethan is going with friends, and Jake is going to a special ASD camp where we hope he will find friends. \n \nSo while we are off depositing our kids in different states today, you.... \n \nCome! link up! Tell all your friends! I promised my friend Jen her lovely linky meme would be alive and well when she brings it back home to her blog,  The King and Eye,  some time in the fall (or whenever she's ready). So don't make a liar out of me.  \n \n This is what Jen says about Blog Gems: \nHow many posts do you have languishing in your archives? Great posts   \nthat will never be dusted off and brought out to breathe again! Maybe   \nyou created fabulous content before you had lots of followers, or maybe \n  you have been blogging for years and your current followers haven't  \nseen  your older material.  \n \nBlog Gems - Air Your Archives is a fortnightly linky list where  we will\n  give a prompt and you select a post from your archives that fits  the \n prompt. You do not have to create content for the prompt, unless  you  \nwant to. All you have to do is copy and paste the url of the post  into \n the linky list. Voila, an old post gets a second shot!  \n \nTo take part:  \n \n1. Follow MY blog for now (and  Jen's blog  once I hand her back the reins) to get future Blog Gem posting information and linkys.  \n \n2. Grab the Blog Gem button and place it on your sidebar (html code  here ).\n  Putting the button on your blog is not a deal-breaker, some  people  \njust don't like doing it and I have no problem with that at all.  What I\n  will say is that something like this can't be successful without  \n'word  of mouth' so I would appreciate if you could find another way to \n let  people know that this is available and they are welcome to join \nin.  \n \n3. Enter your link.  \n \n4. Read and comment on the submissions of the two blogs posted before you on the linky list. (Please!)  \n \n5. Help spread the word by telling your blogging friends, either by tweeting this or blogging about your entry.  \n \n And here's what I have to add: \nIt's a wonderful chance to get fresh eyeballs on your great posts from the past. People tend to put in recent posts because they're freshly in our radar, but I would encourage rooting around in your archive and dredging stuff up that's deeply buried, if you can. \n \nThe rule is that you're supposed to select a post from your  archives  \nthat fits the prompt... but, being the generous, kind-hearted person  \nthat Jen is, it's a lenient rule. She states:   \"Broad interpretations of the prompt are encouraged so this could be a good chance to be creative!\" \n \nAnd now the theme (you may have guessed it)... as I'm currently wallowing in end-of-summer bittersweetness and nostalgia, full of feelings as my boys are about to go off to camp alone for the first time in our lives, this week's prompt is:   Endings and Transitions \u00a0  \n \n Endings and Transitions... things that are over or about to be over... changing over to a new regime, or just the little daily transitions (that some of us have such trouble with). Take this as large or small as you want to go...  the end of a day, a relationship, an era. Personal or political... macro or micro... happy or sad (or some of each)... have fun! \n \nReady? Good. Go link up!\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

When this has happened before, (and it has) I was able to shuffle the schedule around or beg a speedy post from a kind and accommodating blogger. \n \nBut this week, I just couldn't do the hustle and scramble involved in that.

{"date": "Sunday, August 14, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nToday's SOC Sunday was inspired by another post that I read today, a really important one, this one, here:\u00a0 This Is Not Really About Cake \n \n \n \n \n \nIn it, Mocha Momma calls upon the bloggosphere to be brave and talk about race in a real and substantial way. Please go read that post. (And down into the comments, the one from Suebob, it's brilliant.) \n \nThis deserves more than a quick SOC Sunday post from me, and it will get one one day. But also one of the things that holds me back from writing about race is my tendency to over-think things. And the more important they are, the more so this tendency. \n \nRace is such a hot topic, as in potentially dynamite. It is a touchstone. I want so much to not make mistakes in this sensitive area, to never, ever hurt anyone's feelings. And so caution makes me timid, which I abhorr. \n \nSo I'm going to just open up here on the first thing that came to mind as I thought: What can I say about this? My story is a bit off the center, but it's what I can bring today. \n \nSoon I will delve deeper, into the swirling mess of contradictory notions that stream through my head when I start to try to untangle all my thoughts and feelings on race. There are clearly more posts here, and I won't let them die in my head for fear of exposing myself. \n \nBecause what we don't talk about festers under the surface, unless exposed to fresh air and sunshine. Or moonlight. So, here is a start... \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nOne of the many reasons I've been thinking about race lately is that Jake keeps bringing it up. Well, not exactly. He brings up the color of people's skin, but to him that has nothing to do with race, he has no notion of race -- an abstract concept if ever there was one. \n \nOne of the things I admire most about my son Jacob, one of the ways his autism is a gift, is his colorblindness. He doesn't see white people, brown people; Asian people, Latino people... he sees... people. \n \nOr rather, he sees the different colors we come in and to him it is merely color -\u00a0 a favorite topic these days:\u00a0 Eye, hair and skin color differences are all just ... interesting to him for their visual component. There is absolutely NO value that is attached to any of these differences, no preconceived notions, no expectations that go along with the color of a person's skin or the texture of their hair to my son. \n \nAnd he is very conversational these days, and very observant, so while we are out and about on the streets of New York City - where people always come in every size, shape, age and color - he wants to talk about the people he sees... So I end up having very public discussions with Jacob about race. \n \n\"What color is his skin, mommy?\" Jake will ask in his too loud voice about a man standing in front of us on line. And I have learned to not flinch, to answer, matter of factly, the question asked, knowing there \nis no judgment in the slightest little way behind it, just... observation and conversation. \n \n\"His is skin is \nbrown, Jake\" I'll say, \"And isn't it wonderful that people come in so many different \nbeautiful shades of beige, tan and brown?\" Truthfully, that latter part is probably more for the people who might be listening than for Jacob, because he already knows all this, instinctively. \n \nJacob has warm feelings towards nearly everybody he sees. He does not\n parse into \"like me\" and \"not like me.\"\u00a0 I wish I could be more like \nhim.  \n \nI will never succeed, having lived in the world too \nlong as a white person, knowing what that means, the automatic \nbelow-the-conscious-unless-I-work-to-be-aware level of privilege that \nwraps me in, that I bring with me everywhere just because of where the \nball landed in my genetic roulette spin. \n \nBut Jacob? He is free of this. \nHis classmates are generally more brown than white, his teachers have often been \ntoo. To him, this, his world is just an interesting rainbow of shades. \nHe talks about skin color the same way he talks about eye color, hair color or the color of someone's shirt. Exactly the same. Observationally. \n\u00a0  \nPeople say we learn from our children, but when they have \nspecial needs \nthere is a tendency to forget this, to get so, so stuck in \"teaching them\" \nmode that\n we forget they can have important lessons for us, too, can be *our* leaders. \nThis is something I hope Jacob can teach me, to bring me into his colorblindness.  \n \nHe declares that he and I are pinkish beige (and we are). We talk \nabout how humans are not ever purple or green. And always: \"You know that while we are different on the outside, we're all the same on the inside, human.\" But again, I don't need to tell him that. \n \nHe knows. My son, the autistic one, he gets it.  \n \n \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n \nOK, I must confess this was NOT a true stream of consciousness post. I went way over time, I went back and edited it. A lot (because this topic seemed too important for sloppy and unclear writing). But it came out of the free writing I did this morning on race, attempting to do a SOC Sunday post, so I still want to let it stand here, link it up. (I don't think Fadra will mind, right? Especially since I fessed up?) \n \nNext time, I promise: true random brain dump, unedited (watch out, world!) \n \nAlso, please, bloggers who are reading this? I know you think about race, too. Join in the discussion. Write your own post exploring how race affects your life. Let's keep this dialogue going.... \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.  \nNo   proofreading or spell-checking. This is writing in the raw. \n \n You can do it, too!\u00a0 Click on the picture link and let's hear your 5 minutes of brilliance... \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

This was found a few weeks ago in the bathroom of the Hungarian Pastry Shop in Morningside Heights in New York City. The walls are usually covered with graffiti (it's a popular hang-out for the Columbia University crowd), but about once a year they repaint to give a clean slate to the bathroom philosophers. \n\u00a0  \nWant to see it closer up? \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd I agree.

{"date": "Thursday, August 18, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Mom and Dad, summer vacation 1973 \n \nIt comes up at odd times, this missing my Dad, now dead almost a year and a half. We're on vacation this week (hence the quiet blog) back at the in-laws house in the Berkshires (thanks, Jim\u00a0and Pat!) and so there's\u00a0that back-again-in-a-place-we've-been-year-after-year quality to everything here.  \n \nLast year my husband had to leave us on our own for most of the vacation to go attend to his ill, soon-to-die mother. Last year I was still raw and newly grieving my father, still recovering from the harrowing end. This year we carry two newish ghosts with us. \n \nA\u00a0year and a half is a long enough time that I no longer think of my father daily. He is fading from the front of my consciousness much the way he faded from his own life in\u00a0his last few years. But some times, some places bring him back into sharp focus for me, the tang of missing sharp and immediate again. \n \nAt the end,\u00a0though he was still alive, the ill, dying father was so present, dominating my life completely for the last\u00a0five or so months of his, that the other man, my wonderful, wonderfully alive father was eclipsed, all but lost to me.\u00a0I called him up to write  my eulogy , but still, for a long time spontaneous thoughts of father brought up a husk of a man,\u00a0lost inside his own mind, howling in senseless pain, needing to move on but still somehow stuck in his near useless body. \n \nNow that\u00a0the memories of those last, dreadful months are thankfully fading, I am finding myself bombarded at moments with visions of the father I knew and loved for my many years. It's a new phase of grieving I suppose, and also, I believe I am feeling my way into\u00a0the relationship I will have with my father -\u00a0my memory-father\u00a0- for the rest of my life. \n \nThe Berkshires are a place I had been with my parents a few times in our lives. Also, most notably, they hold an important place in my family mythos: my parents met at The Music Inn in Stockbridge one summer, 53 years ago. \n \nAlso, summer vacations were important times for my family, full of happy memories for me, of time enjoyably spent with my hard working parents, having tremendous fun together. \n \nWhatever the reason, my father is very present with me on\u00a0this trip. We pass\u00a0a sign on\u00a0a building, nearly daily as we drive about Great Barrington: \"Caligari\u00a0& Sons Construction\" and every time I hear my father's voice in my head making a joke about what  strange kind of cabinets  they would build. \n \nWe drive up the road to my old childhood camp (where I went only one summer, but was wonderful and transformative for me nonetheless) to deliver paperwork for Jacob's upcoming week away, and I am flooded with memories of my parents coming to visit on Visitors Day. \n \nWe go to dinner at a local tavern (burgers and fries for the kids, what a surprise) and there is an old man sitting with his family at a booth across the room. I keep looking up, seeing him, and for a moment thinking it's my father, and the next moment feeling the sharp tap just above my heart that reminds me it can't be, not ever again. \n \nHello, Dad. It's nice to have you with me again, if only in memory. Mom misses you something fierce, every day. I carry your sense of humor, your delight in the absurd and unusual, about with me every day of my life.  \n \nBecoming a parent has taught me much about how apples don't fall far from trees. I'm glad you were my tree, Dad. Very glad, indeed. \n \n \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, August 13, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's  SNSS guest is the lovely  Gina St. Aubin  of  Special Happens . If anyone would know that it does? It is Gina. She has a busy family with three children, with  her eldest , J being multiply challenged.\u00a0 \n \n I mean multiply: Cerebral Palsy, Autism, Sensory Processing Disorder, and, most devastatingly, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS), a rare epileptic disorder. As part of this last, J experiences a severe sleep disturbance in that he does. not. sleep. Hardly ever. \n \n And then Gina has a three year old son and a  four year old daughter  to care for as well. (Are you getting tired just reading this? I am.) \n \n All this, and Gina still finds the time, energy and fortitude to be an advocate for special needs children, parents and families. She champions our children. She is inspiring to read.  \n \n And yet, she also has  her struggles , her soul's midnights. And that is where she has come from to write this post she shares with us today. \n \n Some SNSS posts are heartwarming and light, celebrating brotherly or sisterly love. This is not one of them. This one is about that stuff that hits the fan.\u00a0 \n \n It breaks my heart to read, and also I nod, knowingly, understanding because, well, I do.  \n \n So come, read the  story  Gina has brought, here:\u00a0 \u00a0  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n When a Brother's Love Hurts  - by Gina St. Aubin \n \n \u201cMommy! J is hitting meeeeee!\u201d  B pleads. \n \n \u201cMooom, J bite me!\u201d  B says angrily. \n \n \u201cSTOP J!\u201d\u00a0  enforces B as strongly as he can before J goes back for more. \n \u201cMOM! J won\u2019t stop hitting me. He kick me.\u00a0 MOOOOOOOOOOOOM!\u201d.... \n \nI watch B and worry, heart aching for all that he\u2019s enduring, the likelihood of just how this is shaping him\u2026 \n \nHe is caring, sharing, kind, funny and gentle, yet can be rough and tumble.\u00a0 He loves who he loves, will follow in your lead but stand firm when you\u2019re turning down a path he is adamant not to trend.\u00a0 Strong, brave, lighthearted... breakable. \n \nThis three year old endures the strikes. The torments. The kicks, pulls, pushes, strains, bites. Slaps upon the head. All he absorbs, he does so with tears. \n \nCries for help. Pleas for someone to make it all stop; though there are times I come to find that he\u2019s enduring without the tears. Silently turning to huddle inward, protecting what he can until the tormentor moves on\u2026. \n \nHe just wants to play with his brother. His brother, 8, has Autism. His brother who is his tormentor... and his playmate; the boy he looks up to, enjoys, loves so fully. \n \nHe seems to hold onto the times they have fun, laughing and squealing like the best of friends. Play for chunks of time where no injuries are received, where no pain is felt, and only the laughter of childhood friends fill the room. \n \nI love these times. They remind me that J is \u2018normal\u2019 in many ways. He still wants to have some of the many interactions that a NT child wants. He still is a sibling, still has sibling rivalry. \n \nThese times also remind me also that his siblings see him for who he is rather than a person ravaged daily with epilepsy along with climbing the daily mountains of autism and more.\u00a0 These times are the times I see our family as it would be if things weren\u2019t as they are.\u00a0 Yet still I measure the actions, the sounds, the level of laughter or energy, or excitement.\u00a0 Because of... well... the OTHER times...  \n \nThe first I thing I should tell you is that these aren\u2019t \u2018beatings\u2019 (don\u2019t call a caseworker, no serious injuries have ever been received), they ARE NOT extremely forceful exhibits of hostility so much as excitement drawn out in less-than-soft swings filled with a lack of impulse control. \n \nBut, it is my three year old getting hurt by my 8 year old. It is my NT child being hurt by my severely NOT NT child.\u00a0 It is tearing me up inside just as much as it\u2019s impressing upon him. \n \nI\u2019m torn with duties, with raising and guiding my kids to be independent, strong, self-confident beings able to run and wreak havoc on the world.\u00a0 I can\u2019t watch the kids every second of the day, without decidedly never making them a meal. \n \nGoing to the bathroom, folding laundry or even picking up a toy in the \nnext room simply leaves too much time for altercations to occur, yet I \nstill want to foster a good sibling relationship. I try to allow room for them to work things out and negotiate with one another, becoming the people they will become in the future, with experiences and understanding of relationships under their belt... while keeping them safe.\u00a0 That\u2019s my primary duty... keeping them safe.  \n \nSo, I worry about him... my B.\u00a0 My three year old with a heart of gold. He loves his brother with more love than I knew a sibling\u2019s heart could hold - but, is he learning to succumb to the abuses of others? \n \nWill he become a victim? Am I teaching him to stand up for himself by coming to his rescue and then giving him the words and actions to keep himself safe?\u00a0 Will he be strong?\u00a0 Will they keep their relationship of loving brothers? Will his innocence be smashed? \n \nAm I keeping him safe?  \n \nI\u2019m trying... I come to the rescue. I come running, often. I hurt often, hearing his cries.\u00a0 I wonder... how much is J\u2019s hurting him... hurting him!?!? \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n This is a brave, brave post for Gina to write. It is so hard to talk about the things we don't have answers for, only questions upon questions. \n \n  It's hard and brave to write about fears, about those bone-chilling places where we worry that our best just isn't good enough, and harm is coming to our children. Mostly we slap rosy paint over this stuff, or try to hide it away in our brain's back closet. \n \u00a0 \n \n So I applaud you, Gina for voicing the secret thoughts so many of us have and are afraid to speak of, for fear of being judged, by our own selves and others. Thank you. Truly, thank you. \n \n And now that you have read Gina here, please follow her home to her blog,   Special Happens , where she is creating a wonderful space for connection and communication about special needs parenting.\u00a0 \n \n Start with  this post , about what autism means to her, and then maybe  this one , and  this one , about being the parent of a special needs child. Or, for a lighter moment,  this one  about how a snow day began, last winter.\u00a0 \u00a0   \n \n Besides writing on her own blog, Gina is a regular contributor at the  5 Minutes for Special Needs  site, among others.

It is also my one year anniversary of posting for Hopeful Parents, my 13th post over there.\u00a0 Last year I had asked to begin on the 10th of August, thought to commemorate my 50th birthday with my first Hopeful Parents post. \n \nWhat I had failed to calculate was that this meant that every year I will now have a post due on my birthday. So be it; it's a great chance for reflection, looking back over the landscape of the year just flown by. \n \nSo what has changed in a year? Mostly that  the new school  I had so hoped would be good for Jacob turned out to be wonderful beyond our wildest dreams, a great place for him to grow and learn. \n \nJake still does not yet  have a friend . But we're working on that, have high hopes for the coming school year. \n \nBut besides all of Jacob's  wonderful developments ? It is also true that my son grows both  older and stranger , adolescence looming a few heartbeats away. \n \nI've been reading a lot of posts from friends lately about their slightly older autistic kids entering new stages of meltdowns and more, and frankly, it's got me a bit spooked. \n \nSo come read me over at Hopeful Parents today as I contemplate some   Cautionary Tales . \n \nSee you back here tomorrow. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2011", "body": "\nMy birthday is tomorrow, the 10th, but as I'm posting this so late at night, well, by the time you read it, it most certainly WILL be my birthday. \n \nI can't really put up a birthday post on the 10th because that's my Hopeful Parents posting day, so all you will find on the 10th is my jumper post leading you to read me on the Hopeful Parents site. (Note to self: WRITE the damn HP post already, OK?) \n \nAnd so I am posting though I don't have much to say. Or rather I have so much to say that it is an amorphous swirl in my brain, not coalescing into anything near brilliance anytime soon. And so I'm breaking all the rules here. Handing you a ruminating ramble today. Because it's (nearly) my birthday and I can do what I want to, right? \n \nI am SUPPOSED to put up my fabu BlogHer11 recap post by today, or certainly tomorrow (not gonna happen) and I have also been told it is imperative to have something really wonderful, a strong post I'd prepared in advance to slap up on the old blog to wow folks that I met at the conference who are coming by to visit for the first time (also, clearly not happening). \n \nWhat I am, mostly, right now, is a (by the time you're reading tihs) 51 year-old woman who is tired. Really really tired. Bone weary tired. \n \nThe BlogHer conference was wonderful and strange and so different from my day-to-day existance that now that I'm back in the thick of things it feels like a dream. One of those powerful dreams you mull over the next day in your waking state and want to write down the details of upon awakening so as not to lose the lessons therein; but a dream, nonetheless. \n \nFor four days I didn't have to think about what other people were wearing or eating or their bathroom habits. OK, maybe I had to THINK about it, as I did have 2 (wonderful) roommates who DID want me to eat with them and consult on outfits and we DID have to negotiate our showers so as to all be able to be on time. But I wasn't RESPONSIBLE for any of that for anyone but me. \n \nSo for four days I was off the hook of mothering responsibilities. And It. Was. Glorious. I could have been at the worst conference in the world, and I would have still been in heaven. But instead I was at a pretty terrific one. With some great people. In San Diego. California. On the West Coast. For the first time in nine years. \n \nI love being a mother. I wouldn't trade that job in for anything. But it IS relentless and wearing me out sometimes. Especially the whole autism thing. I needed a break. And I didn't know how much I needed a break until I had one. \n \nThe problem is, this was a very busy, very intense break. And while it cleared my mind, it was four days of WORK in so many ways. Four days of being \"on\" all the time. \n \nAnd so I came back needing a bit of rest, some down time, and instead found myself thrown back into full time mothering, as Ethan was already DONE with camp, and Jake's summer school ended with a half day today. And there is now a MONTH before the kids go back to school.  \n \nYes, I said a month, because New York City has not fallen into lockstep with most of the rest of the nation and started sometime in August. A few days after Labor day it is then. \n \nWe'll be making the most of it, having fun in the city, trying to escape as often as we can. But still, looking down the barrel of a whole month is daunting. Especially when the kids don't get along. And they don't. \n \nBut I don't want to end this post on a whine, on a complaint, on the downside. \n \nSo I will say this: 51 years on this planet and most days I am still happy to greet the new day, eager to discover what it has in store for me.  \n \nI want my life to be like the Tardis, bigger on the inside, with ever expanding rooms for whatever I need. Like in one of those wonderful dreams where you go through a passageway to \ndiscover a whole new wing in your apartment you hadn't know existed \nbefore.  \n \nSome doors potentially opened at this conference, and I am looking forward to stepping through, walking into new territory, reclaiming parts of myself that are more than \"just\" Mom. \n \nBecause 51 is not too old to learn new tricks and I've got years ahead of me (hopefully) to dance on into. Anybody want to Rumba? \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Saturday, August 6, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today I have another Irish Mum here as my  SNSS guest: Blue Sky  of\u00a0  Looking for Blue Sky . She has a complicated family with three children and an ex-husband. \n \n Of her three children, the eldest daughter,  Angel , is a lovely typical teenage girl; her younger sister,  Smiley , has cerebral palsy and is non-verbal; and the youngest,  Aspie Boy  is, obviously, on the autism spectrum.  Like I said. Complicated.\u00a0 \n \n Some days the intersection of one child's physical needs and another's emotional needs (or meltdowns) make life nearly untenable.\u00a0 But somehow Blue Sky finds a way through. Because, well,\u00a0this is her family.\u00a0 \n \n She is a wonderful, gifted\u00a0writer, and I have been reading her regularly since nearly the beginning of my sojourn through the SN blogging world. Furthermore, she helps out with the social media side of Irish Autism Action, aiding Jen, who was my other Irish guest from a few weeks past. \n \n So come now, sit with me and\u00a0listen to Blue Sky weave the tale of her family so beautifully, here: \n \n Unusual is not the word!  - by Blue Sky \n \nIt all began with a little girl called Angel. Adored by her Mum and Dad, she happily stayed with her childminder during the working day and then played out with her friends on the long summer evenings and stayed in playing board games in front of the fire when the nights closed in. She came everywhere with us and just seemed to enjoy our company. \n \nIt was an idyllic start to her childhood and almost everything I could have wished for.\u00a0 But I wanted her to have brothers and sisters, and so I had two more children at four year intervals. And that's where life got in the way of my plans. \n \nInto Angel's happy shiny world were thrown not one but two children with special needs. Smiley came first, and she was born at 27 weeks. She has cerebral palsy and some other undiagnosed disorder. My handsome boy had a perfect start in life but was diagnosed with aspergers at age 8, soon after my marriage broke down.  \n \nAs Angel says, she can stop a conversation about families stone dead when she explains about hers! So how to describe the unusual dynamics between the siblings in this family? Well I'm going to be very logical and explain them one at a time... \n \n Angel and Smiley \nIt was a huge shock to our little family when my waters went at 24 weeks on my second pregnancy. Smiley was born two weeks later and our lives changed completely. It soon became clear that this little girl was heading for a bumpy ride in life. She was in and out of various hospitals for her first two years, but Angel never complained. \n \nRight from the start she took a huge interest in her very little sister and was a regular visitor to NICU. She talked to her, sang to her and even waved her magic wand over the incubator to make her better. If she was disappointed in having a baby sister who could not crawl or sit or toddle or talk, she never said, nor has she ever given up hope that Smiley will achieve some of those milestones one day. \n \nAs soon as she learned to smile my special little girl realised that this was her trump card. With her infectious giggle and innocent wide-eyed smile she makes everyone love her: and the more attention you give her, the more love she gives back.  \n \nAngel chats to her and plays with her every day, and Smiley's face lights up as soon as she sees her enter the room. But it can't be always easy. I know that Angel worries about her sister's future and who will take of her when I am no longer able. And I'm sure she gets frustrated with the amount of time it takes to do anything or go anywhere, but she never blames her sister.  \n \nSmiley doesn't complain without good reason, she loves attention but will only demand it when she needs something - like a drink, a trip to the toilet or a change of DVD. Despite all its limitations Smiley is so happy with her life and that inspires almost everyone who knows her, including her sister. \n \nAnd yet. Angel wanted a sibling that she could do all the normal stuff with, so when I asked her if she would like another little brother or sister even if it meant she had to give me a lot of help, there was no hesitation and no happier child when my baby boy was born and he obviously had none of Smiley's problems. \n \n Angel and Aspie Boy \nAs a baby he was perfect and so so cute, but also demanding and cranky and odd...he couldn't seem to control his body properly, he had unusual interests and was very late to talk. \n \nI was worried, but most people just thought he was 'being a boy', and oh she loved feeding him and playing with him and watching him. \n \nBut as he got older his behaviour got more and more difficult. He got so angry and upset when things did not go his way, we would all end up in tears. Once he was diagnosed with aspergers at least we knew why, but not what to do...on good days they still get on well and laugh and joke and gang up on me by chatting in Irish. They still do things together - cycling, watching DVDs, popping out to the shop for messages. \n \nBut none of this happens on the bad days, and there are too many of those. \n \n Aspie Boy and Smiley \nIn my naivety I assumed that my new baby boy would just accept his older sisters. They were already part of his family, so why wouldn't he? Well I was completely wrong. As a small child he did play with Smiley, but was also clearly jealous of all the time and attention that she needed. As he grew older and started to understand he limitations he began to be fearful of her. \n \nNow he largely ignores her.\u00a0 Once in a while he will find a toy that he thinks she may like and give it to her.\u00a0 Carefully.\u00a0 You see he still believes that he can catch cerebral palsy and is obsessed with not touching her or anything she may have handled.\u00a0 Meltdowns can be triggered if she sneezes anywhere near him.\u00a0 This can be difficult to avoid as they sit next to each other in the car.\u00a0 And in the car he can't escape from her.  \n \nShe may not be able to get out of her seat but she causes problems in other ways.\u00a0 As she has got older she has got louder.\u00a0 She is always happy and always smiles and laughs.\u00a0 But now she screams with delight and for a boy with sensory issues this is almost unbearable.\u00a0  \n \nWe have sound-blocking headphones for him but its not always enough.\u00a0 So another reason why we spend so much time at home.\u00a0 Luckily home is now large enough to position the children at almost opposite ends of the house, so the only time they really get close at home is at meal times and I face her away from him.... \n \n Angel \nThe one promise I made to myself was that Angel should never feel that all the effort was being made for Smiley... and then later for Aspie Boy. \u00a0She had to see her parents making superhuman efforts for her as well. \n \nSo I was delighted when she started gymnastics and needed lifts and leotards and a trampoline and help getting to competitions....it took up time, and meant dragging the kids out in their pyjamas some nights to collect her, but to me that was important. She did other sports as well, but the gym became her second home and the gymnasts her other family. \n \nMy job in PR also helped to make her feel special, because while we didn't go on foreign holidays and other stuff that families take for granted, I was able to provide experiences and freebies that were the envy of her friends and sometimes they got to take part in photoshoots or meet celebrities, so it helped to even the scales. In return she has been a second 'parent', a playful big sister, a pram pusher, a carer and a cleaner, as well as the best daughter any mother could hope for. \n \n Putting them all together... \nAs a group the biggest problem I have with my children is their different interests. Angel is sporty, the other two are not. \u00a0Aspie Boy wants to stay in the house, Smiley wants to go shopping. Many activities worked well though when the children were younger: when Smiley was more portable and Aspie Boy more amenable.  \n \nWe used to be able to go to the beach for a couple of hours before Smiley got bored, and when she was very little I'd dip her in the sea...thought she tended to turn bluey-purple very quickly!\u00a0Aspie Boy has only been to the beach once in the past 18 months and insists that he will only go with a friend. But guess what? \u00a0Most of his new friends have aspergers and do very little except play video games. \n \nLuckily Angel is now grown up and can look after herself and do her own thing as well as providing a bit of babysitting, so that I can take the other two out separately. Their Dad also does some activities with Aspie Boy when he sees him.  \n \nSo yes we're an unusual family and life can be interesting at times for all of us including Angel. She's gone along with almost everything with good grace, except for the meltdowns. \u00a0They upset us all.  \n \nIf we could just find a way to stop them then family life would be pretty good... \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Blue Sky has painted such a vivid portrait of her special, unique family here, I feel that I know them personally. I love how her love and concern for all of her very different children shines through in every word she writes. \n \n Aspie Boy is currently going through a very difficult time, with nascent adolescence setting off a string of meltdowns that are becoming increasingly hard for Blue Sky to manage. My heart goes out to her, as she copes with the pain both and practical issues issues of this unfortunate development. \n \n So follow her home to her blog,  Looking for Blue Sky , and read more about her family\u00a0and offer her your support. You will want to read  this poignant post  about\u00a0wishing Smiley would speak, and\u00a0 this intense post  about one of her son's first meltdowns.  \n \n Also read this  short but devastating post  about Blue Sky's wanting her old, sweet son back. \n \n Finally, you should follow  Blue Sky  on  Twitter , and   go \"like\" her on her  Facebook  page. \n \n Thank you so much, Blue Sky, for\u00a0writing so beautifully about your family and bringing us into your world.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2011", "body": "\n \nAs I rush around in a whirlwind prepping for BlogHer11, I am feeling very aware of how different this all feels from last year. This is my second BlogHer conference. A milestone in a way. \n \nLast year I really lucked out. BlogHer10 came to my hometown, New York  City. If it hadn't come to me, I wouldn't have gone, I was still just at  the fringes of this world. (Though for all the life of me I felt much  deeper in.)  \n \nThis year I am well aware of how new I still am at this, how I am still just feeling my way. I am in awe of some of the \"old timers,\" deeply impressed their fortitude, the honing of their craft over many years. And at the same time I am feeling deeply connected, have a long list of virtual friends I am dying to see, committed to meet. \n \nI am also deeply, spine tinglingly honored by having been chosen as a BlogHer Voice of the Year this year. (Honoree, not speaker. That exaltation belongs to my roommate, the marvelous Alexandra, the Empress of  Good Day,  Regular People ) \n \n(If you are new to The Squashed Bologna and want to know a  little bit more about who I was last year at this time, you can peek in  here at my pre-BlogHer10 post full of funny stories about my past conference life:  Look, Ma, I'm going to BlogHer ... with tales of Sundance, SXSW, and Toronto Film fests, including the story of how pregnant me nearly threw up on James Caan.  \n \nAnd also my very personal BlogHer10 debriefing post,  here:  The BlogHer10 reflections of a very. slow. newbie. blogger. ) \n \nIn my book, milestones need marking, reflection. I marvel at the changes that have come about via my blog; the growth, transformation, both personal and \"professional\" in my life in this past year. And my blog has really evolved in this short spate.  \n \nOther things, of course, remain the same. Jake still autistic; I still have ADD; my home is still an unholy mess, one step away from being featured on Hoarders: the Apartment Stories.\u00a0  \n \nBut? I can feel myself really becoming a writer. Stretching my wings. Oh, they're still wet and shiny new, somewhat untested. But wings, people. It feels kinda awesome. \n \nThis year I have found my tribes. \n \nOne is the tribe of writers at the wonderfully supportive virtual writers community that is  The Red Dress Club . It took me a long time of reading and ruminating before I began to write to the prompts. There was resistance (I don't like \"being told what to do\"), but then? \n \nI took risks, tried new things ( fiction! ) and in the end wrote some of my absolutely favorite posts to those prompts. (Want to read some of those? Try these:  The Last Room ,  In my Grandmother's House ,  Cheryl ,  Sweat Memories  or  Breakers ) \n \nBut the main thing there? The other writers and readers. It is a true community, one that I am proud to be a part of. \n \nAnd the other tribe? The special needs parent bloggers, including the amazing Autism Moms and Dads. They are the core of why I need to go to this conference, the connection most vital. While I have always sought out other parents in a similar boat, having started the  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays  guest post series on my blog this past spring has extended my reach and knowledge of this amazing community. \n \nI am thrilled and honored to host the incredible stories of their families that other bloggers are sharing there. And to get to meet so many of my guests at once this upcoming weekend? Beyond priceless.  \n \nThe difference a year makes... \n \nLast year I came home every night to my family (though they may have been sleeping when I arrived), woke up and breakfasted with them every morning. This year I am traveling across the country, for the first time since I was pregnant with the twins; traveling alone for five days, for the first time since I gave birth. \n \nAll this for me, who is always last on my priority list. But also for my family. \n \nBecause I am going to meet and exchange information with other special needs parents, to brainstorm up a better world for our families. \n \nBecause I am going to try to learn how to turn my writing into something I can make money at. Because I need to begin to return to the world of work soon, and if I can find a way to earn a living doing what I love and do best? My world will swing into a better balance, and my whole family will be the better for it. \n \nAnd even though I will surely be up all night tonight -- packing, planning, writing out lists of what my children need to be doing each day; the wheres and whens, the thousand things I take care of unconsciously, routinely that need to be spelled out for others (because while Ethan can - and WILL - tell people what they are doing right and wrong for him, Jake as yet cannot, and so it is up to me to make sure his world continues on as he needs it to, while I am gone) -- I know I will arrive in San Diego grinning from ear to ear. \n \nReady to learn. \n \nReady to connect. \n \nReady to meet my tribes. \n \nWriters, over-sharers, special needs parents. \n \nBloggers all.

{"date": "Saturday, July 30, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's wonderful  SNSS guest is Mama Apples of the blog  Apples and Autobots . And she? Really has her hands full. Really. And that's an understatement. Think I'm exaggerating?  \n \n The tagline for her blog is: \"The chronicles of two parents raising four children:  a  high  energy little boy with Asperger's , his girly girl  neurotypical twin  sister,  a quirky four-year-old daughter (who also has autism), and  a  nineteen month old baby boy  in Early Intervention.  Oh... mom also  teaches middle school.  Welcome to the crazy train!\" \n \n Yes. Four kids. Three on the spectrum. And a household full of love and understanding. Right now they are holding their breath to see where on the spectrum the littlest one lies, hoping that they can stave off regression. \n \n Mama apples is a wonderful writer, a pleasure to read. Incredibly moving when she's being serious, incredibly funny when she'd being lighthearted.\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0  \n \n So come now, read about her unique and beautiful family here: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n A Family Mosaic  - by Mama Apples  \n \nMy husband and I are the parents of four children.\u00a0 Three of them have autism spectrum disorders and one does not.\u00a0 Our children\u2019s relationships are incredibly complicated.\u00a0 I suppose they are like a mosaic \u2014 beautiful from a distance, but if you peer closely, you can see the cracks and gaps that we\u2019ve had to fill in over the years, the places where the pieces don\u2019t quite meet. \n\u00a0  \nThe individual pieces of our mosaic are, on the surface, beautiful in their simplicity.\u00a0 Yet, careful inspection reveals complex patterns and even a few stress cracks born of being forced together. \n \n\u2018Bot is our oldest child.\u00a0 He\u2019s nine, and he has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome.\u00a0 He\u2019s like a gaudily painted piece of porcelain.\u00a0 He\u2019s a clown, a connoisseur of slapstick.\u00a0 He tries to be a little tough guy, but his autism leaves him brittle, easily broken by too much sensory input or changes in routine. \n\u00a0  \nHis bright, colorful personality isn\u2019t always enough to camouflage his chipped spots. He doesn\u2019t socialize well, even though he desperately wants to, leading him to say embarrassing things to strangers. \n\u00a0  \nAt times I can see his twin sister visibly cringe at his antics.\u00a0 Their relationship is strained more than non-womb mates because Princess never gets a break from him.\u00a0 They spend recess at school together.\u00a0 They can\u2019t help but be compared to each other by teachers. This is true of all twins, but autism adds an entirely different dynamic to their twinship. \n \nChronologically they are only a minute apart.\u00a0 However, \u2018Bot is years behind Princess socially and emotionally.\u00a0 Princess has remarked before that she wishes she\u2019d have had a twin sister instead of a twin brother.\u00a0 I can\u2019t help but wonder if she feels twice cheated\u2014denied the sister she wanted and forever paired with a brother so intrinsically different from her. \n \nPrincess is like a piece of highly polished quartz rock.\u00a0 She is very girly and creative.\u00a0 She has a sparkling smile and a keen, sharp mind.\u00a0 She possesses a lovely spirit.\u00a0 If you spend a significant amount of time with her, you can see that she is mature for her years.  \n \nThat in itself is not a bad thing, necessarily, but her maturity is the result of nine years of having autistic siblings.\u00a0 Princess has to make concessions to her siblings on a daily basis, whether it\u2019s giving up TV time for four-year-old Tinkerbell to watch the same movies over and over, or allowing \u2018Bot to push the shopping cart, even though she really wants to do it.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier not to fight him.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very unfair.  \n \nHowever, what worries me the most for Princess is not the number of times she has to give up a little.\u00a0 Those are minor scratches on the surface of her soul.\u00a0 It\u2019s the deep gouges that worry me.\u00a0 The times when her twin explodes and focuses his rage on her.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had to physically restrain him many times to keep him from hurting her, because it\u2019s true, you know, the saying that you hurt the ones you love the most.  \n \nThe scars left when even her accomplishments are a sacrifice.\u00a0 You see, she\u2019s an honor student, and \u2018Bot struggles with academics.\u00a0 Who do you think gets the most homework help?\u00a0  \n \nChores are a battle in most families, but my kids take it to a whole other level.\u00a0 \u2018Bot and Tinkerbell have a hard time with following directions and staying on task.\u00a0 Princess always ends up doing the lion\u2019s share of the work. \n \nWe can keep glossing over these things, but eventually there will come a point that a girl\u2019s day with mom just isn\u2019t going to be enough to make her feel better.  \n \nAnd yet, she\u2019s so strong.\u00a0 She was one of \u2018Bot\u2019s first therapists, forcing him to engage and interact.\u00a0 I firmly believe that the early socialization she provided him made a dramatic impact on the course of his autism.\u00a0 She\u2019s a wonderful big sis to the little ones. \n \nYes, she gets frustrated, especially with Tinkerbell, but she\u2019s so good with both little ones.\u00a0 She does speech a lot with Tugboat, and she did floortime with Tinkerbell.\u00a0 She endures with a smile and adheres to her siblings with loyalty and love.\u00a0 However, inside of her is a little girl who has always had to be so much more than just a little girl. \n \nTinkerbell, our daughter with autism is like a fine piece of china.\u00a0 She is wafer thin, most likely from hours and hours of pacing and walking in circles.\u00a0 She inspires protectiveness and gentleness in everyone she meets \u2014 well, almost.  \n \nOn one hand she and \u2018Bot are perfect playmates. \u2018Bot\u2019s social age and abilities are closer to age five or six, so he and Tink are on the same level in many ways.\u00a0 Also, \u2018Bot likes to be in control of play situations, scripting what should happen to everyone involved. \n\u00a0  \nThis works out brilliantly with Tinkerbell, because like many girls with Asperger\u2019s/HFA, she is a born imitator, and she loves being told exactly what to do!\u00a0 They generally play well, but we have to watch them carefully because \u2018Bot tends to get too rough without meaning to hurt her, and when he does get mad at her, he\u2019ll push her down or hit because he doesn\u2019t make allowances for her age. \n\u00a0  \nShe also picks up his bad habits. A few weeks ago she embarrassed my poor husband by talking about her \u201cnuts\u201d in the OT waiting room! \n \nTinkerbell loves to follow Princess around.\u00a0 Out of all of our kids, I think that their relationship is the most \u201cnormal.\u201d\u00a0 Tink is the typical annoying little sister, and Princess loves her to bits.\u00a0 I get so much joy out of watching Princess paint Tink\u2019s fingernails (after Tink has spent hours begging), and I can\u2019t help but laugh at Princess\u2019s incredulous expression when Tinkerbell immediately washes the polish off.  \n \nTugboat is my beautiful, colorful piece of glass, the sharp edges of autism clearly present, but there\u2019s time yet for Early Intervention to dull the edges.\u00a0 His place in our mosaic, however, is already clearly established.\u00a0 He is the baby of the family.\u00a0  \n \nTinkerbell calls him \u201cBaby Wild.\u201d\u00a0 She has a point. He manages to wreak havoc everywhere he goes.\u00a0 He plucks blocks out of Tinkerbell\u2019s line of toys.\u00a0 He lines up bottles of Princess\u2019s nail polish.\u00a0 He loves roughhousing with \u2018Bot, to the point that they aren\u2019t allowed to play unsupervised.\u00a0  \n \nHe is loved by all of his siblings, though it was a little rough between him and Tinkerbell in the beginning.\u00a0 His wet fingers and toy grabbing didn\u2019t exactly endear him to her.\u00a0 Tugboat has communication delays, but the love he has for his older siblings shines through his eyes. \n \nMy husband and I practice the art of parenting day by day, carefully shaping and arranging our mosaic.\u00a0 I have no idea if we\u2019re doing it right.\u00a0 Nothing is set just yet.\u00a0 Sometimes one piece of our special puzzle needs to be mended, so we place it in the center and do the best that we can to hold it together. \n\u00a0  \nDoes that make any of the other pieces less important?\u00a0 Of course not.\u00a0 If one piece were removed, our beautiful creation would be left with a gaping hole, and we\u2019d never find another piece that could perfectly fill that space. \n\u00a0  \nWhat frightens me is the delicacy of the entire thing.\u00a0 The idea that the pieces could be so easily broken, even our strong little chunk of granite.\u00a0 I just pray that the glue we\u2019re using, our love for each other and each of them, is strong enough to weather any storm. \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n I am so impressed by Mama Apples, how she takes her family's very complicated situation in stride. I struggle to balance the needs of my two. I can barely imagine doing it with such a disparate four. \n \n And now that you have read her here you MUST go back and read her on her blog,   Apples and Autobots . This is not optional, you really must. \n \n Start with this post about  a TOUGH day  in sibling-land. Then go to  this lovely one , about those moments of seeing how different children are in comparison to others, and coming to terms with acceptance.  \n \n Read this one, but not when you are already sad or depressed, it might make things worse at first. It's the tale of  an awful meltdown , last winter and Mama Apples most painful experience, as a parent. And then this post is  a call to arms  for how folks can help a family when they see a meltdown in progress. \n \n In  this post , she has a line that I just found so wonderful for both its imagery and how it resonated, that I just have to share it: \"I wish I could pry off the top of his little head and look around for a while at what's going on in there.\"\u00a0 Anyone who has a child with a communication disorder, or whose kid thinks in a unique and normally opaque manner is nodding their head right now (and hopefully not looking for the can-opener). \n \n Finally, you should follow  Mama Apples  on  Twitter , and   go \"like\" her on her  Facebook  page, where she is just as outspoken, lovely, lyrical and intimate\u00a0 as she is on her blog. \n \n Thank you so much, Mama Apples for gracing my blog with your beautiful words about  your amazing family.  (And for saving my butt. You know why.) \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Friday, July 29, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Nine years ago today my life changed... \n \nUndeniably...  \n \nIrrevocably... \n \nCompletely... \n \n(At exactly 10:12 - and then again at 10:13 - AM)  \n \nIn ways I could not possibly presage, did not thoroughly fathom until, suddenly, there were two hearts, beating furiously in the world, that had moments ago echoed solely, safely, inside the cavern of my body. \n \nTheir cries piercing the hushed hum of the operating theater, the chill but joyous room where I first met my sons, and then cried out, myself, as they whisked them away, too soon. Too soon! \n \nI squawked, demanded. (As much as a half-bodied woman, pinned to a table, being re-viscerated can be said to demand.) My obstetrician, a mother herself was supportive. I really loved her. \n \nShe was whip smart and had a wicked, dry sense of humor. She actually came in on her day off (also, coincidentally her own mother\u2019s birthday) to deliver my boys, as at 39 weeks it was time for them to come OUT.  \n \nHospitals are full of rules, and C-sections are very medical ways to birth babies. It\u2019s really, truly surgery. They take a baby out, hold it up in the air in front of you for the briefest of moments, say \u201cSee, here\u2019s your baby?\u201d and then they whisk him away to do hospitally things to him.  \n \nAs I was making noises about wanting to actually HOLD my babies, there was resistance from the nurses, they had their jobs to do. But my wonderful OB had my back. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two, hand one over to her!\u201d she commanded, and thus I found my son Jacob thrust into my arms, wrapped up like a little burrito in one of those ubiquitous striped hospital blankets. \n \nI held him close to my face, peered into his. \n \nThe moment my son and I locked eyes has forever been seared into my brain. I had never experienced love at first sight before, never known that singular moment when everything turns betwixt one breath and the next; a shift of axis wobbling proportion. \n \nAnd here, now, was that for me. Because here was the face of my son, unknown until the moment before, and now emblazoned on my very soul; and I knew with unwavering certainty that it was the beginning of our story, a lifetime of love. \n \nAnd I knew that here was someone, one of two someones, whom I would die for. Someone for whom pacifist me would fight, tooth and claw, for; whom I would throw myself in front of a bus for. \n \nAnd then, when they took Jacob from me and handed me Ethan, my heart doubled up, while remaining the same. An unexplained phenomena that just is: how a heart can be full to the brim and then fill again without ever emptying, expanding infinitely but remaining intact.\u00a0  \n \nMy heart was still firmly encased in the cage of my body, and yet now also walking around the world beating away inside these two tiny beings at the same time. How can that be? Shhh, that\u2019s one of the secrets of motherhood. \n \nFinally they were done putting me back together and I was sent to the recovery room next door, my boys to the maternity ward upstairs. \n \nI sent my husband with the babies, to join the grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins who were gathering to meet the newest family members. I went to recovery alone. And thus began the longest two hours of my life.  \n \n @@@@@@@ \nThis is another piece of the long story of my boys' beginnings. \n \nEarlier this summer, I showed the world how I \" rocked my bump \" in a post I wrote to link up over at  Shell's place. \n \nLast year, I wrote  a letter to my sons on their eighth birthday , recounting my joy at their coming into the world.  \n \nI thought I would have told my whole conception, pregnancy and birth story by now. I thought I would have had the time, that my life might be less of a whirlwind this year (foolish me). And yet it seems to spin, if possible, even faster still. \n \nBut no matter how quick the dance, I must pause each July 29th to give thanks, to marvel again at the miracle (modern, medical) that is the existence of my two beautiful boys. \n \nHello, my loved ones. \n \nHappy Birthday, Ethan and Jacob. \n \nJacob and Ethan. \n \nToday, nine years ago you graced the world with your presence. \n \nToday, nine years ago you made me a mom. \n \nMy world has never been the same.  \n \nThank you, from the top to the bottom of my heart. \n \n \n \n \n I'm linking this post up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for...  and this week I don't have to tell you why.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Four more days to go.  \n \nActually that's not true at all, the running out of ideas thing. I have a million ideas, but what I have run out of, of course, is time. I have a dozen half-written posts, some of which I am truly excited about and am looking forward to finishing, but just don't have the time to do them justice right now. \n\u00a0  \nTime, time, time. What I need, and have so very precious little of... time. \n \nBetween the boys' upcoming birthday (tomorrow! nearly there for that, too), the upcoming trip to BlogHer with all the childcare planning and other attendant preparation that goes into that\u00a0 -- vitamin pours for Jake, playdates set up for Ethan, emergency contact lists to write, new babysitters to train, and oh, yeah, packing *my* stuff for the trip -- I am swamped. \n \nI have really enjoyed writing every day, feel it's kicked my writing mojo up a notch into high gear, even. In fact, what I seem to want to do, most all the time right now, is to  write. (And yes, I have a post about *that* half-written, sitting in the  hopper.)  \n \nBut also? I am looking forward to being able to take a break, a day off if I feel like it, or if my kids' birthday is the next day and there are cakes to make, presents to wrap, \"To-Do\" lists to write, check, curse at. \n \nSo why are there not enough hours in the day? Well, I am possibly not the most efficient person on the planet. Something's got to give, and  lately it's been sleep. And that is never, not EVER, a good thing.  \n \nBut I  can't help myself. I have blog posts to write... birthdays to plan... blog conferences to pack for... friends to tweet with... playdates to schedule... a husband to (occasionally) talk to... blog posts to read and comment on... social stories to write for Jacob... an elderly mother to visit with, shepherd to doctor appointments... vitamins, supplements and medicines to inventory, buy and pour for Jacob... an elderly Aunt's care to oversee... breakfasts and dinners to serve, lunches to pack... autism research to keep up on... zombies to kill...  bathroom conversations  to have with Ethan... \n \nAnd getting enough sleep, taking care of myself? Too often just falls to the bottom of the list. Forgotten. \n \nNext month I am going to think about, write, focus on that: taking care of me, figuring out how to put my own oxygen mask on first (as the eloquent Stark. Raving. Mad. Mommy  puts it ). \n \nBut tonight I am going to wrap up this post, finish icing the GF/CF cupcakes for Jacob's in-class birthday celebration tomorrow, go over the next week's crazy calendar with my husband, and sink into bed exhausted, to catch what few hours of sleep I can before the alarm goes off at 5:45 and I get up and do it all over again. \n \nG'night all. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2011", "body": "\nJacob\u2019s speech is shifting again, he\u2019s moving ahead, coming along\u2026 swimmingly.\u00a0 The pace is fairly glacial, and so like the encroaching ice it moves so slowly you don\u2019t notice it has crossed the line, carried on to elsewhere until, suddenly seeming, it is there! \n \nJake used to ask everyone questions that he already knew the answers to: \"Is that a baby?\" while staring at a baby. Contrary to the standard \u201cbook\u201d on autistic people, Jake actually found it easier to ask a (straightforward, factual) question than to make a declarative statement. \n \nWell, that seems to be shifting now, and Jake is just declaring away to any and all around him. Thankfully most of the people he talks to are willing to play along, not delve too deep into why a big kid is sounding so much like a little kid. \n \nThere is no meanness. Yet. But, then again, he hasn't tried talking to too many teenagers. Yet.  \n \nJake to a man walking a dog the other day on the street: \u201cExcuse me, Man? You\u2019re walking your dog!\u201d Luckily the man smiled quizzically then kindly, and agreed that yes indeed, he WAS walking his dog. \n \nWhen we took a train ride recently, on the return trip home the train was very crowded and it took a long time for the conductor to make her way through the car. Jake was leaning out into the aisle watching her, clearly impatient to talk to her. \n \nHe started to shout out to her, but I made him wait until she was close. When she was two rows away from us, he just couldn't contain himself any longer... \n \nJacob: \"Mrs. Conductor!\"  \n \nConductor: \"Yes?\" \n \n(I couldn't wait to hear what in the world he was dying to say to her; really had no clue.)  \n \nJacob: \"I have a ticket!\" \n \nConductor: \"And I'm going to come punch the heck out of your ticket in just one moment. Wait and I'll be right there.\" \n \nWhen she comes to take his ticket, Jake is beaming, then makes a request: \"Make a happy face, please.\" (The conductor on the outgoing train had done that, pleasing Jake no end.) \n \nConductor: \"Okay...\" \n \nAnd then? Jake kicks it up a notch: \"With teeth, a happy face with pointy teeth!\" (I'm thinking: no more vampire movies for you, my son.) \n \nThe conductor, bless her soul, is game: \"Well, I'll try...\" \n \nAnd she did. And Jake was pleased. It doesn't look much like a vampire happy face, but she get's an A for effort and kindness, for sure. \n \nThe other day I was listening to Jacob tell me something when it hit me like a ton of bricks: He was using complete sentences without prompting. \n \nA year ago, while he was certainly capable of using complete sentences, we mostly got single words and short phrases (if it wasn't a completely scripted phrase) unless  we pushed for more. And so we had to push, push, push him. And deny him, pretend to not understand. If he could get what he wanted with two or three words, that's all we'd get. \n \nInstead of \"I want to want to wear the red shirt today, Mom, can I have it please?\" (now) he would say \"Red one.\" We had to pull expansiveness out of him, and it was exhausting. \n \nSo when did that change? I couldn't tell you. When did this full-sentence-talking-boy emerge? Dunno.  \n \nThat night I asked my husband: \"Have you noticed Jake almost always talks in full sentences these days?\" And he had to stop and think about it, and then agreed with me that yes, he does, and no, he too has no idea exactly when that shifted. \n \nAnd that's the maddening thing. There is no exactly. It's minutely incremental, like how sand dunes \"walk\" across a desert, a few inches a day. And you never notice the day-to-day movement until suddenly it's clear the landscape has altered irrevocably. \n \nThat's Jake.  \n \nHe is also asserting himself in new and interesting ways...  \n \nWhen Ethan grabs the TV clicker as he sits down in the living room where Jake is in the middle of watching a show, Jake will now pipe up with: \"Ethan, don't change the channel... I'm watching something!\"\u00a0  \n \nWhen I spoke to him the other day and addressed him, as I often do, as \"sweetheart\" I got this response:\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t call me sweetheart. My name is Jacob.\u201d (This is probably an adaptation of a script from a TV show, book or movie that I just don't recognize, but it's so damn appropriate that I'm going to count it as amazing anyway.) \n \nI don't know where all this is going, but I know it's a long way from where we've been. And for this next year,\u00a0 I'm vowing to pay more attention on the way, \n \nBut I'll probably still be taken by surprise by Jake's changes. He's a sneaky one, that boy, growing and growing up, changing and evolving while I'm distracted and focused elsewhere for a moment. \n \nI look at him and he's standing in place, admiring the flowers. I turn around and there he is, a whole square further down the path, smiling and waving. \n \nAnd as long as he's forging ahead, I wouldn't have it any other way. Keep going Jake, keep going... leave me in the dust, please. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "body": "\nMy son Ethan? \n \nLoves coffee. Yes. Coffee. \n \nAnd he's 9. (OK, not even,  but he'll be 9 in a few days, so I have to start thinking of him that  way so I don't cry all over him and his twin brother Jake on their birthday, being SO not my babies anymore  and all.) \n \nI'm not a bad mother, don't turn me in. It's not  like he's really drinking it, I don't pour him a big ol' steaming cup of Joe every morning.\u00a0  \n \nIt's just... you know how whatever you're having, if it looks like you're really enjoying it, if it seems important to you? Your kids want it too. (Well at least the ones typical enough to notice such things.) They can become real pests about it. \n \nYeah, Ethan is like that. I give the lecture about some things being just for grownups, not good for kids, etc. but still, the lure of the \"semi-forbidden-grown-up\" thing is strongly at work here, too. \n \nAnd the whole thing is my own damn fault.  \n \nIt started out with me, like a fool, letting him have ONE sip, once...\u00a0 I was thinking: stinking picky eater that he is, he'll hate  the taste and that will be the end of it. \n \nFool. \n \nHe LOVED it. (face palm) \n \nProbably because I take mine light and sweet.  \n \nSo now every time he is around when I'm drinking  coffee - especially iced coffee? He wants a sip. \n \nHe begs, whines,  wheedles and pleads for a sip. \n \nDamn. \n \nAnd every now and then, for a  special treat? I let him have one. \n \nOne sip.  \n \nAnd you know how nicely the other mommies at Starbucks look at me when I let him have one there, right? (Yes. Like there was a skull and crossbones on the cup I was offering to him.) \n \nBut the thing is, I can't over-emphasize how terrible coffee is for you, because he's likely to want to drink it some day. And also because Ethan has a logical mind, and will want to know why *I* am drinking poison on a daily basis. And he will try to get me to stop. \n \nAnd that will never do. \n \nMust. Have. Coffee. \n \nSo, really, how harmful is one occasional sip of milky coffee, considering the massive unknown load of environmental toxins our bodies are being bombarded with every day? (See, I can justify anything, it's one of my true talents.) \n \nAnd anyway, he already drinks tea with me regularly. (Sit back in your seats, his is decaf.) \n \nAnd like Jean-Luc Picard, we prefer Earl Grey, hot. \n \n \n Note: This post was inspired by a post on \"Is There Any Mommy Out There\":  Sip locusts.  It is essentially an expansion of a comment I made on that wonderful post. Thanks, Stacey for being such a moving and inspiring writer. \u00a0  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

While *I* may not have a summer home, at least Blog Gems does. \n \nI now will be hosting this linky fortnightly (I LOVE that word! It means every other week, for you non-anglophiles.) starting with today. \n \nCome! link up! Tell all your friends! I promised Jen it would be alive and well when she brings it back home to her blog  The King and Eye.  So don't make a liar out of me.  \n \n This is what Jen says about Blog Gems: \nHow many posts do you have languishing in your archives? Great posts   that will never be dusted off and brought out to breathe again! Maybe   you created fabulous content before you had lots of followers, or maybe   you have been blogging for years and your current followers haven't  seen  your older material.  \n \nBlog Gems - Air Your Archives is a fortnightly linky list where  we will  give a prompt and you select a post from your archives that fits  the  prompt. You do not have to create content for the prompt, unless  you  want to. All you have to do is copy and paste the url of the post  into  the linky list. Voila, an old post gets a second shot!  \n \nTo take part:  \n \n1. Follow MY blog for now (and  Jen's blog  once I hand her back the reins) to get future Blog Gem posting information and linkys.  \n \n2. Grab the Blog Gem button and place it on your sidebar (html code  here ).  Putting the button on your blog is not a deal-breaker, some  people  just don't like doing it and I have no problem with that at all.  What I  will say is that something like this can't be successful without  'word  of mouth' so I would appreciate if you could find another way to  let  people know that this is available and they are welcome to join in.  \n \n3. Enter your link.  \n \n4. Read and comment on the submissions of the two blogs posted before you on the linky list. (Please!)  \n \n5. Help spread the word by telling your blogging friends, either by tweeting this or blogging about your entry.  \n \n And here's what I have to add: \n \nIt's a wonderful chance to get fresh eyeballs on your great posts from the past. \n \nThe rule is that you're supposed to select a post from your  archives  that fits the prompt... but, being the generous, kind-hearted person  that Jen is, it's a lenient rule. She states:   \"Broad interpretations of the prompt are encouraged so this could be a good chance to be creative!\" \n \nAnd, as we're in the middle of a horrific heat wave, this week's prompt is:  Cool .\u00a0  \n \n Cool... take that literally or figuratively; temperature or attitude. Root around in your archives and find an old post that connects to the concept of \"cool.\" \n \nReady? Good. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines, aaaaaand link up! \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, July 23, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Every week I tell you that *today's*  SNSS guest is particularly wonderful or special. And I really mean it, because they all are (they're all special needs bloggers, after all). But  TODAY? Wow! \n \n Today I bring you Jen of    The King and Eye  (her personal blog) and   Irish Autism Action,  a community blog that Jen runs along with their  other social media.\u00a0 \n \n Jen is the mother of three children, the middle of whom is on the autism spectrum. And, to quote her tag line, she writes about  \"family life with a dash of autism. \" Jen is also my second international SNSS guest, as she lives (and is involved in the autism community) in Ireland. \n \n But also? Jen is my friend. I met her (and her mother) when she  came to New York  for a special trip last winter. I was a guest host of her  Blog Gems   link-up feature, and will be taking it over for her while she takes a break this summer. \u00a0\u00a0  \n \n But enough of MY words about Jen, come read about her  wonderful  family in her own words, here: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Happy to Be in the Middle  \u2013 by Jen \n \nMy name is Jen and I have three, fabulous, children. Firstborn is 9 years old, HRH (His Royal Highness) is 3 years old - with autism, and Her Cuteness is 2 years old. Having a special needs child in the family has never really been an issue for us because we don't know any different. \n \nFor my neurotypical children HRH 'just is who he is' and they have adjusted well. I blog often about HRH, the issues he faces and how he overcomes them. I don't often blog about my other children and how brilliant they are so I am delighted to have this opportunity to specifically write a post about my neurotypical children, the \u2018special needs siblings.\u2019 \n \nFirstborn, at 9, understands that HRH has difficulties and likes to be involved in any way he can. When HRH started a new school last January Firstborn visited the school to see where HRH sat, works and to meet the teachers. The school were very accommodating with this and it meant a lot to Firstborn.  \n \nWe also occasionally, at Firstborns request, bring him to therapy appointments so that he can know the therapists and see what happens during therapy sessions. He likes to do 'work' with HRH so we tend to assign him his own personal task to work on with HRH (a small task).  \n \nThis is all at his own request, so if he has a difficult day or wants some alone time then either myself or my husband will just pick it up. He worries about his little brother but also celebrates all of his achievements with gusto. \n \nHer Cuteness, at 2, has no idea what autism is or that HRH has it. To her it is perfectly normal that he uses a PECS book and when she started using PECS at 12 months old we just went with it. It actually came in very handy because she could show us the pictures of what she wanted when she didn't have the words to express it and I think we avoided a lot of frustration tantrums because of PECS.  \n \nShe is a bossy little girl. Luckily HRH loves her bossing him around and they have great fun together. Although there is a 16 month age gap between the two of them, developmentally they are very similar and I can see them encouraging each other.  \n \nRecently HRH showed an interest in being able to sing his alphabet and Her Cuteness followed. While she was doing this she discovered other nursery rhymes and HRH followed her with that interest.  \n \nOften I see Her Cuteness looking after HRH, particularly in the case of him not understanding a verbal instruction. She takes him by the hand and shows him. They do argue, mostly about turn taking and who gets to play with which toy. Not much different to any set of siblings!  \n \nThe interesting thing is that Firstborn and Her Cuteness have a much different relationship. While both of them are very gentle and considerate (mostly) of HRH, when they get together the pair of them cause fireworks.  \n \nHer Cuteness regularly goes out of her way to annoy her eldest brother and said brother does 'big brother' things like saying 'oh, look, a spider' and laughing while she runs away screaming. There is a pair of them in it, I can't say which of them starts the fireworks, I just know how often I have to put an end to it! (Too often!) \n \nIt amazes me that each of my children has such a good grasp on where their siblings are and what they can handle. Their intuition leads them, they trust it and, mostly, get it right.  \n \nIt may not always be like this. Things may change as they get older, I realize that, but I choose to enjoy what we have now rather than worry about things that haven't happened yet. \n \nI would like to think, in 10 years time, I will still be able to say how close my children are to each other\u2026\u2026 and that maybe the eldest and youngest will have put out their fireworks! \n \n \n @@@@@@@ \n \n Jen, can I just say, for the record, how much I love your family? And I also love how  your  love for and deep knowledge of your children shines through in every word you write. I am honored to have had you here as my guest today.  \n \n OK, people, now that you've gotten to know them a little bit here today? Jump across the big pond and follow Jen home to her blog,  The King and Eye . \n \n Try this, her very first post, about the  light-bulb moment  when she realized her son was autistic, or this post listing  10 things she thinks HRH wants you to know  about himself.\u00a0 A nd do read this really, really funny one about a particular, um, kink in  HRH's earliest language development.\u00a0 \n \n Jen is also (unlike me) a techno-gal. She does her own coding and even posted a tutorial about how to  make your own custom favicon.  That's how I learned to make mine. (Thanks, Jen!)\u00a0   \n \n You should know that Jen is  taking a little break  from blogging for the rest of the summer. This spring her family went through a crisis when HRH became extremely ill with  a mystery disease  that required a lengthy hospitalization. So Jen really needs to recharge and focus on her family right now.\u00a0 \n \n This means things will be very quiet on her blog for a bit. But that's OK, because her archives are a lovely place to root around in until she's ready to post again. \n \n Also? You will certainly want to follow Jen on  Twitter as her charming self    @jencull , and also as    @Irishautism ,  for news on that front. \n \n And finally? Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jen, for being such a wonderful member of the blogging community, and most importantly, for being my friend. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

(Because I know you want to know.) \n \nI suppose I was feeling the weight of their near full nine years upon this earth when I climbed up the stairs to the toy floor, and right into the sight of a three year old boy entranced by the play area's Thomas train tables. \n \nAnd I have to catch my breath. It all comes tumbling back. Here, now becomes here, then... \n \nHow many hours had I spent, mom-sized butt wedged into toddler-size seats, beside those magic rectangular islands of Sodor? \n \nIf I squint I can almost see my boys here again, their curls golden brown and blond, squabbling over possession of the best freight cars, the one James the Red Engine whose face has not been loved into oblivion. \"Mine\" yells Ethan, while Jake howls and growls like a wolf. \n \nSometimes the boys would even pull their own precious trains out of their pockets, carried forth out of our home on promise of safekeeping, unable to resist the allure of watching them travel over bridge, through tunnel, into the shed and back out again. Maybe take a wild spin on the turntable.  \n \nWhat? Has a train plummeted off the highest bridge, into the river? Oh, well, accidents happen. The greatest entertainment. And they provide Jacob with the opportunity to appropriately script: \"He tried to apply the brakes, but it was too late!\" \n \nMy boys are so big now, Ethan's train days many years behind him. It's like opening a forgotten door to watch this sweet little boy squealing in delight as Edward, once more, rounds the bend. \n \nJacob  still revisits the Island of Sodor  from time to time, as he spirals back again - with greater understanding - through old delights.

{"date": "Thursday, July 21, 2011", "body": "\nOK, so this IS kind of a BlogHer primer, but I'm warning you: don't be relying on me for practical advice!* \u00a0  \n \nMy good bloggy friend Alexandra ( The Empress ) is going to be one of my roomies at BlogHer. (Yay!) As it's her very first conference, she's feeling a bit nervous and anxious (though, of course in  a very funny way  on her blog). \n \nSince she knows I was at BlogHer last year, she has asked me for advice & reassurance. Ruh, roh. \n \nNow, while I rarely lecture here on my blog, if you know me at all in \"real life,\" you'll know I'm a big old know-it-all. I love, love, LOVE to give advice, often unasked for, and whether I have actual expertise in the matter or not. \n \nYes, I really have to bite my tongue to make myself stop when I sense my generously shared wisdom is unwelcome. (You should see me around an autistic kid whose parents are clearly clueless and clearly do NOT want to know. I actually twitch from the effort to keep my big mouth shut.)  \n \nAnd this time I have been ASKED for advice, whoopeeee! Permission to blather on granted! And so instead of just sending my wonderful friend an e-mail (which I also have, since it seemed impolite to make her wait) I have decide to share my garnered wisdom with all of lucky you. \n \nI mean, everyone who is anyone in the bloggosphere is offering their take on how to prepare for BlogHer to the nervous newbie, and so I figure I'd better follow suit. It's pretty much REQUIRED, at this point. And I always do as I'm told. (snort) \n \nThe problem here is: I don't really know how to properly advise a BlogHer newbie, having never *quite* been in those shoes myself. \n \nFor you see, even though last year was my first BlogHer ever, and even though I'd only been blogging 6 short months when I went? I wasn't actually a nervous newbie. Not at all, not by a long shot. (In fact I wrote a post about THAT last year & you can read it here:  Look, Ma, I'm going to BlogHer ) \n \nIn a nutshell,  I am so un-nervous about these things because in my prior-to-parenting,  prior-to-blogging life? I was in the media business (film/tv/video/music publishing) and went to and also worked at a lot of conferences. \n \nSo my advice is probably useless to you if you are quaking in your boots about being at a conference with 2,950 really nice women who want to meet and connect with you. (And, yes, about 50 competitive, nasty, narcissistic jerks.) \n \nMy best advice: ignore the 50 jerks. That's really all you have to do, and you'll have a great time.  \n \nMy other main advice to you, even if you've never been to conference before in your life is: Don't Panic. \n \nAlso (get ready for it): Be friendly. Make plans, but be receptive to serendipity. \n \nThat last bit is the big one. (And kind of covers everything.) \n \nI showed up at the Toronto film festival not knowing a soul, and ended up at a wild party with a bunch of Icelandic filmmakers, at  dinner with Agnes Varda, at an amazing event at the Shoe Museum...\u00a0 all because I talked to the people who stood next to me on lines, and said \"yes\" to everyone who asked if I wanted to come with them to do something. \n \nAnd THAT was at a snooty film festival filled with narcissistic posers. \n \nAnd THIS? Is BlogHer we're talking about... basically  just a big ol' family reunion! These people are OUR TRIBE, remember? \n \nActually it's even  better  than a family reunion because no one has generations-old grudges they are holding, and hidden agendas, and they don't care who mother always favored or who was seated at a \"bad table\" at your cousin Susie's wedding. \n \nNo one has come to judge you or make fun of your shoes. Everyone wants to connect, to revel in being with others who understand why we feel compelled to turn our lives into prose and blast it out into the bloggosphere. We are family! (And how many more cliche catch phrases from books, songs & TV can I slip into this one post?\u00a0 Let me work on it.) \n \nAlso? I know some of you are nervous about the travel itself, having never flown alone into a city you don't know. \n \nOK, you may not have done THAT, but you have been in an airport and flown before with your family, right? OK, same thing, but this time there's no one else's nose you need to wipe - a win! \n \nIf no to that one... well, you've seen airports in the movies and TV, right?\u00a0 And unlike in those shows, no one is trying to hunt you down and shoot you, honest. \n \nAlso? Airplanes?\u00a0 Just buses with staler air; buses that fly in the sky. And airports? Train stations with tighter security, more expensive food, and MUCH better shopping. Really. Mostly, they are BORING and you will spend much time sitting around in them, so bring a good book or two. \n \nAnd sit right by your gate from an hour before departure on. Really. \n \nBecause I *might* have once been so engrossed by a book I was reading in a quiet little spot a bit far away from that pesky, noisy gate that I nearly missed my fight, had to beg them to NOT shut the gangway door in my face. \n \nAnd finally, because SOMEONE should learn from my past mistakes (and it's certainly not going to be me): \n \nDO remember to pack underwear. \n \nAnd? Good Luck! \n \n* If your really want some wonderful, practical help-you-plan-for-your-first-BlogHer advice? Or even just someone else's take on the whole thing? Go read these great posts from these wonderful bloggers: \n \nTry  BlogHer Bound: San Diego, Here We Come   from Mo of  One Ping Only  or   this funny one ,  How to Prepare for BlogHer   from Sherri of  Old Tweener.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2011", "body": "\nWe have gone to the beach, my children and I, finally this summer, in mid July.  \n \nOur toes slide past the shoreline\u2019s tickling foam fingers with hours and hours of traveled anticipation at our backs pushing us further and further into the crashing waves. \n \nThe first slap of ocean upon sun warmed flesh a shock delicious and bracing, and as familiar as breathing to me, thrown suddenly way back to my beach-washed childhood. \n \nThey want to go deep, my sons. Beyond the breakers, with me. \n \n\"Swim, mommy! I want to swim!\" Jacob has been chanting over and over, impatient through the processes of establishing our beachhead; of blankets unfurled and corner weighted, towels piled at the ready, glasses securely stowed away.  \n \nHe will not be denied. \n \nWe stand thigh deep in the churning foam as I test the ocean\u2019s resolve to push us under, pull us out. The waves are dramatic but not demonic, the undertow manageable. It\u2019s a go. \n \nThis first time I must take them out together, as neither will countenance being left behind, shore-locked and waiting. \n \nWhen I was their age I was out in the deep on my own, body surfing the breaking waves as my father had taught me.\u00a0 But these are city boys, our forays to ocean beaches few and far between. Once or twice a summer season. (Last year not at all, to my heart's sorrow.) \n \nAnd I, after an urban beginning, was raised an Island girl, the south shore beaches my constant summer's terrain.  \n \nIt was a casual thing for our family. Once a week, sometimes more, we'd toss our towels and a couple of peanut butter & jelly sandwiches into a bag and we\u2019d be off to the beach. And then as a teenager, I would venture alone with friends on the Jones Beach bus. \n \nWith my sons, however, it's an outing, a sojourn, planned, scheduled, only attempted when the stars align and circumstances are just right. Like last Sunday. \n \nThey want to run headlong into the surf but I hold them back, an old hand at this game. \n \n\u201cDo you want to get trashed by the waves?\u201d I ask them.  \n \n\u201cNoooo!\u201d they howl, seeking to be spared this indignity.  \n \n\u201cThen wait for my signal, move when I move, and fast!\u201d I instruct.  \n \nI stand looking seaward, study the waves as they collapse upon the many small sandbars that carpet the ocean floor here, engendering a complex pattern, difficult to properly time our approach.  \n \nI watch the ebb and the flow, making sense of what looks like chaos, and slowly the patterns emerge. There are occasional rogue waves coming in from the right, but basically these big waves come on: one, two, three, and then a little lull, one, two, three and then the lull, the outgoing wave canceling out the incoming one, creating calm, the appearance of stasis on the surface when below there is a swirling pas de deux. \n \n\u201cNow!\u201d I yell, hoping I\u2018ve got it, that the wave I see beginning to swell out beyond the red ball buoy is going to be small, shallow, cresting once we are well beyond it. And indeed it is.  \n \n\u201cJump\u201d I shout as the wave passes, rising us up with it, nowhere near ready to crash and crush.  \n \n(Yes, I\u2019ve called it right.)  \n \nWe bob and sway with the tide. Our faces split open in joy. You wouldn\u2019t know which twin is autistic out here in the deep, both boys happily treading water, calmly following my instructions. \n \n\u201cOver, over!\u201d I yell, and we rise up together, laughing into the spray. With Ethan tightly gripping my right hand and Jake my left, I am sincerely hoping my nose does not start to itch.  \n \nOccasionally a wave rises up and up, curls over us ominously, and our strategy changes. \u201cUnder!\u201d I command and we dive below, surfacing to the screams of those being crashed upon, further ashore.  \n \nA double wave catches us by surprise, causing me to drop right into its crest, expecting a lull. As I snort some ocean water, I feel my feet starting to cramp and realize I have hit the point where my body is tiring of this constantly alert state. Time to head in. \n \nThe boys howl in protest, would stay out here all day, rising and falling in the swells with Mom. But I am the grown-up here, know when I am reaching my limits.  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe anymore,\u201d I tell them, \u201cI'm getting too tired to keep you safe.\u201d  \n \n\u201cNooooo!\u201d they wail. But I am the Mom. \n \nI turn my body toward the shore, but my head and gaze swivel back to watch once again the patterning of the waves. I want us to travel with them, to use the waves\u2019 energy to bolster our flagging reserves, riding them shoreward.  \n \nI am trying to describe my process to Ethan, trying to teach, to pass on my knowledge; but this is hard, making explicit what is inside me mostly a feeling.  \n \nThere are so many variables, chaos theory in action. There is my mind, calculating, looking at the swells: how high will they go, how fast are they traveling, how long it has been since the wave before, how fast it is being chased by the next, when and where and how large is the wave returning from shore to meet it?  \n \nBut what is happening in the ocean at any moment is more than the sum of these parts. There is a gestalt to it, a knowing of the ocean, a sensing of her mood.  \n \nI can\u2019t even say how I know what I know, but I know it. I feel it. \n \nI have spent hours, days, years in the ocean and been trashed maybe thrice. Not in years.  \n \nAnd so when I yell to the boys \u201cNOW! Move with THIS wave, let it carry you in!\u201d I know it HAS to be this one; that hesitation will bring disaster, our timing off, the pattern all wrong and a wave will crash at our backs before we are far enough in, possibly throw us down, pull us under into a total sand-face-mash-up.  \n \nNot the end of the world, these waves too gentle for real damage; but still, a scary incident, a glimpse into the dark side of the ocean\u2019s magic that I am not ready to invite yet into their sweet lives.  \n \nBut lo, the boys listen, they move with me and the waves, let themselves be carried in.  \n \nAnd as our feet hit the sand we run, slogging fast towards shore. So the waves catch up with us too low to pull us under, a sandy tickling caress only.  \n \nWe splash around in the shallows for a while, not quite ready to leave the salty sea. And as we drop onto the sand happily spent, let the receding tide tickle our feet, we look out at the noisy ocean and laugh. How we laugh. \n \nThey like to go deep, my sons.  \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  The Red Dress Club .

{"date": "Monday, July 18, 2011", "body": "\nJake\u2019s been taking center stage in the blog for a while now (what with the autism and all), and Ethan wants me to remind you folks that he exists, too. \n \nSo here are a few more snippets of life with Ethan. Enjoy him. (I do.) \n \n \n \n Ethan, Summer 2011 \n \nThe other night Ethan complained to me \"My life is boring right now.\"  \n \n\"What? Why?\" I asked, slightly stunned, what with the fun camp and many friends and all.  \n \n\"Well, there's nothing going on in my life. I kind of like Gogos, but not THAT much... There\u2019s nothing I'm REALLY into right now\u201d  \n \nAhhhh, I see, life without an overriding obsession feels\u2026 different... lesser. \n \nI suggested to him that maybe it was time to take up a real life hobby that could grow with him - like a musical instrument, instead of him outgrowing - like all his Japanimation toy obsessions: Power Rangers, Bakugan, Pokemon, Beyblades\u2026 and now Gogos Crazy Bones\u2026 \n \n\"No, Mom, I just need a new THING to be into.\"  \n \nWell, at least it's not girls. Yet. \n \n(Also, just so you know, this conversation took place, of course, while he was on the toilet, just before bedtime. Once  a bathroom conversationalist , always a bathroom conversationalist.) \n \n \n\u00a0@@@@@@@ \n \nAt bedtime the other night Ethan got the giggles -- this is, unfortunately, a not uncommon occurrence. He gets these funny ideas, and well, they make him laugh. Not the most conducive to sleep, now, is that?\u00a0  \n \nEthan. My budding insomniac night owl child.\u00a0 (Sigh.) \n \nSo, this time the \u201cfunny thought\u201d ran along the lines of \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be soooo funny to have a boy and name him Muriel? Or Betsy, or Isabel.\u201d Somehow naming of the inappropriate variety is a big theme for Ethan, and a frequent source of mirth.\u00a0 (As all gender reversals are, too, come to think of it.) \n \nHe was going on and on, suggesting girlier and girlier names as possible candidates for \u201cWorst. Boy. Name. Ever.\u201d I was trying to put the kibosh on this, to shush him up, both to help him calm down enough to sleep and so as not to wake Jacob with his chortling. \n \nBut then I couldn\u2019t help myself. \n \n\u201cWell, you know there\u2019s that famous song about A Boy Named Sue\u2026\u201d \n \nEthan didn\u2019t. He wanted to know all about it.  \n \nI told him a tiny bit about Johnny Cash and the song; just a tease, really, enough to intrigue him. And then I told him I would find it on You Tube for him the next day and play it for him ONLY if he quieted down and went to sleep right away. \n \nIt worked. \n \nThe next day, when he came home from camp, I had it all cued up, waiting for him, keeping my word. I played it; we got to the end. \n \nAnd his reaction? \n \n\"That\u2019s just WEIRD, mom.\" \n \nAnd then the thousand questions, about the song... \"Why did he leave his family... and why does he want his son to be a fighter... and why did he want to kill his Dad... and why would ANYBODY name a boy Sue and... ?\" \n \nAnd the singer... \"Why is he the man in black... and why is he playing in a prison... and why is his voice so low and... ?\" \n \nAnd a part of me wanted to say \"It's just a song, Ethan.\" \n \nExcept it isn't. It's a part of our heritage now, our mythic landscape.  \n \nAnd Johnny is one of the Great Beings who have walked among us (although of course he was also just a man; someone's son, father, husband, brother, grandfather). \n \nAnd you know who wrote it, right? \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nLast night I attempted to explain the mechanics of humor to Ethan. All about how to tell a joke and what makes a joke funny or not. Not easy stuff to quantify. \n \nIt started with a discussion of swimming at camp, he talked about learning the backstroke, which led to my telling him that old chestnut of a joke from the classic lexicon: \n \n\"Waiter what\u2019s this fly doing in my soup?\" \n \n\u201cThe backstroke, sir.\u201d \n \n(cue rimshot)  \n \nHe then wanted to hear more waiter jokes \u2013 so I told him the \u201cWho wanted the clean glass?\u201d joke and then started in on other \u201cclassic\u201d jokes, like the \u201c... walks into a bar\" formulation. \n \nSilly me, after much pleading I finally told him my favorite walks-into-a-bar joke. Which, unfortunately involves a certain knowledge of existential philosophy. It begins \"Descartes walks into a bar...\"*  \n \nHave you ever tried explaining existentialism to a nearly 9 year old?\u00a0 (Yeah, me neither.)  \n \nAnd then we ended up talking about how certain variations on the chicken-crossing-the-road are funny and some are not.\u00a0 And why. \n \nWhen I said \u201cand then, when you deliver the punch line, you have to drop it in just right\u201d? He thought that was hysterical. \n \nHe had never heard the term and got very distracted and entertained by the idea of ACTUALLY punching someone while telling a joke. \n \nSigh. \n \nI guess he is still a not-yet-quite-nine year-old boy after all. \n \n \n@@@@@@@  \n \nAnd those are all the tales of Ethan I have to tell... today. \n \nYou know there will be more soon. \n \nBecause Ethan keeps being Ethan. \n \nAnd that?  \n \nIs entertainment. \n \n \n *Oh, you want to hear the  Descartes  joke? Really? OK. It's short, sweet, a little absurd, definitely goofy (and I love it): \n \nDescartes  walks into a bar. \n \nPulls up a stool, sits down. \n \nHe starts chatting with  the other folks at the bar. \n \nThe bartender is getting impatient, asks  him: \"So, buddy, are you going to order a drink?\" \n \nDescartes answers: \"I think not.\" \n \nAnd promptly disappears. \n \n(cue rimshot)  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Kids are gonna be tired at camp & summer school tomorrow. But? Not my problem (yay!)

(we will be forgiven). There were trains and taxis and ferries, and then...  \n \nWe went into the ocean... oh yes! The waves were big but not too rough and so we faced them & got out with our dignities intact (no total trashes)  \n \nLots of \"swimming\" and then sand time. \n \nAny doubt Jake is a sensory seeker? Quashed when I found him basically swimming in the sand, pouring it on ihs own head for good measure (can you say needed 3x shampoo, yes.)

Funny. Priceless. \n \nThere was ice cream. and potato chips. Also hummus (see, not all junk). \n \nOf course the ferry ride back was packed. 7 pm on a perfect summer day, everyone was at the beach and weekenders were headed home, too. so we couldn't ride up top and Jake was disappointed, but lo, who should sit next to us but a good looking young couple with a... (wait for it) BABY! \n \nGiven Jake's current baby obsession was a total win.

And since I LOVE looking at pictures of my boys from way back when, I'm so in! \n \nEspecially as we're fast approaching their 9th birthday at the end of this month, and so I'm I getting all weepy and nostalgic reflecting on how they've grown and are (sob) not my little babies anymore. \n \nMy boys were endlessly cute back then (still are).

They are from a more innocent time, before I knew  we were headed down the road hand in hand with autism. \n \nSo when I see these pictures I am brought back to those impossible-to-believe-now days when the future was endlessly rosy and anything  seemed possible; when I thought my boys would be best friends forever, never  lonely, always having each other to play with.  \n \nAnything is still possible. But some things seem a lot less probable, now. Sigh.  \n \nAnd now, as a bonus (and also because I can never leave well enough alone)... I'm throwing some generational stuff into the mix here. \n \nFirst a trio of pictures from a contact sheet of newborn me, being held by my lovely, then raven-haired mother. Taken by my marvelous photographer father.  \n \n \nDon't I look like a mix of the two of them? (Oh, wait, genetics goes the OTHER way... so, um, rather, don't they look like me?) \n \nAnd finally, my father as a baby, in 1917: \n \n \nAs astonishing as it may seem to young children, old people were once babies, too! \n \n This post is linked up over at  Things I Can\u2019t Say . \u00a0Thank you, Shell, for encouraging us all to share photos of our babies (sob, they're not babies any more). \n   \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, July 14, 2011", "body": "\nM is for Movies. \n \nI grew up watching them. \n \nMy parents loved movies. \n \nBut more importantly? They loved film, cinema, the real deal. \n \nI was taken to important films from the time I was young. \n \nOh, we went to the blockbusters, the kid flicks, the fun things. \n \nBut also? Serious films. The ones that meant something, opened you up, pulled you apart, turned you inside out, put you back together differently. \n \nYou don't think a film can change you? \n \nThen you've been watching the wrong movies. \n \nWhen I was eight years old, on the 4th of July? \n \nInstead of fireworks (which still frightened me a bit at that age anyway) my parents took me to the movies. \n \nZeferelli's  Romeo and Juliet . \n \nIt was rated \"M\" for Mature audiences (in 1968 there was no R yet, no PG-13). \n \nI still remember the beauty and lyricism of Shakespeare's words. And Romeo's naked butt. \n \nMy parents loved classic films. I watched hundreds of old black and white movies on the TV, was no stranger to Bogey and Bacall; Katherine Hepburn my idol.\u00a0  \n \nMy mother loved musicals. And I loved Barbra Streisand passionately.  Hello Dolly  and  Funny Girl , of course, but also  The Owl and the Pussycat   where Barbra plays a sometime hooker who drops the F-bomb (the first time a female star ever uttered that word in a Hollywood picture). \n \n(At the time, I had no idea why I loved her so much. But looking back I can clearly see she is the only star who looks anything remotely like me, Jewish and significantly shnozzed and all.)  \n \nMy parents took me to foreign films. With subtitles. And we watched them fervently on public television.  \n \nI remember being very tired in the mornings for a whole month of the 11th grade because Cinema 13 was hosting a Japanese film festival nightly at 11 PM. \n \nThis was in the days of broadcast TV. \n \nThere was no cable. There were no VCRs. \n \nIf you wanted to watch something? You had to show up. You had a date with your TV for when it was being broadcast. \n \nAnd we really wanted to watch Kurosawa, Ozu and Teshigahara. I was the only 15 year-old I knew whose favorite film was  Woman in the Dunes . \n \n(Until it was eclipsed by Bergman's  Persona  the next year.) \n \nWe loved Woody Allen. He was ours. (The uber-New York Jew.) \n \nWe loved Robert Altman (no explanation necessary). \n \nWe loved the actress Ruth Gordon and quoted lines from  Where's Poppa?   and  Harold and Maude   as part of our private family patois.  \n \nFilms informed my whole life.  \n \nI studied film in college, became a film and video maker, made my living in a branch of the business.  \n \nStudying film was delicious. I got to watch so many wonderful films, as well as learning how to make them.  \n \nThere were times I would become a bit... obsessed with certain films. \n \nWatching them over and over, finding truths in their flashing frames. A string that would vibrate in my soul every time a moment played out, an image seared into my brain, imprinted, that my eyes wanted to see. \n \nOver and over. \n \nLike these films, among many others... \n \n Hiroshima Mon Amour  (Possibly my favorite film of all time. About memory. And love. And everything else.) \n \n Dr. Strangelove \u00a0 (First seen as a child on New Year's Eve, with the end-of-the-world  mushroom cloud  explosions perfectly timed with the stroke of midnight) \n \n Diva  (If  you have never seen this film? I don't know how to describe it, nor to  adequately convey how consumed I was by it when I first saw it, and then  watched it again and again and again. Yes, obsession was the operative  word here. Yes. I have not viewed it again in years, don't know if it  holds up, am almost afraid to find out.) \n \n The Lion in Winter\u00a0  (This  moment... Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine says to her  jewelry: \"I would hang you from my nipples but it would shock the  children.\" Perfection.) \n \n Stealing Beauty  (Whatever you think of Liv Tyler, this is Bertolucci and a luminous film. Do not let your teenage virgin daughter watch if you want her to stay that way.) \n \n Burden of Dreams  (A film-making friend of mine was obsessed with this film & pulled  me into her obsession, making me watch with her, over and over. It's a documentary made by the filmmaker Les Blank, who was in turn obsessed with the obsessive nature of  Werner Herzog while making  Fitzcarraldo , a film about a man obsessed with a\u00a0 boat. Sensing a theme here? At one point Herzog says, \"I shouldn't make films anymore, I should be in a lunatic asylum.\")  \n \n Blade Runner\u00a0  (I know you're thinking: Wait. What? That's a big blockbuster film, a genre film from a commercial director, not a personally meaningful work from an \"Auteur.\" Where did that come from?  \n \n Well, a great film is a great film. And I have always loved Science Fiction. And this film? Was something else. Something new. Ever since you laid eyeballs upon it, you cannot picture the future without either referencing or refuting this film's vision of it, so completely did it create that world.  \n \n It is in our psyches. Permanently. And I wouldn't have it any other way.)  \n \nWhen I was a young girl, my parents business, an Art Gallery, was located on the main street of our suburban town, right next door to the movie theater. On the other side of the theater, physically part of the same building, nestled into a little chunk of its side, was a delicatessen and candy store. \n \nI went to work with my parents on Saturdays, as did the Deli owner's daughter, Diana, a girl my age. We were friends. \n \nAnd because her parents were friendly with the movie theater's owner? We got to see the Saturday matinee movie every Saturday. For free. Even the popcorn was free, if we brought our own paper bags to put it in. \n \nMy parents didn't have much money back then so the free part was wonderful for them. And it took me out of their hair for two hours or so. Win. \n \nAnd I? Was in movie-loving heaven. \n \nThe matinees were movies for children. Occasionally classics like  The Sound of Music  or  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , but often pure kid fodder like  Island of the Lost  or  With Six You Get Eggroll.   We didn't care.  \n \nThis was of the time before multiplexes, before theaters resembled nothing more than rectangular boxes with another glowing rectangle up front for you to fix your eyes upon. \n \nThis theater was old, it had nooks and crannies. A vaulted ceiling, cherubs. Deep red, velvety wallpaper softening the walls. \n \nAnd a loge, where we sat, week after week, my friend Diana and I. Sucking on rock candy from her parents store, slipping fistfuls of popcorn from brown paper bags, grown greasy, into our hungry mouths.  \n \nWe were there to be transported. Even drek like  Destroy All Monsters  called forth the magic. It didn't matter, for we were learning to see. \n \nTo see in the dark. \n \nAnd now, what is it my autistic son Jacob loves more than anything else in the world? \n \nMovies. \n \nHe loves movies. \n \nHe is learning about the world though them; he is learning to see. \n \nTo see in the dark. \n \n \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's   Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And isn't \"M\" is such a lovely letter? Shaped like a mountain, it is.  \n \n \n \n \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for... \u00a0 because I am grateful that my life has been enriched by the existence of wonderful movies, and most especially for the parents who taught me to love film.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, July 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's Special Needs Sibling Saturdays guest is a real dynamo. If I ever feel tempted to whine about feeling overwhelmed by my life (and believe me, I do) I just think of  Julie Cole.\u00a0  \n \n Julie  chronicles her life as the mother of SIX  (yes, I said 6!)  children in her writing at two blogs,  The Baby Machine ,  at the Yummy Mummy Club (a wonderful Canadian site) and  Mabel Mama of Many  at  The Mabelhood .\u00a0 She also works full time at the  wonderful  company s he co-founded,  Mabel\u2019s Labels Inc . \n \n And I have never heard her whine once, never seen her be anything less than friendly, gracious and lovely at the many blogging events she must attend to promote her business.\u00a0  \n \n Julie's six children range in age from 2 to 11, three girls and three boys.\u00a0 Her oldest son (currently 11) is the one who is on the autism spectrum. Also, her youngest son is experiencing significant speech delays and some behavioral issues that is making her concerned he may be headed down some version of that same path. \n \n Julie is not, primarily, an autism blogger, writing  mostly  about the general parenting issues that come with having six kids, a Mom of Many, indeed. She doesn't downplay the way autism has impacted their lives. It's more that she's  matter-of-fact about it,  it's  just  one issue of... many, in their busy, busy lives. \n \n In fact, I know that she has an autistic child because she casually brought it  up when I first met her and we were talking about my main blogging  topics. Frankly I was shocked. She looked so relaxed, so cheerful, so un-frazzled, I didn't know how she did it.\u00a0  \n \n I still don't know how she does it. And I HATE it when people say that to & about ME. But still, I am deeply impressed by her joie de vivre in the face of how much she juggles on a daily basis.\u00a0  \n \n But enough of my chit chat, come read all about her large, wonderful family, here: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Siblings \u2013 The Best Therapy   \u2013 by Julie Cole \n \n \n \n Julie's six children in 2009 \n \nWhen my eldest child was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, he already had two little sisters. People commented about how \u201cbrave\u201d I was to go on and have two more. There was actually nothing brave about it \u2013 his sisters had already arrived by the time he was diagnosed. \n \nPerhaps the brave part came when we went on to have three more children. Our kid head count is up to six, the eldest now eleven years old and the youngest recently turned two.  \n \nI find the term \u201cbrave\u201d to be a strange one. The underlying implication is that raising a child with autism must be so awful that you wouldn\u2019t risk going through it again. \n \nBelieve me, the thought of going down the autism road twice was very daunting and certainly not on my bucket list of things to do before I die. However, we found that the benefit of having more kids outweighed the risk of another autism experience.  \n \nBesides, I figured if it happened again, at least I would know what I was doing this time around. I had invested so much time and money into research and materials, I had studied and read about therapies and I was a full member of the autism community.  \n \nA second child with autism would have almost made sense \u2013 I would be getting more out of all the work I did for Number One Son! \n \nThe benefits of his sibling relationships have been countless for my son, for various reasons. To name a few: \n \n Siblings Force Him Out of His Comfort Zone \nHere was a kid with communication deficits and difficulty with social skills. When you have three little sisters by the time you are five, there\u2019s no avoiding situations that target your deficits. \n \nThose sisters chatted with him, kept him engaged and dragged him into imaginative play around the clock. He was socialized at all times \u2013 he did everything with his sisters from eating, bathing and sharing a bedroom. He couldn\u2019t turn around without having a sister in his face putting demands on him. \n \n Big Families Have Big Expectations \nWe\u2019ve all seen it within the community \u2013 parents who cater to their child because of an autism diagnosis. Sometimes they just do too much for their kids because they feel bad for them. The classic learned helplessness case is especially upsetting when you see it in children with disabilities.  \n \nNo chance of that happening around here; I\u2019m too busy to cater to his every whim. Our little man has to run with the pack \u2013 doing chores, watching his youngest brother, getting his homework done on time. There is a set of rules in our house, and his autism doesn\u2019t get him off the hook. It takes all hands on deck to keep a family like this functioning, and every member must chip in.  \n \n Cheap Therapy \nMy children have been raised in a household where ABA is a lifestyle. The funniest little therapist moment I can remember was when my son was six and his sister was five. I asked him to get me a spoon so he walked into the kitchen and stood staring at the drawers unsure of where the spoons were. \n \nHis little sister, knowing that we never feed him answers, joined him in the kitchen and said \u201cOK, do you think the spoons are in THIS drawer, or THIS drawer?\u201d pointing at two different drawers. I rolled my eyes as he went over to the correct drawer and fetched me the spoon. \n \n \n*** \nI didn\u2019t decide to have a lot of children because of my son\u2019s autism, but with each passing day I am more and more convinced that his siblings are the very best gift I gave him. \n \nAnd they\u2019re pretty darn lucky to have him too.  \n \n \n @@@@@@@ \n \n Thank you so much, Julie for straight-shooting, upbeat post. So much like yourself. You really are my hero. \n \n So now that you have read her here, you're definitely going to want more Julie (more! more!) so come visit her at her  blogs,  The Baby Machine  and  Mabel Mama of Many , where she makes parenting six kids look easy (or at least manageable) and most importantly - FUN!   \n \n Try this moving post about something we've all experienced:  Mrs. Judgy McJudgerson at the Mall  or this one about acceptance:  You Get What You Get  or this moving post about miscarriage and loss:  A Different Kind of Remembrance Day . \n \n The closest she ever gets to complaining that I've seen is here, telling us what NOT to say to her about her autistic son:  Nice Things You Say That Annoy Me,  and here she makes it clear that she thinks her life is anything but awful:  Is My Life Awful? \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Finally, you should read this post:  The Reasons You Should Not Take My Advice   because it's really funny. \n \n Also? You will certainly want to follow Julie on  Twitter as both herself    @juliecole , and also her business    @mabelhood  to keep up with news and special offers on their fabulous products. \n \n Thanks once again Julie for taking time out of your incredibly busy life to share some of your wonderful self with us, here.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2011", "body": "\nI love the \"-ish\" formulation. \n \nImplying sort of, almost, kinda, in the neighborhood of, the ballpark of but not exactly; no commitments here. \n \nAnd me? I am never truly wordless am I? \n \nNo, not wordy, wordy me. \n \nSo, here's some photos from the boys lovely Sunday in the park with Mom, and also some words (because I just can't help myself): \n \nSunday? Was a perfect beach day. But we didn't go to the beach (my lingering summer cold knocking me out just too much for that). \n \nSo we went to the park. And in New York City, when you say \"the park,\" you usually mean Central Park, the mother of all NYC parks. \n \nWe did. And here's the pictures to prove it... \n \nFirst stop:  Victorian Gardens Amusement Park \n \n \nSome days? I am very grateful that Jacob is a member of the sensory-seeking autism tribe, so we can do things like this. He LOVES rides and motion; and the loud commotion in the park? Doesn't phase him a bit. Crank up the music, yo, it's all good! \n \n \nEthan was there with friends, so I didn't see much of him. The beauty of it being a very small, contained amusement park (in the footprint of the Wollman ice skating rink) and of Ethan's being almost 9 is that I can now just buy him a ride-all-day wristband and send him off with his friends, keeping half an eye out for them as I follow Jacob around from ride to ride. \n \nEthan has the extra cell phone on him if he needs me, and we meet back at our \"home base\" (a centrally located bench the moms take turns sitting on, and my  huge bag  is stationed at) at regularly scheduled times. And when the kids come begging for money for junk food. \n \nFun!  \n \nAnd then, when we were done with that and walking home through the park:\u00a0 ROCKS! \n \n \n \n \n \n One thing my boys agree on (and they don't agree on much) is that rocks rule. They LOVE to climb up, down, all over and around big rocks. Love to find, move, stack and play with the smaller rocks. \n \n \u00a0 \nRocks, rocks, rocks. \n \n \n \n \n \n A ton of exposed  Manhattan Schist  = great rocks for climbing.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 12, 2011", "body": "\nI'm going to let you in on a little secret. \n \nShhhhhh... quiet now...  \n \nCome closer, let me whisper in your ear... \n \nHave you noticed something... different about me this month? \n \nI'll give you a hint:  \n \nLook over to your left in my \"Blog Archive\"... \n \nSee anything unusual there (for me)? \n \nYes, today *IS* the 12th of July, and yes this *IS* my 12th post of the month. \n \nI've been posting every day in July, so far. \n \n(Thanks for noticing.)\u00a0  \n \nI've been keeping kind of quiet about it, afraid if I make a big announcement it will trip me up, jinxes and all. (For a basically rational person I still carry a little superstition around in my back pocket.) \n \nBut it's been going so well (one might even say swimmingly) and I was never one for keeping secrets, so I am officially announcing here: \n \nI have joined  NaBloPoMo  this month over at  BlogHer . \n \n \nWhat's that? (Ask my non-bloggy friends who are scratching their heads right about now.) \n \nIt's National Blog Posting Month. (NaBloPoMo for short, though that's STILL a mouthful.) \n \nBasically? It's a commitment to post daily for a month, no matter what hell, high water, summer flus, school bus breakdowns or elder-care disasters may come.  \n \nCrazy, I know, what with my crazy life. Autism and all. Not a good time. \n \nBut there is NEVER a good time, and I really loved the theme for this month, so I figured, what the hell. \n \nTheme? \n \nThere's a theme? \n \nYes, I'm not posting on it much, but it is lovely... it's \"Swim\"\u00a0  \n Like my post from last Friday:  Swimmingly \n \nAnd hopefully maybe another, sometime soon.  \n \nSo, how's it going (you may ask)? \n \nSo far, so good. \n \nAnd the kind of cool, kind of wonderful thing that I'm still even a little bit afraid to talk about... \n \nI am finding that the more I write, the easier it gets, the more I want to write, the more ideas come to me all the time, my mind just going to the \"writing place\" constantly, nearly no-stop. \n \nKind of like the opposite of being blocked, my spigot seems to be stuck in \"on.\"\u00a0 Not that I'm complaining. \n \nI actually now have a backlog of nearly complete posts and a dozen quickly jotted down ideas that are going to blossom into something, I can feel it. \n \nSo all those old teachers of mine who said the secret to truly being a writer is to write every day, no matter what? \n \nTurns out? \n \nThey were right. \n \nGo figure. \n \nAnd the best part? \n \nIt's making me really happy. \n \n(Shhhh, don't tell anyone. I'm not sure, as a special needs parent, I'm allowed to be really happy.) \n \nSo, I'll see you back here tomorrow. \n \n(And this time, you can count on it.) \n \nWish me luck!\u00a0  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

(Hey you, take your mind out of the gutter, I'm not talking about THAT kind of self-love.) \n \nBut right now, according to many women I know and admire (might I even say love?) who, like me, blog? I am supposed to be writing a list of things I like about myself. \n \nFor  this linky .  \n \nEngendered by a post of  The Empress's,  about accepting  ourselves despite our imperfections . Conceived and hosted by  CiaoMom , who wrote up her own wonderfully empowering list already. \n \nShe says:  \n \n Today is all about celebrating who we are and what we like about  ourselves. It is about sending a message to ourselves, to society, and  even to our children, that finding the positives in yourself is an  important and essential endeavor.\u00a0 Maybe just maybe, thinking about what  we like instead of what we would want to change, will increase our self  confidence. Maybe it will help us see things that we have not noticed  before. And maybe it will send the message that we are ENOUGH just the  way we are. \n \nOK. \n \nSold. \n \nLaying the doubting voices aside. \n \nTelling my inner critic (who is damn loud these days) to take the freaking day off.  \n \nCracking my knuckles. \n \nLet's get down to business. \n \nWriting my list of...  \n \n Two or Three things I like about myself:   \n \n1. I really like how curly my hair is. (OK, I borrowed this one from The Empress, but it's a start) \n \n2. I like that I was really able to be there for my father while he was dying. That I was not afraid of either the intensity of the feelings or the heavy workload. That I bore it, and thus was also able to be there with and for my Mother in those difficult last three months. \n \n3. I like my writing, that I feel I am really finding my writer's voice. (Wow, THAT was a hard one to write down and own, without feeling like I'm being somehow... unseemly, braggardly. But then, I spent nearly 30 years as a blocked writer and I do really like that I have broken through.) \n \n4. I like that I am a fierce advocate for my children. That I am not afraid of the word Autism. That the moment I started to see that my son had issues, I have pushed for knowing (and doing). I never had a moment of head-in-the-sandness, not a drop of denial. \n \n5. I like my affectionate nature. I am a warm, cuddly, huggy, hand-holding person. It's just a part of my nature, totally instinctive. If I love you? You will know it. And I'm going to touch you. (Unless you are a touch-averse sensory avoider, Then I will almost touch you, but hold back and just send my waves of affection to you through my eyes and words.) \n \n6. I like that I am handy. I know my way around a tool box. I own a Makita driver-drill. I have put together Ikea furniture without cursing (unless they've messed up the parts, then I curse, A LOT). \n \n7. I like that I am a loyal friend. That I go out of my way for people, that I take care of and stand by my friends. That I put myself easily in other people's shoes and act from a place of empathy. \n \n8. I like that I am a connector, a community builder. If you have something to give away that she needs? Nothing pleases me more than helping you find each other. I love to find common ground. I am into much less than six degrees of separation. \n \n9. I like how much I love my children. Unconditionally. With many hugs and kisses. And (on the good days) more patience than I would have thought possible.\u00a0  \n \n10. I like the way I dance. I fully inhabit my body. I move with the music. I am playful with my dance partner. I am a joyous dancer. I really love to dance. (Note to self: Dance more.)  \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \nSo, I made it to 10. That's more than two or three. \n \nConsidering how I feel right now? Major accomplishment. (Hey, maybe that's another one - I like the way I will rise to the occasion when pushed.) \n \nThanks to CiaoMom and The Empress for creating this wonderful pool of positive thinking. \n \nAnd a special thanks to all the women who tweeted encouragement to me when I whined about not being in the right space to find the self-like last night. \n \n \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, July 9, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today Special Needs Sibling Saturdays is host to a very special blogger, someone near and dear to my heart.\u00a0 While my sensibilities may be close to the \"old time\" bloggers, the ones who write for the joy of storytelling and connection, I am actually fairly new at this game, having begin The Squashed Bologna just a year and a half ago.\u00a0 \n \n Shortly after that I joined a collective blogging group, the  NYC Moms Blog , a part of the larger Silicon Valley Moms Group (SVMG) which had sister sites across the country. In their LA site, I discovered  Elizabeth Aquino who blogs at  a moon, worn as if it had been a shell , and I fell in love with her words and her family.\u00a0 \n \n Elizabeth is the mother to three children, Her eldest is  Sophie , who has a severe seizure disorder and developmental disabilities. Sophie has two younger brothers,  Henry  and  Oliver .\u00a0 \u00a0  \n \n Elizabeth is a poet and lover of poetry (her blog's name comes from a poem by William Butler Yeats) , and her love of words comes through in all her posts, be they about her family or food ( or both ).  \n \n So come, read her beautiful words, here: \n \n \n@@@@@@@ \n \n Hilarity and the Mermaid\u2019s Brothers\u00a0  \u2013 by Elizabeth Aquino \n \nDuring the days prior to my writing this post, I attempted to probe both my sons about their feelings being the siblings of a girl with severe epilepsy and developmental disabilities.  \n \nHenry is almost thirteen years old and Oliver is ten; Sophie is sixteen and has had a refractory seizure disorder since she was nearly three months old, so both brothers have lived their entire lives as the siblings of a child with special needs. \n \nIt's all they know of their sister and while they have expressed, over the years, their frustrations and sorrows that she can't talk or \u201cbe normal,\u201d I can honestly say that their attitude toward her is one of nearly complete equanimity. It is what they know.  \n \nHenry, in particular, has been almost preternaturally compassionate and loving toward his sister since he was a tiny child, and their relationship to this day is very special and significantly different than that of Oliver or even my or my husband's with Sophie. Sophie often reaches out with her hand and toward Henry's face, gently stroking it and staring into his eyes.  \n \nShe seems to know and understand his gentleness. He is able to help me with her, even during a seizure, and stay completely calm.  \n \nOliver, on the other hand, has always seemed more conflicted about Sophie and her disability, and whether this is just a reflection of his superior (to Henry) ability to convey his feelings (however outrageous and negative) is unclear.  \n \nHe has taken a very active, nearly heroic role in the fight against the word \u201cretard\u201d at his school and in our neighborhood, yet he is also the one who is quick to tell me that he's not sure he wants to take care of Sophie when I die.  \n \nAnd yes, he actually told me that, back when he was about five years old.  \n \nHenry, on the other hand, has decided that when he's older and very rich, he'll have a padded room for Sophie to live in and be safe from seizures, and maybe even a robot to decipher her humming noises. \n \nWith that said, and going back to my initial inquiries to better prepare myself for this post, I had this conversation with Oliver: \n \n So, what's it like for you to be the brother of a girl with epilepsy and special needs? \n \n Um, not again, Mom?  Oliver answered, and he rolled his eyes. \n \n Come on , I said,  help me out. What are some of the feelings that you have about Sophie? \n \nOliver sighed and started walking round and round the dining room table where I sat, listening. I was also casually flipping through a magazine, not putting any pressure on him. \n \n Upset , he said. \n \nBoring \n \nScary \n \nFrustrating \n \nI hate it. \n \nI looked up at him, and he smiled.  \n \n Just kidding , he said and he rolled his eyes, again. \n \n O.K. , I asked him,  I hear you on the negative stuff. Now tell me something positive. \n \nWithout missing a beat, Oliver replied,  It's kind of cool to get to park in handicapped parking spaces.  \n \nBefore I could protest, though, he smiled and said, again,  Just kidding. \n \nI think this brief exchange speaks worlds for what the experience is like being the little brother of a young woman who has big, ugly seizures nearly every day and who can't talk and needs assistance with all life activities, including walking, eating and personal hygiene.  \n \nI know that Oliver feels every single emotion that he listed, and I know that when he watches his sister seize at the dinner table he is at once horrified and numb to the spectacle and chaos. Being upset, bored, scared and frustrated by the often chaotic goings-on in our home are normal emotions, to be expected, and I have made a very conscious effort to not only expect them but to accept them from my sons. \n \nWhat has surprised me, though, is my boys' resilience to this chaos and the strength of their own personalities, their ability to find hilarity and absurdity in the otherwise traumatic events they witness as they live their lives.  \n \nBecause they are living their lives, their own lives, and while their sister's life is entwined with theirs in significant ways, and her disabilities often demand great emotional and circumstantial sacrifices, they are on their own unique journeys.  \n \nWhile I worry occasionally that they have never had a normal day because of their sister's epilepsy, and I yearn to know what it might have been like to not have this heavy, heavy weight to carry for them and with them, I know that their sister's life is entwined in theirs in ways that set them apart from their friends and my friends' children, make their journeys perhaps more difficult but far richer and wider.  \n \nWe cope as a family, my boys cope as siblings, with great senses of humor, a natural ability to laugh \u2013 at ourselves, at one another, at the situation.  \n \n Jesus Christ , Oliver yelled one morning when he'd bumped into his brother, running out the door to his carpool. He had just helped me to move Sophie from the bathroom to her bedroom, her body stiff and jerking, toothpaste dripping from her mouth and his as we had been brushing teeth when the seizure began.  \n \nWhile my first impulse was to admonish him for the language, I had to laugh. You have to laugh.  \n \nI think we cope, as a family, because we love Sophie as she is and because we see by her still, graceful presence that she is about love, pure and simple. \n \nAnd then there's the awesome parking... \n \n \n @@@@@@@ \n \n I am so moved by Elizabeth's acceptance of her children for who they are. All different. All truly known and deeply loved.\u00a0 \n \n Now that you have read this eloquent, moving post here, you will surely want to follow her home to her  blog,  a moon, worn as if it had been a shell , and read more there. You'll also get to see pictures of her lovely children and the beautiful things she bakes.\u00a0 \n \n Read this post about  an extraordinary ordinary day , and this incredibly moving post (with lovely photo) about  Sophie  and her presence. Or maybe this  moving stream of consciousness post  about a  morning with Sophie and Henry. \u00a0 \n \n Or possibly you would like to hear a little of the gallows humor that helps Elizabeth get through life, as in this post about yet another  dinner with seizures.   \n \n Finally, Elizabeth  is yet another SNSS guest who can also be found at  Hopeful Parents,  where she writes and is a member of their board.\u00a0  \n \n  (Unlike the other SNSS guests so far, Elizabeth is not on Twitter and doesn't have a Facebook fan page. So you'll have to just read her on her blog.) \n \n Thank you, Elizabeth for gracing my blog with your lovely words about your lovely family. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, July 8, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nMy son Jacob is an absolute fish. \n \nHe loves to swim and will spend hour upon hour in the water, if allowed. \n \nIn the water all of the jangly awkwardness that comes hand-in-hand with his autism just falls away. \n \nHe is fast, sleek, joyful.  \n \nThat little extra layer of fat on him that puts him in between regular and \"husky' sizes? Is just the right kind of insulation for hours in a cool lake or pool. \n \nWhen Ethan must get out, shivering with blue lips, Jacob is still splashing away. \n \nEthan will stomp around proclaiming to the heavens how unfair it is that Jake can stay in the water so much longer than he can, and how utterly horrible it is that Jake finds it much easier to float, too.  \n \nWhen I can stand it no longer I quietly ask him if he'd really like to trade places with Jacob and have the autistic brain instead of his brother. That usually shuts him up pretty fast. \n \nThis past weekend we were invited to a wonderful party at a house on a small private lake. Every July 4th of July weekend they throw a fabulous fete for friends, family and neighbors, and we have luckily found ourselves to be invited in recent years.  \n \nOne of the loveliest aspects to the party is the swimming. It's a clean, spring fed lake with a small beach. They hire lifeguards, a lot of them, so I can actually get out of the water when I am done swimming and let Jake stay in as long as he wants. \n \nThe coolest part? A floating trampoline platform out in the middle of the lake.  \n \nYes. A trampoline. \n \nAnd, yes, Jake was in heaven. \n \nBounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. jump off. Swim out to the teenagers in the paddle-boat and say \"Excuse me, Are you in a boat?\" and have them smile and wave hello. Swim back to the trampoline, Circle round, climb back up. \n \nRepeat. \n \nAnd repeat. \n \nFor 3 hours. \n \nDanny and I took turns being in the water with him or watching from the shore. There was a lifeguard stationed on the trampoline and one in a rowboat halfway between that and the inflatable climbing iceberg.  \n \nFor three hours Jake had the freedom of the lake and a trampoline to boot. \n\u00a0\u00a0  \nAnd Jacob with that much swimming in one day? \n \nA happy, happy boy. \n \n(Picture proof available here, in Wednesday's post  Happiness ) \n \nLast year he did not get to swim enough. \n \nThis year his  wonderful new school 's summer camp takes him swimming four times a week. \n \nThis year I will make sure Jake gets his time in the water, to let his merman-self, his inner  Namor  shine through. \n \nSwimmingly. \n \n Note: This post was inspired by the July  NaBloPoMo  theme: Swim. Have you noticed I've managed to post every day so far this month? Shhhh, don't jinx it. If things continue to go... swimmingly, I'll officially announce my participation next week. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, July 7, 2011", "body": "\nIt's that time of year again. \n \nCounting down, getting close to my boys' birthday in late July. \n \nPlans must be laid, preparations made. \n \nNot the least of which is the cakes. \n \nI make awesome birthday cakes, my one claim to domestic fame. \n \nThink I'm exaggerating (as I have often proclaimed my complete disinterest and ineptitude at most things housewiverly)? \n \nNope: \n \n \n \n Jake's \"Very Hungry Caterpillar\" cake, 2009 \n \n \n \n Ethan's \"Lapras\" Pokemon cake, 2010 \n \n(Want to see them all? See this post  HERE ) \n \nIn years past, I have pretty much known what Jacob's current favorite characters were, his obsessions up front and obvious. I have asked the rhetorical question: \"Jake do you want a (insert favorite character here) cake this year?\" And he has said \"Yes.\" And that's it. Case closed. \n \nEthan's choice has been obvious and easy some years. Others have required research and negotiation, a delicate balancing between his desire for elaborateness and my ability to make 2 cakes in one day & evening while managing to still get enough sleep to function at the party. \n \nOne Pokemon of his choosing: yes! An elaborate battle scene with multiple Pokemon  and trainers? Not in this lifetime, kid. \n \nBut Ethan will communicate with me, we'll hash it out together, sometime over the next week or so. If Wilton has ever made a cake pan shaped even vaguely like what he wants, I'll head to E-bay to acquire. If not, I'll hit up the internet coloring pages to create a pattern. \n \nFor Jacob, on the other hand, this year is a bit of a mystery; his cake, a puzzle that needs to be solved. \n \nYou see, this year, he is paying attention. He has been talking about \"Birthday Cake\" for about a week now. Constantly. He REALLY wants to help me make it, and is very specific that it MUST be round. \n \nFor some years now, I have been a bit smugly pleased that my son is \"less rigid\" than most other kids on the spectrum. I figured he was just innately more easygoing, thanked my lucky starts about it, thought it was his inborn \"happy-go-lucky\" personality shining through. (Can you see the smack-down coming?) \n \nTurns out? It was because he was mostly just oblivious! As he has \"woken up\" into the world, is processing so much more, really understanding what is going on around him in a much more profound way... he is getting REALLY OPINIONATED, and well, rigid about things. \n \nLe sigh. \n \nSo I can't just make a reasonable suggestion, have him go: \"yes\" and just carry on with whatever I make his cake to be. He wants it HIS WAY. \n \nNow, if he were better at communicating what he wants, this would not be be MUCH easier. But he's not. Autism is a communication disorder, see. I know this seems like such a little thing, barely a blip in the big scheme of things, \n \nBut I know if I don't get it right he will be miserable. If his cake is \"just right\" what he really wants? Happiness will ensue. \n \nNo pressure here folks, really. \n \nWell last night at bedtime I got him in an expansive, expressive mood. When he started up with the \"I want my birthday cake, Mom!\" routine,\u00a0 I actually got him to answer some questions about it.  \n \nWhat he appears to be telling me is that he wants: a ROUND cake with layers \"a tall cake, Mom.\" \n \nAlso? Chocolate. \"Brown, darker brown chocolate cake!\" No doubts about that. Damn! \n \nAs I make two cakes every year for the party (Twins!) and not everyone likes or can eat chocolate, I have always made one chocolate and one vanilla or flavored vanilla (lemon/orange/strawberry). \n \nSince Ethan is a chocolate fiend and believes that non-chocolate cakes are a disgrace to desert-hood and have no reason to exist, well, you can see that Ethan's cake has always been the chocolate one. \n \nSo now? I am going to have to make two chocolate cakes (one gluten free for Jake) AND some lemon-vanilla cupcakes for the non chocolate crowd. \n \nBut all that aside, back to Jacob's elaborate plans. If I've got this straight (and this is for sure what he told me tonight, whether it changes tomorrow remains to be seen), he wants this cake to have: \n \n\"Yellow frosting, mom. Yellow AND orange frosting.\" \n \n\"OK. And what kind of picture do you want on it, Jake?\" \n \n\"A pig!\" No hesitation there. \n \nReally? A pig? \n \n\"Jake, you want... a... pig?\"  \n \n\"Yes, Mommy! A white pig, Mommy! With green eyes, Mommy!\" \n \n\"OK, a white pig with green eyes.\u00a0 Jake, you got it.\"\u00a0  \n \nI kiss him a final goodnight, climb down the ladder from his top bunk, and then hear a little voice in the dark: \n \n\"With wings, Mommy, a white pig with wings.\" \n \nSo this year, in late July, be prepared to see a white pig with green eyes, flying across a TALL birthday cake.

She sprints to the living room\u2019s windowed wall, fantasy-stalking the birds flitting about the feeder, newly filled by my mother. \n \nTheir hungry chirps an invitation to come outside and play before this winter afternoon\u2019s blue light fades to black.  \n \nThough the huge nor\u2019easter was two weeks past, there are still deep piles of snow out back, making odd, lumpen shapes out of our backyard\u2019s buried furnishings: picnic table transformed into igloo palace. \n \nBut the pull of something else bears a stronger seduction: an ugly square box with golden antennae perched atop. Curved glass holding shifting ghosts of black and white. \n \nIt\u2019s 4:30 PM. Sunday afternoon. I am watching TV. \n \nAnd after today, February 23rd, 1969, my brain will never be the same again. \n \nI am, as is common, alone; my parents busy, elsewhere\u2026\u00a0 Mom in the laundry room perhaps, Dad in the darkroom. \n \nI turn on the TV set. Channel 4, NBC. OK, why not?  \n \nSomething comes on. Something I have never seen before, and, for many years afterwards, am not sure I had actually seen then, not just hallucinated:  \n \n\u201cThe Cube.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nI see this... \n \nThere is a man alone in a small white room.  \n \nPerfectly square.  \n \nA cube.  \n \nEach wall, floor, ceiling made up of a 4x4 grid of white squares, in turn.  \n\u00a0  \nThe man is searching, questioning: What is going on? Why is he here?  \n \nPeople begin to enter the cube, interact with the man.  \n \nBut no one gives him answers.  \n \nThey only draw him into their own dramas.  \n \nThe mystery deepens.  \n \nExistential angst engulfs. \n \nPeople talk: \n \n\u201cNone of us are real, he\u2019s not real, we\u2019re all projected.\u201d \n \n\u201cWell, as I interpret what you\u2019re doing here, this is all a very complex discussion of Reality versus Illusion. The perfect subject for the television medium!\u201d \n \nReality shreds, hangs on by a thread, disappears completely, appears to return, and then? Poof, in a whiff of strawberry jam, it is gone\u2026 \n \nWhat remains?  \n \nThe Cube. \n \nSo yes, at age eight and a half, I had my already precocious mind completely blown by a bit of TV. \n \nProduced for NBC Experiment in Television, directed & co-written by Jim Henson (yes, that one). \n \nThis will be hard for those born into the cable-TV-10,000-channels-that-must-be-filled-at-all-times years, but this aired exactly twice. \n \nOnce, the day I saw it, February 23, 1969, and once again in 1970.  \n \nThen it disappeared. \n \nWhen I would describe it to friends, with a few rare exceptions, they would look at me as if I had three heads, shake their own heads and declare that nothing that strange had ever appeared on television; I must have made it up, so fantastic did it sound. \n \nBut oh, it was real. Very real. \n \nIf you have never seen it (and I am guessing this describes 99.9% of you) you must.  \n \nHere: \n \n   \n \"The Cube\" a tele-film by Jim Henson (& Jerry Juhl), 1969 \nNow imagine yourself a hyper-sensitive, highly intelligent not-yet-nine year old girl with an over-active imagination and a developing penchant for getting stuck in the revolving doors of her own mind, watching THAT alone on a long ago February afternoon... \n \nAnybody have any questions as to when the seeds were planted for me to become a student of avant-garde filmmaking at an experimental college at 17? A hippie, lesbian, college-drop-out, bean-sprout farmer living in a primitive geodesic dome on a ridgetop in Northern California at age 20? \n \nAnd then, at 33, a married, Manhattanite, globe-trotting corporate video producer with a closet full of suits? \n \nI thought not. \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  The Red Dress Club .

{"date": "Monday, July 4, 2011", "body": "\nKaty Perry now takes up real estate in my brainspace. Whether this is for better or worse? Doesn't really matter, it just IS. \n \nEvery time I see, hear, think of fireworks - there's Katy belting out \"Baby you're a firework...\" Pretty much unavoidable this time of year, being the Fourth of July and all. \n \nIt's a damn catchy popsong. Plus there's that amazing, moving, meaningful video. It's old news certainly, out since last fall, but I catch on slow, being such an old lady. (You HAVE seen the video right? If not, head to the bottom of this post immediately.) \n \nWhat really cemented it in my mind was hearing the graduating middle school kids singing the song at Jake's Special Ed school's end of year celebration. To hear these amazing kids, who have faced such deep learning challenges and persevered, singing this anthem of self-worth: \"...it's always been inside of you, and now it's time to let it through...\"?  \n \nWell, I fell in love with the song a little (and bawled my eyes out a lot, thanking the gods of waterproof mascara). \n \nSadly, we didn't get to see actual fireworks this Fourth of July.\u00a0 I'm feeling kind of bad for depriving my almost 9 year old boys of this thrill, but it's just so hard to get to see them here in New York without spending insane amounts of time in insane crowds and for 2 out of 4 of our family members that would be sheer torture. \n \nI was about to write \"I have always loved fireworks\" but then realized this is so NOT true. As a teenager and adult? Yes. Even as an older child, yes. \n \nBut as a little kid? Fireworks were a big problem for me. One of my earliest memories is watching them out the window of our Riverside Drive apartment and being shocked, baffled and TERRIFIED because I was in physical pain, and everyone else around me seemed unharmed; pleased, even. \n \nAnd fire CRACKERS? Don't let me go there. As a child I was truly terrified of firecrackers to the point of being thoroughly phobic. They scared the everloving shit out of me.  \n \nOne time, after we'd moved to the suburbs, my family had come into the city to go out to dinner with another family in Chinatown. No one quite realized it was Chinese New Year, or what that might mean for me. \n \nWhen we went in to eat it was still daytime, and relatively quiet. But by the time we emerged in the evening, it was a full-blown firecracker inferno. I had to be carried, screaming and blubbering, down the stairs, through the exploding streets, to the car. \n \nThe memory is etched into my psyche. I thought I was going to die. \n \nIn hindsight? I can unequivocally diagnose my child-self with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), hyper-sensitive variety. Yes, as a child loud sounds were actually physically painful to me. Very. \n \nAnd as I had outgrown it as I got older, I had just completely forgotten about my childhood sound/pain connection. Until I was reading up about SPD issues after Jacob's autism diagnosis. Then it all came flooding back.  \n \nWell, I've always said the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. \n \nWe know so much about this stuff now, how it is neurologically based. But back then I was just \"weird\" and often teased by my peers for being \"sensitive.\" I was also hyperlexic. \n \nBut these are other stories for other days (and other posts). \n \nTonight? I leave you with fireworks. Thanks, Katy! \n \n \n \n \n   \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Saturday, July 2, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today brings a completely different voice to Special Needs Sibling Saturdays. Last week the  stark. raving. mad. mommy.  interviewed her children about their siblings\u2026  \n \nNow, I bring you Luna, a young woman who is not a mother (yet) but who has a lot of experience with autism\u2026 as a sibling. Both of her brothers are on the autism spectrum. \n \nShe also has experience caring for children - other people\u2019s - as she has worked as a nanny. She writes as ababynanny on her blog    Hand in Hand in Lala Land .  \n \nObviously NOT a Mommy Blog, although she openly admits to \u201changing around mommy blogs.\u201d Most SN/Autism mombloggers don\u2019t have paragraphs like this in their posts:\u00a0 \u201dI wonder what would happen if I totally started dancing to this song down the aisle of the library?\u00a0 The only trouble is, my skirt would definitely slip down and I\u2019m not, as such, actually wearing underpants.\u201d \n \n(Oh, to be young, footloose, and fancy free again.) \n \nIf you go there, be prepared to hear the interesting, sometimes random thoughts of a bright, funny, unconventional young woman exploring the world and her place in it.\u00a0 \n \n But first, read this moving post about her experiences as the sister to two autistic brothers, here: \n \n@@@@@@@ \n I Am the Sister  \u2013 by Luna (aka ababynanny) \n \nI am a 21 year old girl, not yet a mother, but I think a lot about autistic kids because both of my brothers are autistic. Growing up watching my parents try to raise my brothers gave me a lot of huge, huge fears about motherhood.  \n \nBut reading (some might say stalking) Autism Mom blogs \u2013 especially stark. raving. mad. mommy. \u2013 is helping me to see how mothers can be content with their special needs families, loving their kids and knowing they are awesome. Right now I'm really coming to terms with my future motherhood. \n \nI am the youngest child in my family, with two older brothers and one older sister.\u00a0 My oldest brother David (now 32) has Asperger\u2019s syndrome and my brother Tyler (now 30) is mildly autistic with developmental and learning disabilities. Although these guys are my \u201cbig brothers,\u201d my sibling relationship with them, growing up, has been far from typical.  \n \nWhen giving a definition of autism, a doctor might tell you about the impaired social interaction. Real life translation: I can\u2019t remember ever receiving a hug from either of my two older brothers.  \n \nThe doctor might tell you about low IQ.\u00a0 Well, I can tell you that ever since I\u2019ve learned to read, I have been reading aloud to my eight years older brother instead of the other way around, and we both love it.  \n \nThe doctor might mention restricted and repetitive behavior, but I\u2019ve experienced the variety of having a brother who can always tell me about the latest movies and Broadway plays, and can\u2019t rest until he\u2019s collected them all on DVD. (Don\u2019t call it obsessive.)\u00a0 There\u2019s a whole lot about life with autism that a doctor can\u2019t tell you.  \n \nIn some ways, my brothers are a challenge.\u00a0 Growing up, when I invited friends over, I had to educate them first. I'd take them to the stairs in the laundry room on their first visit, and clumsily but confidently talk about things like poor reading skills and special ed classes, while they always listened quietly and respectfully.  \n \nMy brothers required more attention from my parents in many ways. And people with Asperger\u2019s syndrome typically have an emotional maturity rate of about 2/3 their age, so for years I\u2019ve had to deal with the frustration of a \u201cyounger\u201d older brother in both David and Tyler.  \n \nAnd yet, overall, I love the experiences I have with my brothers. \n \nAs a little girl, it didn\u2019t seem strange - in fact, I was lucky - that the person I played dolls with was my teenage brother, Tyler. David, always very smart, would teach me about interesting things that most people wouldn\u2019t, from ancient history to modern medicine.  \n \nWhatever intellect or sociability he may lack, Tyler paints and draws and is one of the most creative people I know.\u00a0 Despite Tyler\u2019s supposed limited ability to relate to people, he has a streak of compassion that runs deep and that I admire.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nFor some reason he has this adorable weak spot for vulnerable women.\u00a0 He gets tender and nurturing around them. Tyler has a volunteer position (supervised by other adults) taking care of the toddlers at our church while their parents are in class.\u00a0 We had a single, pregnant relative living with us, and every Sunday he would always bring her a Dixie cup full of animal crackers they had been feeding to the kids.  \n \nHe's unusually high functioning for someone with his type of disabilities. He can't learn easily, but he wants to SO badly!\u00a0 He has a voracious appetite for books. He is the favorite visitor of our librarians and the employees and Barnes and Noble, and he can take the bus there himself.  \n \nTyler collects books he cannot read and his teacher used to report him copying from the pages of books for hours, which strikes me, as a lover of reading, as poignant and tragic. He is however quite well read through all the books he listens to on tape. When tested, his scholastic skills fall around kindergarten level, but his vocabulary is relatively off the charts at high school level. \n \nMy relationship with Tyler now breaks my heart.\u00a0 I adore him, but in a very distant way. I used to spend hours playing dolls and writing stories with him when I was little. I brought the writing skills, but he brought the play and imagination. \n \nAs I got older, we both outgrew that, and he got... annoying. He could be a such a brat, and I could never work out our tiffs with him the way I could with a typical sibling. \n \nEven being around him, today, as a young adult, makes me feel overwhelmed with frustration. I feel like gritting my teeth listening to him go on and on about some movie.\u00a0 I think my guilt adds to my annoyance. Why can't I just be patient and accepting? I pray for help with that.  \n \nI feel a strong desire to enrich his life. This is because he's so limited by lack of socialization, lack of independence, and lack of, well, the ingenuity and opportunity and comes with intelligence.  \n \nI genuinely WANT him to come live with me and my future husband when we have a settled home someday. Nieces and nephews would enrich his life so much. He is pretty low maintenance as far as day to day stuff and needs lots of alone time, so it wouldn't be intrusive or a big deal. Then my parents could have a life.  \n \nI was a live-in nanny on Long Island recently. The family went on vacation, and said Tyler could come stay with me.\u00a0 I excitedly emailed my mom - Tyler had been saving up for a trip to New York, (he loves Broadway) for FOREVER.  \n \nWell, I think he was expecting a wonderland, but Manhattan is OVERWHELMING for someone with autism! My mom ended up coming on the trip, and he ended up needing her for support, but also resenting her taking away from our freedom and fun with her stress. \n \nHis favorite part of the whole trip was when he and I were alone and I took him out for some \"real New York pizza\" in a boring Long Island strip-mall. He told everyone about it.  \n \nThen there\u2019s my brother David. The way David affected me really messed me up.\u00a0 I was afraid to have kids.\u00a0 No kid could possibly have been harder to raise than David.\u00a0 And ya know it's genetic.  \n \nHe was hell. My parents did EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF for him. AND NONE OF IT WORKED. They tried to shield me from it, but I could tell.  \n \nMy poor parents just wanted a simple life.\u00a0 They wanted to raise a few average Christian kids who would do things just right: go to college, get married, make them some grand kids.  \n \nInstead they got psychiatrists and doctors and government aid and social workers up their butt forever.\u00a0 And my dad, a great provider, has worried constantly about paying all our mental health bills and, as moral support to David, attended a million and one support groups.\u00a0  \n \nMy parents are, and weren't to begin with, the most emotionally healthy people, and I am unique in my family for the way I have addressed that as I became an adult and really worked hard to get better.\u00a0 But one thing I do really admire my parents for is the way they tried and persevered and supported my brother.  \n \nI was supposed to be the good one. Quiet, eager to please, precocious, even \"wise,\" I was their last and easiest kid. Until I hit my preteen years and the stress and lack of emotional support in my home became too much for my hyper-sensitive self and I slipped right into the pit of depression that genetics had ready and waiting for me.  \n \nBut, too bad for me, my parents had completely been run out of steam for that sort of thing with David. They would angrily have \"talks\" with me about my slipping grades, and I would get the eerie realization they thought they were talking to HIM, not me.\u00a0 \n \nThey would say, \"We've tried everything and nothing works on you.\" David could not be motivated to change by any reward or punishment under the sun.  \n \nBut I hadn't done anything... \n \nThe thing is, David doesn't just have Asperger's, he has severe depression (that started way too young when he was teased at school), OCD tendencies, severe ADD. He is completely negative and self defeating.\u00a0 He made a lot of bad choices and brought a lot of darkness into our home.  \n \nHe was sweet to me growing up.\u00a0 I was his \"favorite,\" the least obnoxious of his younger siblings, and I cried and ran out of the house the first time my parents had to kick him out for behavior they couldn't accept in their home.\u00a0 I even watched him be escorted away by a police officer once.  \n \nI am PROUD that David REFUSES to think inside the box, I am PROUD that he is so very smart, and PROUD that he always maintained a goodness and sweetness even at his lowest point.\u00a0 He is proud of his unique approach to the world and absolutely refuses to change it, even though I think it would make his life easier. \n \nHe wants to help people, and I'm sure what he's been through has made him empathetic.\u00a0 He's a cat whisperer, full of faith, and knows everything about everything. He's amazing, really. \n \nHaving my brothers around has taught me a lot about open-mindedness, acceptance, and individualism. Through Tyler, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with many people with disabilities, including assistant-directing a play for developmentally disabled adults, something I never would have chosen to do if it wasn\u2019t for my experience with my brother.  \n \nAnd occasionally David's quirks can produce comedy that is the stuff of family legends.  \n \nLike the time he randomly got it into his head, to write a letter hoping to convince our grandfather that he should, like David, give medication a shot. Our grandfather is probably mentally ill, but is the kind of narcissistic jerk who makes everyone around him miserable, without being aware that he has faults.  \n \nFrom one dysfunctional man to another, David's letter (that never got sent) began with a tactful opening and then went: \"It is my opinion that you are insane.\" The entire family laughed about that for months! \n \nI do have a bottom line.\u00a0 And it is that my brother's are freaking SPECIAL people.  \n \nIf I could tell parents anything, it is that autism is not the end of the world. Try to still be happy. David has finally grown up a little, did great with lots of biofeedback, and is slowly taking college courses and wants to become a nurse. He's a good person, always was, and we always loved him. \n \nHe's perfect, really. Both my brothers are. That needs to be all that matters.  \n \nOh, and LAUGH. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n I don't know about you, but this post made me laugh and cry. It made me think a lot about how my autistic son Jacob affects his brother Ethan, and what I ask of and expect from Ethan on a daily basis.\u00a0 \n \n That Luna has been through so much with her brothers and still clearly loves and values them gives me much hope for their future together.\u00a0 \n \n If you want to hear what Luna has to say about other things, go to her blog   Hand in Hand in Lala Land .\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n You might want to try  this post  about actually loving kids, or  this one  written to the fathers in her life on Fathers Day, or  this funny one  on keeping a sense of humor about kids tantrums. Also if you just want to get inside the head of a sweet, funny 21 year old? Try  this post  about, well, you'll see.\u00a0 \n   \n Luna has also written a  guest post on Scary Mommy  about why it's hard to be a nanny.

{"date": "Sunday, July 3, 2011", "body": "\n Exhausted after a full day fete at a lakeside house yesterday. We never get invited to anything, so are quite grateful for this now annual chance to party as a family with food, swimming (floating trampoline!), rides, live music and a firepit after dark for the last late stragglers (us, we always come late, stay late). \n \nI am coming down with a nasty summer cold, so while Ethan is over at a friend's house (a deep thank you to every parent of a friend of Ethan's who has hosted more than your fair share of drop-off playdates due to Jacob's autism and my subsequent need to hand Ethan off for the day) Jake is home blissfully watching TV and playing on the computer while I try to drag my ill ass off the sofa to unpack from yesterday's excursion. \n \nMaybe not happening (getting dizzy every time I try to stand up). While languishing on the sofa I am half taking in the TV, which led to this observation...  \n \n @@@@@@@ \n \nOne of the many gifts of Autism is that Jake takes a lot longer to outgrow his \"babyish\" loves and obsessions. Or seems to outgrow and move on and then (hopefully before I've given away all the toys & videos) circles back around and they are on his radar again. \n \nLike Thomas the Tank engine, favorite of every 3 and 4 year old boy on the planet it seems...\u00a0 Jake out grew it later than Ethan, but really seemed to be past it by 1st grade or so, watching all the horrible violent superhero shows that his brother liked on the Cartoon network or Disney XD. \n \nSomehow or other, Jake is liking the superheros less these days, and is back in little-kid land when it comes to TV. Thomas, Curious George, Clifford and Arthur are all back in steady rotation in my house, at least when Ethan isn;t home and strong-arming control of the clicker. (I draw the line at Caillou, I WILL not watch that again no matter what!) \n \nI was trying to figure out why this was, why Jake had seemed to move on & grow up & then slide back into little kid shows. But upon reflection, I think it is anything but a backslide, more of an upward spiral that looks like a circle back around, but isn't. He is revisiting the old shows but with much more understanding and insight. \n \nIt's all because of Jake's language processing issues (of course). for a while he loved the superhero and teenagery shows Ethan watched because there was a lot of visual excitement and movement in them (fights! Explosions!) and the scary aspects to them seemed to go right over ihs head. \n \nBut now Jake is understanding and processing more - and the scariness of those shows is actually starting to... scare him. \n \nIt seems a lot of stuff around which I thought Jake was fearless? Well, it turns out he was just clueless. Because you have to process and understand what is going on to be afraid. and he wasn't before. And now he is. So what looks like a step backwards is really progress. \n \nSo he is retreating to the \"safe\" little kid shows, but as he is processing more, he is getting more out of them -- understanding the situations more, getting the humor, getting more than just the basic story, the contexts of things that had just slid right by him before. \n \nSo, as I said it is a spiral, Old \"friends\" re-visited but with new, \"higher\" understandings, one turn up the spiral ladder of understanding.  \n \nSo I guess my ticket off the Island of Sodor is going to have to wait a little longer. That's OK. Jake is happy and learning. \n \nAs long as I don't have to hang out with that damn whiny Canadian bald kid with the too-nice parents, who is clearly going to grow up to be a serial killer. (You knew that, right?)  \n @@@@@@@ \n \nOK, back to bed now (Damn summer cold)!  \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Tuesday, June 28, 2011", "body": "\nToday was the last official day of public school here in NYC. Ridiculously late by any standards.  \n \nEthan was already gone, his camp having started yesterday. I gave him a free pass to miss the final day and a half of what is essentially babysitting, because, as he put it: \"Everybody makes friends the first day at camp, Mom, I don't want to miss that.\" Socially astute, this son of mine. \n \nSo today I was at his school even though he wasn't. I dropped Ethan off at camp then u-turned and headed back down, passed my street and kept going. Rebounding many blocks in the opposite direction to take care of some final paperwork and say some goodbye-for-summers. \n \nNew York City is a landscape of micro-neighborhoods, and so  I was also saying goodbye to this comfortable one around Ethan's school. It's close enough to home and filled with useful stores and services, so that we will probably be by there at times this summer; but it will no longer be part of my daily mind-space. \n \nI therefore have my summer & school-year routines, each different, each looked forward to and/or missed when in the opposite mode. \n \nEthan's camp is in the same uptown neighborhood as his preschool had been, so there is a lovely quality of familiarity and return each summer. I catch nostalgic glimpses of 3 and 4 year old Ethan around every bend. \n \nSweet memories wafting up, helping to ease the pain of Ethan's new-found \"Just leave me at the entrance and don't let the gate hit your ass too hard on the way out, Mom.\" attitude he has suddenly adopted at drop-off this summer. \n \nWhere once there was clinging & kisses, there is now quick dismissal. I knew this was coming, was even looking forward to it in some ways, but it's hard to reconcile with the boy who still climbs into my lap each evening at bedtime, fiercely  demanding his talk & cuddle time.   \n \nOutside Ethan's school this morning, I ran into my friend  Sandra . She is all excited about (and exhausted preparing for) a big European vacation she has coming up. \n \nAlone with her husband. \n \nUnfathomable to me. \n \nThough we have kids the same age, she is more than ten years younger than me. Her daughters will be having a blast at their Grandparents home, her parents being more than 20 years younger than mine, making all this possible. \n \nBut I also realize that it's not all of the unfathom. Even were we all so much younger, even had we the financial resources to pull such a trip off, it would not be on the table for us, just not in the cards. \n \nJacob needs me just too damn much. \n \nHe could not tolerate that large a block of separation. And frankly, truth be told, neither could I. \n \nIt feels like another life, the one in which I traveled for work and pleasure, hopped on and off of planes, packed with precision and ease for days, weeks, or months, and just set off. \n \nIt WAS another life, and I was another me. \n \nA not-mother me. A not-yet-autism-mom me, for certain. \n\u00a0  \nThis summer we are looking into the possibility of sending Jacob to a special needs sleepaway camp for one week. It will be in a town near where my in-laws have their vacation home. A place comfortable & familiar to Jake. \n \nI / we could really use the break. And yet I'm filled with trepidation. \n \nWe have never been separated for this long before. One night twice, two nights once. That's pretty much all. \n \nI am his ambassador to the world, his interpreter. I know his thoughts, needs, moods like none other. I am what he wants, needs; always. \n \nAnd yet... and yet... he is nearly 9. He does go to school every day and they seem to have figured him out just fine. He is getting older, and he needs to grow more independent, not just  stranger. \n \nJacob is awesome these days. He is expanding his repertoire, telling stories, constantly, that begin with \"Once upon a time...\" \n \nAnd even though they are all variations on a few basic themes? They are VARIATIONS, not rote repetitions. Yes, he is making things up, combining elements in novel ways, inventing characters. AWESOME! \n \nBut the talking all the time is getting exhausting. His week off school (that comes to an end TOMORROW, YES!) has been quite a challenge for me. \n \n(Yes, I've seen every kids movie out now. Cars 2? Twice.) \n \nAnd his full month off, after summer school ends, will likely be likewise challenging. This camp could really be a godsend. For all of us.  \n \nWe are probably going to try it, if they'll have him (application is in and we are awaiting) and if we can scrounge up the cash to cover it. \n \nBut still, I am afraid. I fear he will be too sad, too lonely, too alone without anyone who understands what he is thinking/feeling/needing. \n \nAnd I know, even though I desperately need the break, I will spend much of our time apart thinking about him, worrying about him, wondering how he is doing. \n \nThe camp number on speed-dial, my fingers hovering, constantly, inches from the phone. \n \nHe needs me. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, July 1, 2011", "body": "\nI was cleaning up the living room today - don't snigger people, I do DO that (about twice a year or so) - trying to organize all the boys' papers from this past school year, when I came upon some wonderful drawings of Jacob's and a note sent home by his teachers that I want to share. \n \nHere they are: \n \n I asked Jake what this was. His answer: \"I have veggie chips in my brain, Mom.\" They seem to be making him very happy in a serenely content sort of way. Works for me. Who needs brain cells when you can have yummy veggie chips filling up your head instead? \n \n Jake wasn't able to tell me exactly who (or what) the figure in the middle of this somewhat disturbing image was. Though he did make it clear that he/it is a \"bad guy\" being tied up in a bathtub.\u00a0 The significance of the numbers 56 & 48 in the circle on the lower left edge? Unknown.\u00a0 \n Ethan thinks it might be Jake's interpretation of a character from the Dragonball Z Kai TV show. I think it looks like an evil sunflower creature with a black hole in the middle of his head. The \"X\" marks on his face *might* be indicating that he is dead. \n We will probably never know. Some of life's mysteries should remain just that, I suppose. \n \nI have mentioned before my son's love of movies in general and  Rango in specific . That his teachers \"get\" this and know exactly how to encourage & reward his hard work and good behavior (praise and a pic of a favorite character)? Thrills me to no end. \n \nIt was a wonderful school year for Jake, and so far three days into Summer Academy (\"School Camp\") he is happy as a clam - and they haven't even started swimming yet!  \n \nI feel that his fairy godparents must have been looking out for Jacob (FINALLY!) when we tumbled into this school, late last year at the very wee end of the placement process. It hadn't even been on my radar for the past few years (though I had toured it when Jake was a turning-5 tot and I was looking at SN Kindergartens). \n \nAnd now, blink, blink, and it's been a whole year passed. And the school is a perfect fit for Jake. And I love each and every teacher, therapist, aide and administrator there, significantly more than words can tell. \n \nJacob's imaginative play and storytelling abilities are really growing by leaps and bounds right now. And while it seems to have just sprung out of the ether, I know it had to have been growing slowly, underground, like taproots for a long time before the wonderful comes bursting through into the sunshine. \n \nLooking at these pictures from the late winter, I shouldn't be surprised at what's going on this summer. There is so much \"story\" in them. They really are signs of an active and engaged imagination. Portents of good things to come. \n \nNow when Jacob takes my hand and asks \"Can I tell you a story, Mom?\" and then begins \"Once upon a time...\" I know it has grown from a happy Jakey with his head full of veggie chips. \n \nCan't wait to see what pops out of his wonderful (and deliciously crunchy) brain next. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Linking up with The Red Dress Club today. \n \n \u00a0 @@@@@@@ \nThis morning I am practicing my coma. \n \nPretending I don't hear the soft sing-song calls of \"Mooooommeeeeee\" wafting in from out there somewhere. In stereo.  \n \nI don't hear the tinkles and toilet flush. The pitter-pat of four little feet.  \n \nIt's June 24th. Let me sleep. \n \nI do, however, feel the knee in the left ovary and the little agile fingers prying my eyelids open. \n \n\"Good morning, darlings! What, awake so soon? Let's go make us some breakfast!\" \n \nTwo almost three year-olds? Love to \"help\" in the kitchen, make making breakfast a whole morning-long activity. Thank goodness.

Why do you think we have a dog? \n \nDid Robert fill the plastic pool before he left for work, set it in the sun?  \n \nYes! (No divorce today.) \n \nHours of splash the brother / dunk the sister have done their job. \n \nAfter lunch? They go down for a nap. Hard. \n \nI honestly don't know what I would have done today, otherwise. Chained them up in their room? Maybe. \n \nNo need. \n \nI slip away from sleeping children, back downstairs, then down again.  \n \nA room of my own. Merely a screened off corner of the basement. No matter. Mine.  \n \nAnd in my desk, middle drawer, back, under, no further under... there it is. \n \nI pull out the envelope. Plain, manila tan. One corner worried at, a bit torn. \n \nInside: one picture.

I don't really need to look at it anyway, so seared into my soul. \n \nBack upstairs, upstairs again. \n \nSitting, waiting for my children's eyes to flutter open, for them to tumble, sleepy, out of newly minted toddler beds.  \n \nMy arms will fill with the sweet weight of them, as my heart\u2019s doors swing open and shut, open and shut.

{"date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Today's very special SNSS guest is a mom with a very special family. She is the stark. raving. mad. mommy (SRMM). She writes at her  eponymous blog , whose tag line is: Losing my mind, one child at a time.  \n \n The SRMM has four children, and... they ALL have special needs. But, just to keep her on her toes, they are all different from each other.\u00a0 \n \n There are her  twin daughters , oldest at 10, one with ADHD, one with severe anxiety. Then there is her brilliant but anxious  seven year old daughter,  and finally, her  five year old son  who is on the spectrum with Aspergers. \n \n The SRMM herself? Has ADD, which she has  recently begun to address , much to the improvement of her life.  \n \n And the most amazing thing is that this is a very, very funny blog. The SRMM sometimes  rants about the injustices  that any special needs parent experiences, but she also rants about everything else that  freaks her out  or pisses her off in a most entertaining way.\u00a0 \n \n She also enjoys and celebrates her children, revels in the wonderfulness of their specialness, even as she recognizes the challenges of their lives. \n \n For her SNSS post, The SRMM has done a unique and brilliant thing: interviewed her four very bright children about their own situation, asked them to think about and share their thoughts on their siblings. Read this amazing post now, here:   \n \n @@@@@@@\u00a0  \n Special to the Fourth Power  - by stark. raving. mad. mommy. \n \nI have four kids, each with their own special needs.  \n \nLittle Dude, who is five, was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome about a year ago.\u00a0  \n \nThe Peanut Butter Kid is seven. She has some anxiety issues, but her biggest special need is that she's crazy smart. We just put in a Gifted IEP for her.\u00a0  \n \nMy twin daughters are ten. Cookie has severe anxiety. Besides weekly therapy, she's on three different prescription psychiatric medications. She had a 504 for her anxiety, but now those accommodations have been folded into a Gifted IEP.\u00a0  \n \nHer twin, the Pork Lo Maniac, has ADHD and some language processing issues. She also gets weekly therapy, and is on medication for both ADHD and anxiety. She currently has a 504 for her ADHD, but we're working toward an IEP to help her with the language processing. \n \nYeah ... I've got my hands full. But you know what? My kids do, too. \n \nMy husband and I do our darndest to give each of our kids as much individual attention as we can. But still, all these issues obviously impact each of our kids in different ways. \n \nFor my contribution to Special Needs Sibling Saturdays, I decided to interview each of my kids about how they see their siblings, and how they affect each other. \n \n \n Little Dude, age 5. \u00a0 Has: Asperger Syndrome, Sensory Processing Disorder. \n \n What's hard about having a sister with ADHD? \u00a0 She doesn't let me do much stuff.\u00a0 It's stressful, and also sometimes I get really upset with her because she wrestles with me and her moves are too hard and I can't win.\u00a0 What about when she's having a meltdown?\u00a0 Yeah, that.\u00a0 But that's all the problems. \n \n What about Cookie's anxiety? \u00a0 Is it hard for you when she's sad or stressed out?\u00a0 I usually kind of tickle her.\u00a0 Or do a silly face. \n \n Can you tell me something great about each of your sisters? \u00a0 Something great about Cookie is that she makes me happy.\u00a0 The Pork Lo Maniac, a great thing about her is that she's Dad's padawan.\u00a0 That way I have more people to wrestle with.\u00a0 Something great about the Peanut Butter Kid is that she is great about doing crazy stuff.\u00a0 Like laughing really hard and laughing into a pillow because it's so loud.\u00a0 It doesn't even hurt my ears when I'm right next to her and she laughs. \n \n What do you think it's like for your sisters when you get really stressed and have a meltdown? \u00a0 I think they get upset, because they can't fix the problem. \n \n The Peanut Butter Kid, age 7. \u00a0  Has: anxiety, Gifted IEP. \n \n What's hard about having a sister with ADHD (and language processing issues)? \u00a0 When she doesn't get what I'm saying, when I'm being sarcastic.\u00a0 It's hard to get her to understand me, about each thing I say.\u00a0 If she's too busy and she can't hear me, somtimes I start to freak out a little, because it's really hard to get her to focus on what I'm saying. \n \n What's fun or awesome about having a sister with ADHD? \u00a0 It's awesome that she has ADHD, because if she didn't, she wouldn't be as much fun.\u00a0 She makes up funny jokes, and sometimes they don't even make any sense, but they're funny.\u00a0 She talks about weird stuff with me, like talking about poop, and then we laugh so hard that Cookie calls us \"broken.\"  \n \n What's hard about having a sister with anxiety? \u00a0 When she's stressed with me because I did something wrong, I try to make her feel better, because then I feel guilty and it turns into this whole thing.\u00a0 If it's just about homework, when she's done I try to leave her alone, or cheer her up.  \n \n What's great about her anxiety?\u00a0  She understands me, because she gets stressed like me.\u00a0 She's not perfect, and I like that, because she's my sister, and I don't want to feel so different. \n \n What's hard about having a little brother on the spectrum? \u00a0 When he melts down and freaks out, it's hard to get him to understand, and sometimes he doesn't pay attention because he's so focused on something else.  \n \n What's great about his Asperger?  He loves Star Wars and he loves me very much.\u00a0 He's so fun. \n \n What do you think it's like for your siblings when you're feeling anxious?\u00a0  I think it's hard for them to understand me, and to feel the way I do.\u00a0 It think it's hard for them.\u00a0 Sometimes they try to leave me alone.\u00a0 I guess it's stressful for them. \n \n What about when you're working on school stuff that your older sisters are working on, like multiplication?\u00a0  Sometimes when I accidentally say stuff out loud, about me working on multiplication or something, that can hurt someone's feelings. It can be a little offensive.\u00a0 I try not to talk about that.\u00a0 I can talk about it with you and Daddy instead. \n \n The Pork Lo Maniac, age 10.\u00a0  Has: ADHD, anxiety, language processing issues. \n \n What's hard about having a little brother with Asperger Syndrome?\u00a0  It's hard to ask him a question like, \"can you please lower your voice?\" or \"can you please stop that?\" without him getting upset.\u00a0 When he has a meltdown, he might scream at me, and sometimes it'll be because of one little thing.\u00a0 When I want him to stop doing something, I know that he'll get upset if I ask him, so then I have to just listen to his really loud voice. \n \n What's awesome about his Asperger Syndrome? \u00a0 Sometimes, how he needs to express his feelings at the end of the day is wrestling, which I love to do.\u00a0 Sometimes I just need to wrestle.\u00a0 It's perfect when we can just both wrestle together.  \n \n Both of your sisters have anxiety issues. What's hard about their anxiety for you?\u00a0 \u00a0 Sometimes when we're having a conversation, and I don't understand what one of them is saying, or I don't really know what they're talking about, or I take it literally, then they do this (shows shaking arms), and I can't really help it that I don't understand. \n \nAlso, since Cookie has anxiety, she needs that medicine Clonidine, so at night it makes her think it's later than it really is.\u00a0 She gets more tired, and keeps asking me if we can turn off the lights, and it's really not that late.\u00a0 I just want to keep reading.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n You have some anxiety too. What's different about your anxiety than theirs? \u00a0 I get anxious about mostly about getting stuff done.\u00a0 They start worrying that it's late, or we're going to be late, and I'll probably never worry as much as they do.\u00a0 I guess sometimes when I can't hear somebody or I don't know what they're saying, and they keep having to repeat it over and over again, and I still can't understand them, it's just too hard, and I don't know what to do. \n \nI don't think they have that anxiety.\u00a0 But they might.\u00a0 When I keep asking them a question, and they don't know what I'm saying, because I've already had the conversation in my head and I just use pronouns and they don't know, that might make them feel anxious.\u00a0 I see them flapping their hands because they're frustrated.\u00a0 And then that makes me feel bad because I can't help that. \n \n Do you think them having anxiety makes it easier for them to understand what you're going through? \u00a0 No.\u00a0 They just can't understand. \n \n Is there anything great about the way they are, or their anxiety? \u00a0 I guess it is good that even when it isn't that late, and Cookie says she thinks it's late and we should turn off the lights, but I just started reading a minute ago, then that reminds me that at some point I need to turn off the light.  \n \n Is it hard when the Peanut Butter Kid is doing really advanced schoolwork? \u00a0 Yeah, sometimes that bothers me.\u00a0 I know I'm smart, but I'm the only one who hasn't been in the gifted program.\u00a0 Sometimes it upsets me when everyone else is so smart, and I'm smart, but I'm the one who struggles with the most stuff in school.\u00a0 And they're so smart, I can't understand what their stuff even is in school.\u00a0 It seems easier for them. \n \nI'm the one who probably won't be in the gifted program.\u00a0 Sometimes I feel like people aren't as proud of me.\u00a0 In the spelling bee, I was the fourth one out.\u00a0 Everyone was so proud of [our friend who won].\u00a0 At the spelling bee, they couldn't see how good of a speller I really am.\u00a0 I think you and Daddy are proud of me, but at school, I don't feel like they're proud of me, of how hard I work. \n \n Tell me something great about your sisters.\u00a0  Cookie's really crafty, and she has really good ideas that are so good it's hard not to steal that idea.\u00a0 It's fun playing with The Peanut Butter Kid, just her and me.\u00a0 I think she's really good at understanding me when we play one-on-one. \n \n What do you think is hard for your siblings about your ADHD, or your language processing issues?\u00a0  It's probably hard when I have a conversation in my head, and then I just say \"it\" or something like that, and they have no idea what I'm saying.\u00a0 I guess it's stressful for them when I get really frustrated. \n \nIt's probably hard for anybody when they're asking me a question, and I can't understand them, or when they can't understand me.\u00a0 I know that my ADHD is fun sometimes, because the PBK said one time that she's glad I have ADHD, because if I didn't, it wouldn't be as fun for her, but I don't really understand that.  \n\u00a0  \n Cookie, age 10. \u00a0 Has: severe anxiety, Gifted IEP. \n \n Did you know something was different about Little Dude before we told you?\u00a0  Yeah. A little before that, there was something a little off. Something just didn't seem like normal. He was different from other kids his age. When we would go to friends' houses, he didn't play with other kids as much as he played with Legos and stuff. \n \n What's hard about having a little brother with Asperger Syndrome?\u00a0  Sometimes he's very stubborn.\u00a0 And he gets so obsessed with one thing, it's hard for me to want to play with him. Sometimes I want a break, and he doesn't really seem to understand that. At the dinner table, things can get a little weird, and I kind of get tired of him talking about butt cheeks at the table. It's not very pleasant.  \n \n What's awesome about having a little brother with Asperger Syndrome?  Sometimes he can kind of help us with his homework. When he was obsessed with multiplication, he would sing, \"six times eight is forty-eight.\" Sometimes it's fun playing with him, because he has awesome ideas about what to pretend. When we're playing Lego Star Wars or Lego Indiana Jones, he knows exactly what to do and where everything is.\u00a0 On Batman, he can even remember the bad guys' actual names. \n \n What's hard about having a twin sister with ADHD and language processing issues? \u00a0 Sometimes, she doesn't really understand, somehow. She takes so many things literally. Sometimes it's hard to talk to her at the end of the day, because by the end of the day, she's mumbling, and she gets mad. She'll say, \"I said, ...\" Every little thing seems to be so big to her. \n \n Do you know why she's different at the end of the day?  Probably because she had a tough day dealing with her ADHD. And I know her Adderall wears off by then. \n \n Is there anything awesome or fun about her ADHD?  Despite how she doesn't get sarcasm, she has a really good sense of humor. She's funny sometimes, but sometimes she doesn't get how she's being funny. Other times, she does get it. But sometimes when she's humming little tunes and doesn't hear us talking, it's kind of funny. Also, she can find pretty much anything in the house, because of her memory.  \n \n If she's being really ADHD-ish, how does it affect you?  It really depends on how I'm feeling, and what she's doing. Sometimes it's stressful. Sometimes it's hilarious. \n \n Do you feel like you get left out, like Daddy and I spend more time or energy on Little Dude or the Pork Lo Maniac?  Sometimes. Because sometimes I'm trying to talk, and somebody has a freak-out in the middle of the conversation. It's not very fair to me. And the Pork Lo Maniac always needs things repeated, so it's like I've had the whole conversation over and over.  \n \n How do you think it's hard for your siblings to have a sister with anxiety?  I never really thought about their side, of what they deal with too much, in terms of me. At the end of the day, if I've forgot my homework or something, I guess it must be hard for them, to hear me getting so upset. Kind of like how it's hard for me to hear them get so upset. \n \nI know it's especially hard for the Pork Lo Maniac. One time, the PBK offered to give me her slinky because mine was all bent and I didn't like it any more, and the Pork Lo Maniac was like, \"how come you always get what you want?\" It made me feel bad. \n \nI know Little Dude doesn't like waiting for an hour when I'm in therapy. But I'm pretty sure my sisters are fine because they have toys in the waiting room. But I don't know, because I'm not there. I'm in therapy.  \n *** \nI'm grateful to Varda for asking me to contribute to the Special Needs Sibling Saturdays series.\u00a0 Interviewing the kids, and then reading the responses as a family, really gave us the opportunity to focus on how we function as a unit.\u00a0  \n \nClearly, the kids hadn't previously given much thought to how their quirks affect other people.\u00a0 Self-awareness is a long, hard road, and I'm glad we could start them on that path in a gentle, supportive way. \n \n @@@@@@@\u00a0  \n I love how articulate and thoughtful all of her children have been. It was a brilliant idea to interview them, and that SRM family used it as a source of connection and communication, to help set the kids on a path of self-awareness? Beautiful.  \n \n The fact that, in spite of their very differing needs, it is clear that this family still functions as a unit is a testament to what an amazing parent the SRM Mommy is. Even if she has written a post  confessing that she sucks ? Don't believe it. \n \n  We all get overwhelmed, no special needs parent (let alone one x 4) can do it all. She is way wonderful, trust me. Any mom  who LOVES summer break ? Wonderful. And that she faces  all these challenges  with her kids yet clearly has kept her sense of humor? Amazing. \n \n So now that you have read this lovely post here? You will surely want to go read more at  stark. raving. mad. mommy.  Her absolute honesty, discussing  her own issues , openly  talking about medication  and her kids, has been inspiring and helpful to so many. \n \n Besides all the wonderful posts I've linked to in the introduction and above? Don't miss  this fabulous one , about how to make special needs \"cool\" (by changing an acronym to \"Jedi\"), or  this funny one  about the trials of doing math homework with her twin daughters, or try  this sweet and funny one , about the advantages/disadvantages of autism.   \n \n Or, for something completely different (the funny stuff that has nothing to do with special needs) read the post that put SRMM \"on the map\" for a lot of people: a hysterical treatise on those highly annoying childrens cartoons:  Dear Dora, We Need To Talk. \n \n Finally?  You should follow her  on  Twitter , and   go \"like\" her on her  Facebook  page, where she is just as outspoken and delightfully irreverent as she is on her blog. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, June 23, 2011", "body": "\nIf  E was for Ethan ? \n \nThen J must surely be for Jacob. \n \nA pair, these two. \n \nTwins. \n \nMy bookends. \n \nAnd me, most assuredly sandwiched into the middle between them. \n \n(Squashed.) \n \nBut two more unalike bookends have ne'er been seen.  \n \nThere is light and dark. \n \nThere is slender and solid. \n \nThere is early riser and night-owl. \n \nThere is picky eater and lover of all things food. \n \nThere is my blue & green loving boy and my yellow/red/orange choosing son.  \n \nThere is the seeker of the next new thing and the one attached to the comfortable and familiar. \n \nThere is the greatest divide... Autism and Not-autism. \n \nJacob is my Autism. His autism. \n \nHe has taught me so much. \n \nI am a better mother because of him. \n \nMore patient. \n \nMore understanding. \n \nKinder. \n \nGentler. \n \nBecause he needs me to be thus.  \n \nI have to listen, so carefully, to hear the message under the words, because so often Jake's words only hint at the true nature of his thoughts, the mere cresting of a deepening wave. \n \nAnd then, too, I need to pull the right words out of him, help to expand, make explicit, because I will not always be his main listener and I want, nay, *need* him to be understood by the world at large. \n \nJacob is so easy to love but so hard to be with sometimes. \n \nExhausting. \n \nAlways talking, always louder than need be. Often asking the same question over and over. But how immeasurably better than the silence that he once overcame. \n \nJake does not walk down the sidewalk most days. Rather, he skips. For why walk when you can skip, just for the sheer joy of it? \n \nActually I think of that as one of Jacob's 5 basic rules for living: \n \n1.\u00a0 Why walk when you can skip? \n \n2.\u00a0 When you hear music? Dance! \n \n3.\u00a0 Go to every vaguely-appropriate-for-kids movie. At least twice. The first time preferably on opening weekend. Always stay until the end of the last credit. Dance to the music (of course, see rule #2, above). \n \n4.\u00a0 Hands are for holding. \n \n5.\u00a0 Why just give one kiss when three are so much nicer?\u00a0 (And up the arm like Gomez to Morticia is always preferable.) \n \nSometimes I think he is the happiest child in New York City. \n \nExcept when he is the saddest. \n \nJacob as a baby? \n \nOne word: charming. \n \nHe was a flirt. \n \nHe loved the shopgirls in the stores on Broadway, where we would pop in and out of, to relive the tedium of those early baby days. \n \nHe always picked out the cutest, sweetest, friendliest girl to bat his long eyelashes at and flash his killer smile. If I ever showed up without him, his favorites would complain: \"Where's my boyfriend today?\" \n \nMy sister in law Bern once described year-old Jacob as \"Always ready to be delighted by the world.\" \n \nAnd she was right.  \n \nHere he is, then: \n \n \n Jacob, the 3 month old charmer And now:  \n \n \n Jacob, still charming at 8 years old \n J is for Jacob... \n \nJoyful, jouncing, juicy, jovial, jargoning, Jedi-hearted, jigsaw puzzleish, jack o' lantern-loving, and full of boundless joie de vivre. \n \nAll this, and more. So much more than the sum of his parts. And always his unique self. \n \nMy son, Jacob. \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's   Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And of course you guessed that \"J\" was one of my other favorite letters.  \n \n \n \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for... \u00a0 because I am deeply grateful for my son, Jacob.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2011", "body": "\n \u00a0 \n If you're a regular reader of my blog, you will know that saying \"My boys don't always get along.\" is an understatement on par of calling the sun a little bigger than a basketball. \n \nThere may be some basic personality differences and generic sibling rivalry going on, but really?\u00a0 It's mostly about the autism. \n \nOne thing they actually agree upon (besides the fact the Sponge Bob is hysterically funny) is a love of all things basketball. \n \n \nToday was a perfect June day. So when Jake and I picked Ethan up  from his afterschool class at 5:45 (basketball, of course) there was still plenty of daylight. As we walked down the sidewalk and the boys were squabbling over possession of our one basketball I had a brilliant brainstorm: buy a 2nd basketball! \n \nConveniently, there's a sporting goods store a block from Ethan's school, and a decent-for-kids quality ball on 1/2 price sale - score!\u00a0 The guy behind the counter even pumped up our old ball along with the new one. (Thanks, excellent Modell's cashier!)  \n \nAnd then, when you've just gotten a new basketball, you've got to go try it out, don't you? So back to the schoolyard we went. \n \n \nNormally, I carry my good camera with me all the time, but today it was home, the battery charging in anticipation of Jake's special end-of-year school event tomorrow. So I whipped out my cell phone and shot away. Not, however, the best tool for fast moving action shots. \n \n \nBetween the 3-second delay between button push and shot, the long wait for upload onto the chip, the late afternoon brilliant sunlight and deep shadows, I never really got the fabulous \"Basketball!\" shot I wanted. \n \n But the most important thing, that they were getting along, enjoying shooting hoops together? Happened, whether I captured it or not. So these will have to do: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jacob, airborne \n \n \n Ethan sinks one. \n My boys, they love basketball. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, June 26, 2011", "body": "\n Sliding in here on the very edge of Sunday's tailfeathers. But wanted to post quick before I go collapse in my bed, then wake up early to prepare for the upcoming week's many challenges. So here goes.... \n \n @@@@@@@ I was at a wedding today. a lovely, lovely wedding. I don't know the Bride and groom well, had met them at their engagement party last year. But the mother of the groom is a dear, dear friend of mine, so Danny & I made the 2 hour-each-way trek up the Hudson to Poughkeepsie. Yes I know some of you make that kind of trip daily as your commute. (thinking you must be insane) \n \nWe are New york city folk without a country home. to us a long drive is anything over 1/2 hour. Longer than that? Take the damn subway dude. \n \nBut anyway, usually that length trip better involve a sleepover for me, but today? totally worth it, to share my friend's joy. \n \nAs soon as I got home, I popped this in as my FB status: \n \n Was at the loveliest wedding today. A friend's son. He has overcome many challenges to become the amazing young man he is today, and I am so happy that he has found love and an amazing partner in life. She has also faced challenges, and they understand and support each other completely. Also? Damn good looking couple. Danced my feet off, had a great time. Wishing them many happy years! \n \nAnd I mean every word. This morning Dan & I were so not in the mood to go to a wedding. We're both stressed, too much to do, too little time.\u00a0 We left a little late (but arrived EXACTLY on time, thank goodness I;d padded the drive time expectation!) and were stressy and snippy about that, tumbling into the car in dual nasty moods. \n \nThe drive up was not lovely... talking / worrying about money and autism and other fun fun subjects like that. But once we arrived? the beauty of the place (catering hall right on the Hudson river w/ sweeping views) and the sheer, clear & palpable happiness of the young couple and their wonderful supportive families just shifted our mood completely.  \n \nWe didn't know many people there at all, (pretty much only the grooms parents) so I decided to treat it a bit like a date, talk with each other, hold hands, dance a lot together. and we did. and it was lovely. And we met some nice people too. \n \nThis morning I was thinking how I was going to write another whiny bitchin' & moanin' SOCS post today as I was feeling all bummed out about autism. tonight I;m feeling all warm and fuzzy (and no. I only had one glass of champagne for the toast, its not that) so moved was I by the force of these loving families we were celebrating with. \n \nthe groom is the middle of 3 brothers who love each other fiercely. It was awesome to be witnessing this. He loves puppets and animation, would love to be a puppeteer, is actively working towards that goal. and so his chosen song for his dance with his mother? The Muppet's \"Rainbow Connection.\" \n \nAnd they sang along, to each other, as they danced.\u00a0 And I was really glad I was wearing waterproof mascara, because you bet I teared up at this.  \n \nIt was all about who he truly was. In a family that \"gets\" him, marrying a woman who \"gets\" him. their honeymoon? They're going to Disney. Because they are playful, joyful people, and that's their idea of fun.  \n \nI was so happy to be a part of this... and now I'm going to sleep because I'm wiped out. My feet are killing me. I danced my ass off. G'night! @@@@@@@ \nNothing to add really. Unless someone wants to come over and massage my aching feet... Husband, are you still awake?... \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

(For Him.)  \n \nNo school. \n \nNo camp. \n \nCamp Mom.  \n \nAll Mom, all the time. \n \nSo if the blogging is a little light in these weeks? \n \nIt's not you, it's me. \n \nReally. \n \nMe and Jake, on break together. \n \n(Ethan's last day of school is Friday. He starts camp Monday. Seamless.) \n \nI love my Jacob to pieces, but when that school bus comes round to pick him up late next week? \n \nI'm going to kiss the driver, I swear.  \n \n(Just kidding, Honey, just kidding!) \n \nJake is doing great, really great. Everyone says so. \n \nBut? He also still talking ALL. THE. TIME. \n \nSo we're going to keep busy, go on lots of \"field trips\" like the one to the   Liberty Science Center  last weekend. \n \n \n \n Who knew plumbing could be this much fun? \n You know what we'll be doing this Friday morning,  don't you? (Hint: Jake has been announcing \"Cars 2 coming to theaters on June 24th!\" since, oh, last September.) \n \nAnd after I put Jake on his bus? \n \nThe silence will be deafening. \n \nI will revel in it. \n \nAt least until Ethan wakes up, requesting morning kisses and hugs, checking last night's final WNBA basketball scores (NY Liberty plays all summer), bringing his own special flavor of noise to the table. \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, June 18, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Tomorrow is Fathers Day. And so, who better to be my SNSS guest today than the awesome Big Daddy, who blogs at  Big Daddy Autism ? No one, so here he is!  \n \n Big Daddy has a son,  Griffin , on the autism spectrum and a daughter,  Lil Sis , who is not. Griffin is loud, repetitive, loving,  funny , charming, obsessive and   anxious  -- in other words he  sounds a lot like an older version of my Jake. \n \n In contrast to many other SNSS guests who have young children, Big Daddy's kids are all into the double digits, lending a whole other element to their story. I look to his stories as possible shadows of our future.  \n \nAnd, amazingly enough? In spite of all his family's challenges, Big Daddy Autism is a humor blog. A very, very funny humor blog. \n \nBig Daddy believes that by telling funny and off-beat stories from his life, he shows that raising a kid with special needs is not all doom and gloom. As he shares his tales (and  cartoons !) from the lighter side of raising a child with autism, he is actually being sneaky: using humor to be all inspirational and such.  \n \nSo read now, and be inspired: \n \n @@@@@@@\u00a0   \n Sister Knows Best  - by Big Daddy \n \nI can think of nothing quite as boring as a parent gushing on and on about how wonderfully perfect their NT (neuro-typical) child is.\u00a0 So, I will not spend too much time telling you what we think of Griffin's little sister.\u00a0 Suffice it to say, in our eyes, she is anything but \u201ctypical\u201d and, she is the most beautiful and incredible little girl in the universe.  \n \nI know I\u2019m gushing a bit.\u00a0 However, in the context of how she affects Griffin\u2019s life, I feel a few words singing her praises would be appropriate. \n \nFrom her relatively uneventful labor and delivery, through every developmental milestone, and even to our hopes and dreams for the future, she has shown us how it is \u201csupposed\u201d to be.\u00a0 With her, we get the pleasures of raising a \u201ctypical\u201d kid.\u00a0 But we also get the bonus of perspective.  \n \nThanks to our experiences with Griffin, we never take her accomplishments, no matter how insignificant they may seem, for granted.\u00a0 Just as without nighttime the day would not seem as bright, raising a disabled child has made us appreciate our non-disabled kid even more. \n \nWe first learned Lil Sis was on her way into the world around the time Griffin was first definitively diagnosed as autistic.\u00a0 This caused quite a bit of concern.\u00a0 We were told that autism may be genetic and the chance of our next child being autistic was greatly increased over the general population.  \n \nWe considered genetic testing, but ultimately decided against it since it didn\u2019t really make a difference.\u00a0 We were going to have her either way.\u00a0 Besides, when we were pregnant with Griffin, in light of Mrs. Big Daddy\u2019s youth and good health, we were told that the chances of having a child with a disability or birth defect were less than our chances of having a puppy.\u00a0 So much for predictions \n \nLil Sis\u2019s impact on Griffin has been profound and we believe much of his emotional growth and development can be attributed to her.\u00a0 She subscribes to the family philosophy of giving him no slack, teasing him, and forcing him into our world.  \n \nWhen she is bored and in need of a playmate, she refuses to let Griffin hole himself up in his room.\u00a0 She makes him participate in regular kid activities as much as he is capable and even includes him when she is playing with her other friends. \n \nEarly on, she was our main translator.\u00a0 She understood Griffin\u2019s garbled and broken speech better than any teacher or therapist.\u00a0 Whenever we couldn\u2019t understand Griffin, she was there like a UN Interpreter.\u00a0 Now, we just make him spell the words we can\u2019t understand.  \n \nSometimes, though, Lil Sis still understands him when no one else can.\u00a0 She also has the uncanny ability to sense if there is something bothering Griffin, even if he has not (or cannot) verbalized it.\u00a0 In a way, at times, she knows Griffin better than he knows himself. \n \nLil Sis is protective of Griffin.\u00a0 Occasionally we worry she is overly concerned with his well being.\u00a0 We want her to be a carefree kid and leave the worrying about Griffin to us grown-ups.\u00a0 A good example of how she goes above and beyond to safeguard him would be the first time she ever got in trouble at school. \n \nGriffin was already in first grade when Lil Sis started private preschool.\u00a0 When she began Kindergarten it was the first time they were in the same school.\u00a0 Although he spent most of his time in a special cluster, she occasionally saw Griffin during the day.  \n \nThe first time she was in attendance for a fire drill must have been a shock for her.\u00a0 She, like all the other kids, witnessed Griffin\u2019s routine fire drill meltdown.\u00a0 Later that day, we received a call from the principal (who we knew well by this point) telling us that Lil Sis had cut physical education. \n \nWe were shocked.\u00a0 Even I waited until around sixth grade to start skipping out of gym class.\u00a0 Could she have inherited my complete inability to do anything remotely athletic, and total disdain for physical education teachers?\u00a0 No way.\u00a0 She had tons of energy and enjoyed anything that involved running, bouncing, and jumping.  \n \nFurther, this type of rebellious behavior was entirely out of character for her.\u00a0 She was well behaved and respectful of authority.\u00a0 Were we totally in the dark as to our daughter\u2019s true personality?\u00a0 As we pieced together the rest of the story, it all made perfect sense. \n \nLil Sis actually loves PE.\u00a0 It\u2019s watching Griffin crying that she dislikes.\u00a0 It turns out that gym class immediately followed the aforementioned fire drill.\u00a0 A few minutes into the special, Lil Sis told Coach Smith that she had to go to the bathroom.\u00a0 Instead of using the restroom directly outside the gymnasium, she snuck down the hall to Griffin\u2019s class room and convinced the special education teacher to let her use the facilities in there. \n \nHer detour wasn\u2019t a quirky toilet preference, or a desire to get out of dodge ball (although I wouldn\u2019t blame her for either), rather, she merely wanted to make sure her brother had recovered from the fire drill.  \n \nI don\u2019t think, in the history of public education, has a parent been so proud of his daughter for lying to her teachers and cutting class.\u00a0 It was difficult to admonish her for this transgression without hugging her so tight her head would pop. \n \nThere was a time when Lil Sis would end friendships with kids who did not respect Griffin or did not treat him well.\u00a0 If they were not nice to her brother \u2013 they were gone.\u00a0 Simple as that.\u00a0 Now all her friends, at a minimum, tolerate him and some of them even get a kick out of him like we do. \n \nNot long ago Lil Sis came to me while I was sitting at my desk and asked for a roll of tape.\u00a0 Since Griffin does not have the dexterity to use tape and Lil Sis has a tendency to go heavy on the sticky stuff, I am always on heightened alert when a project calls for it.\u00a0 Not wanting to spend an hour pulling tape off our Persian cat and letting my curiosity get the best of me, I snuck a peek to find out what my progeny were up to. \n \nIn Griffin\u2019s room I could see that she had transformed his closet into an imaginary elevator in which they were pretending to ride from floor to floor.\u00a0 That is what she chose to spend her afternoon doing.\u00a0 Can you blame me for gushing? \n \nAlthough we tell her he is not her responsibility, she still looks out for Griffin, and has a loyal band of friends who do likewise.\u00a0 Our concern is that she will someday feel weighed down by him.\u00a0 Especially in adulthood when we are no longer around.  \n \nOther than constantly telling her that it isn\u2019t her job to always make sure he is okay, and by taking the steps necessary to ensure he will never be a financial burden on her, there isn\u2019t much we can do to stop her from wanting to take care of him. \n \nIt\u2019s who she is.\u00a0 We wouldn\u2019t change a thing about her.\u00a0 She is the awesomenest! \n \n @@@@@@@\u00a0   \n I don\u2019t know about the rest of you, but I am so deeply moved and,  yes, inspired by the relationship between Griffin and his Lil Sis.\u00a0 I  can only hope that some day Ethan has a fraction of the love and  compassion that Lil Sis shows toward her autistic big brother.\u00a0  \n \nGriffin  is lucky, indeed, to have her. And the most beautiful thing? She feels  lucky to have him. \n \nNow that you have been charmed by Big Daddy here? You simply must go visit him back at HIS house,  Big Daddy Autism .  \n \nYou\u2019ll want to read this post, a touching  letter addressed to Lil Sis , or this one about Griffin's  love of elevators . Try  this utterly hysterical post about what  Big Daddy does on schedule , or this incredibly moving one, about  a moment of \"normalcy\" from Griffin .\u00a0 \n \n I could easily link a hundred great posts here (Big Daddy is prolific, too) but I'll stop now. So just go over and start reading through his archives, there are gems on every page.\u00a0  \n   \nAnother place to find Big Daddy is on his BlogTalk Radio show,   Autism WTF,   which  he co-hosts with his partner, the wonderful  Autism Army Mom . Looking  for a funny and irreverent conversation about autism and the special  needs parenting experience ? Here it is! Go, listen, laugh. \n \n Also? Breaking news: Big Daddy has written a book of his collected wisdom, just out this spring, called, naturally, \" Big Daddy's Tales From the Lighter Side of Raising a Kid With Autism. \"  \n \n You can (and should) buy it,  here . \n \nBesides his blog, radio show and book, Big Daddy can be found dispensing his wit on  Twitter,  and on his  Facebook page , where you should go and show him a lot of \u201clike.\u201d \n \n Thank you, Big Daddy, for coming to inspire us with your love and humor. Happy Fathers Day, dude! \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

There's a little more distance, a little more getting used to the  rhythms of \"without.\" \n \n \n \n Dad & Me, 1997 \n But we never get over, we just get through. \n \nToday is my second Fathers Day without a father. \n \n \n \n Dad & Me, Riverside Park, 1997  \n As the day was approaching, and I was wondering how I would feel, I was trying to measure, to gauge how less sharp the loss might feel, the dulling of the ache as time wears smooth the memories of those  last, dreadful months . \n \n \n \n Dad & Me, 1991 \n I know the pain is less keen these days; there is more dull ache to it, less sharp jab. But I also knew I would  be thinking of him. How could I not?  \n \nAnd indeed thoughts of my father have come and gone today, where  last year  they were a constant companion. I have been trying not to worry at the hollow  space too much, like a tongue always seeking that missing tooth. \n \n \n \n On Vacation with my Dad, Mexico, 1978 \n I kept busy, was thoroughly distracted by my children, taking a drive with a friend and her brood out to the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. \n \nLosing ourselves in giant bubbles and sneezing blue faces. Exhibits that taught us to speak a few words in another language and ones that recorded our voices and played them back REALLY LOUD (can't you just see Jake's delight at THAT?) \n \nIt was a good day. \n \nBut still? I miss my Dad. \n \n \n \n Me & Dad, December, 1969 \n I'm sad that my kids have no Grandfather. \n \n \n \n Dad & Jake, 2005 \n He really loved my boys, was touchingly involved with them until that last year, when he was slowly slip-sliding away from it all. \n \n \n \n Dad & family, 2007 \n He took a special interest in Jacob, read up about autism, wanted to do all he could to help him. \n \n \n \n Mom, Me & Dad at E & J's Birthday Party, 2009 \n The Dad from my childhood, the Dad from my early adulthood, the Dad from these last, waning years when our roles reversed and I had become his caretaker. \n \nThese all coexist, living on inside me now. \n \nHe told me so many of  his stories . (I feel so lucky to have truly known my father.). And so the man my father was before he was my father also lives on in me, too. \n \nAnd I will share those stories with my children (and with you, my readers) so he will continue to live on, even when I, too, am gone. \n \nNot how he preferred to achieve immortality (like Woody Allen he was hoping to actually live forever) but it beats the alternative, fading away into the dust. \n \n \n \n Dad, Me & Mom, 1962 \n Happy Fathers Day, Daddy Jim. \n \n \n \n My father, 1961 (photo by Bruce Steinhardt) \n I will remember you, love you, always. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, June 11, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's wonderful SNSS guest is a mom who blogs as Jennie B. at  Anybody Want a Peanut?  She has two young children: a four year old son,  Moe , who is on the autism spectrum, and his little sister, two year-old  Jelly Belly,  who is not. \n \n Jennie writes about family life, and also about her evolving role as an Autism Mom. She is a wonderfully helpful read for parents who have recently received an autism diagnosis for their child, and whose heads are still spinning and hearts are in freefall. It is like having a conversation with a supportive friend, one who has been through what you are going through. \n \n Jennie is also a sister herself, to a beloved brother she lost to cancer a number of years ago.\u00a0 \n \n In this moving post, Jennie looks at her children through the lens of a sister who loved her brother, and hopes that someday they may grow into a likewise deep love. Come, grab a box of Kleenex and read it now...  \n \n @@@@@@@  \n Brothers and Sisters: The Next Generation  - by Jennie B. \n \nWhen I brought my daughter home from the hospital, my then 23 month old son Moe had an enormous meltdown then ignored me for a week. He paid no attention to the baby, preferring to spend hours alone in his room.  \n \nThis was about six weeks before his autism diagnosis. \n \nThere were no pictures of big brother holding new baby sister.  \n \nOver the next few months, I was able to snap a few shots of Moe pushing Jelly in the swing, or staring intently at the baby in the bouncy seat. To the untrained eye, these pass as typical scenes, but I know that Moe had no interest in the girl in the seat. He just liked to watch the swing go back and forth, was drawn in by the spinning and vibrating toys. \n \nJelly, on the other hand, followed her brother around from the day she arrived at home, first with her eyes, then on hands and knees, then wobbly legs, and finally at full speed.  \n \nShe did not care that Moe couldn\u2019t talk; neither could she. He was just a bundle of energy closer in size to her than any of the other people she saw on a regular basis. \n \nJelly is now two and Moe is four. Not much has changed about their relationship since those early days. Moe spends less time alone in his room and tolerates Jelly\u2019s presence. He is occasionally amused by her, but never engages her.  \n \nHe lets her steal toys right out of his hands, but only because he doesn\u2019t know how (or maybe just doesn\u2019t care) to stop her. He enjoys having her at the dinner table, primarily because she eats more slowly than he does, and he can usually grab some tasty morsels from her plate. These days, this is generally followed by Jelly shouting \u201cSwiper, no swiping!\u201d \n \nIt hit me recently that Moe is now the age my brother was in my first real memories of him. Bill was three and a half years my junior and passed away 9 years ago.  \n \nMy brother and I had a good relationship. As kids, we bickered, but we also got along as friends. We liked similar music and were unbeatable as a Pictionary team.  \n \nWhen he followed me to Berkeley, he as a freshman and I a recent graduate, my parents made us a deal that they would pay for any meal we had together. We didn\u2019t need the extra incentive to see each other, but we appreciated it. \n \nMy parents were also thankful I was nearby to keep an eye on my brother, who was finishing up chemotherapy to treat a brain tumor that had been found during his senior year of high school. He did remarkably well, though on one occasion became very sick and needed to be taken to the emergency room.  \n \nIt was the one and only time I was called on to be his caretaker. It turned out that he had a virus and would be fine, as he would be for the remainder of his college years, including a semester in Spain. \n \nBeyond that emergency room visit, I never had to take care of my brother. My parents did all of the work that comes with caring for someone who is dying: bathing, dressing, bathroom needs. They did not want my brother to suffer the indignities of having his sister helping him in those ways, and allowed us both to preserve our relationship until the very end. \n \nWhen I was pregnant with Jelly, my husband and I used to say that we had our first child for us, but we were having the second for Moe. Of course we wanted another child, but we also wanted him to have a sibling. I wanted my kids to have the kind of relationship I had with my brother. I wanted to know that they would have each other when Jeff and I were no longer around. \n \nAlthough I fully expect Moe to be able to care for himself in basic ways, I have no idea how well he\u2019ll be able to function as an independent adult. He\u2019s too young and autism is too unpredictable.  \n \nI\u2019d like to think that Jelly will always be around to support Moe, but I also hope that they can be just brother and sister, without any burden of care (even if she doesn\u2019t see it as such). I want them both to enjoy the love and camaraderie that only growing up in the same household as another person can provide.  \n \nI want them to commiserate about their crazy parents. And I want to give them a credit card to use whenever they go out to dinner together. \n \nOf course I can\u2019t predict how my children\u2019s relationship will develop any more than my parents could have predicted that my brother and I would like the same music or go to the same college.  \n \nAs a parent, I can encourage and influence, but their relationship will be their own.  \n \nAnd like everything else, I\u2019ll just have to wait and see how it turns out. \n \n @@@@@@@  \n I love how Jennie weaves between her past and present here. Her love for her brother shines though so brightly, as well as her sadness at his loss, and at the gulf that currently separates her children. \n   \n And, that fear that a typical child may be burdened with the care of their SN sibling at some point in their life is something I think all parents of SN kids worry about (I know  at least  I do). \n \n And now that you have enjoyed Jennie here, please follow her back to her bloggy home,  Anybody Want a Peanut?  for some more great reading.  \n \n Be sure to read the post, where she contemplates the potential for  sibling rivalry  in her house, or this lovely lyrical one, about what Moe may or may not  remember , understand. And be sure to catch this very clever post, with a  delightful surprise  at the end of it. \u00a0  \n \n Finally, you can find and follow her  on  Twitter , and   go \"like\" her on her  Facebook  page, because she is so very, very likable. \n \n Thank you, Jennie, for your heartfelt thoughts about siblings.

{"date": "Thursday, June 9, 2011", "body": "\n Note:  I initially wrote this post two weeks ago, the day my mother came home from her hospitalization, then promptly forgot about it, caught back up in the whirlwind of my busy life. I just re-discovered it, while searching for something else in my blog's draft hopper, and so having given it a polish, I send it out into the world today: \n \nMy 88 year-old mother came home from the hospital today, after a four day, probably-not-necessary-but-that-can-only-be-known-in-hindsight sojourn there.  \n \nI was with her for much of this time, only returning to my home for brief shifts of not-anywhere-near-enough sleep, and to reassure my children that I still existed and cared for and about them. (And to do Jacob's extensive vitamin/medicine pours.)  \n \nBy the end of this journey, I have realized that I was in no way prepared for this. Throughout all my father's many hospitalizations in the last few years of his life, I had my mother to share the burden of the care and time with. And also, often, a third party, their very caring aide Mina. \n \nThis time? There was just... me. \n \nAnd there is just not enough of me to go around. \n \nBut go I must. \n \nAfter remaining awake for 99% of her  30 hours in the ER  before being finally admitted into a real hospital room, my mother spent much of her remaining hospitalization sleeping.  \n \nAnd I, equally exhausted, dozed on and off in the chair beside her, keeping a lazy vigil made possible by the excellent care I knew she was receiving. \n \nThe thousand tests they performed have shown that all the scary things we worried might have been going on were not: no stroke, no heart attack, no bisected arteries, no clogged carotids, no normal pressure hydrocephalus, no heart failure, no silent pneumonia. \n \nThe vascular specialists, the neurologists\u00a0 have walked away satisfied. But oh, yes, my mother was still deeply dizzy, the condition that had led her to call the nurse where she lives and begin this whole chain of events on Monday afternoon.  \n \nAfter hours and hours of wait, wait, wait, there is suddenly rush, rush, rush. My mother must arrive back home to her assisted living community by 6 pm or they cannot accept her (rules, rules, rules).\u00a0 So once the green light had been given, her wristbands cut off in both a functional and a symbolic gesture, a surgical rupture of the umbilicus of her care there, I am left to dress my mother. \n \nEver attempting to be helpful, they sent the nurse's aide to assist; however, I know this is my task, and shoo him (him!) away. \n \nMy mother had been hooked up to all sorts of machines and monitors, which means she had a lot of... things... stuck all over her body. And so after removing her hospital gown, it was time to de-tag her. \n \nMy father used to hate help with dressing, even when he could clearly no longer function on his own, a man deeply fond of his dignity. So we would often find those little EEG tags, or, stranger still, full monitor buttons, like extra nipples stuck onto his body in odd places, weeks (weeks!)  after a hospitalization. \n \nWhen I would attempt to remove them he would become upset.\u00a0 In his mind, the doctor didn't tell him specifically to take them off, therefore they should remain attached. Likewise those little cotton balls band-aided to blood draw points designed to apply pressure briefly after the event, to help prevent hematomas from developing. \n \nMy parents have been known to wear them for days after a doctor visit, having never heard, absorbed or remembered the instructions: \"Keep this on a few minutes, maybe an hour,\u00a0 to make sure the bleeding has stopped.\" \n \nMy mother's skin has gone all crepey, nearly translucent, in spite of its always olive tint; it stretches tremendously, so as I pull at the tags I am begging the glue to yield before I cause her any pain. \n \nAs a mother, I think about how my mother must have painstakingly cared for my physical needs when I was a baby. And now here I am, full circle, caring for my mom. \n \nWhen the technicians had asked her to move into positions that caused her pain, I would rub her back, hold her hand; simple reassurances, but making all the difference in the world. \n \nAnd then, at the very last, a pair of eager ENTs came down, fresh faced residents full of cheer. They put my mother through some moves -- lie down, turn her head, turn her whole body, sit up this way and not that -- to help re-set the gyroscope of her inner ear. \n \n\"Watch us!\" they'd said, \"This should help, but it often needs more than one session.\u00a0 You can do this with her at home until she's all better, or if it happens again.\" Their enthusiasm was infectious. I learned the moves. \n \nWe made it back before six. They let us in, welcomed her home. Willie, poor  ancient cat,  was beside himself with joy to see her. \n \nAnd then, miraculously, after days of somnolence in a hospital bed, Mom was eager to go down to the dining room, to take back up the reins of her social life: dinner and a (closed-captioned) movie with the other two feisty old broads who call my mother friend. \n \nThey are the three musketeers, the nonconformists of the bunch, aware of life's absurdities, always peeking behind the curtain, looking askance at the dour little-old-lady types who populate much of the elder brood. \n \nAnd thus I leave her, at the dinner table with her friends. Laughing.  \n \nAnd so I can leave with a lightened heart, as they lighten hers; for with them she once again laughs. Oh, how they laugh. \n \n \n \n Mom and her friends \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Sunday, June 12, 2011", "body": "\n \nToday I am happy to be helping out a friend and hosting the fortnightly (LOVE that word!) Blog Gems - Air Your Archives link-up. \n \nThis was created by the wonderful Jen, my lovely friend from Ireland who blogs at  The King and Eye .  Jen, a sister Autism Mom, is taking a break from blogging, as her real life has been pretty intense lately and she needs to focus on family matters. \n \nSo she has  asked her friends to help her out and keep the linky going. \n \nI am very happy to help you, Jen! (Even though, true to form, I am 2 weeks and a day late!)  \n \n This is what Jen says about Blog Gems: \nHow many posts do you have languishing in your archives? Great posts  that will never be dusted off and brought out to breathe again! Maybe  you created fabulous content before you had lots of followers, or maybe  you have been blogging for years and your current followers haven't seen  your older material.  \n \nBlog Gems - Air Your Archives is a fortnightly linky list where  we will give a prompt and you select a post from your archives that fits  the prompt. You do not have to create content for the prompt, unless  you want to. All you have to do is copy and paste the url of the post  into the linky list. Voila, an old post gets a second shot!  \n \nTo take part:  \n \n1.  Follow Jen's blog  to get future Blog Gem posting information and linkys.  \n \n2. Grab the Blog Gem button and place it on your sidebar (html code  here ). Putting the button on your blog is not a deal-breaker, some  people just don't like doing it and I have no problem with that at all.  What I will say is that something like this can't be successful without  'word of mouth' so I would appreciate if you could find another way to  let people know that this is available and they are welcome to join in.  \n \n3. Enter your link.  \n \n4. Read and comment on the submissions of the two blogs posted before you on the linky list. (Please!)  \n \n5. Help spread the word by telling your blogging friends, either by tweeting this or blogging about your entry.  \n \n And here's what I have to add: \n \nIt's a wonderful chance to get fresh eyeballs on your great posts from the past. \n \nThe rule is that you're supposed to select a post from your  archives that fits the prompt... but, being the generous, kind-hearted person that Jen is, it's a lenient rule. She states:  \"Broad interpretations of the prompt are encouraged so this could be a good chance to be creative!\" \n \n And today's theme is: CHANGE!\u00a0 \n \n We are about to end our School Year here in NYC (and most schools in America already have). The weather is switching back and forth between Spring and Summer day to day like it can't make up its mind which it is.\u00a0 Everything is in a state of flux, transition. \n \n  So find a post about that. Whether you are embracing the changes or fighting them, share with us. It can be big, say a move across the world, or small (ever change a diaper?) And, as the lady says, creative interpretations welcome!  \n \n Tell us about CHANGE. \n \nSo easy! Come, Link Up folks! \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Really. \n I got my bump early, what with carrying twins and all, moving from the \"Is she preggo or just really fond of beer?\" to the \"Oh, yeah she's preggo!\" stage in rapid succession. \n \nIt helped get me sympathy as I puked all over Los Angeles and the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah (almost in  James Caan's lap ) on my last business trips before I was grounded by my obstetrician. \n \nAt Sundance, the actress   Julie Benz,  who played the pregnant vampire Darla in the (Buffy the Vampire Slayer spin-off) Angel TV series rubbed my bump \"for luck.\" That was pretty awesome. \n \nIn Los Angeles?\u00a0 The boys were really growing. I needed fuel, and plenty of it. Intensely. And impatiently. (I *might* have eaten the untouched cornbread from a basket at the just vacated\u00a0table next to ours when the service was glacially slow in that LA restaurant way. Mmmmm that cornbread was good.) \n \nIt was NOT a good idea to get between me and my plate of risotto on that trip. (You would likely have found teeth marks on your arm.) \n \nThis is me in Los Angeles in February, only 3 & 1/2 months pregnant, mind you: \n \n \n On the beach at sunset. Maybe Malibu. I don't remember. It was almost dinnertime. I was getting hungry. \n My husband and I took our last trip alone together in April, a weekend getaway at Mohonk, a Catskill mountain resort just 90 minutes from the city (we had been admonished not to go any further). \n \n \n April 2002, 5 months Pregnant, 4 months to go! \n Right about now? In early June, nine years ago? I was losing my mind trying to get our kitchen/bathroom/baby's room renovation completed before the babies arrived. \n \nBecause twins without a kitchen? Really bad idea. Twins without a working bathroom (our apartment only has one)? Even worse. And a 3-week job had turned into 2 months and counting, of course. \n \nI needn't have worried. \n \nAlready big as a house in early June, I couldn't imagine going full term, to that date I had awoken from a dream in January and spoken out loud with such certainty I'd marked it on the calendar: \"July 29th -- I'm having the babies on July 29th!\" \n \nBut there that date is, on their birth certificates. \n \n39 weeks. \n \nNearly 14 pounds of babies. \n \nWhich looks like this: \n \n \n Me, July 28th, 2002, my last night pregnant \n And then?\u00a0  These: \n \n \n Ethan & Jake, 1 day old \n Worth every stretch mark, and then some. \n \n This was written for the Rockin\u2019 the Bump Link-up at Shell\u2019s blog: Things I Can\u2019t Say.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2011", "body": "\nToday my mother was tired when I stopped in to visit, to take her downstairs to lunch. And while many a day I will coax and cajole, force her to rouse herself, to rise to the occasion, today I didn't. I let her be. \n \nDo you know why? Because I was tired, too. \n \nSo I didn't make her make an effort, make her rise and dress, put in her teeth. I did hand her her hearing aid, however, to make conversation less about shouting and guessing. \n \nAnd then I laid down beside her on the big, now half-empty bed and held her hand. \n \nAnd we talked. \n \nAbout the little things; about everything and nothing. \n \nI told her how we had just  this morning measured Ethan, to find he had grown a full half-inch in a month. \n \nShe patted her head and mine, proclaimed us both lucky in our luxuriant curly hair. \n \nI talked to her about Jacob. \"He's still autistic, isn't he?\" \n \n\"Oh, yes, that's for certain.\" \n \nHer eyes soften, wishing there were something she could do, finding nothing.\u00a0  \n \n\"But he's doing well? He's in a good school?\" \n \n\"Yes, Mom, very well, and a very good school. He wants to see you. I'll bring him by soon.\"  \n \nI haven't brought Jake to see my Mom since  I put her cat Willie down  last week. For a quite a while before that even, as he was growing quite frail. \n \nJake loved that cat, will have a hard time with him gone. I'm not ready to handle that. Not yet. \n \n\"Haven't found me a man yet, have you?\" \n \n\"Nope, Mom. They're either too old, too young or too... dull.\" \n \nShe nods in agreement, knows my father will be a hard act to follow. Yet, still, she longs for companionship. \n \nWe lay side by side, a short arms reach apart as I know she had lain for 51 years with my father on many a morning and evening (and, in their later, retired  and tired years, an afternoon, too) talking about everything and nothing, the easy rhythms of intimacy. \n \nI know this well in my own life, with my husband (though in these frantic years of still young children, our quietly together times are much fewer and farther between) and with my son Ethan who jealously hoards his bedtime talking time with me, needing so much to process his day before releasing it to slumber. (Not an easy sleeper, this one, not at all.)   \n \nI held my mothers hand. We talked of this and that, and then we drifted off into sleep; took a little nap, side by side, our fingertips a bridge from daughter to mother. \n \n\"I'm going to be 89 soon,\" she'd  said, \"Imagine that.\" \n \n\"I can. I do. I'm no spring chicken myself, you know.\"\u00a0  \n \n\"I plan to make it to 100.\" Then, shaking her head, \"Not likely.\" \n \n\"Why not?\" I asked \"Why not?' \n \nShe smiled. \n \nWe napped. \n \nI woke first, slipped my hand from her now lax fingers, stepped into the kitchen to do a little cleaning up after my formerly fastidious mother who now sees no dirt. \n \nCame back to wake her, to say goodbye. (There were groceries to purchase, children to retrieve from schools.) \n \nBut first I sat softly on the bed, gently clasped her hand once again, leaned over to gaze at her barely lined, still youthfully smooth face; whispered quietly, beneath the threshold of her dimmed hearing: \"Why not, 100? Why not?\" \n \n \n This post has been linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's   Alphabe-Thursday writing meme.   But, you know, unlike most of my alphabet posts that truly  are   inspired by jazz-like riffing off a word, I wrote this  first   (riding the crosstown bus home from my mother's apartment) and then found an \"H\" word within the post to hang it on. And really, you're lucky, because the other way around? You might have had to read about my \"Hell in a Handbasket\" week. \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for... \u00a0 because I am so grateful for this lovely moment with my mother.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Monday, June 6, 2011", "body": "\nI thought it would all get easier as Jacob got older and matured, grew into himself; as his language developed, engagement with the world expanded. \n \nTime to think again.  \n \nRight now it is getting harder and harder to go out with Jacob. Along with expanding interest he is becoming less easygoing. He now wants what he wants when he wants it. And also? He will not be easily denied, distracted, redirected. \n \nAnd Jacob? Loves babies. If I am anywhere near a baby or young toddler\u00a0 (= pretty much anywhere out of our house) I can't take my eyes off him for a minute, so great is his love of and desire to interact with babies.  \n \nWith babies we know personally? Usually a tolerable situation will emerge (with close supervision) and can actually be a great source of delight for all concerned. Because Jacob will talk to a baby for hours, asking him questions, shaking a rattle in front of her, taking a just walking toddler for a cruise around the room. \n \nAnd the babies? They love Jake. Because he talks to them like they are people, equals, doesn't talk down to them in baby-talk; will pay them endless attention. And what baby doesn't want endless attention from a big kid?  \n \n \n \n Jake with baby friend at Greta's Bat Mitzvah this May \n With complete strangers, however, who see this giant, 80-pound, 10-year-old-looking, yet 3-year-old-acting boy about to pounce upon their tiny baby? A frightening situation at best. \n \nI look away for a minute, like to check on my other son, make sure he is still in sight. When I look up there is Jake making a bee-line for a stranger and her... oh, no,  sleeping  baby. So I have to drop everything and run an interception move, shouting at the top of my lungs: \"Jacob, no! Come back, we don't know  that  baby!\" \n \nSigh. \n \nToday was Ethan's 3rd grade end-of-year picnic. I had no sitter, my husband was both working this evening and so jet lagged (having just returned from his week working his ass off teaching in Milan) as to be a useless zombie this afternoon... in other words, I was (once again) alone with both kids. \n \nSo I had to bring Jacob along. It won't be so bad, I thought, even though Jake goes to a different, specialized school, he has been coming to his brothers events for years, no biggie. \n \nJake used to be easy at these things, happy to sit near me and play with toys I'd brought along.\u00a0 But now, runs off to the far reaches, often in search of babies. Fortunately, relatively scarce at this big kid gathering. \n \nBut the other thing he does? Try to talk to and interact with the other big kids? It doesn't go well. \n \nBecause  he's strange . \n \nHe's either talking about movies, reciting when they will open and what they are rated, or he's asking strange questions. The kind that might get him beaten up, like: \"Are you a baby?\" \n \nOr? He's walking right through the middle of heated ballgames, not noticing there's a game going on. Or even worse, noticing and grabbing the ball and running with it, because he thinks that's playing with the big boys. \n \nGreat. Something else that will be getting him in trouble. (That happened, badly, yesterday. I started to write about it, just couldn't finish that post \"And so it begins\" yet, even though it should have preceded this one. It's still too raw, will be coming soon.) \n \nToday? He'd brought a large toy train with him, and proceeded to find the one patch of dirt in the entire lush green lawn to sit in and roll his train around. He basically swam in the dirt. \n \nSome younger kids came along to help him dig a hole with a stick and bury his train. I am sure their parents did not appreciate the lure of the dirt, but frankly as long as he was staying out of trouble I was happy.  \n \nUntil he started throwing some dirt. And a little girl didn't appreciate that; retaliated by shoving his face into it, before I had completed my charge up to him to stop him. \u00a0  \n \nAnd these days? Jacob, once upset, gets stuck. Really stuck. And so I have a hysterical, crying, screaming autistic kid on my hands now, too covered (head to toe) in dusty dirt to make a fast escape. \n \nSo there I sit, surrounded by the other families trying not to stare at the spectacle on my blanket as I clean Jake off, pack up all our stuff. I make arrangements with our next door neighbors to bring Ethan back with them so he doesn't have to cut short his thrilling dodge-ball game to slink home with his autistic brother. \n \nAnd I thank my stars that Ethan is in a wonderful (NYC public) school, that this is not a much judgmental crowd. My friend  Sandra 's daughter, kind and sympathetic, is offering Jake her treats to try to cheer him up. \n \nAnother mother whose children have issues, who is on the PA's Support for Special Needs Committee with me, comes by as we are nearly ready to go and marvels at my patience. I can't really take credit for it; it's the patience of the weary, of the worn down to a nubbin Mom that I am these days. \n \nThe tears are winding down, finally, as we board the bus up Riverside, only a few stops but far too far to walk my exhausted son. I am grateful for a nearly empty bus, as he sits down in the front \"elderly & disabled\" priority seats. \n \nAnd you know, he IS disabled, even if it's invisible. We can rightfully claim those seats, but still, I'm glad that we're not making some old lady walk to the back, not engendering the stink-eye from the other passengers. \n \nBecause I just couldn't take that today. \n \nSoon we will be home; he will be bathed, pajamaed and happy again.\u00a0 Soon he will have moved on into ready-for-bed mode. But me?  \n \nI have left a part of me on that lawn where the other parents are playing ball with their kids or chatting with their friends. Where I am wiping the dirt from my sobbing, screaming son's limbs and wondering what is next. \n \nWhat, my God, is next? \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, June 2, 2011", "body": "\nG is for Goodbye, Willie. \n \nI am writing this while sitting at the ASPCA, waiting for our number to  come up, to walk through those steel doors, to put my 88 year-old  mother's 19 year-old cat to \"sleep.\" \n \nHow I hate that euphemism. (Plus, remind me NEVER to use  this expression around the boys or they may never sleep again.) But to say \"death\" is still just too harsh. And \"down\"? Too ambiguous. But maybe that's best. \n \nThe technical term \"to be euthanized\"? Too many shivers down my spine, images of Hitler's death wagons  coming for people like my son  to let that word trip off my tongue lightly. \n \nBut really, all this theorizing about language is the distractor isn't it? To keep me from thinking too much about the next few minutes; about walking Willie through that door. \n \nBecause I have already asked for the box of Kleenex, dripping snotty tears all over the poor reception clerk's desk as I filled out the forms that will make this come to pass, today. \n \n \n \n Mom & Willie, June 1, 2011 \n \nI am writing this sitting in a hard wooden chair in a small room, redolent of bleach, with a raised steel table at the center. Lovely photographs of wild animals hang on the walls, I'm sure meant to soothe; to establish that this place is all about the animals. \n \nBut really, don't you think it's kind of cruel in this place emblematic of our  ultimate control over our domestic pets' lives to taunt them with images from their ancestral memory, when their great, great (to the hundredth power) grandmothers were once wild and free? \n \nI see owls and does, wolves and tigers all around me. \n \nAnd this one little tiger,  William \"Tyger\" Blake , alternately panting and wild eyed or serenely resigned and calm, waiting, contained, in the carrier beside me.  \n \nAnd in spite of the many pounds lost, the ravages of old age and kidney disease upon his once solid frame, his ribs countable, his fur clumped and patchy, he is still rubbing his large, now quite angular head against the fingers I snake through the bars of his cage to offer what little comfort I may in this strange place that smells of dogs and fear. \n \nThe veterinarian and technician finally enter the room, are lovely young women, kind and clearly compassionate. They reassure, tell me we're doing the right thing; rattle off the ways Willie's body is failing him, confirm he is on the brink of heavy suffering and that this is the just right time to do this, when the scales of pleasure and pain in his life are about to tip straight down into nightmare. \n \n\"You have loved him much, and are saving him needless suffering,\" they say.\u00a0 And: \"It's truly time.\" \n \nAnd so, it was time. \n \n \n \n \nAn anesthetic held his body still while I pet him one last time, recalled to the gentle vet how handsome Willie was in his glory, the now matted fur sleek and full, the most glorious bushy tail I'd ever seen on a cat held regal and high. \n \nI kissed the top of his head one last goodbye, waited for her to push the plunger with the final, heart stopping drug... \n \nAnd then? \n \nMy damn cellphone rang. \n \nCaretaker of so many, I  had  to glance over, and then, holding up my hand, requested a halt for a moment. It was the the driver of my autistic son Jacob's school bus. It seems the bus had broken down in the extreme heat and humidity while still downtown, miles from my home. \n \n (People? You just can't make this shit up. It would be way too cliche: the phone ringing as the vet pulls back the plunger, just like in all those death row movies, the governor calling  at the  zero hour with a stay of execution. \n \nBut this is my real life. And  there's a reason I called my blog \"The Squashed Bologna\": I am the meat flattened in the middle of the sandwich. I honestly earn my bloggy nickname and  Twitter handle \"SquashedMom\" nearly every day.) \n \nIt was hard to get the details clear from Jake's driver. She's a lovely woman but with a thick Spanish accent, much more understandable in person than through the filter of cell to cell telephony. While we worked out the plan to get him picked up, the vet was growing impatient, worried the sedative was wearing off and Willie would begin to stir. \n \nSo I hung up on the bus driver, crossed my fingers that she had understood my intent to send a babysitter to get Jake rather than wait the possibly two hours it will take the bus company to get a new bus into position, and jumped back to the steel table of death. \n \nAnd then? Quickly, so quickly, it is done. One last kiss, one last tear dripped upon his still warm but now lifeless body. The vet picked him up, cradled him lovingly as she carried him from the room. \n \nAnd out I went, to wheel an empty carrier home to my mother in the sweltering heat. To tell my mother it is over. To take her to  her  doctor's appointment, the follow-up from  last week's hospitalization , where we will at last have good news. And during which my missing-me son and my currently-in-Milan husband will call my cell phone simultaneously while the doctor is still talking to me. \n \nSquashed. Always. \n \n \n \n \nWillie was a vastly handsome, but an aloof, cat-like cat. He interacted with humans on his  terms only, choosing to sit upon a lap or not according to his own  arcane rules or whims. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet  'Willie, you  mamzer \" from my Mother. \n \nBut  since my father's passing last March? Willie has stepped up to the  plate, kept on knocking them out of the ballpark. He talked to Mom all  day long, sat near and on her constantly, slept on Dad's side of the bed  beside her, a smaller weight for sure, but comfort, nonetheless. \n \nNow gone. \n \nWillie's  small furry absence will ring loudly, echoing the much larger one that  looms over all, in my mother's life. His ashes, once claimed, will sit in their own little box, next to my father's, on their bookcase shelf. \n \nMy mother misses my father fiercely, still,  every day in every way. They had a true partnership, a deep friendship;  were mates, through and through. (We should all be so lucky.) \n \nNow gone. \n \nBut never forgotten.  \n \n \n \n \nSomeday soon I will walk into my mother's apartment bearing a sweet orange tiger, someone's beloved kitty that they just could not keep.\u00a0 They will regard each other warily for a few minutes, then a head will be stroked, a paw extended, a lap occupied; purring will begin. \n \nEmbers will beget sparks, and the flames of love will start to dance anew in hearts once bereft and sundered.  \n \n \n \n \nGoodbye, Willie. You were a good cat, much beloved. You will be deeply missed. Rest in peace (and catnip). \u00a0  \n\u00a0  \n \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's   Alphabe-Thursday writing meme.   I believe that G is also  for Gah!

{"date": "Tuesday, June 7, 2011", "body": "\nYesterday I had a  really rough day  with Jacob.\u00a0 But then sometimes, as if to tip the scales back a bit, the universe will throw me a bone; the gods of autism will show me something other than their asshole side. \n \nLast night at bedtime, for the first time in ages (months I think), Jacob, out of the blue, said: \"I love you, Mommy.\"  \n \nAnd then, spontaneously, this morning? He said it again.\u00a0  \n \nEach time he said it I stopped what I was doing, went over to him, kissed him and told him that I loved him, too. Told him that I always know he loves me, but that it's also nice to hear it sometimes. \n \nAnd then, to top it off, Jake's bus was running really late this morning. Really, really late, leaving us standing around in front of our building waiting for about half an hour. \n \nThere are days when this happens and it's a disaster, Jake getting agitated and anxious as the minutes tick by with no bus in sight. \n \nAll those dark winter wee-hour mornings spent sitting on the radiators in the cold outer lobby, hoping the bus wasn't stuck on an unplowed street, answering Jake's constant question \"When is the bus coming, Mommy?\" with yet another \"I don't know, honey.\" \n \nBut that was not today. \n \nToday was a perfect June morn, not too warm, not too cool, so we could stand outside and take in the breezes, admire the blue cloudlessness of the sky, the green of the trees of Riverside Park, lush in their newly clad spring foliage. Jake in a good yet not over-the-top giddy mood, chatting away with me, less annoying and repetitive than most mornings.  \n \nI had lucked out while parking yesterday, snagged the rock-star spot right in front of our building, and Jake was thrilled to find himself standing beside the family car as we waited. \n \n\"Paint the car, mommy? I want an orange car.\" Jake requested, and we engaged in a fun and silly conversation about all the ways we might repaint the car. \n \nJake refrained from yelling \"Go away doggie, shoo!\" at the many dogs that get walked past us every morning on their way to the park. He actually wanted to pet one particularly sweet and docile creature that lived in our building, chickening out at the last moment but seemingly satisfied when I stroked her in his stead. \n \nCheerful right until the end, when the bus pulled up, driver full of apologies and tales of a major accident on the West Side Highway snarling traffic for miles. \n \nI kissed Jake goodbye, waved to the bus as it lumbered up the street, headed back inside to wake and ready Ethan for his coming day. \n \nThank you, universe, thank you (kinder, gentler) gods of autism. \n \nI really needed that. \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, June 4, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n And now for something completely different... today's SNSS guest post is by a MAN: Peter Flom, a Dad, who is the father of a child with special needs. But even more remarkable is that he is also, himself, a person with special needs, officially on (the fringes of)  the  autism spectrum with  Nonverbal Learning Disorder (NLD) . \n He writes about this on his blog,  I am learning disabled , where he talks about his experiences in life as someone who is different. He also faces special parenting challenges with his two sons, the eldest of whom is also \"on the spectrum.\" \n \n The other different thing about today's guest is that I did not \"meet\" Peter online, he is actually a friend in real life. I have known Peter since our sons became friends when they were two and a half; his wife is one of my closest friends.\u00a0  \n \n Peter is very lucky in that he had parents who believed in him at a time when \"different\" children were often discarded. When his mother was told told he would never learn anything or have a normal life, and that she should send him away? She ignored the \"experts,\" instead founding  an amazing school  for special children to properly educate her son.\u00a0 \n \n And it paid off. Peter is a statistician holding a Ph.D. He is a family man with a wife and two sons, has many friends. \"Ineducable?\" I think not. \n \n Living with his differences personally gives him a special perspective on the lives of his sons, which he shares with us, with much warmth and humor, here:\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0@@@@@@@\u00a0\u00a0  \n Siblings and the LD Person  - by Peter Flom \n \n Part 1: Me and my siblings: \n \nI\u2019m learning disabled.\u00a0 It even says so on  my blog .\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not FORMALLY diagnosed with LD.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2018cause I\u2019m 51.\u00a0 MY diagnosis is \u201cminimal brain dysfunction\u201d!\u00a0 Woo!\u00a0 Sorta makes you glad your kids are young, huh?\u00a0 Your kids just have autism or Aspergers or whatnot.\u00a0 *I*\u2019ve got a dysfunctional brain!\u00a0 (At least it\u2019s minimal!) \n \nThe LD that fits me best is probably  Nonverbal Learning Disability .\u00a0 But I note that (per the book) people with NLD have no sense of humor.\u00a0 We are ESPECIALLY bad at things like sarcasm which depend on tone of voice.\u00a0 Hehehe. \n \nYeah, life for us LD people was even worse 40 years ago and more.\u00a0 MBD was my FORMAL diagnosis.\u00a0 Informal diagnosis were things like \u201clazy,\u201d \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d (from adults) or \u201cspazzo,\u201d \u201cretard\u201d and such (from kids). \n \nBut some things made it easier.\u00a0 And some NON-things made it easier too.\u00a0 Two of the non-things that made it easier for me were my brother and sister.\u00a0 I got lucky.\u00a0 One of the ways I got lucky is that they think THEY got lucky.\u00a0 Not a lot of people would have thought of having me as a sibling as luck.\u00a0  \n \nMy sister (technically, my half-sister, but we have an unhyphenated relationship) was 12 when I was born.\u00a0 She was an enormously competent 12 year old.\u00a0 So much so that our mother trusted her to take care of me. \n \nOnce, when I was a baby, she took me to the park and was pushing me in a swing.\u00a0 A woman came up to her and said \u201cWHAT are you DOING with that BABY?!?\u201d and my sister turned to her and said \u201cthat baby is my brother, and I am ENTERTAINING him\u201d.\u00a0  \n \n18 months after I was born, my brother came along.\u00a0 I was an odd-looking, skinny, cranky, strange acting child.\u00a0 My brother was a blue-eyed, blond-haired chubby cheeked cutie.\u00a0 So, everyone oohed and aahed even more over the new baby than usual.\u00a0 My sister decided she was having none of that!\u00a0  \n \nNo!\u00a0 *I* was the one.\u00a0 Until a couple months later when she told our parents that she couldn\u2019t help liking our brother because \u201che makes himself so charming.\u201d But, nevertheless, I\u2019ve always been closer to my sister than my brother has. \n \nSo, there I am, this messed up little baby with this adorable brother.\u00a0 Recipe for \u2026. A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.\u00a0 It\u2019s weird how these things work out sometimes.\u00a0  \n \nMy brother and I shared a room until I was about 15. For most of that time, it was by choice. In the apartment where we spent our tweens and teens, there were two rooms for us.\u00a0 But, until I was 15, we shared one as a bedroom and used the other for other stuff.\u00a0 And, even after I decided I wanted my own room, we did a lot together.  \n \nI helped him with his homework (yeah, well, my dysfunctional brain is good at some stuff, like math and writing).\u00a0 He provided relationships.\u00a0 Because I had no friends from 6th to 11th grades.\u00a0 None.\u00a0 I think I had one date (and that was a disaster) and I don\u2019t recall any \u201cplay dates\u201d.\u00a0  \n \nBut my brother had tons of friends.\u00a0 He loved being around people.\u00a0 And people loved being around him, too.\u00a0 He made himself charming.\u00a0 And I got to share. \n \nMeanwhile, my sister had gone off to college (but she came home some) and then got married.\u00a0 She lived for a little while in Lawrence, Kansas, but for most of the time she lived in Chicago.\u00a0 I used to go visit.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 Several times a year.\u00a0 Because it was just a lot easier being in her house than being in my parents\u2019 house.\u00a0 How many people go to Chicago for Christmas vacation? \n\u00a0  \nSo, even though for a lot of kids in the autism ballpark, sibling relationships are really hard, for me they were good.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Well, Calvin Trillin was once asked the secret to his long, happy marriage.\u00a0 He said \u201cI walked into the right party.\u201d\u00a0  \n \nThat\u2019s how I feel.\u00a0 I got lucky.\u00a0 That\u2019s not much help to others, I guess.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how my brother and sister decided to put up with me.\u00a0 But I\u2019m really glad they did. \n \n Part 2: My two sons: \n \nWe have two kids.\u00a0 One is 14.\u00a0 The other is 8.\u00a0 The older one is in the ballpark -- that is, the whole  AS/HFA/NLD/PDD/NOS/WTF ballpark .  \n \nThese two boys are very different.\u00a0 Darling Older Son (DOS) is asocial, stoic about physical pain but very sensitive to noise, has stable emotional states, thinks and cogitates before asking questions, is often lost in his own thoughts, speaks relatively little (although he speaks well), and operates in a narrow emotional range.  \n \nDarling Younger Son (DYS) is social, hysterical about physical pain but not overly sensitive to noise, emotionally labile, speaks in what seems like stream of consciousness, shares his thoughts readily, and is given to hyperbole\u00a0 -- he does not have bad days, he has the WORST DAY in the HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE; or, sometimes, best day. \n \nLike many sibling pairs, DYS wants to be around DOS much more than vice versa.\u00a0 Unlike many pairs, DOS is just not able to deal with it.\u00a0 But unlike some, where one child is in a different part of the ballpark, it seems like he OUGHT to be able to deal with it.\u00a0  \n \nSOMETIMES he can.\u00a0 For short periods.\u00a0 On his terms.\u00a0  \n \nIf he couldn\u2019t cope, ever, at all\u2026 well, he would be in a more central part of the ballpark, and farther from us.\u00a0 But it would be easier to understand, in a way, and easier to explain, certainly.\u00a0 When a kid is verbal enough to say \u201cLittle brothers are OK. Until they learn to talk\u201d then why can\u2019t he be verbal all the time?\u00a0  \n \nWell, why does a 2 year old want to be alone?\u00a0 Why does a 14 year old say \u201cI really like a lot of space\u201d while an 8 year old says \u201cBut I LIKE sleeping on top of you, Daddy!\u201d? \n \nI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 People vary.\u00a0 Including our children.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have acronyms, we have kids.  \n \nWe can be thankful for some stuff.\u00a0 DOS has never been violent towards DYS.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t lie about him.\u00a0 He can make his wishes known with language, even if it isn\u2019t always language DYS wants to hear, or can deal with.\u00a0  \n \nWill they get along better later?\u00a0 Probably.\u00a0 I hope so.\u00a0  \n \nSiblinghood is powerful.\u00a0  \n \n \u00a0@@@@@@@\u00a0\u00a0  \n I love how Peter's love for his sons and his endless patience with them shines through here.\u00a0  One of the wonderful things about Peter is his accepting attitude towards his children, as he says above: \"We don\u2019t have acronyms, we have kids.\" \n \n I can also say, with firsthand knowledge, that far from \"lacking a sense of humor,\" Peter is one of the funniest people I know.\u00a0 I love his jokes, like this one,  about Aspergers . \n \n Now that you have read Peter here, you're going to want to get to know more about him, so go to his  blog,  I am learning disabled.  He doesn't blog often, but when he does, it is always worth reading. \n \n Try the post where Peter talks about his view of autism as a  ballpark , or this one, where he lists  some things NOT to say  to him, or this one, where he talks about thinking so far  out of the box , he doesn't even see it. \n \n Besides writing on his own blog, Peter is also a contributor to many other sites including Yahoo's  Associated Content , and  Daily Kos  where he is an active and involved writer and  community member.  \n   \nFinally, you can find and follow him on Twitter, where he maintains two different handles:  peterflomLD  for his thoughts on special needs and as plain old   peterflom  for his thoughts on all else, including (liberal) politics. \n \n Thank you Peter, for kicking off June, Father's Day month, with your insights as both a father and a sibling. I am happy and proud to call you my friend. \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "body": "\nA friend of mine frequently makes this joke: \"I'm in shape.... because round is a shape!\" And I laugh the sympathetic laugh of a fellow middle-aged-bigger-than-I-used-to-be mom. But also? I wince. \n \nBecause I *AM* round right now, and I don't really know how to deal with it. None of my clothes fit me right. I am completely clueless about how to dress for this shape, because it is not a shape I have ever been before. \n \nAlthough it's been my shape, more or less, for the past nine years, I keep thinking it's temporary, an aberration and I will just magically morph back into my old shape sometime soon, so I throw on whatever loose (or, disastrously, too tight) clothes I can still tug onto my body and then I don't think about it. \n \nBut this round body? Seems to be not going away. Seems to be here to stay, and it's time I learn to dress for it, because I am really tired of looking dumpy and dreadful much of the time. \n \nA little history here? OK... \n \nLike any woman, seeming every woman, I have a long and complicated history with my body, my sense of self and beauty. A lot of this is coming up right now because last week I dredged up photos of myself from my High School graduation, many years ago (1977) for that \" Senior Hottie \" meme that was going around. \n \nWant to see?\u00a0 Here: \n \n \n Me, 1977, High School Graduation day \n I know at the time I did not feel beautiful. I thought my breasts  were too small, while my hips too large. I didn't feel womanly enough. I  look at these pictures now and can so clearly see my loveliness. \n \nAnd it  makes me sad that I was still pick, pick, picking at myself for not  being perfect at the same time that I *thought* I was bucking the  established order by choosing a \"natural\" hippie style. \n \nIntellectually I knew real women weren't shaped like Barbie dolls, but still, the little girl in me that had played with them did not know how to feel like a woman, shaped otherwise. (I got over that, but it took a while.) \n \nIn my entire childhood? I'd been small, skinny, scrawny even. Then with adolescence I sprouted hips, but not much in the way of breasts, becoming a slim pear, an elongated bosc, lets say. Growing older I put on more weight slowly over the years, but always maintaining that basic pear shape, broader at the bottom than the top, becoming more of a d'anjou. \n \nNo matter how round my bottom? I always had a waist. And so, in my mid twenties when I came back East from the California bean sprout farm (yes, literally) and it began to be OK to think about and care more about my looks, I learned to dress for my shape. \n \nOnce more wearing undergarments, push up and padded bras balanced the top. Cinched waists, belts, and clothes that flared outwards from there made it look like the dress and not my hips was creating the width. \n \nIn my adult life? I gained a few pounds each year, went up to a B-cup (finally!), didn't stress too much about my size or shape. I was never obsessed with my looks, never really cared enough about it to do something radical like diet. I liked food. I was OK being a size 10 or 12. I've been told I was possibly more like a man in that, how the mirror never turns fun-house on me.  \n \nBecause the thing was?\u00a0 I always felt somehow comfortable enough in my skin, inhabiting my body fully. And feeling, maybe, more attractive than an objective measurement of my looks might tally? Made me actually more attractive, as confidence is quite a turn-on. So I was never at a loss for a date or mate.  \n \nIt looked pretty good at 27: \n \n \n Me at 27 (don't mind the curly mullet, please, it was the 80's) \n Even at 37? Not half bad. This is how I looked when I met my husband. \n \n \n Me at 37 and at the beach \n And then, some time quite late in life, this happened: \n \n \n Me, 39 weeks pregnant with twins \n At the ripe old age of 41, I found myself finally pregnant, and with twins, no less.\u00a0 I went full term, to 39 weeks.\u00a0 So 12 days shy of my 42nd birthday, I delivered nearly 14 pounds of babies. \n \nThat was nearly 9 years ago (the boys' birthday is coming up in late July).  \n \nAnd I have never seen my waist again. \n \nThe whole pregnancy process started me down this road.\u00a0 It involved fertility treatments at the beginning (I permanently lost 2 inches of bust and gained 2 inches of waist in just 2 weeks on one evil anti-hormone drug. Truth.) and then a 4 inch, never healed tear in my abdominal muscles from going full term with the twins (a ligament can only stretch so much before it splits, folks, and it's officially called \"Diastasis Recti\").  \n \nAnd then, just when I thought I might start to focus on myself again, re-claim my body? One of my twins was diagnosed on the autism spectrum and my life as a full time Autism & Special Needs Mom began. And then my very elderly parents moved back to New York City from Florida so I could take care of and look after them. My second full-time \"job.\" \n \nI'd even managed to join weight watchers for a while and lose seventeen pounds, I thought I was finally on track to shifting my shape back.\u00a0 But then my father started slowly, intensely  dying ; followed closely by my  mother-in-law . I am a stress eater. I was not sleeping much. No more need be said, right?  \n \nAdd in the unkindness that each year's peri-menopausal changes have made as I marched towards then crossed over the big 5-0 mark, plus the assault on my body that was this winter's  gall bladder attacks ,  surgery  and  recovery ? And you'll find me, now, heavier and more beach-ball shaped than I have ever been, non-pregnant. \n \nAnd so now nearly all of my clothes getting are too tight and binding. Except for the mumus. \n \nAnd those mumus? Any clothes loose enough to not reveal the gut... look like maternity wear  and make me look pregnant. Like really, really pregnant. Because my weak as kittens abdominal muscles push my body towards this preggo, weeble, Booh-Bah shape. \n \nAll while my body is hurtling  towards menopause, making it gut wrenching when people ask when I'm due (and they do).\u00a0 If folks catch me on a particularly hormonal day when they ask that? I might just wail: \"Never! I'm too (sob) OLD (sob) to have more babies, waaaaaah\" at them.\u00a0 You can see that something MUST be done, and soon. \n \nAll that said, I am not completely lost and clueless. I have a few \"go to\" items: 2 perfectly loose-and-flowy-but-not-too-loose-and-baggy shirts, a magic jersey dress that seems to fit me and look halfway decent no matter what size I am (magic!), one pair of black jeans that I am not afraid to wear. \n \nBut I need more than 4 items of clothing I feel okay in. Plus these few pieces, already many years old, will eventually fall apart at the seams, leaving me naked. Not a pretty picture. \n \n \n \n At BlogHer10 in THE DRESS \n \n \n At the boys 8th birthday party in THE DRESS \n I do have a sense of style, I just have mostly wrong clothes and no idea how to dress for my new increasingly round shape. I hope to change that shape someday, as I know I need to get pay attention to my body again, to become healthier. \n \nIt's just I can't keep putting off looking OK now thinking I'm about to be magically transformed back into my old shape at any minute. So I want to simultaneously work, slowly and steadily, at getting my body stronger, healthier, more flexible and a bit smaller while also finding a way to feel beautiful again now, in this odd shape and size that I find myself in. \n \nI need to learn what to wear that works for \"round.\" And how to dress to both feel comfortable and flatter this shape that I'm in while I work to possibly turn it into something else, accepting that at 50 it's going to be a slow process, and might never end me back where I began. \n \n \n \n On my 50th birthday last summer, shockingly NOT in THE DRESS \n \n \n Not too shabby for 50, eh? \n At 50 I know who I am, I know my general sense of style (high-end Manhattan hippie meets Boden mommy) but I just really need a lot of help translating that to this \"new\" body of mine. I am tired of looking dumpy. Really tired of it. \n \nI just learned of this mom's fashion makeover contest today today, so here I am at the 11th hour, frantically trying to slap a post together (both kids FINALLY asleep) and throw it up on my blog before the clock strikes 12 and my coach reverts to a pumpkin. Because I could sure use the help, gals! \n \n This post was written as my entry for a chance to win a Style Session at BlogHer11 from Moms Fashion File. \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2011", "body": "\nSpring has now surrendered herself to summer\u2019s sultry heat. As I stretch my loosening limbs and feel the sweat trickle, tickley, down my slick armpits, I get thrown, always, back through time's twisty tunnels: summers past rushing by, swirling their memories around me, tantalizing snippets. \n \nSense memories all, sticky, sweaty summers full of swelter and promise. One stands out, recently plucked from the memory box\u2026   \n \nSummer of \u201977.  High school graduation; beginnings and endings, all rolled up into one. \n \nOr maybe more like this: a constant tumbling head over heels of endings and beginnings, chasing each others tails, a blur of old and new and old and new; the wheel, spun again and again, the endless yin and yang of it, as I tried to make a 16 year-old's sense out of my life. \n \nMy parents loved me dearly, cherished me fiercely, but were often clueless. They didn't attend my high school graduation ceremony. I had been ambivalent about attending it myself, and by the time I decided to show up after all, they had made other plans; important plans.  \n \nNot nearly as callous as that seems, I'm sure they had asked me at least three times if I\u2019d minded that they weren\u2019t there.\u00a0 And I'm sure I'd reassured them that it meant very little to me and I was OK. But I also know at some deeper level I was disappointed, feelings were hurt, a disconnect widened.  \n \nAs a mother, I have learned to listen beneath, to the waves below the words; to discount, at times, the surface, the brave \u201cI\u2019m OK\u201ds from little boys who aren\u2019t. My mother never did, needing reassurance more than truth. Pity. \n \nAt sixteen, I was so very young and clueless, though I'd thought myself sophisticated, a worldly woman. I was sorting through so many things in my mind, and developing just about zero practical skills for negotiating an adult life in the actual world. \n \nNavels were for gazing, and I did, how I did.  \n \nNew York City (suburbs). 1977. \n \nIt was the summer of Sam; and Star Wars. \n \nI remember waiting hours for tickets on opening week, the first time I had ever done that, with my last high school boyfriend, Ben. Sitting on the roof of his Black 1963 American Rambler in the parking lot of the Huntington Mall cinema, we were trying to catch a slim breeze as we waited for day to wheel into night and the movie's magic lantern to begin.  \n \nI have since seen that film dozens of times, but will always remember my first, seen with a last. Beginnings and endings tumbled together, wearing each other smooth like the rocks in the rushing river we camped beside, on the sweet and wondrous weekend road trip we took together that summer. \n \nThat summer of last high school boyfriend, while I was also quietly falling in love, unrequited, with girls right and left; my head and my heart in a tug of war (along with some select other parts). \n \nI did not even have my plans solidified for the fall, having missed the drop-dead dates for completing college applications, my parents once again useless here, being \"no pressure\" individualist hippie types, never realizing that a sixteen year-old girl might need a little guidance, a little pressure to make things happen, barely knowing her own mind, leaf-tumbling through life, lucky beyond all knowing that life never tossed evil into her hapless path. \n \nAnd the soundtrack to all this mayhem? Somewhere between Patti Smith\u2019s Horses album on my stereo, Springsteen\u2019s Born to Run blasting out of a jukebox, John Prine being strummed on my boyfriend's guitar and Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen wafting in from a somewhere distant radio.  \n \nIf the smell of being thirteen was  Coppertone ? The smell of sixteen turning seventeen for me was sweat; the intoxicating scent of fresh sweat, honestly earned. \n \nAnd the salt taste of it, the startlingly metallic and musky tang of it, on my hungry, awakening, clueless tongue. \n \n \n P.S. If you want to see me on the day of my High School Graduation? Go here:  I Was a Senior Feminist-Hippie-Hottie  \u00a0  \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  The Red Dress Club .

{"date": "Monday, May 30, 2011", "body": "\n Well, I'm a day late with this thing, but it's Memorial Day Weekend and so Monday feels like Sunday, no? That's my story and I'm sticking to it. It couldn't be that I'm just having such damn trouble getting anything done these days, no that's not it at all.... \n \n @@@@@@@ \nWe went nowhere this Memorial Day weekend. We being the kids and I. My husband went somewhere. he is in Milan. MILAN, people, as in Italy. \n \nBut he is working his ass off there, teaching an intensive class. So i can't really resent that he is in ITALY while i am alone in New york City in a beastly heat wave ALONE with the boys and nothing to do, nowhere to go, now can I, much? \n \nI used to go places. I used to travel the country and the world on shoots, with plays, for film festivals. sometimes even just for fun. \n \nI miss it, people. \n \nMy passport has expired. Ten years. Ten years since I've left the country. I don't do that work anymore. We don;t have the money to travel for fun. \n \nAnd the kids? Are an odd combination of tough and easy travelers. They were real troopers on our recent sojourn to Lowell, Mass. for their cousin Greta's Bat Mitzvah (post on that in process, coming soon). but its still a hell of a lot of work for me to haul them anywhere. \n \nI wrote a post about the physical (and emotional)  baggage  that comes along with taking Jake out. And i know that he's actually a fairly \"easy\" kid on the spectrum ,that there art people who literally CAN NOT go anywhere as a family. I am grateful that we are not on that sort of plane of existence. \n \nBut still, the big problem is.. we have nowhere to go. I can't just go somewhere, me and the boys - the two of them don't get along well enough to be alone together in tight quarters for days on end. In our home its bad enough, but without our computers and thousand toys\u00a0 yikes! Plus Ethan has playdates here. \n \nBut going away with others? well, let's just say the invitations to stay with friends with country homes? Just don;t roll in. My close friends love Jake, always tell me how amazing he is, but Jake for the whole weekend? would give anybody pause. Means it will not be quiet and restful for anyone in that house. even my friends who love Jake to death? They have husbands who have not signed on for autism.\u00a0  \n \nI don't know any families with autistic kids who get invited away for weekends. (And Ethan is a handful in his own way, too.) And also many of my closest friends? don't have summer houses anyway, are trolling for their own invites. \n \nSo we puttered around the city, went to movies, swam in a ridiculously overcrowded city pool (boys loved it anyway) ate too much junkfood, spent too much time on videogames/computers, had a bunch of playdates. \n \nIt was a pleasant, not dreadful, weekend. I am now completely exhausted, and have a week ahead of me I do NOT look forward to - dealing with my mother's 19 year old about to die cat who has become incontinent and will likely need to be put to sleep. \n \nBut still, it would have been nice to be able to go away somewhere. I miss vacations, travel, excitement.\u00a0 I would like to be in Milan.  \n \n @@@@@@@ \n \n Oh, I am so sorry. Was not intending this one to be a whiny rant, but that's where it went anyway. I'm tired of being tired, folks. I'm feeling mighty short on wit these days, sorry. I will try to return to witty or lyrical or something else soon.\u00a0 \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2011", "body": "\n I had all kinds of plans and ambitions for my life and blog this Monday and Tuesday, which all came to naught because of one of *THOSE* phone calls I received Monday, early afternoon.\u00a0 A classic \"your mother isn't feeling well and we think she should be seen by a doctor right away\" phone call.  \n \n So out went the Book Expo 11 plans, including a tea party at Random House with the fabulous  Lisa See . Out went my\u00a0 Red Dress Club \u00a0  RemembeRED memoir post.  \n \n In came the grueling grind: sleep deprivation and worry and tedium and adrenaline and annoyance and rage and acceptance and stupor and... a lot of sour lemons. So I made the bloggers version of lemonade: whipped up a post about it. \n \n It is now late late Tuesday night, and my mother has FINALLY been admitted to a proper bed in a proper room on the appropriate ward. I wrote this post Monday night between midnight and about 3 AM, typing with my thumbs on my little no-keyboard Droid cellphone. That I still had functional thumbs today? Nothing short of miraculous. \n \n So without further ado, I bring you: \n \n13 Things to do in the ER while waiting with your 88 year-old mother for them to find her a bed and move her the hell upstairs: \n \n1.\u00a0 Eat 2 packs of peanut M&Ms for dinner. (What? Like you've never experienced vending machine cuisine at its finest?) \n \n2.\u00a0 Read The New Yorker you brought with you cover to cover, even the articles about obscure sports figures you don't care about and the reviews of movies you were never planning to see in the 1st place. \n \n3.\u00a0 Feel inordinately proud of yourself that you managed to snag, vulture-like, from the patient vacating the berth next door: the pillow your mother's head is dizzily resting upon and the hard, narrow, plastic chair that is currently causing you a literal pain in the butt. As there are so very few of these rare and valuable commodities in the insanely overcrowded ER, you had to consciously restrain yourself from performing a fist pump of victory upon their procurement. \n \n4.\u00a0 Calling overcooked fish, white rice & soggy mixed veggies \"a meal\" and pouncing upon it with your mother when it arrives at 8 pm after 6 foodless hours spent in the ER. \u00a0(Also? Feeling like a genius for re-purposing the \"real lemon juice\" packets provided with the tea to make the fish vaguely palatable.) \u00a0  \n \n5.\u00a0 Wish you could shut your ears and not hear, the same way you can close your eyes and not see, so as to not have to listen to the 15 minutes of crying, screaming, wailing, cursing, gurgling and pleading going on in the curtained bay next to yours as a young woman has \"about a gallon of pus\" surgically drained from abscesses in her jaw. Realize how many doctors really do have impatience with, and markedly little empathy for patient's pain. (Be incredibly grateful for the amazing man who is your mother's - and was your father's - eminently patient & empathetic cardiologist. A menschier doctor does not exist.) \n \n6.\u00a0 Try to hold the lockless stall door closed by sheer will as you pee as quickly as female-humanly possible in the filthy visitor bathroom that you had been hoping not to encounter, but just couldn't hold it in any longer. \n \n7.\u00a0 Tie the undone shoelaces of the incredibly adorable 3 year old girl who has sidled up to you in the outer waiting room and tapped you on the knee to request assistance with said task, while her bedraggled mother simultaneously tries to fill out paperwork & calm her screaming, ill infant. Give up on trying to answer an urgent email and play with this sweet child for the last 5 minutes of your 10 minute \"plugged-in\" break from the inner ER electronic blackout zone. Return to your mother with a smile on your face. \n \n8.\u00a0 Try not to cry, yourself, as you (expecting tears and howls) break the news to your autistic son that you will NOT be home to put him to bed as you had PROMISED him you would be this morning, kissing him goodbye at the school bus door. Be surprised and thankful for his calmness, but even more wrenched by his brave little \"OK, mommy I'll see you in the morning.\" Pray they find a bed for your Mom before 5 AM so as to make THAT one true.  (They didn't.) \n \n9.\u00a0 Listen in to the weary mother of the young man in the next-door berth to the other side as she explains to the hospital security guard for the 10th time why she cannot leave for the standard shift-change visitor clearing protocol, as her non-verbal, seizure-prone, mentality challenged son would be completely lost and unable to communicate without her by his side. Try very hard not to start thinking about how life will be if Jacob still has significant communications problems when he is a man, no longer a child, and my presence by his side will be constantly questioned, his disability invisible. \n \n10.\u00a0 Be eternally grateful it's just an \"ordinary\" busy Monday and so we're not being \"entertained\" by one of the loud, drunk/high, belligerent & yet also inappropriately amorous couples who always manage to show up in the ER on Saturday nights. (I had enough of THOSE on  my train ride  from Boston to Lowell two weeks ago.)  \n \n11.\u00a0 Laugh when your Mom loudly contemplates what she can possibly lift from the stocked supply shelves you pass, walking her to the one non-filthy patient bathroom on the far side of the ER. Make her laugh as you invent imaginary uses for the pink bedpan you assume she plans on stealing.\u00a0 Look the other way as she nicks a mini tissue box: \"It''s such a convenient size!\" \n \n12.\u00a0 Try not to think about why you know this ER like the back of your hand, can find your way through the catacombed passageways of this hospital's lower corridors like a resident, pushing back against the tide of memories of your father spending much time and  mother-in-law dying  in the selfsame ward they are seeking to place your mother in, tonight.  \n \n13. Two words: angry birds. Two less fun words: dead battery. Two even less fun words: puking toddler. (And yes, a hurling pediatric patient missed my feet by inches today when my Mom was in triage. But it was sweet to hear him say afterward: \"I feew bedda now\" to the surprised nurse.) \n \nAnd? that's all folks. Wish us luck! \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Well, we finally got the luck... some 30 HOURS late.\u00a0 Much more hilarity ensued, more stories to tell... another night.\u00a0 \n \n Now? TO BED. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Saturday, May 21, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today's guest poster blogs as the Spectrummy Mummy at her eponymous blog   Spectrummy Mummy .\u00a0 As you can tell from the vowel choice, she is not American, but rather an Englishwoman, whose American Foreign Service Corp husband has been posted back stateside for the past few years.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n We about to lose her to another country soon, and I was thrilled to have had the chance  to meet her recently , however briefly. I can happily report back that she is even more lovely in person than on her blog (never a guaranteed thing, as many of us have found out at meet-ups and conferences).\u00a0  \n \n Spectrummy Mummy  is the mother of two young children, a four year old daughter,  Pudding , on the autism spectrum (currently holding an Aspergers diagnosis) and her little brother,  Cubby , just turned two, who, while not on the spectrum, has sensory issues. Of the  exact opposite type  as his sister.\u00a0 \n \n You can see it's a busy, complicated household. Add in the impending move overseas, and a mother could easily become overwhelmed. Yet somehow Spectrummy Mummy manages to keep her calm, clear focus on her children and  what they need;  manages to keep an open heart, a loving,  thankful perspective . \n \n And then she writes about it so beautifully, too. As you will see here, read ... \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Sibling Saplings  - by Spectrummy Mummy \n \nI was born and raised in the same place.\u00a0 My roots grew deep into the soil.\u00a0 I shared a childhood with my friends, and with our years of shared experiences, we remained friends as we became adults together.\u00a0 My chosen sisters. \n \nI wasn't close to my brothers growing up, but planted side by side, as we've grown older, our branches have intertwined.\u00a0 Though I live on a different continent, I feel that we're probably closer now than ever. \n \nIt is different for Third Culture Kids like mine.\u00a0 My little saplings are transplanted from one country to another every two or three years.\u00a0 Their roots don't get a chance to bury into the ground, but spread like vines across the world. \n \nMany Foreign Service children find it tough to make friends, and instead rely on the closeness of the sibling relationship-friendship with the only person to understand and share their life.\u00a0 It is not uncommon for such children to describe their brothers and sisters as best friends.\u00a0 That is how I imagined things would be for Pudding and Cubby. \n \nThe seeds were planted two years ago, when Cubby was born, but the signs of autism were emerging in Pudding.\u00a0 Pudding's sheltered little world was disturbed by this chaotic, screaming, routine-breaking, parent-snatching, attention-stealing, unpredictable bundle of need.\u00a0 From the very beginning, she was conflicted about his arrival in her life, resenting and pursuing him at once. \n \nSensory-seeking Pudding was too boisterous in her attentions, and the sensitive-avoider Cubby would scream whenever she came near.\u00a0 Pudding would lash out at him, or withdraw into herself.\u00a0 A relationship between the two of them seemed impossible. \n \nI would try to come up with games or sensory play that they might share in together.\u00a0 Inevitably, it led to fighting and tears.\u00a0 Everybody felt frustrated and miserable, myself included.\u00a0 Pretty pathetic for what was supposed to be fun for all.\u00a0 So I gave up. \n \nI'd concentrate on one child at a time.\u00a0 Finding something else to occupy the other, or making the most of Cubby's nap time, or the times that my husband was around so we could, at times, divide and enjoy our only children.\u00a0 I let go of my expectations of the kind of siblings they'd be, and let them just be. \n \nNow things are really starting to change.\u00a0 Since Cubby turned two, the developmental gap between the two of them is closing.\u00a0 They find each other funny, get into trouble together, blame each other for their mischief, and fight too, of course. \n \nBut mostly, they play; sometimes side-by-side, sometimes even together.\u00a0 I didn't need to teach them, they are figuring it out together, dare I say, like ordinary siblings.\u00a0 Ordinary being a word I don't tend to associate with either of them. \n \nI think of Cubby as a sort of hybrid plant.\u00a0 He has sensory processing differences, like his sister, but without the communication challenges.\u00a0 He can already tell us with his words the things that bother him, which Pudding would only show through her behavior at this age.\u00a0 The more I learn from and about one child, the more I can understand, and apply it to the other.  \n \nThey are still very young, of course.\u00a0 I don't know what will happen when Cubby's development surpasses that of his sister.\u00a0 I don't know if autism will create distance, or if moving will bring them closer.  \n \nAll I do know is that they are experiencing the world together in a way that nobody else is.\u00a0 They have a unique connection.\u00a0 The shoots of a budding relationship have appeared. \n \nIt is a connection that grows organically, and is cultivated by the two of them alone.\u00a0 When Cubby couldn't bear to be touched by his tactile-loving sister, she was the one who covered him in stickers, and he let her.\u00a0 Pudding struggled to do her yoga homework for occupational therapy, and Cubby was the one who motivated her. \n \nShe was the one he sought for a hug when he was distraught at his parents for a blood draw that went wrong.\u00a0 I just have to leave them to it, which is the part I find difficult. \n \nIn amongst the thicket of squabbling and demands, they are flourishing.\u00a0 They are still very young, and they have plenty of time to grow together.\u00a0 My hope is that if I can just stop trying to propagate a relationship between them, a beautiful togetherness will blossom.\u00a0 Perhaps it will be perennial. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n \n I\u00a0 am truly touched by this sweet, moving, lyrical post; the image of her children as plants growing side by side is one I will keep with me for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I am thrilled for  Spectrummy Mummy   that Pudding and Cubby are starting to  find their own way  into a relationship now. I can feel how they will grow together, how Cubby will support and  help his sister  (when he isn't busy annoying her, as little brothers are wont to do).  \n \n So now that you have gotten a little taste of  her   here, you will surely want to go over to  Spectrummy Mummy's blog   for more.  \n \n Be sure to read this lovely post about her awkward daughter transforming into a  Mermaid    in the water, this moving one about a day when everything was all too much and Spectrummy Mummy  dissolved into tears , or this insightful one about how  Behaviour Is\u00a0Communication  (note British spelling, she's  an Englishwoman  for sure). \n \n Also? Spectrummy Mummy  is yet another SNSS guest who can also be found posting at  Hopeful Parents .  Her day is the 19th of every month.\u00a0 And she  posts at the  SPD Blogger Network.

{"date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2011", "body": "\nWhat?  \n \nWhen of Liz of  a belle a bean and a chicago dog  came up  with the fun idea of posting photographs of ourselves from our senior year of High School, I'm sure she was thinking most moms would be coming  up with late 80's and early 90's style: big big hair, big sweaters, neon bright make-up and leggings. Well, ladies I'm a good bit  older than y'all. \n \nWhen Natalie from  Mommy of a Monster & Twins  was graduating high school in 1992 and rocking  her glamour style?\u00a0 I was a 32 year-old bride (my \"starter marriage\", not the  one that took & gave me my boys). \n \nMy high school senior year?  1977, baby! And while technically the hippie era was over by about 5  years and punk and disco were vying for the official \"youth style\"  title, my friends and I were nostalgic throwbacks. All artsy-fartsy, hippie-dippy, loosey-goosey, anti-materialistic. Also? Budding feminists. \n \nSo in my  box of senior year pictures (if I could find it) you would NOT see: make-up, prom pix  (didn't go, didn't believe in it - too bourgeois) big hair, big shoulders, or underwear  (didn't wear it, didn't believe in it  - too bourgeois). Sigh. (My kids better not follow in my footsteps.) \n \nWhat you would see: my natural curly hair (in that awkward stage  of being grown out), lots of loose cotton clothing from India via  Manhattan's  MacDougal Street , hairy legs & pits. \n \nThere aren't a lot of photos of me from that year, for, you see, I was a Photographer, to be found on the OTHER side of the camera, a Creator, no mere passive female object. (Did I mention I was starting to become a bit dogmatic and insufferable that year, in that way teenage zealots can be? Maybe just a tad.) \n \nWell, I actually managed to dig up three photos from my senior graduation day, none official (horrors, perish the thought!) but these few blurry, dark photos do prove that I did actually show up at my graduation, in spite it being a, you know, patriarchal, conservative institution and all. \n \nMaybe because there was a great graduation party that night. A girl's gotta have her priorities straight, after all.\u00a0  \n \nSo here is me circa June 1977, on the front lawn of my house with my parents, Graduation Day: \n \n \n \n Me & Mom, Graduation Day, June 1977 \n \n \n \u00a0Me & Dad, Graduation Day, June 1977 \n \n \n Me, Graduation Day, June 1977 \n \nAnd was I wearing a skirt as a strapless dress that day? Why yes, yes I believe I was. What? It was freaking hot in June. A skinny 16 year-old can get away with that shit, right? In 1977? You betcha! \n \nI was a Senior Feminist-Hippie-Hottie, for sure!  \n \n \n Come dig out your pictures and  link up , too! \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, May 19, 2011", "body": "\nE is for Ethan \n \nCould it be otherwise? \n \nI don't think so, for he is the big \"E\" in my life. \n \nMy firstborn. \n\u00a0  \nBy one minute. \n \n(Not that he ever lets me or his brother forget it.) \n \nSo, for once, this won't be all about autism, though it certainly informs and affects Ethan's life, presses in upon him.\u00a0 And he likes that not one bit, declaiming with wailing voice, \"Why did I have to have a twin brother with autism? Why can't I have a regular brother, like other people?\" \n \nAnd I have no answers for him, no easy solace, no words of comfort, other than to agree that it is indeed hard. But also this rejoinder: that we don't pick the families we are born into, that we all just have to play the hand we're dealt. \n \nAnd I hold him while he cries. And I remind him of the wonderful things about his brother, while making sure he knows it's OK for it not to be OK. \n \nHe is allowed to be mad at, even to hate and resent his brother. He is not allowed to be cruel to him, a line clearly drawn in the sand. \n \nEthan, the boy, will talk about his feelings. I hope this is something he can retain, that it will survive the rough pitch and tumble of male adolescence, let him grow into a man who will talk about his feelings openly with his closest friends, with the woman he loves. \n \nEthan, the boy, is passionate. He loves his friends, basketball, computers, and his toys/collections. \n \nHis current obsession? Gogo's Crazy Bones. Never heard of them? Then you're probably not living with a 7 to 9 year old right now. \n \nHe is of the age of changes. From one minute to the next, quick and quixotic, patterns long stable are shifting, tossed aside as he stretches his \"big boy\" muscles, both literal and figurative.  \n \n Conversations with Ethan  are still so often delightful (except when he is going on and on about Basketball players and game stats, and then I am looking for the knitting needles to puncture my eardrums with). \n \nI am still central to his life. And I hold my breath knowing that I will blink and he will be releasing my hand as we walk down the street, moving on into Tweendom; and then beyond.  \n \nLooking forward is a little scary; unknown adventures in parenting await. So let me look back for a moment, tell a story from the beginning: \n \nEthan was newborn, still in the hospital, maybe 2 days old. I was looking at him versus Jake, marveling at how vastly different they were from each other. Not quite night and day, but barely twin-like. \n \nJacob was a newborn straight out of central casting: a big-headed, Winston Churchill resembling, bald but for tonsure-like blond fringe, classic Gerber baby. \n \nEthan... not so much so. With his smaller head, fine features, visible and expressive eyebrows, scalp covered in dark but thin and sparse hair, including seeming sideburns (that led us to quip we should have named him Elvis instead) he resembled nothing so much as a miniature middle-aged balding guy. Seriously. But in a cute way. \n \nSo that day, when he was sleeping in my arms, I leaned down and whispered in his ear: \"I know your secret: you're not really a baby. In reality, you're a tiny forty year-old man, somehow magically transformed into an infant. But don't worry, I won't tell anyone, your secret is safe with me.\" \n \nAs soon as those words were out of my mouth - I swear this is true - still deep asleep, his mouth broke into a giant grin and his eyes popped wide open then rapidly rolled back and forth in a crazy fashion. \n \nThis went on for about 5 seconds, a near perfect rendition of a Groucho Marx comedic eye roll. Then his eyes snapped shut, his smile vanished and he was once again, simply, a sleeping newborn. \n \nBut we had shared a moment; and I knew, I knew. \n \nHere he is, then: \n \n \n Ethan, 5 minutes old \n And now: \n \n \n Ethan 8 years old \n Being the mother of Grouch Marx, reincarnate, isn't always easy; but it's never dull, often highly entertaining, and always deeply rewarding.  \n \nE is for Ethan... \n \nEnergetic, enthusiastic, enchanting, exhausting, extraordinary, eminently lovable. \n \nMy son. \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's   Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And now, of course,  \"E\" is one of my very favorite letters. Bet you can guess the others.  \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for... \u00a0 because I am eternally grateful for my son, Ethan.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "body": "\nAsked to picture my grandmother in her vital days, before the stroke that laid her low, creating the shadow who hovers dimly in the background of my later childhood years, this image comes: \n \nDunia, in her kitchen; yellowed light from an ancient ceiling fixture suffusing everything with a sulfuric glow, wiping her hands on her ever-present stained apron, a cigarette stuck to her lower lip, as if by glue and not mere spittle, the red edge of a pack of Pall Malls peeking up out of the apron's torn pocket. \n \nMoments before, her hands were furiously busy with wooden bowl and gleaming blade, chopping up the eggs, onions and chicken livers whose frying smell hangs close, blends with the cigarette smoke to create a thick haze in the kitchen: the smell of Grandma Dunia's house. (I have that chopper now, passed down the maternal line, its metal handle still retaining a hint of the red paint that once caught my eye, there in my grandmother's kitchen.) \n \nOutdoors the air is fresher though also strange, dank, loamy; her yard deeply shadowed by old tress, old bushes grown tall and feral. The lilac that stands by our own garage door comes from these here, my flower-loving mother happy to have a piece of home with her. But somehow, here, even the lilacs seem dour, moody, menacing as they tower over me, the smallest, palest thing around for miles.  \n \nThe old swing-set in the backyard is miraculously still standing, and I push the upstairs tenant's twin toddlers higher and higher to their squealing delight. At eight, I am the big girl, enjoy watching the little girls' flashing smiles, marvel at the many tiny pink-barretted braids it must have taken their mother hours to tame their hair into. \n \nI do not know this will be my last visit, that my grandmother's days of independence are swiftly numbered. I will miss spending time with these little girls, the only young, new things in this creaking old house.  \n \nFinally the gloaming completely engulfs the yard, a perfect background for the fireflies dancing delight. But it is time to head inside, the night being no time for young girls to linger outdoors in this now rough neighborhood. \n \nSmoke swirls through all the rooms of this house, as my grandmother lights one cigarette off the dying ember of the previous, a chain that will, by necessity, end the soon-coming day she keels over. \n \nMy mother, once a smoker too, now quit, waves her hand in front of her face to clear a small circle of air, hoping to breathe freely.\u00a0 She knows better then to ask her mother to stop smoking, in spite of the wheezing it now brings on. She knows better than to ask her mother for anything, empathy and generosity running decidedly short in this house. \n \nWe do not visit often, but when we do I marvel at how different it is here than in my home. Her ancient standard poodle skulks like a ghost from room to room, large and silent, its one eye turned milky strange, a frightening apparition to a child used to frisky cats. \n \nThe television is round at the edges, encased in a huge wooden cabinet, almost unrecognizable to me, but for the comfort it provides; the familiar images appearing therein reminding me that I still inhabit the same solid world, though the frame has shifted. \n \nWhile I watch TV, the grown-ups talk and talk. I do not try to listen in. When my grandmother tells a joke, though the telling is in English, the punch line is always in Yiddish, a language I do not understand. Even the laughter here bears a sharper edge, a tang, is not easy and light.\u00a0  \n \nWhen it comes time to leave, my mother comes to sit in the back seat with me, her lap my pillow, a sleepy girl's fondest wish. The car's windows are open, inviting night's fresh air to rush all around us, and we gratefully inhale. \n \nShe strokes my head, her hands ever gentle with me, as her mother's never were with her.\u00a0 And I drift off, knowing I will wake up in the arms of my strong father carrying me from the car, bringing me home. \n \n \n Curious about my unusual Grandmother? I have written about her before:  here , and  here . \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  The Red Dress Club .

{"date": "Saturday, May 28, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Our lovely guest today is a woman who needs no introduction (but, of course, I will be providing one anyway) for it is none other than Jess of  a Diary of a Mom . Jess has been blogging about autism longer than many of us, and, from the very beginning, she has been an amazing connector, a community builder, generous, reaching out to all.\u00a0 \n \n In 2009 Jess wrote,  Welcome to the Club,  a letter to help guide and ease the fears of parents whose children have been newly diagnosed on the autism spectrum. If you know anyone in this situation, please send them to this  important  post. \n \n Her most recent efforts? The \"light it up blue\" autism awareness campaign whose  letter to President Obama  got her an invite to The White House for their Autism Awareness Month community event, an extraordinary experience which she then (again, generously) shared with everyone via her blog. (You can read about this here, in parts  one ,  two ,  three ,  four ,  five ,  six , and  seven .) \n \n On the personal front, Jess is a mother to two daughters. Her youngest,  Brooke , is on the autism spectrum; Brooke's older sister,  Katie , is not. Katie is incredibly loving towards and helpful with her sister, and theirs is a beautiful story. \n \n Jess is exquisitely sensitive to the needs of her children, to a depth rarely seen. And to combine that exquisite sensitivity with such powerful, moving,  beautiful writing ; and add in her strength of will, her  community-building  character? Is the reason why Jess and her blog are beloved and read by so many. \n \n It is also the reason that while every other SNSS post so far has been original to this series, this one is not. Jess so wanted to participate in this series, as the relationship between her daughters is very important to her, but she just had too many commitments; it was impossible to add yet another plate to the many she is keeping spinning right now. So Jess asked if it would be OK to use a previous post of hers instead, as she has written often on this topic, near and dear to her heart.\u00a0 \n \n I felt that Jess and her place in our community was too important not to include here, so I have chosen this beautiful post about the relationship between her  daughters  (originally published in April, as  \"what she\u00a0needed\" ) to share with you today for Special Needs Sibling Saturdays. \n \n I am sure many of you reading this already know and read Jess, but for those who don't you are now in for a special treat... \n \n   \u00a0@@@@@@@\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \n  Sisters  - by Jess  \n \n \nShe showed me the picture covertly so that Brooke wouldn\u2019t see it. \n \n\u201cLook, Mama, I drew Brooke as Rapunzel in the tower and that\u2019s me,  climbing up her long hair to come save her! Don\u2019t you think she\u2019ll love  it?\u201d \n \nKatie had been working on the picture for nearly half an hour before  she finally decided that it was done. She presented it to Brooke with a  flourish. \n \n\u201cLook, Brooke,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cI made this just for you.\u201d \n \nBrooke took the paper from her and without so much as a glance handed it to me. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry.\u201d \n \nBrooke and I had a chat. Ultimately, the best we could do was a parroted, \u201cThank you, Katie. That was very nice of you.\u201d \n \nKatie was crushed. \n \nLater that day, Katie and our sitter, Julie had a special outing to  the mall. For her birthday, Julie had gotten her a gift card to her  favorite shop and had promised that they would hit the mall together to  do some shopping. Katie couldn\u2019t wait. \n \nShe\u2019s been begging for a trip to  the mall alone with a friend.  (Not quite there yet, kiddo.)  So  the half-step toward independence meant the world to her. She had packed  up her gift card and tucked her very own money into the wallet in her  very grown-up purse. \n \nThey\u2019d spent hours at the mall. \n \nShe came home carrying a shopping bag, flush with excitement. She  pulled me in close for a secret. \u201cMama,\u201d she said. \u201cI got Brooke the  best present EVER! She\u2019s going to LOVE it! You know how she keeps saying  she wants earrings just like me but we know that wouldn\u2019t really work  cause she\u2019d try to pull them out cause they\u2019d hurt? Well, I got her  MAGNETIC earrings! Isn\u2019t that the BEST? I\u2019m sooooo excited!!! OK,  shhhhh! Don\u2019t tell her. I can\u2019t wait to see how happy she is when she  sees them.\u201d \n \nShe reached into her shopping bag and pulled out a small, hot pink  gift bag. She\u2019d even thought to get a gift bag in her sister\u2019s favorite  color. \u201cBrooke!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI got you a present at the mall!\u201d \n \nHer sister looked up from her drawing. \n \n\u201cYou did?\u201d \n \n\u201cI did. Want to see what I got you?\u201d \n \nKatie was beside herself. She couldn\u2019t wait to see her sister\u2019s reaction. \n \nBrooke pulled the earrings out of the bag, set them on the table and  went back to her drawing. \u201cI don\u2019t want them,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry.\u201d \n \nKatie tried to explain. Perhaps she didn\u2019t know what they were. Maybe  she just didn\u2019t understand. \u201cBrooke, you can be just like Katie. See,  they\u2019re earrings, like mine. Look, Brooke, this is what you do with them  ..\u201d \n \nBrooke let out a sharp shriek, then yelled, \u201cI DON\u2019T WANT THEM. SORRY!\u201d \n \nThe dam broke. Katie couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I talked to Brooke  briefly. Said the same things I\u2019d said earlier. Told her we\u2019d talk about  it again later. \n \nKatie and I walked together into the kitchen, carrying the cast-off  bag. I peeked inside. There were two other pairs of earrings in the bag  that Brooke hadn\u2019t even seen. I turned them over \u2013 $5.95 each. On her  big trip to the mall, my girl had spent eighteen dollars of her OWN  money on something she thought her sister would love. To no avail.  Eighteen dollars. \n \nI held my girl as she let it all out, the words tumbling over each  other as she sobbed. \u201cI just wish that there was a shot or a pill or  something, Mama. Something, anything that Brooke could take that would  make her autism just go away. I\u2019m just so tired of it. I just wish I had  a typical sister. I\u2019ve just been trying so hard. I just want to show  her that I love her but nothing\u2019s working. Nothing.\u201d \n \nI said the right things. I did. I told her that she is the best  sister that I ever could have imagined. I told her that she doesn\u2019t  always have to be, I told her that Brooke knows how much she loves her \u2013  that it would be impossible for her not to. I told her that she doesn\u2019t  always have the ability to show that. And above all, I told her that I  know how much that hurts. \n \nI told her that I understood. That from the bottom of my heart, I  understood. I told her that Brooke might very likely come back to the  earrings later. It had been a long day and she just might not be able to  handle something new. But I knew that wasn\u2019t the point anymore.  When  there was nothing more to say, I held her and let her cry. \n \nLast night, after  presenting the Autism Awareness mural to the mayor ,  we went out to dinner at a local mall. During dinner, Brooke needed a  walk. \u201cOoh, Mama. May I take her, please?\u201d Katie begged, just like she  always does. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be responsible!\u201d \n \nWe\u2019d never agreed before, but the mall was quiet and it seemed like a  good opportunity for a first run. Brooke resisted. \u201cNo, Mama would.\u201d \n \nWith some cajoling, she agreed to walk with her sister. \n \nWe gave them strict parameters and then watched them walk away. Two  minutes in, Luau said, \u201cYou going or me?\u201d I got up and headed in the  same direction. \n \nBy the time I reached them, they were headed back toward me, walking  arm in arm. Periodically, Brooke would spin out, then come back and  re-attach herself to her sister. Each and every time she came back,  Katie\u2019s arms were open. \n \nBrooke stopped walking in front of the entrance to a shop. I wondered  if she was going to go in. Instead, she leaned into her sister and  hugged Katie for all she was worth. Katie hugged her back, grinning from  ear to ear. I felt like a voyeur as I feverishly snapped a picture with  my phone. \n \nThey began to walk again, slowly, lazily. Katie kissed her sister\u2019s head and said, \u201cThanks, Brooke, I needed that.\u201d \n \nAnd her Mama thought, \u201cMe too, baby. Me too.\u201d \n \n \u00a0@@@@@@@\u00a0\u00a0  \n As you can see from what have just read,  Jess is an \"Autism Mom\" extraordinaire.\u00a0  I do not say this lightly: I have never yet met a parent more aware  of exactly who each of her children are, and what they specifically need  as Jess. She is an inspiration and a role model for me, truly. \u00a0 \n \n And now? You really must go back to Jess's blog,  a Diary of a Mom , and read more. She doesn't have a \"best of\" page, but that's OK because you can click on any month of her archives and just start reading and you will be astounded. But let me point you to a few specific posts, anyway:\u00a0    \n \n For more about the relationship between her girls, these posts,  from last October's \"Spotlight on Siblings\" week are wonderful: this pair about another sibling reaching out to Katie,  big sister as little\u00a0sister  and  little sister becomes big\u00a0sister , are extraordinary. Also  this one , and  this one  are truly touching. \n \n  And then, because telling her own family's story is not enough, here is a great post about how to help YOUR children:  what siblings would like parents and service providers to\u00a0know.   \n \n Whatever she is writing about, Jess so honestly and beautifully shares her  love , her  fears , her  joys  and  her  heartbreaks.  Go, read! (And have a box of Kleenex handy, you'll need it.) \n \n And of course, Jess  is yet another SNSS guest who can also be found posting at  Hopeful Parents .

{"date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "body": "\n Searching for a little levity today, I thought I would list some of the web searches that have, rightly or wrongly,  driven people to my blog. Thank you, Google, for this: \n \n \"pokemon with a generalized anxiety disorder \" (guilty as charged) \n \n \"allie brosh and stalking \" (Just for the record, let me make this clear... I have NEVER stalked  Allie Brosh . In fact, *she* stalks me. Yeah. Right. OK, well, maybe just a little stalking... but only cyber-) \n \n \"beyblade cake\"  (probably this July, that's what  I'll be making ) \n \n \"sandwich generation angst\"  (Oh, yeah, we got that! Also? On first page for this one on Google Search. YAY!) \n \n \"jokes about the sandwich generation\"  (a few, if you consider my quips about my Dad  about to lose his toes  \"jokes.\" I'm generally funnier about my kids.) \n \n \"jacob is a poopy head \" (No, no, Jacob sings \"Ethan is a poopyhead!\" and \" Twinkle, twinkle, little poopyhead .\" Can't they get anything right?) \n \n \"bologna and autism \" (Nothing to add to this. Except, yes, Jacob does eat bologna. Organic turkey bologna. I don't *think* it has anything to do with his autism.) \n \n \"everyday is autism awareness day in my world\"  (mine, too!) \n \n \"good sandwich based on gems\"  (Hope they weren't too disappointed. Guessing my \" Blog Gems \" post triggered this. Also?\u00a0 Wouldn't that be a bit too... crunchy?) \n \n \"autism mom blog\"  (Biggest \"Duh\" on the planet) \n \n \"confessions from the sandwich generation\"  (Not so much confessing as whining, bitching and moaning, but I'll take it.) \n \n \"bologna odor in walls\"  (Guessing if they truly needed help with that they didn't stay long. Also? Eeeeew!) \n \n \"origin of because y is a crooked letter\"  (Yeah, I wrote  a post about that,  my Grandmother's favorite saying. Well, actually it's a toss-up between that and \"put your tuchis on the table\") \n \n \"do autistic children like chuck e cheese\"  (Mine does, but he is a sensory seeker. But for a sensory avoider? Let's put it this way... the first time we walked into a Chuck E Cheese my husband turned to me and said: \"This is where we'll go when we die if we've been VERY, VERY bad.\" And he's not even autistic, just a man who likes a bit of calm and quiet.) \n \n \"spring is here and i can't wait for summer get along with friends\"  (good luck with THAT) \n \n \"how to include typical siblings in special needs childrens lives\"  (When you come up with the answer, would you please come back and share it with me?) \n \n \"ironman childrens regalia\"  (yes, Jake has  gone there ) \n \n \"sweaty girls\"  (needless to say this person was very disappointed) \n \n \"coppertone\"  (Yup, wrote  one on that !) \n \n \"coppertone ass\"  (Nope, did NOT write one on THAT!)  \n \n \"autism mom\"  (Me, me, me, me!) \n \n \"why different pronunciation of bologna city and meat\" (You know I've been wondering a bit about that myself, but actually don't really care as long as you pronounce MY blog name right.) \n \n \"momsomnia\"  (Don't think I was the first one to coin it, but I amused myself when I  came up with this word . Became less amusing as I found need to use it a lot.) \n \n \"thoughts for my son\"  (every day in every way) \n \n \"want to get direction in my life\"  (Oh, man, so do I, so do I. Sorry I'm not gonna be much help here.) \n \n \"world laughter day parties\"  (I LOVE this. Wish I were at one.) \n \n \"not allowed to be sick\"  (definition of  a Mom ) \n \n \"my parents are getting old\"  (In my case? Not so much the getting, more the \"are\" - or \"were\" in the case of my Dad.) \n \n \"life with jake, autism blog\"  (Yes, that's us. Also? There are a LOT of Jakes out there, so maybe we weren't the one you were looking for, but I hope you pulled up a chair and stayed a while anyway.) \n \n \"sibling rivalry good or bad\"  (Yes.) \n \n\"special needs parents, parallel lives\"  (Well, there's -unfortunately- a lot of us out there. Don't know if you found your parallels here, but hope you found something relatable.) \n \n \"ethan sharer\"  (Sometimes. Others it's Ethan: hoarder, but we're working on that.) \n \n \"television is a drug\"  (They were probably looking for the video of my friend Todd Alcott's monologue, but since I embedded that in  my post , they got the 2 for 1 deal.)\u00a0   \n \n \"autism growing older\"  (It sure is getting old around these parts. Or maybe they meant autistic kids getting older. Wrote  about that , too.) \n \n \"homework wars\"  (Been there,  done that . Both boys. Wish we weren't in the trenches.) \n \n \"mayday mayday\"  (Yep, I  put out that call  a few weeks ago. Of course if they were really on a ship going down, my post wouldn't have been much help to them. Of course if they were really on a ship going down why would they be wasting time Googling shit, anyway?) \n \n \"he really needed to pee\"  (Did I mentions I have boys? Boys who often get too distracted to... take care of business in a timely fashion, and so aim is not their top priority when doing so? Have I mentioned that in spite of spending at least a half hour each day cleaning around our ONE toilet, it STILL usually smells like a Parisian alley in our ONE bathroom?) \n \n \"autistic little boys love their moms\"  (That they surely do, yes!) \n \nAnd? That's all folks! \n \nBut also (because when do I ever really shut up that easy) I want to give credit where credit is due.. . \n \nI had been mulling over doing a post like this for a while, and had already gathered quite a few of the more interesting search terms people had googled to find me when Spectrummy Mummy wrote HER post about the same, \" Googled .\"  \n \nShe inspired me to get this damn post finished and up. Also? Her post is fun and worth the read too, so go over and do so. \n \nPlus? Come closer, let me tell you a secret...\u00a0  she's my SNSS guest poster this upcoming Saturday.\u00a0  So now you are in the know.

{"date": "Sunday, May 15, 2011", "body": "\n Been Sunday for many hours now and I've been trying to drum up two brain cells to rub together to write my SOC Sunday post. Finally: one boy is asleep and the other is enthralled by the Basketball game. There is food in my stomach and I *think* I may be able to locate my brain if I try really, really hard. Here goes....\u00a0  \n \n @@@@@@@ \nSorry folks, I know this is not going to be the world's most pleasant stream of consciousness post when the phrase that pops right into my head as soon as I sit down to write is: \n \n\"Cumulative stress\" \n \nBecause that's my theme song these days. As in: when asked how I am and I give a lukewarm \"OK, I guess\" and then am pressed for details and there's no one thing I can name, no BAD EVENT, it's just...\"cumulative stress.\"  \n \nAs in: I just tweeted \"Cumulative stress has just worn me down to a nubbin.\" \n \nAs in: 8 years of living with autism = 8 years of cumulative stress.  \n \nAnd yes, I got away last weekend and it was lovely but it was 2 and a half days. and even though I was away? I was still the one in charge of my kids - I got 10 calls a day, had to track down a playdate connection, had to keep popping out of my seminar to make sure that my babysitter\u00a0 and my friend's babysitter had figured out how to hook up. \n \nHad to plan all the meals and spend hours before I left doing Jake's vitamin pours, so while my body had a break, my brain was still at least a little bit hooked in to the family the whole time. \n \nAnd so there is no such thing as a 100% break for me, because at eight and a half years old, Jacob is still, essentially, a 3 year old. He must be watched and cared for; cannot yet explain what he wants and doesn't want clearly enough, cannot advocate for himself effectively in any meaningful way. \n \nEthan? I could walk away from for a whole weekend and beside two or three \"I love you\" phone calls, i know he'll be fine. I had set up playdates, including a sleepover. I knew he would inform his Dad\u00a0 or whoever else was looking out for him at that moment what and when he eats, etc. etc. \n \nBut Jacob? Still needs the tending and THINKING FOR a young child needs. and 8 and a half years of that has... worn me down to a nubbin. \n \nI feel i can;t think clearly, I know my mind is running more circularly than it should. I need a REAL break, a complete vacation. \n \nI want my old brain back, the sharp one I had before I had children, before I turned 50 and stopped sleeping. \n \nsorry for my umpteenth whiny rant. But that's the consciousness that streams forth from me right now. \n \nHope your weekend was sunnier. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n I originally wanted to call this post \"Attempting to pull my head out of my own ass\" but figured the good-taste police would come get me. And then I was going to call it \"Have you Seen My Brain?\" but that was just too cute. So then I just said \"screw it\" to the witty title search, went with the basics. \n \nAlso I have a  FUNNY POST  all set to go up tomorrow. Really. I promise it won't be all whiny rants, so come back tomorrow, don't give up on me, OK?  \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Saturday, May 14, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Our guest blogger today at  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays,  the OTHER Julia Roberts, has challenges few of us could imagine, no less face with the grace and tenacity that she has. \n \n Julia's children   are  BOTH   affected by  the same rare genetic disorder ( ARPKD ), and her  blog,  Kidneys and Eyes,  is named for the main physical manifestations of their condition.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Julia has been blogging for much longer than most, documenting her  son's  and  daughter's  many struggles, from the big things like their  kidney transplants  to the small day-to-day challenges of life with immunosuppression, which  can turn big  at a moment's notice. \n \n Besides this shared  physical disability , their lives were further complicated when her son developed mental health troubles that have deeply impacted his relationship with his sister, and caused Julia no small number of sleepless nights.  \n \n Julia is also, like the rest of us,  just a mom,  loving her family and trying to keep them safe and happy.   That in her case this task is Herculean, Sisyphean? Well, she is certainly the right mom for the job.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n But why take my word for it, read her own lovely words here: \n \n @@@@@@@  \n Special Needs Squared  \u2013 by Julia Roberts \n \nWhen my son was nearly 3 and his sister was almost born into our family I wrote this long, heartfelt letter to him that our lives were about to change but that I loved my alone time with him until that point.  \n \nTears streaming down my face. It was very dramatic. \n \nI look back at that time and laugh a little bit. I didn\u2019t know at the time that welcoming a girl into our family was the least of our worries.  \n \nTwo days after she was born she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease and three months later he was diagnosed with the same disease. In turn, she was diagnosed with the rare vision disorder we\u2019d known he\u2019d had since he was 12 months old causing low muscle tone and developmental delays.  \n \nBefore I knew it, I was hauling them to 13+ therapy appointments a week, multiple doctors visits and ultrasounds and I began holding them down for the first of hundreds of blood draws. I refer to those first 6 months as \u201cThe Fog\u201d because I don\u2019t remember how we had our regular needs met as a family of four.  \n \nOur son is what some call strong willed, impulsive, energetic and for a time he was also aggressive and mean. We worked with a behaviorist for years; one who said our son was one of his \u201chardest\u201d cases.  \n \nI found that oddly comforting; I wasn\u2019t crazy for thinking he was hard to parent. He needed constant monitoring, he had behavior programs that needed frequent tweaking, and we had to work closely with his school on a behavior plan included in his IEP.  \n \nDuring this time, our challenging son went into kidney failure, started dialysis, had multiple invasive procedures including a botched surgery (he was awake but couldn\u2019t move) and finally a kidney transplant a month after his 8th birthday.  \n \nTransplant medication (I believe) and PTSD brought on\u00a0 complete shut down and within a year he was clinically depressed, suicidal and lashing out at anything and everything but especially his sister who was facing her own battle with kidney failure.  \n \nShe was vulnerable and convenient.\u00a0  \n \nManaging their relationship was a constant struggle and all of my energy went into that and keeping him alive. I have clear memories of checking on him at night and wondering if he\u2019d awoken to somehow hang himself off the side of his loft bed.  \n \nAs our daughter slept in the next room, I was relieved her needs weren\u2019t as consuming; which is a horrible thought when you are talking about your daughter\u2019s kidney transplant.  \n \nWhile we were trying to manage the needs of her physical demise we were balancing his ever-increasing mental health needs. He particularly liked her to think he was going to hit her or push her and when she reacted loudly, would have the honest answer of \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d  \n \nShe became so conditioned to his threats that she could barely operate in our family without thinking he was going to harm her. For over a year, they couldn\u2019t be left alone while he was in therapy, on suicide watch and sinking deeper into despair.  \n \nMeanwhile, our daughter\u2019s kidney transplant and local and national media attention just brought out more PTSD symptoms in him.\u00a0  \n \nThree months after her kidney transplant, we found ourselves at a  psychiatric hospital with him  where I am happy to say we found the right doctor \u2013 one that wanted him to function in the world the best way medication would allow. A doctor who wasn\u2019t afraid to treat a child already on several kidney-saving drugs.  \n \nFinally, now, a year and a half later my kids are typical siblings. She doesn\u2019t feel like he is going to kill her and he is annoyed by more typical things besides her just being present; typical sibling irritants.  \n \nI hate feeling like I didn\u2019t support her as much as I could have through her kidney transplant because of his needs. I reasoned she was emotionally more stable and while I tried to avoid it, I knew at the time she was the sacrificial lamb of the family because something had to give.  \n \nI harbor a lot of guilt about that still and feel like I am trying to make it up to her with extra attention even 18 months after her surgery and recovery.  \n \nWhile I do try to be thankful for each day; I can\u2019t help feel like another crisis is just around the corner because with disease, delays and mental health issues, that is just how it is for our family.  \n \nI hope because they share the same disease and some of the same struggles that one day they will find comfort through their shared experiences.  \n \nI will always hope their sibship grows. \n \n \u00a0@@@@@@@\u00a0 \n I am rarely speechless, but Julia's story leaves me so. To have children so profoundly challenged both physically and emotionally requires a mother of super-human proportions, and that Julia is.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n What they have been through as a family is nearly unimaginable to me, and yet, it is merely their story, and Julia is simply doing what she needs to do to keep her children alive and well. \n \n Thank you,  Julia, for sharing your family's amazing story with us. \n \nSo now that you have gotten a little of Julia here, you will want to go over to  Kidneys and Eyes  for more. She has been blogging for so long, there's just so much terrific stuff over there.\u00a0 \n \n Be sure to read this moving post about Julia's  nightly fears , this one about her son's finally being able to  feel his feelings , and this lovely one about her daughter's  success at swinging .   \n \n Taking care of her family is a full time job, one that anyone could feel proud of doing, and stop at that. But amazingly, Julia does so much more.\u00a0 \n \n Not only does Julia  thoughtfully advocate  for all special needs children on her own blog, she has also started an organization and website specifically for this:  Support for Special Needs . \n \n This is a WONDERFUL community that you should absolutely join if you are a parent of a child(ren) with special needs. And if you are going to BlogHer11, you should join their  SN at BlogHer  group, so we can find each other there, amid the madness. \n \nFinally, definitely go follow Julia on  Twitter , where she is both wise and funny. You can also follow  Support for Special Needs on    Twitter ,  and \"like\" them on  Facebook .\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Thank you, Julia, for being you and for all that you do for the Special Needs community. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

A weekend away from them. Really. My first actual break in eight and a half years. \n \n(Remember what happened  the LAST time  I tried to get away for a weekend?) \n \nSo I went to Bloggy Boot Camp in Boston (to you civilians, that's a women bloggers conference run by the wonderful  SITS Girls ) and had a great time, learned a ton. \n \nI am still processing it all, and not ready to write about the conference content in detail here yet, but let's just say it was an enjoyable success both educationally and socially. \n \nI met, ate good food, and drank good wine with many marvelous women there, some of whom I actually already knew IRL, some of whom I had known only in the e-space and was confirming they were actual corporeal beings, and some of whom were completely new connections. \n \nAt about 150 people (148 women and 2 men, I think) the conference was just the right size, not too overwhelming (though I also rather enjoyed the massive  BlogHer conference  last summer, too, it was just a different type of experience). \n \nI left Friday morning, and Ethan sent me off in style, requesting and giving me a \"Hug that will last three days!\" as I bade him goodbye in the schoolyard at drop-off.  \n \nI drove up from New York with two lovely blog buddies (Holly, the  Culture Mom  and  La Mere Joie ) I had hung out with a little bit before, but happily got a chance to talk to and get to know in further depth on the five hour trip (four driving, one in a Connecticut diner -- we're all Jewish gals, we don't go too long without a feed and caffeination break). \n \nI spent the first night at the conference hotel with a great roomie, another terrific NY area blogger I had been wanting more face time with, Anna from  Random Handprints . \n \nThen after a wonderful, chock filled conference -- including sneaking out to spend a WAY too short 45 minutes at the hotel bar with two sister Autism bloggers I had been dying to meet IRL who were not at the conference: Bostonian Alysia of  Try Defying Gravity  and the  Spectrummy Mummy\u00a0  (who had flown up from the DC area for the day) -- I was off to Lowell to spend the night with my  cousin Annette and her lovely family . \n \nI was catching an 8 PM train to Lowell. North Station is right under the Boston Garden, where the Celtics play. There was a Celtics game that night. At 8. And there had been a Red Sox game that afternoon. \n \nI was given plenty of examples to help me remember why they call (a certain type of testosterone-and-beer fueled) Boston sports fans \"Massholes.\" \n \nMy time in Lowell? Pure family-bonding delight. \n \nAnd my twelve year old, about-to-be-Bat Mitzvahed niece? Made us a wonderful Mother's Day breakfast including pancakes and home-made strawberry coulis. She is thinking of starting her own foodie blog and I am greatly encouraging her. (Hear that, Greta? Do it!) \n \nThe interesting thing about the weekend? I spent a significant portion of it traveling. I took a cab to the commuter train to the 'burbs to meet my ride up. Then the mini-van drive to Boston. \n \nFrom Boston it was a cab to the commuter-rail train to Lowell, where I was picked up by my cousin's husband and driven to their house. Then back to the Lowell train station (Twice! I missed my first train by 2 minutes, don't ask!) for a commuter-rail ride back to Boston. \n \nAnd a cab ride from Boston's North Station to South Station where I caught my Peter Pan bus home with 2 minutes to spare. (Yes, bus, because $25 vs. $128 for Amtrak? No contest.) And then NYC subway back to the Upper West Side. \n \nAnd I discovered: when traveling alone, without the kids, I am just Miss Laid-back-whatever-pants these days. Hours upon hours on the road, delays, traffic, detours, missed connections... ho, hum, no adrenaline necessary. \n \nBecause I can eat or read or nap or noodle around on my Droid to my heart's content with no one to bother me, thinking about no one but myself. \n \nAnd THAT is a real vacation for me. \n \nSo thanks, family, for that amazing Mother's Day gift. And for all the kisses and hugs I received upon my return at bedtime Sunday night. \n \nI hope you all had a lovely one, too! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, May 7, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n What can I possibly say about Adrienne, today's   Special Needs Sibling Saturdays  guest poster that would  adequately  communicate the depths of my feelings towards her? \n \n Adrienne holds a very special place in my heart, so much so that I am actually a bit anxious about this intro, wanting to be very, very sure that I \"get it right,\" introduce Adrienne to you properly, so that you will all love her as much as I do (silly me).  \n \n As you may have figured out, Adrienne is one of my early, important bloging connections, a bloggy mentor to me. I don't even remember what post brought me to her blog,  No Points for Style , because once there, I started to read everything, backwards and forwards. \n \n (I believe it might have been this amazing post about the stigma of mental illness:  If the Diagnosis Was Cancer\u2026 ) \n \n Whatever post it was, it stopped me in my tracks, as did the rest of Adrienne's blog, her life story brimming full of challenges, a heavier load than any one person should have to carry in two lifetimes, let alone one. \n \n Adrienne has four children, the youngest of whom has special needs. Until now, all my SNSS guest bloggers have had children on the autism spectrum, but Adrienne's son Carter's issues run both deeper and wider than that. His  challenges are profound , and his care can be  all consuming .  \n \n And yet, in spite of these heavy weights? Her words take flight, soar; dive deep, tunnel into your soul; expand in your mind, open up universes. \n \n There is so much I want to tell you about Adrienne, I could just go on and on, but I really shouldn't do that because her own words are so beautiful and my yakking away is keeping you from them.  And they're right here... so read... \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Driving In the Wrong Direction  \u2013 by Adrienne Jones  \n \nI'd like to think that, if I'd known then what I know now, things would be different. \n \nThat, though, is an exercise in futility. Like my friend used to tell me, start putting wishes in one hand and shit in the other and see which hand fills up faster. \n \nNo doubt about it; regret is poison, but sometimes in the wee hours, I'm drawn to those dangerous thoughts and I spend hours second-guessing everything I've done in the past 8 and 1/2 years. \n \nWhen Carter was born in 2002, my husband Brian and I already had three children. Jacob and Abbie, 8 and 6 at the time, are my kids from my first marriage. Spencer, who turned 5 the day before Carter was born, is my stepson. \n \nMarried just 2 years at the time, Brian and I and our kids had only just begun to feel a little like a family - to define all our new relationships and navigate the complex life of a step-family. \n \nAnd then I gave birth to 8 pounds, 4 ounces of red-headed, caterwauling, wakeful baby. He was a crisis in footie pajamas. He cried so much (many, many hours at a time) and so vigorously (purple in the face and veins popping out all over his head and neck) that Brian and I rushed him to the ER at least 4 times during his first year because we were convinced that he must be in excruciating pain, perhaps even dying. \n \nOur other kids? At first, I made dinner and we ate it while Carter screamed. Then I started preparing scrambled eggs or sandwiches. Eventually, I sent Brian out for a sack of burgers or gave everyone a bowl of cereal. \n \nAt first, they tried very hard to talk to me, pushing through Carter's wall of sound and shouting to be heard. Then, they stopped telling me anything but the essentials. Finally, they gave up altogether. \n \nAt first, I was relieved that the kids had their other parents' homes to go to, where they could get the adult attention they needed and enjoy a break from the chaos at our house. Then, they started to spend more and more time at their other homes, and finally, in 2009, Jacob and Abbie moved to their dad's house permanently. \n \nWhat I didn't know in the beginning - what I couldn't have known - was that life with Carter was never going to calm down. Carter got older and gathered diagnoses like a snowball rolling downhill (an alphabet soup of developmental, social, and emotional issues), and my mental health frayed (and not just around the edges), and just when we would feel like we were at the very end of our endurance, things would suddenly get worse. \n \nBy the time I understood that we weren't dealing with a time-limited crisis but a lifetime of disability and that everything about our lives would have to change if we hoped to get Carter to adulthood, my older kids were gone. Their resentments, their feelings of abandonment, their pain, are all too deep for me to be able to repair our relationships in the short-term. \n \nOur relationships won't be repaired until they decide that it's what they want. \n \nWorse than my own pain is the rejection Carter has experienced. He adores, idolizes, and loves his siblings and just as Jacob and Abbie feel rejected and abandoned by me, Carter feels rejected and abandoned by them. \n \nSee how complicated things get? \n \nI want to wrap this up with a pretty yellow bow, but I haven't got one. Raising a child with a serious mental illness is sort of like driving a car on the freeway going in the wrong direction - no matter how much I want to do things right, there's no time for anything except keeping everyone alive. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Adrienne, thank you for this beautiful post. I remember when I first read your words about your truncated hopes for Carter, that for you just keeping him alive to become an adult would be a triumph, and how my heart wept for you.\u00a0 \n \n I knew your story here would be probably more intense, brutal, than many of the others told, but one I, and we all, needed to hear.\u00a0 \n \n Thank you from the bottom of my heart for opening yourself up once more and bringing your anguish to my table. My respect and admiration for you knows no bounds; I am truly grateful for the gift you have given us with your words.\u00a0 \u00a0  \n \n And, readers? The difficulty of living with, loving and caring for a child with a severe mental illness?  Watching your child dissolve into a self- and other-injuring   hallucinatory state ? Hearing that your child is deeply disturbed,  often psychotic, and will need to be on psychiatric medication for the rest of his life? Are things I can barely fathom. But all this Adrienne has  faced, and  written about,  time and  again , so movingly. \n \n When I first discovered Adrienne I believe I spent a few nights up way too late, pouring over her archive, reading post after beautiful post.\u00a0 There is so much there, so wide, so deep. I've linked to no small number of posts already, but let me just point out a few more, truly near and dear to my heart...  \n \n A wrenchingly intense post about how there are no  Disposable People ... about her deep love for her  Beautiful Boy , Carter... about another  Disposable Boy , and how society failed him...  about her deep love of her oldest son and daughter and the  Pain that Runs Through (her) Veins  around losing them.  \n \n Besides her children, two other important topics for Adrienne are  bullying  and  suicide , because she has greatly suffered from, and been shaped by the occurrence of both in her life.\u00a0  \n \n I know Adrienne isn't really fearless, that she's actually human  sized. But her writing IS fearless, brave and honest and  crack-open-your-chest-cavity-and-wrench-your-beating-heart-out real.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n And she also highly values that searing honesty in others, bestowing her  \"No Points for Style Bad Ass Blogger Award\"   to folks for bloggish bad-assery.\u00a0 (In the spirit of full disclosure, I  must admit I have been the recipient of said award for my post  \"O Is for Oxygen.\" ) \n \n But most of all, Adrienne is simply a flat-out  amazing writer . She can be lyrical, touching. And on other days?  Piss-your-pants funny . So go, read... ANYTHING there. It's all good. Better than good. Wonderful.\u00a0  \n \u00a0  \n And, if that weren't enough? Adrienne, like quite a number of other SNSS guests (and me, too) can also be found posting monthly at  Hopeful Parents. \n \u00a0  \n Finally, you should absolutely follow her on  Twitter \u00a0 and go \"like\" her on  Facebook . Whew! \n \n And did I mention? I love you, Adrienne. Thank you.  \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, May 5, 2011", "body": "\nBet that surprised you! \n \nWere you expecting something like... Catharsis?\u00a0 Or how about Chocolate?  \n \nBecause I was really thinking about those two the other day, when I quipped with a friend of mine who also does Alphabe-Thursdays that I was deciding between Catharsis and Chocolate for my \"C\" word, and what a decidedly different post each of those would yield.  \n \nBut would it really be that different? They are both coping mechanisms for me, after all, and right now I am working hard, paddling as fast as I can to keep my head above water, not head straight into the flesh-rending rapids without a paddle. (I know I've mixed my metaphors, that shit creek doesn't have white-water, but I don't care, so shut up.) \n \nBut back to Chewy for a minute... why him? (Besides the fact that this means I'm now coming out of the closet as a total Sci-Fi geek girl, that is.) Well, it's a kind of stream-of-consciousness answer, and even though it's not Sunday, I'm still going to go with it.  \n \nThis morning while getting ready to slog out into the day, I was thinking about Ethan and how to talk to him about some of his... less than lovely behaviors that have been cropping up lately.  \n \nI was wondering if it was appropriate to start using that old pithy chestnut of a (surprisingly accurate) clich\u00e9: \"Would you rather be right or happy?\" Because these days he's leaning heavily towards the \"right\" answer; which is, of course, the WRONG answer. \n \nPlaying basketball with his friends, if their interpretation of the rules is different than his? He just loses it, melts down, accuses them of cheating, insists they do it HIS way, which is of course the right way.  \n \nAnd have I mentioned this is my non-autistic, supposedly \"typical\" kid? Yeah, it's like that these days.  \n \nBut anyway, I was thinking about pointing out that if he is right all the time, that means his friends have to be wrong all the time, and if he makes them feel that way, are they going to want to play with him much?  \n \nAnd then moving on to the \"put yourself in someone else's shoes\" concept. Would he want to play with someone who had to win all the time? No, because that meant he would have to lose all the time.  \n \nSo maybe, for the sake of friendship? He should let his friends win the argument sometimes, play by their rules, let things go their way. For the sake of friendship, right?  \n \nAnd as the words \u201clet them win\u201d swirled around in my brain, they found an echo\u2026 I heard\u00a0 C-3PO\u2019s voice saying \"I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookie win.\"  \n \nNow I understand that in this instance it was to keep R2D2 from being taken apart, not for friendship's sake, but still the concept of throwing a game from time to time is in there, right?  \n \nAnd then of course, I started to think about Star Wars, classic version - it being the day after 5/4... May the Forth... Star Wars day... \"May the Forth be with you.\" (Total Nerd Flag flying now.) \n \nAnd then it dawned on me that the Wookie's name is... Chewbacca... a \"C\" word.  \n \nSo maybe I didn't have to choose between Chocolate and Catharsis after all, maybe I could have both (and a Wookie, too). \n \nAnd so I chose Chewbacca today, because my blog has been getting a wee bit heavy lately. (Autism, you know?) \n \nBut maybe that's because I use my blog for catharsis, so I can lighten up in my life.  \n \nAnd really, I would rather have catharsis on my blog and chocolate in my actual life than the other way around, don\u2019t you think? \n \n(And may the force be with you!) \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's  Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And there are so many other wonderful \"C\" words, aren't there? Chameleon... chalcedony... chardonnay... \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, May 3, 2011", "body": "\nAn odd, tough twist on a familiar saying keeps running through my mind: \"The older they get, the further they fall.\" \n \nAnd I know I'm thinking about Jake, and how much distance is growing between he and his twin, as Ethan sprints ahead into sophistication, maturity, leaving his brother in the dust. \n \n @@@@@@@ \nHaving a toddler on the autism spectrum can be very frustrating. \n \nHowever wild your other children are, they can be so much wilder. Or, conversely, uncomfortably tame, absent, self-contained to the point of disappearance. \n \nThey can be fearful, unable to explore their environment due to anxiety and sensory issues. Or, like my son, so busy exploring, feeding their sensory hunger that thoughts of safety are, well, I was going to say last on the list, but really? They don't even make the list. \n \nIt's more like: Safety? What is this safety of which you speak? Ooooh, shiny & spinning... and... he's off. \n \nBut also, in some ways, they are not so unlike other toddlers. It's often a (cumulative) matter of degree. \n \nMany toddlers have tantrums  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \nMany toddlers are hard to understand, communicate with difficulty  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \nMany toddlers have problems with self regulation  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \nMany toddlers put odd things in their mouths  (autistic ones usually more so).   \n \nMany toddlers are out of control in stores and restaurants  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \nMany toddlers screech and make silly noises  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \nMany toddlers spin and roll  (autistic ones usually more so).  \n \nMany toddlers are odd or picky eaters  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \nMany toddlers seem \"crazy\"  (autistic ones usually more so). \n \n(and I could go on) \n \nSo an autistic toddler, while usually beyond exhausting to his or her family, often doesn't stand out quite so much to the world. \n \nThose of us who are there know, can see the telltale signs, but on a playground you have to look hard to spot them among the general chaos.\u00a0 They can sometimes pass; pass for \"normal\" (whatever that is). \n \nBut then your little kids grow up. \n \nBy the time your children are eight and a half, like mine are, by the time they are in 3rd grade (or something like it), depending on how deep on the spectrum they lie, passing's frequency can be limited, to non-existent. \n \n @@@@@@@ \nI am on the bus with my son Jacob and I know we are annoying the person sitting right next to us. But Jake is happy, talking up a storm, interacting with me. So really? I don't give a shit. \n \n(And some days a small part of me is comparing. Comparing what being out with Jake is like, vs. with Ethan. And it's never good for my brain when I go there, so I try to shut that down fast.) \n \nOur conversation puzzles people, they double take because I sound like I am talking with a much smaller, younger child that I am seen with. Jake makes declarative statements I agree with. I answer simple questions (over and over again) with equally simple answers. \n \n\"Is that a Dad, Mommy?\" \n \n\"Well, Jake, that's a man, he might be a Dad.\" \n \n\"He has brown hair Mommy.\" \n \n\"Yes, he does, Jake.\" \n \nMy voice when out with Jake is less casual, more drill sergeant. \n \nI say to Ethan: \"Hey, E, our stop is coming up soon, so lets get ourselves ready to get off the bus.\" \n \nI say to Jake: \"Jacob, Next Stop is ours. Jake! Be ready. OK, Up, now. NOW! Right now, Jake! Stay with me!\" I am sharp, directive. \n \nThen solicitous: \"OK, Honey this way, stay close, down the steps there you go. Good job!\" Like with a toddler. My four and a half foot, 80 pound toddler. \n \nAnd while the annoyance of strangers I easily shrug off, sometimes I can feel looks of pity floating my way. And the pity? That, my friends, is much harder to take. \n \n @@@@@@@ \nAnd then there is this:  \n \nJake drops my hand in the middle of crossing a busy street and runs ahead to the other side because the back of the phone booth has a big old ad for Rango on it and he must go worship. \n \nWhen I catch up to him, puffing (I really am too old for this shit) he is so happy, smiling, pointing (Pointing! Terrific!): \"Look Mommy! Rango, Mommy! March 4th, Mommy! Rated PG, Mommy!\"  \n \nAnd I need to berate him for running ahead, make him understand how serious an offense that was. \n \nBut he is sheer joy at this moment and I hate to make him cry which he surely will when I chastise him. \n \nHis eyes do go wide and brim with tears when my voice goes stern and my face turns severe; so fragile is my child, so sensitive. \n \nBut it's better than those other days when the wildness is in him and he laughs manically at everything, including corrections. Between the easy tears and the crazy laughter, I don't know which one is harder. \n \nOn the days with tears I know at least something is getting through to him. \n \n\"I'm sorry Mommy\" he blubbers \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry...\" over and over and I am the ogre who has made my sweet son cry. \n \nBut if he is ever to have any independence, if he is ever to have any hope of negotiating this complex world without a chaperone standing by? He needs to learn and remember the basic rules of safely, which at the moment are so far from his thoughts. \n \nSo I kneel down and hold my son on the busy Broadway street corner, and slowly he calms, complains his glasses need cleaning now. And as I dry them with the corner of my scarf, his eyes light up. \"Rango!\" \n \n\"Rango, Mommy! Opens March 4th starring Johnny Depp rated PG, Mommy!\" he proclaims, enthralled by the re-spotted poster. \n \nEven though it is April. Even though he has already seen it. Twice.  \n \nHe is happy. Again. And thus, so, wanly, am I. \n \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

Because they can't/don't play together (because of the stupid fucking autism). and we live in the city, I can't just toss them out into the backyard, tell them to play with the neighbors.  \n SO they are in separate rooms, watching TV and on the computer and playing their DSes and waiting for Mom to take them out or make a thousand phone calls to set up a playdate for ethan and I am just spinning my wheels and digging deeper and deeper in my rut, feeling overwhelmed by everything, and feeling like the worst mother in the world.\u00a0 (which I know I am not, I am feeding and caring for them and talking to them -- just not providing much adventure and excitement right now) \n And I kept thinking: tomorrow I'll wake up feeling better, be back to my old self.

{"date": "Saturday, April 30, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Today I have something special for you here at   Special Needs Sibling Saturdays,  a post by the lovely Jessica who blogs at  four plus an angel. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Jessica has a full house: a  teenage daughter  who is on the autism spectrum, two  surviving three year-olds  that were born as premie triplets, and a  baby boy , now nearly two. \n \n Jessica  writes about her daughter's  Aspergers  with much thoughtfulness and feeling. And, though the loss of her third triplet is  never far from her mind , her posts are often full of light and laughter.  \n \n Jessica's writing is  lyrical and poetic  without ever being forced or precious. She writes from deep in her heart, as you will see... \n \n @@@@@@@  \n Our Shopping Cart  \u2013 by Jessica  \n \nWheels spin across the floor. \n \nLaughing with delight, my daughter catches her end. With a \"wheeee\" she turns the plastic shopping cart around, sending it gliding to her brother. \n \nGiggling as he accepts the flying cart, my son's eyes glisten wide, he shouts his \"wheeee\" a bit louder and sends the cart back again. \n \nThey take turns again and again, trading \"wheees\" and laughter and a shopping cart. \n \nBefore long she comes in. \n \nI light up because she is headed their way, the giggles enough to pull her in.  \n \nWill she join them? Will they look to her? I hold back my urge to arrange the scene. \n \nWalking right through that sailing cart's path she stops the wheels. Unphased, the kids move a bit, trying to finish their game. \n \nBut their big sister does it again. Stops the next \"wheee\" before the basket can be caught. \n \nThe weight of autism hits me harder than that cart, had it been full of bricks. \n \nShe wanted to join in. \n \nThis was her way to try to play. \n \nShe was doing the best that she could. \n \nMy younger children were not yet three at the time. \n \nMy oldest, 14. \n \nIn their two and a half years of development, they had learned social skills and reciprocal play and a bit of intuition. \n \nIn her 14 years of therapy and social skills training and special education she had not. My heart broke as the ease of their play cast more light on the difficulty of hers. \n \nHaving spent so long raising one child, the shock of typical development in Ashlyn's siblings is something I had not prepared for when expanding our family. \n \nI was nervous about autism, I knew how strong the genetic links were. But I had never once thought about the comparisons and how, in seeing the \"normal\" and the \"easy\" in my typically developing children, I may need some time to mourn the absence of this in my oldest. \n \nI watch the relationships my younger children have, the effortless way they play, the carelessness they use in climbing on each other, imitating their favorite characters, playing in their basement band, and I can't help but feel the loss of it all for Ashlyn. \n \nPlaying does not come without practice and guidelines. She flinches from an unannounced touch, does not quite grasp make-believe and covers her ears the minute an instrument is held. \n \nAutism has stolen her ease, the relaxation and contentment of childhood, and she is almost an adult. It is not coming back. \n \nBut for every difference adding these little beings to our family has magnified, there has been a blessing in return. \n \nHer siblings have offered Ashlyn an unjudging audience; welcome little friends who don't care if she looks them in the eye or says hello before she begins to speak. \n \nUnconditional love has been magnified for her and when she wants to play a game or watch a cartoon she has a three foot tall group to pick from, just in case she needs company (or someone to throw her game pieces all over the floor). \n \nThere are times I think that close family and friends are the only circle of acceptance our children can count on. \n \nAutism can be such a hard disorder for unknowing eyes to understand.\u00a0 I watch my children interact and see the love connecting them all. \n \nAlthough she might not find the perfect words to say it, and her unfailing honesty may give you a long explanation for why being an only child is wonderful, Ashlyn loves her siblings in ways she can't truly express. \n \nHer shopping cart is full and they won't ever mind pushing it for her. \n \n \u00a0@@@@@@@\u00a0 \n I am especially touched by the way Jessica speaks of and shows us her younger children's unconditional love for their big sister. Thank you, Jessica for sharing your lovely family with us here. \n \nSo now that you have finished reading Jessica\u2019s words here, you will want to go visit her at her  four plus an angel . You are in for a treat. Be sure to read this post about  sibling connections , this one about her teenage daughter's  recent triumphs , and this lovely one about  being a mom .\u00a0 \n \n Jessica is not only a lovely writer and an amazing mom, she is also  an engaged and generous member of the blogging community.\u00a0 As such, she has recently launched a fun and funny weekly series called \" The Hot Seat \" wherein a different blogger is put on the spot each Monday, and has to answer questions posed by her readers.  \n \nFinally, you should absolutely follow her on  Twitter  (where she gives good tweet) and \"like\" her on  Facebook . Although if there was a \"love\" button? You'd want to click that, too. Because even though Jessica is younger and prettier than me? I love her, I do! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, April 29, 2011", "body": "\nI hear the volume increasing, and my stomach tenses. Still, I ignore, stay turned to the task at hand, dinner in the making: skins thinly peeled from slices of ripe-bursting peach, rice steamed to softness.  \n \nAnd then the pitch rises again. And the thuds. And the keening. And the wail. The wail that cannot be ignored: Mooooooooooommmmaaay! \n \nIn their bedroom is a tangled mess of snot and confusion. Jacob with glasses awry. Ethan with hands on temples, shrieking \u201cHe head butted me, he head butted me!\u201d \n \nJacob, alternately growling like a caged lion and laughing theatrically, a perfect rendition of a cartoon villain's world-destruction-anticipating cackle. Ethan now lurching at his brother with clenched fists and a growl of his own, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him!\u201d \n \nAnd me? I\u2019m in the middle again; sorting, soothing, trying to make sense of the senseless. I don\u2019t even bother asking what or who started it, for these things just start. \n \nEthan is maddened by this idea, full of indignation and bluster, dead sure of his own absolute blamelessness in the matter. \u201cHe\u2019s the worst, the meanest brother in the world! He took my Pikachu, he laughed at me when I tried to take him back!\u201d \n \nI could explain, for the hundred thousand and second time, that there is not the same purposefulness behind Jacob's actions as there would have been had Ethan been the perpetrator, that the motivator is not cruelty. \n \nBut why? \n \nEthan knows his brother has autism. He's never going to be happy about it. \n \nOnce again, the physical damage is minimal. The psychic, massive. \n \nEthan\u2019s anger is a wildfire, burns blue-hot, consumes all in its path. He spits words at Jake through gritted teeth \u201cDo. Not. Laugh. At. Me. Ever. Again!\u201d Which Jacob, of course, cocooned in his autistic obliviousness to much that is normal human discourse, finds hysterical.  \n \nJake love, love, loves his brother brimming full like this, is getting his lasered attention, for once. And just to ratchet up the annoyance factor? Begins to repeat his usual mispronunciation of his brother\u2019s name in his most grating sing-song voice: \u201cOh, Eeee-fan\u201d giggle \u201cEeeeee-fan\u201d giggle. \n \nIf glares could kill, Ethan would be the only man standing. \n \nThoughts of dinner temporarily abandoned, separate them I must. Jake to remain in their room, Ethan to come with me into my bedroom; to float in the middle of my big bed, try to find his calm, regain his rudder. \n \nSponge Bob on the TV providing perfect distraction, I return to the scene of the crime, find Jacob rubbing the spot on his shin that will surely sprout a game-token sized plum splotch by bath time. \n \nMystery bruises his usual specialty, at least this time I know the culprit: bedframe. \n \n\"Are you Okay, Jake?\" I ask.  \n \n\"Efan was MAD!\" he says with glee. \n \n\"Yes.\" I agree, breathe deep, dive into an explanation made as simple as can be, but still fitting the bill. \"When you took his toy he got mad. And when you laughed about it he got madder. It's mean to laugh at people when they are mad or sad, Jake. Do you want to be mean?\" \n \nAnd then he's got his contrite face on. The one he pulls up when he knows he's done something wrong, but can't understand for beans precisely what. \"No\" he answers, fairly sure that this is the right answer, the one that will grant him hugs and cuddles, absolve him of all transgressions. \n \nAnd it does. \n \n\"Come here, honey,\" I say as he climbs into my lap, my eight year-old, eighty pound toddler.\u00a0 I put some music on the radio and we sway together for a minute, but stomachs are grumbling and dinner sits, bereft, barely halfway complete. \n \nEthan's laughter trickles through my bedroom doorway, mood lifted by the magic of television, as I make my way back to the kitchen, to settle once again into the rhythms of cooking. \n \nThen, to pick up the scattered fragments, to shake the jangly shards of our family back into a familiar shape. \n \nDinnertime. \n \nLet's eat. \n \n \n @@@@@@@ \n This post was written for The Red Dress Club's  Red Writing Hood  prompt: \"Write a piece about a fight.

{"date": "Thursday, April 28, 2011", "body": "\nB is for Best Friend \n \nJake doesn't have one. \n \nNot a bestie, not a buddy, not even a one. \n \nNot. one. friend. \n \nEthan? Has a flock of friends; plays elaborate imaginary games with them, involving  10,000 characters with names like \"Flareon\" or on screens in parallel universes vanquishing foes with, and acquiring goodies for, their associated avatars. \n \nAnd Jake? Wants desperately to play, to interact with other kids; but has no one who will give him the time of day. \n \nAnd this breaks my heart. \n \nThis is who Jake now talks to and plays with all day long: \n \n \nYes, it's George, Curious George. George is Jake's best and only friend. He's stuffed. Very accommodating. And completely non-judgmental.  \n \nIn the playroom Jake sits him in the little red car (that he no longer fits in himself), and pushes him all around. George is who shoots baskets with Jake, and slides down the big slide with him. \n \nSeated next to him at the table, George is who Jake's dinnertime conversation is mostly directed at. Better than nothing I suppose. But still, I can feel how he longs, how he yearns for a human kind of companionship. \n \nThe other day in the playground there was a child who kindly responded to Jacob's awkward overtures for a while, and it made his day. \n \nIt was the first glorious spring day, come late into our interminably long and grueling school \"break.\"\u00a0 I had hauled Jake and Ethan out of their electronic boy-cave, blinking into the sunlight, to meet up with a friend of Ethan's in the park. \n \nWe'd ended up in the Hippo Playground, where there are large fiberglass hippos that can be climbed upon and most importantly in, too.\u00a0 Jake was inside of one, his head sticking out between the hippo's gaping jaws, roaring at all who passed by, and this one boy, about Jake's own age, thought that was funny, roared back at him. \n \nJake was thrilled to find someone willing to speak his language. And since these were, after all, sculptures of wild animals, this was not way too odd, too beyond the pale. \n \nThere was no screaming going on, so I parked myself on a bench, allowed myself a distracted moment of Twitter, looked up when Jacob appeared in front of me with a question: \"Where's Daniel?\"  \n \nI was confused \"You mean Daddy?\"\u00a0 \"No,\" Jacob answered \"boy Daniel.\" And then I understood, Jacob had actually managed to extract a name, all on his own. \"You mean the boy in the blue shirt that you were playing with?\" \n \n\"Yes!\" beamed Jacob. \"Where's he at, boy Daniel?\" and together we scanned the crowded playground for this now familiar person. Spotted on a jungle gym in the distance, Jacob bounded off as I waited on tenterhooks, cringing, hoping, prepared to spring into mother-bearly action should there be rejection, a need for intercession, explanations.  \n \nBut the gods of autism were smiling upon Jake once again, and this boy surely had a kind and generous nature.\u00a0 For he roared at and chased Jacob a few steps, laughing, happy to go along with the odd request. \n \nAnd when Jacob roared at him he obligingly shrieked, aped mock fear, ran a few paces then spun back to smile at Jake, before returning to his other friends, playing other, bigger-boy games. \n \nAnd, nearly unbelievably? Was willing to give it a go again, and again, and again as Jacob returned for round upon round of \"growl and chase.\" This boy, Daniel, never turned mean, never turned on him, just cheerfully went along with the program. \n \nAnd so, for one day, Jake was just another kid on the playground taking up with a found friend for a while, as kids, regular kids, are wont to do. \n \nAnd my faith in the goodness of humanity, the kindness of strangers was restored. \n \nIt appears that B is also for Best. Day. Ever. \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to  Jenny Matlock 's  Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And aren't there so many nice words that begin with \"B\"? Like: Beauty and Butterfly. But were my kids to choose? Probably: Burp and Buttocks at the top of the list. I have mentioned they are eight year-old boys, yes? \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Maxabella's  I'm grateful for... \u00a0 because I am truly, deeply grateful for kind children like boy Daniel.   \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "body": "\nHello there, friends. \n \nI'm really not good at this. \n \nThe business side of bloggy things. The razzle and the dazzle. The self-promotion machine that I am supposed to be. \n \nI'd really just rather be writing. Writing about autism, my mom, my kids, my dead father; pretty much anything else. But I've been told this needs to be done. I need to \"promote\" myself and my blog. \n \nBut you know? I'd really just rather be writing.  \n \nBut also, the bald truth? I like readers. \n \nI know I'm supposed to say I'm an artist, that I would write even if I had one reader, that I write for myself. And to some extent that's true.  \n \nBut also? Pure balderdash. \n \nThis is a blog, not a journal. It's called \"Social Media\" after all. I want people to read me. For what is an over-sharer with no one to share with?  \n \nSo, one cup of shameless self-promotion coming up...... \n \nOK, I'm Jewish, I'm a mom. Jewish moms are notoriously famous for successfully employing guilt as a motivating factor, so let me try that one out on you folks here: \n \nDarlings, I don't ask for much do I? I don't. No, nothing at all, not ever. \n \nAnd me? All I do is give to you. Give, give, give. \n \nSo, could you please, just this once, do a little favor for me? Just this one little, two little things? \n \nAfter all, I carried you around inside my body for nine long months, fed you from my very own breasts... no wait, I think I'm getting confused here... \n \nLet's try that again... attitude change... \n \nYo, peeps, let's DO this thing, OK? \n \nTakes like about two seconds, maybe 10... OK, a minute, tops. EASY stuff: no signing up, no signing in, just clickety, click, click. Done! \n \nFIRST, Facebook: Find my Box... \n \n(Take your mind out of the gutter. Yes, YOU, I heard that thought.)\u00a0  \n \nLook over on the sidebar on the right (no, your  other  right) yes, THERE.\u00a0 The box that says \"Find us on Facebook\" on the top. It looks like this: \n \n \n   \nNow, here comes the tricky part:\u00a0  Click the \"like\" button . \n \n(Unless you don't like my blog. And then, um, why are you here?)\u00a0  \n \nYes, that's it! Done! Voila! Yay, you! \n \nNext? \n \nBabble. \n \nBabble, babble, babble. They seem not to know I exist. This irks me. \n \nRecently, in honor of  Autism Awareness Month , they came up with a list of \"Top 25 Autism Spectrum Blogs.\" \n \n \nI like this. I commend this. I would like it better if I were ON that list. \n \nNow, don't get me wrong, 25 wonderful bloggers were on that list.\u00a0 They are fabulous, many are my friends. I don't begrudge them their seat at the table, not for even one instant. \n \nBut the list needs to be longer. At least 26. (But probably more like 50, since off the top of my head I can easily name at least 20 others who are wonderful and should be noted, too.) \n \nAnd here's where you come in... you can help correct this! Let Babble know I exist! Tell them I'm an autism blogger to be reckoned with!\u00a0 (I know, I don't have autism in the title of my blog. Did I mention I'm really bad at marketing and self promotion?) \n \nHere's how: Go  HERE .\u00a0 Find ME.  \n \n(I'm sorry I can't tell you exactly where I will be, am currently #13 on the nomination list, but you should be able to move me up. It shouldn't be hard to find me -- \"The Squashed Bologna,\" remember?)  \n \nNext... wait for it...\u00a0  Click the \"I Like This\" button  (yes, the one with the thumbs-up icon below it). \n \nOnce again: Ta-da! You are done! Sheer simplicity!  \n \nThat's all folks. About a minute of your time, and you have helped a blogger out. Feel good about yourself, you've been a good friend today.  \n \nAnd? A great big THANK YOU. From me to you. You rock! You're the best! (No, really, YOU are.) \n \n(And Tomorrow? Back to our regularly scheduled program.)\u00a0  \n \nFinally... just an observation: I think I have used more parenthetic clauses in this post than any other yet. \n \nYay Me!

{"date": "Monday, April 25, 2011", "body": "\nAutism doesn't suck every day. Sometimes it lets me in to see the  unique beauty  and  vision  of my son. But then there are days when it causes him real pain. And then I want to kick autism's ass to the curb. \n \nLike two Saturdays past. Yeah, it was one of those days. \n \nIt started out with such promise. I had actually gone out on a date Friday night with my husband. We saw a movie (Source Code) in a real movie theater and it didn't suck, and we'd had dinner in a restaurant that didn't serve burgers & fries (because that's what the kids eat in restaurants). \n \nI'd gotten some sleep. Sure, Jake woke up at 6:05 (really? on a Saturday? really?) but he happily entertained himself on the computer until 7:30. \n \nOK, he watched the Mad TV episode \"The Fast and the Curious\" for the ten thousandth time. (Yes, starring Vin Diesel and Curious George, and yes, this is what's fueling the current renaissance of his obsession with Curious George.)  \n \nBut I got to sleep until 7:30. Win. \n \nTotally worth hearing Jake repeat \"The Fast and the Curious\" like a TV spot announcer all day long. I think. \n \nSo,  Saturday. The day we'd long been awaiting had at last arrived... \"Rio\" had finally opened in the theaters.\u00a0 I've only been hearing about it for six months now, and Jake was near giddy with anticipation. \n \nWe headed out to the movies, just the boys & me, since 3-D gives my husband a big\u00a0headache and he successfully begged off (lucky bastard). \n \nIt was all running so smoothly, a little too smoothly, and so the gods of autism had to reach down and screw it up for us again. \n \nEnd of movie. Ethan starts bouncing up and down, tells me he drank his whole water (why did I bring water?) and really needed to pee. If it were just he and I - no problem, if\u00a0he had a friend with him -\u00a0 no problem, if all four of us had gone to the movies - no problem.  \n \nJust the three of us - BIG problem.  \n \nThe bathroom in this theater is not just outside the door, but downstairs on a whole other floor. Ethan, understandably, didn't want to go alone. I couldn't leave Jacob alone in theater.  \n \nAnd Jacob? Loves the music at the end of movies, lives for movie credits - maybe his favorite part of a movie. I\u00a0knew it was going to be trouble, BIG trouble,\u00a0to extract him before the last note of the last song had faded and the\u00a0lights\u00a0went up. \n \nSo picture us: Ethan doing the pee-pee dance as if life depended on it, Jake jumping up and down, dancing to the credit music. It has to be getting near the end of credits, so I move us closer to the door. \n \nThey're playing a big loud song, they're deep into the list of background animators, this MUST be close to ending, I know the final song is coming up, so I tell him Jake that Ethan HAS to go pee, that we HAVE to go to bathroom and we're going to wait until the end of this THIS song and then go. \n \nNow we're halfway out the door. In fact, we're in the middle of the open doorway, like a large river rock, making everyone flow around us, and I just don't fucking care. I'm trying to get away fast after the penultimate song, to be on the escalator before first notes of the next, last song start up. \n \nI'm praying to the gods of autism that this will work, but know deep down how cruel they are, that I'm surely fooling myself big time if I think I'm going to get away with this. \n \nAnd indeed, three steps from the theater doorway the waterworks start.\u00a0 And then comes the keening, the great big hiccuping sobs, as if he'd just lost the love of his life. Jake is sodden and sobbing and repeating over and over: \"Now we're NEVER gonna finish this thing!\" which is a script from somewhere, I don't really care. \n \nAnd so focused am I on comforting my boy, I don't see or notice the stares, although I know Ethan does, shrinking from all the eyes upon us, from his brother and the scene we're causing as we noisily race down the escalator to the floor below, the one with the bathrooms. \n \n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry\" he apologizes profusely, and this, too, breaks my heart, that Ethan has to feel bad about needing to pee. I tell him it's not his fault, that he's done nothing wrong, but know that my words just float on the surface, won't sink below the sheen of his guilt.  \n \nI make sure that Ethan hears me as I tell Jacob: \"I know you badly want to stay to hear the last song, see the end of the credits, but it is hurting Ethan's body to not pee right now, and his physical need to not be in pain has to come before your feelings and desires.\" \n \nI know full well that to Jacob, even if he were not so gone into misery, this would not mean much: a jumble of words, abstract mumbo-jumbo. But Ethan needs to hear it, to know it is okay to come first, even if it makes his brother this sad. \n \nWe stay in the theater building a long time. And still Jacob, limp, spent, is crying as we walk out into the gray drizzle; crying as we get into the cab; crying as we walk into our building; crying as we settle back into our apartment; crying because, to him, he has not seen the movie because he has not seen every last little bit, until the last note of the last song has faded and the\u00a0lights have gone up. \n \nThe gods of autism are assholes. \n \nBut then Sunday, the very next day, it's a whole different story. \n \nAnother day, another autism. \n \nWe're out on Long Island at my  Aunt and Uncle's house  at the end of a dead-end block with the fields out back. And my cousins are their with all their kids, too, so we are a wondrous gang of cousins. \n \nJake is in and out of connectedness, but with the space to do so, sliding the glass door open to run in and out of the yard at will. Delighted to go along with the gang on our shambling walk through the woods. \n \nAnd then after the seder and the dinner, when guitars and ukuleles are brought out and folk songs are being sung, I pull a pair of pots out of the cupboard at Ethan's brilliant suggestion. \n \nAnd suddenly Jacob is in the thick of things, drumming away, calling out to his cousins, gleefully a part of the music making, a member of the band.  \n \n \n \n (Sorry about the bad Droid shot, but my camera battery had died) \n \nAnd so Sunday, autism doesn't suck, is just a part of who Jacob is, not getting in his way, may likely even be a part of his innate rhythmic abilities. \n \nAnd I watch Jake, my  awesome drummer boy, light up the room with his smile, light up my heart, always. \n \nAnd the gods of autism are smiling, too, mercurial jerks though they may be; merciful, for one day. \n \n \n \n \n I'm also linking this post up to Shell's Pour Your Heart Out linky at  Things I Can't Say     \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, April 23, 2011", "body": "\n \n My guest this week, Jean Myles, blogs as  Mommy to Two Boys , and she is another amazing Autism Mom.\u00a0 \n \n She writes about her family: her four year old son,  Jaylen , who is on the autism spectrum, and his younger brother,  Xavier , who is not. \n \n Jean also takes beautiful pictures of her sons, and they are all over her blog,  woven throughout  her posts. \n   \nOne of the things I admire most about Jean is how thoughtful she is  about every aspect of her children's lives. Read her post now and you will see... \n \n@@@@@@@ \n Brotherly Love with a Side of Autism  \u2013 by Mommy To Two Boys \n \nI rubbed my pregnant belly as I heard the words for the very first time, \"Jaylen has Autism.\"  \n \nWould this baby have Autism?\u00a0 How am I going to give Jaylen all the help he needs yet still take care of another child?\u00a0 Should we have stopped at one child?\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nXavier was born four months later, and aside from some sensory issues and being a total brat, he has turned out to be exactly what our family needed.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n There have been some very rough times as their brotherly love matures, but there have been some amazing moments at well.\u00a0 I know there will be hurdles to overcome in the future, but I feel strongly their bond will strengthen over time. \n \nA solid connection is what surprises me most about how my boys interact. \n \nJaylen, my ASD 4 year old, is truly lacking in social skills, empathy, and play skills, so to see them communicate, play together and understand each other blows my mind. I always thought Jaylen would remain in a shell and Xavier would be left without a companion, but instead their worlds intersect a lot.\u00a0  \n \nAs a baby, Jaylen's therapists were so concerned over how he could spend hours in his own little world, filling and dumping buckets of toys, watching water pour out of a hose, and spinning to Maroon 5 tunes. (I know, it was as unbearable as you'd think. The most sadistic torture has nothing on being forced to listen to that guy for hours everyday.)\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nJaylen never seemed to notice or care when I got upset, my husband and I fought, or if we were trying to include him in play.\u00a0 Xavi is the complete opposite, a personable, always in your face 2 year old.  \n \nIt breaks my heart when Jaylen gets home from school and Xavi cheerfully yells, \"Hi Jaylen!\" only to get no response most days.\u00a0 However, I am slowly watching their relationship evolve.\u00a0  \n \nThey communicate in their own way.\u00a0 They order each other to do things, ask each other to play, and have started ganging up to defend each other.\u00a0  \n \nRecently they played together for 39 minutes without a problem.\u00a0 I am not sure how much interacting really occurred, but I heard them laughing and talking. \n \nIt is still interaction, even though half the time they spend together they are fighting.\u00a0 For never having seen a single WWE event, they sure know some serious moves and use them often.\u00a0  \n \nBlood has been drawn, bruises have been made, and many tears have fallen because of their extreme physical contact.\u00a0 My husband swears this is normal boy behavior, which I know nothing about since I grew up in a house of three girls.  \n \nJaylen and Xavier are on the same level when it comes to certain skills.\u00a0 Pretend play is one area Jaylen still really struggles with so they are learning the skill together.\u00a0\u00a0 Even though all we have seen is play-kitchen cooking, car and train scenes, and hours of school buses picking up and dropping off kids, I can easily see it progressing.  \n \n \nWe still have a long way to go.\u00a0  \n \nXavi lost his lovey at Stop and Shop and Jaylen got upset, \"Oh no, is he going to be sad?\"\u00a0 I looked at Xavi and replied, \"No, he seems OK. He isn't crying, but will probably be sad at bedtime.\"\u00a0  \n \nI watched Jaylen stare blankly as he processed what I said, then explained, \"No Mom, not Xavi. I was talking about Lovey. Will Lovey be sad and lonely here at Stop and Shop?\"\u00a0  \n \nOh well, so much for empathy for humans over inanimate objects, but we will get there. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Thank you, Jean, for sharing the lovely, complex, growing, sometimes difficult relationship that exists between your two boys. I am especially touched that they have \"started ganging up to defend each other,\"  think that bodes well for their future.\u00a0  \n \n Now that you have read this lovely post, you are going to want to follow Jean home to  Mommy to Two Boys  and read her there.\u00a0 \n \n May I recommend  this post  or  this one  about the surprises of parenting a typical toddler after an ASD first child. Or  this lovely post  about her son riding the \"short bus.\"  \n \n Jean can also be found posting about her work-from-home business on her  work blog .\u00a0 Finally, you can and *should* follow her on  Twitter  and like her on  Facebook .\u00a0 Happy Reading! \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, April 16, 2011", "body": "\n \n Another Saturday, another   Special Needs Sibling Saturdays  post!\u00a0 \n \n One thing I need to mention before I introduce  Stimey , this week's wonderful guest blogger... You may have noticed that the \"special needs\" of the children in all the families I have featured so far fall onto the autism spectrum, and this week continues the trend.  \n \n There are two reasons for this. First off, when I  conjured up this series  and sent out my initial query letters to see if anyone else thought it was a good idea, I naturally turned to the folks I felt most comfortable with, knew best. And those would be my fellow autism bloggers. \n \nThen, it IS April, which, as I am sure YOU are aware, is Autism Awareness Month, so it is making sense to feature autism posts this month.  \n \n That said, this is soon to change. Starting in May and going forth, you will see stories from families whose kids have other Special Needs: from cerebral palsy to seizure disorders to pediatric mental illness to genetic disorders of many varieties. And combinations thereof. \n \n There will also from time to time be stories written by adult siblings telling tales of their own childhoods in SN families, and families where all the kids have SN, but of differing degrees and diagnoses, which creates yet another challenging sea to navigate. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n With that out of the way, let me introduce you to this weeks amazing blogger, a woman who probably needs no introduction (but when has that ever stopped me before?)...\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Jean Winegardner who blogs as  Stimey  at  Stimeyland  was one of my very first autism mom blogger connections when I was still a newbie, wet behind her ears, beginning blogger (was it really only a year ago?) I had just joined the  SVMG NYCMoms group blog, and she wrote for their sister DCMoms site. I noticed right away that she was smart and funny and an autism mom like me. \n \nThen BlogHer10 began with Stimey's  Blogging Autism Panel  and so we got to meet. And meet. And meet. Because it seemed everywhere one of us went, we immediately bumped into the other. Kismet.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Stimey is an amazing woman, a fabulous mom, and truly a talented writer.\u00a0 She  blogs about her  three sons: her middle son,  Jack  (who is on the autism spectrum), her eldest son,  Sam , and  Quinn , the \"baby.\"\u00a0 She also writes a lot about the boys'  relationship with each other .\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Then there is her writing about  autism itself , about  mice  (yes, mice, don't ask), about running her kids summer fun & learning program called \" Camp Stimey \" and just in case you think she is Wonder Woman (as I sometimes do), she also writes brutally honestly about those dark days when she's  having a really rough time . \u00a0  \n \n Jean can write beautifully and entertainingly about anything and everything; but don't take my word for it, read her post now and you will see.... \n \n@@@@@@@ \n Our Social Skills Group is 24/7  - by Jean Winegardner, a.k.a. Stimey \n \nIt's 8:45 p.m. and Jack and his little brother are supposed to be asleep in the bedroom they share, stacked in bunk beds one atop the other. They, however, are wide awake and chatting with each other. \n \nThe mom in me thinks I should march in there, separate them, and threaten them to within an inch of their lives if they don't fall asleep right this very minute! \n \nThe autism mom in me, however, is delighted. I can't tell what they're chatting about\u2014if I had to guess, I would wager that it is a conversation about a complicated video game mission that the two of them are creating in their minds\u2014but I don't really care. \n \nThey're talking. One speaks, then the other follows up with a related sentence, and it continues for as long as I listen. It's not really that big of a deal, unless learning how to hold a conversation is not something that comes naturally to your child. \n \nThis is the advantage I have in parenting a child with autism who has both an older and a younger brother. Social skills never stops at my house. \n \nThere have been many times when my family is out and about somewhere and my three kids are  running around like the little chaos machines  that they are, and I think, \"Wow, this would be so much easier with fewer children.\" \n \nBut then I stop and think, \"No, really having three kids makes life so much easier.\" And that's not just because they play with each other instead of hassling me to play Candy Land. \n \nMy parenting goal when it comes to my children is that I want to make them a unit. I want them to be able to count on each other and be each others' best friends. I want their brotherhood to be one of their strongest, life-long bonds. I have long accepted that eventually they will use that bond to become united against me. I am 100% okay with that. \n \nThis sibling bond became even more important to me once my middle son, Jack, was diagnosed on the autism spectrum a few years ago. Since then, having one brother ahead of him in school and one behind has been nothing short of a godsend. Being sandwiched between brothers has helped in so many other ways as well. \n \nJack has a fair amount of trouble relating to his peers. While his teachers are fantastic, they don't have time to try to get him to engage with the other kids as much as he needs. \n \nJack has a social skills group once a week, but an hour of group time cannot make up for the other 167 hours in the week. Adults will socialize with Jack, but that's not his main problem. He needs to learn to engage with other children. \n \nWhat Jack does have are brothers. His brothers are constantly with him and pushing him to participate in appropriate social behavior. They ask him questions; they include him in games; they have hurt feelings and desires that require Jack to learn to navigate these kinds of interactions, but in a safe place. \n \nI think that we are doubly fortunate in that Jack has an older brother who paves the way for him (and me!) both in school and coming-of-age experiences. Having an  older brother  helps Jack reach, stretch and grow.  \n \nJack's younger brother is wonderful because he looks up to Jack so very much, and it is so valuable for Jack to get to be a role model. Not to mention that in certain things, Jack and his younger brother are very much on the same developmental level, so it is lovely that they can  share their interests . \n \nLearning how to interact with his brothers can't be the be-all, end-all however. They have learned his mannerisms and quirks so well that they will often compensate without even thinking about it, letting Jack slide by without utilizing the skills he is learning. It is so important that Jack have typical peers around who don't know what he's thinking. \n \nEnter my other sons' buddies. Because my three kids are so close in age, they like to do many of the same things. When my oldest or youngest son has a friend over, Jack gets to practice his social abilities to figure out how he can get involved in what they are doing. Plus, his brothers act as a sort of buffer between Jack and other kids, who may not understand his peculiarities. \n \nThere are times when we have kids over to play with Jack as well. Those playdates can be hard. It can be exhausting to try to get Jack to engage with a peer for an hour or two. I imagine it's tough for Jack as well. When Jack (or I) needs a break, his brothers are there to step in and shoulder some of the pressure of playing. \n \nMundane things can teach social thinking skills when you do them all day, every day. Even something as simple as filing into the bathroom at night to brush teeth can be a lesson in patience and turn taking. \n \nI believe that the more success and fun Jack has with his brothers, the more interested he gets in non-familial children. Having brothers around helps Jack see that there are benefits to interacting with other kids. Furthermore, my other children can be role models for typical behavior. (Although, frankly, they have their own quirks too.) \n \nAll this said, there are downsides too. Families with only children have so much more time and resources to spend with their autistic child. When you're focused on only one child, it is so much easier to target exactly what he or she needs; there is no other child with competing desires. \n \nEvery time I'm waiting for Jack in a speech or occupational therapist's waiting room with my other kids, I think about how much easier it would be with just the one. \n \nLet me tell you also, that it's not all smiles and sunshine in my household. Yes, my kids all get along and play together beautifully \u2014 when they're not screaming at each other and trying to commit fratricide. \n \nStill, for my family, the benefits outweigh the negatives. More than anything else, I am so grateful that Jack gets to experience the greatest social benefit of all: having two best friends who accept him as he is. \n \nYes, they get frustrated sometimes and, yes, sometimes Jack gets annoyed, but for a child who wants to socialize, as Jack does, having two willing bodies nearby is the best thing we could hope for. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n One of the things I find so moving about this piece is how appreciative Stimey is of the gifts her children give and are to each other. \n \n Also note that she points out how Jack's being in the middle feels a big part of the magic. I have to concur, as I have identified how some of the big trouble in my house comes from Jacob being Ethan's twin. There is such an expectation of sameness and equality there that autism's delays and immaturities just confound so deeply. Sigh.  \n\u00a0 \n I especially love how Stimey contrasts the reactions of \"The mom in me\" with that of \"The autism mom in me\" to a situation.\u00a0 I have so been there, as I think all autism moms have been, too. \n \nSo now that you have read her post here, you'll surely want to go  read more at her own bloggy home,  Stimeyland . Besides all the posts previously linked and mentioned above, you might want to try  this one here , or  this one , a funny favorite of mine. \n \n Stimey is not only a prolific writer, but an active member of the Autism parenting community. She founded, runs and writes for  AutMont , Montgomery County, Maryland's autism community website. Jean also write a regular column,  Autism Unexpected,  at The Washington Times Communities. \n \n Stimey can also be found posting on the 15th of every month at  Hopeful Parents . Finally?

{"date": "Friday, April 15, 2011", "body": "\nThe thing is, if every life is full of ups and downs, life with special needs children is just... more so. \n \nIn every way. \n \nThere are so many aspects to it that drag me down, made me cry, bring me to my knees. So it's important to look for, focus on, and magnify the moments of light and buoyancy; the little things that lift me up, keep me afloat, allow me to just get on with it. Because I would rather laugh than cry, any day. \n \nThis morning I had one of those lightening moments. Not a big laugh-out-loud funny, more on the order of a tiny rise of the corners of my mouth and heart. But all those tiny bubbles? Aren't they what make champagne so delightful? \n \nAs I was  rushing  encouraging Jake through his usual get-ready-for-school routine this morning, I was reminded that my eight year-old son, my Jacob? He has a mob name.  \n \nHe's Jakey Vitamins, and don't mess with him. \n \nThis came about because of the unique configuration of our small apartment: we don't have a dining room and we don't have an eat-in kitchen. The dining table is in a corner of our living room, the corner farthest away from the kitchen, which is typical NYC: a long, narrow  galley. \n \nJacob is a \"mid-high functioning\" kid on the autism spectrum. What that translates into is that he is capable of being independent in his morning routine. Sort of. \n \nMeaning: with LOTS of coaching and reminders he can do most things for himself. With LOTS of coaching, reminders and nudging to stay focused, that is. And a quick mom-check that his underwear is not on backwards. Again. \n \nAlso, in the mornings, time is of the essence. Jake gets up at 6:00, his bus comes at 6:45. No lollygagging allowed. With the kitchen and the dining table so distant, and with Jake & Ethan's lunches to be packed and Ethan's breakfast to be made while Jake is eating his breakfast, the coaching inevitably needs to happen somewhat long distance. \n \nTranslation: Me, yelling from the kitchen towards the living room: \"Jakey, Pants!\" \"Jake - TWO shoes!\" \"Jacob! EAT!\"\u00a0 This short form is based on the theory that reminders should be kept simple: name plus one word - verb or noun - that best jogs the memory and focuses the brain. \n \nOne particular morning my husband was actually up early and at the computer in the alcove off the kitchen (aka his office) while this was going on. After about my third bellow of \"Jakey! Vitamins!\" he chimed in: \"You know honey, I think that's his mob name.\" \n \nMe (distracted by toaster oven and microwave timers going off simultaneously): \"What?!?!?\" \n \nHusband: \"When you said just now, I thought -- Hey that sounds like a typical mob nickname, like 'Tony Bagels' or 'Vinny Carwash.'\u00a0 'Jakey Vitamins' -- it's got as nice ring to it, don't you think?\" \n \nAnd thus Jakey Vitamins, my son's mobbed-up alter ego was born.\u00a0  \n \nAnd so now when I call that out to him - \"Jakey! Vitamins!\" - (many, many, many times each morning) I play this back in my mind and makes me smile; helps me to not be so annoyed. \n \nJakey Vitamins. Don't mess with him. Or he and his gang --  Blue Bear , Curious George and SpongeBob SquarePants -- will have to come show you who's boss (of the big hugs). \n \n @@@@@@@ \nAlso, if you have another 3 minutes?

{"date": "Monday, April 11, 2011", "body": "\nYesterday at the link-up Jen from  The King and Eye  hosts once a fortnight (that's every two weeks to folks on our side of the big pond), the directions were seemingly simple: \n \n \"Link up a post about parenting, being a mother or a father.\" \n \nI am a mother and I blog, should be a piece of cake...\u00a0 But as I started sifting through my past posts to come up with an appropriate one to link up, I kept coming upon every other thing. I write a lot AS a parent, but not so much about BEING a parent, in general. \n \nI am all too often very specifically identified: \n \nAutism Mom... Older Mom... Special Needs Mom... Sandwich Generation Mom... Twin Mom... Grieving Mom... but, seemingly, never just a Mom.  \n \nThe post I finally dredged up? This one:  Mom is not allowed to be sick  -- a somewhat whiny post about trying to parent vaguely effectively while I was sick as a dog.\u00a0 Not my most shining moment, but at least it fit the bill. \n \nBut thinking about all this? Made me a little sad. \n \nSometimes, I just want to simply be a mom, a plain old mom, a generic mom among other moms. Sometimes I just want to write about my kids as a mom, not wear my specificities on my sleeve all the time. \n \nSo, as plain old Mom, here are some small thoughts about my children... \n \nWe had our first truly warm spring day today, here in New York City. As the layers peel off and limbs are once again exposed, I observe my boys and marvel at how close to the cusp of big-boyness they have advanced over this long cruel winter. \n \nEthan is growing leaner, rangier; the shadows of what will one day be muscles starting to take shape across his body; the angles of his face fully emerged, not an ounce of baby-fat left. \n \nJacob is well on his way to becoming a (gentle) giant. Every time I hug him I marvel at the solidness of his eighty plus pounds.\u00a0 He still asks me to pick him up, twirl him around; and for the life of me, I just can't. \n \nBoth boys have sprouted over an inch each in the last three months, as the penciled and dated lines in our doorway will testify. \n \nEthan, after a number of highly energetic kickball games and an unusually long spate without a bath (don't ask), developed a very grown up smell in his armpits, about which he was inordinately pleased.\u00a0 He is in an awful hurry to grow up and become a teenager, and I am silently begging him to slow down. \n \nBut still, thankfully, the little boys remain. \n \nJacob holds my face in his two hands, locks my brown eyes with his gray-green and says \"I love you.\" I just swoon; hope someday a girl will know this feeling, but for now he is still all mine.  \n \nToday, walking to school, Ethan slipped his hand into mine, as he does most days. Strolling down Broadway together, this effortless affectionate bond between us intact, I was keenly aware that it would all too soon be tossed by the wayside, a victim of \"uncool.\" \n \nBut now, not yet. For, still, Ethan is happy to fold himself up, catlike, to lay claim to my lap; still content to kiss my cheek hello and be briskly kissed goodbye by me, his mom. \n \n \n I am linking   up  this post to the lovely Shell's:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, April 9, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today, I would like to welcome the lovely Jen Troester as my guest here at  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays  this week .  Jen blogs over at  Living Life, with a Side of Autism .\u00a0 I'm sure you can guess by the title of her blog, she has a child who is on the autism spectrum,  a daughter . She also has a  younger son  who is not.   \n \n I truly admire Jen and her desire to tell truths. Sugar-coating is never her style. This can be a big breath of fresh air for those of us trying so hard to spin the \"oh, this isn't so bad\" wheel a few times too often, while quietly crying in our private corners. \n \n As you will see from her post below, besides being brave and honest, Jen a lovely writer.  \n \n Thank you, Jen, for courageously opening up your heart and sharing your story  with all of us. I am deeply honored and grateful to have you here. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n When It's More Than Sibling Rivalry  - by Jen Troester \n \nI always knew that I wanted at least two, if not three children. As much as I might have wished I was an only child when I was young, I cannot imagine not having siblings as an adult. \n \nWe started trying for a baby when Katie was 19 months old, one month after she started Early Intervention for an expressive/receptive speech delay. Autism wasn't even on our radar at the time, and we wanted so badly to give Katie a brother or sister. \n \nI imagined them playing together, and growing up extremely close. I envisioned grand kids and growing old surrounded by a big family. Yes, I tend to look into the future. Way into the future. The one thing I didn't see was where Katie's delays would take us, only a few years down the road. \n \nWhen Ben was born, Katie was a little over 2 and 1/2. She was still extremely delayed in speech, and pretty much cried inconsolably for two weeks. I think that is pretty common, though. No toddler can really understand a new person suddenly taking over.  \n \nBut our child wasn't able to express any of her feelings, good or bad. Not even to say she wished we could give her little brother away, like I have heard from so many friends when they gave birth to number two. \n \nThe difference between Katie and other kids is that she never go over not wanting Ben around. They never became real playmates. She was angry about his presence from day one, and still is to this day. \n \nThere are the random times that she seems to enjoy his company, but 95% of the time she wants nothing to do with him. It's a tough thing to watch, especially when Ben so badly wants to be part of her life. How do you explain to a\u00a0 2, 3, 4 year old that his sister might never want anything to do with him? \n \nUnfortunately, the worst part is not that she doesn't want to play. The worst part is that she takes out all her frustrations and anger on him. He is a lot smaller and doesn't really fight back. She doesn't go after my husband or I. She goes after him. Physically. She hits him, kicks him, throws him down, sits on him. \n \nIt got so bad that last summer I seriously considered taking Katie and moving out. I needed to make our home safe for our son, and I didn't know how to control Katie's behavior, and no one could really offer us anything useful. \n \nOur developmental pediatrician asked if Katie was leaving marks on Ben, as though that was the threshold for when things were really bad. I wasn't willing to wait for a broken bone or broken skin, a black eye or bruised face. It wasn't OK that she was hurting him, regardless of what marks were left, or not left. \n \nAt the beginning of this year we took the very hard step of putting Katie on psychiatric medication to control her tantrums and aggression. I agonized over the decision, not at all wanting to put my almost 7 year-old on anti-psychotic drugs. \n \nBut, we had no choice. It wasn't just about Katie. We had another child we had to take into consideration. The perfect playmate had turned into the perfect target. \n \nThe drugs did help. I couldn't deny how the aggression diminished, and, even though I still hate the fact my child is on a heavy-duty medication, it has kept Ben safe. \n \nWhen you have a child with Autism there are a lot of dreams you have to leave behind. It's one thing to give up dance recitals and soccer games, but giving up the relationship you dreamed for your children? That is almost too hard to bear. I am not sure if Katie will ever want a close relationship with Ben, or any relationship at all. \n \nIt breaks my heart to watch my Ben follow her around, day after day, still trying to engage her. To play with her. To just talk with her. To watch him be rejected over and over again, but still try. To know Ben will never have a chance for a typical sibling relationship because that third child I always wanted will never be. \n \nNow that we know the road we are on with Katie, we can't take that chance. I love my son, and I am grateful everyday that we decided to have a second child before receiving Katie's diagnosis. But now that we know, our choices are different. \n \nI don't like playing referee. I don't like trying to explain to my 4 year-old why his sister won't play. I don't like listening to my daughter scream that she hates her brother. I don't like having to make sure no physical harm comes to Ben. The emotional harm... that I cannot yet gauge.  \n \nI've stopped looking years into the future. Right now, I am just trying to make it through today. Trying to keep my son safe. \n \nNever did I think life with my children would be like this. Not in my wildest dreams. Although, Autism wasn't a part of those dreams. It just sneaked in and stole them. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Thank you, Jen, for your utter honesty; for baring your soul here for us, for bearing witness.\u00a0 This can not have been an easy post to write , to admit to yourself, let alone to all of us, how rough things are in your house, how far  from the idealized dream the reality of your family life is.  \u00a0 \n \n Reading this, I can only think there is a parent out there, right now, struggling with this same heavy load, worrying, wondering how to hold a family together when there is so much wildness and destruction in one child that harm is threatened to another.  \n \n And they need to know they are not alone. They need to know that it can change, that things can get better, and that if they could get over their fear of the potential harm or stigma of giving their child psychiatric medication, their child might be tremendously helped by it.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n No child wants to be out of control. When they are able to talk about it, most people who have been appropriately and properly medicated speak of the feeling of coming out of a black hole into the light.\u00a0 \n \n Jen, you are helping spread light with this post, even though you had to go into a dark place to write it. I thank you, for the gift that it is. \n \n And now that you have spent some time reading Jen\u2019s words here, please go visit her at  Living Life, with a Side of Autism . Be sure to read  this post  and  this one .\u00a0 \n \n Also know that while Jen often blogs about the dark side of autism, she also clearly appreciates and celebrates all that is lovely and wonderful in her children in posts like  this lovely one .  \n \n Finally, you can find and follow her on  Twitter  and \"like\" her on  Facebook . So, what are you waiting for? Go connect with Jen today! \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 6, 2011", "body": "\nI slip into the  bluemercury  make-up store with my cousin Annette and her two daughters, one poised on the precipice of teenhood. We have been strolling languidly down Broadway popping into stores willy-nilly as the fancy takes us. \n \nI have stolen an afternoon from my tightly pressed life to pretend for a moment that I am a lady who lunches; to bask in the girlyness of my cousin and her daughters, my dear nieces that I have spent precious little time with, absent the testosteroned clatter that is my twin eight year old sons. \n \n \n \n \nWe know we're not going to part with any money in this bastion of expensive make-up and skin care products, and the salesgirls know this too. But it's a way dead Thursday afternoon and the staff is bored to tears, so they happily indulge us and make-over the girls to their giggling delight. \n \n \n \n \n \nI glide past the perfume cases, pick up a bottle that looks interesting, open it up and am transported... somewhere, way back in time. \n \nNot a smell I associate with perfume, but rather hot sun, AM radio blaring  Crocodile Rock , my scrawny bikini-ed body with sand stuck to it in all the uncomfortable ways and places sand sticks, especially since I'm slathered in... COPPERTONE! \n \nThat's the smell! I look up, questioningly, at the sales girl and she smiles. \"Is this... ?\" \n \n\"Yes\" she says, \"it's been created to smell like vintage Coppertone.\" Emphasis on the \"vintage.\"\u00a0 Like me. It's two days after my 50th birthday, she didn't need to rub that in. \n \nShe holds up the bottle. That's when I pay attention to the fact that I've just sprayed myself with something called \"Beach.\"  \n \nI take the bottle from her, cradle it in my hand for a minute, knowing I'm never going to spend $45 to smell like my thirteen-year-old Jones-Beach-loving self. \n \nBut for just a moment I contemplate it, sniff my perfume sprayed arm; close my eyes, feel the sun-sweat start to pool between my just budding breasts, sway to the beat of Loggins & Messina telling me that my Mama don't dance and my Daddy don't rock & roll. \n \nThe seagulls keen and try to steal our gooey peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\u00a0 The waves crash in the background, drowned out by the cacophony of dueling radio stations around us. \n \nMy friends slather Coppertone on each others backs and keep one eye out for the boys, who will never speak to us, but we like to think know we're there for them. \n \nWe are a young thirteen, filled with longing for things we are nowhere near ready for, cannot even fully imagine, but know that it has something to do with the faintly tingling feeling between our legs whenever they come into our midst to retrieve a tossed football gone astray. \n \nAnd then the tinkling laughter of my nine year old niece breaks through. \n \n \n \n \n \nShe and her twelve year old sister are cavorting through the store, showing off their glamour to my cousin, who smiles the indulgent smile of a mother of daughters, fondly remembering her own first forays into the world of make-up, and all things grown-up and semi-forbidden. \n \n \n \n Cousins attempting glamor, 1973 \n \nAnd then we are back out in the street, onto our next girly mini-adventure.\u00a0 Something involving chocolate. \n \n \n \n \nAll too soon it comes to an end as I drop them off at the subway station. I race back home to meet my autistic son's bus, hoping that someday, maybe someday, he will be able to find himself on a beach playing ball with his friends, buoyed up by the admiration of sweaty, giggling girls he is so carefully pretending to ignore. \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  The Red Dress Club .

I'm all over that. \n \n \nSo here I am at  5 Minutes for Mom 's Ultimate Blog Party, along with a lot of other terrific bloggers, all looking to meet each other. \n \nAnd I'm supposed to introduce myself, well, OK... \n \nThe Squashed Bologna in a nutshell (an appropriate metaphor here, folks): \n \nI started blogging a little over a year ago, at a tough time in my life.\u00a0 My nearly 93 year-old father was actively dying,  fast, and I was taking care of him, my soon-to-be-widowed mother, and my  then 7 year-old twin boys, one of whom is on the  Autism Spectrum.  \n \nPouring out all my thoughts and feelings onto the page, finding my words  instead of just howling helped me to sort things out, allowed me to  plumb the depths without being torn apart by the pressure down there. \n \nI found that I loved writing as much as I had when I was a girl, a young  woman who had thought she might some day become a writer. \n \nI write about the familiar: my family.\u00a0 I write a lot about  Death  and   Autism  because these things press up against me every day.\u00a0 I write  about ADD because not only does my son have a brain that tends that way,  but so do I, so you get to come along for the wild ride. \n \nI write about love and  thankfulness  because that is what underlies all  the other stuff, keeps it from descending into sadness and madness. \n \nI write about  friendship  because without my friends I wouldn't be here, and I appreciate them with every fiber of my being. \n \nI don't write much about my husband because he is a private man and the  story of our marriage is half his, not really mine to tell.\u00a0 (But he  does come up from time to time.)  \n \nI also sometimes lighten things up, share delightful stories about my  sons,  Ethan  and  Jacob , now eight and a half. \n \n \n \n Jacob & Ethan, July 2010 \n Over the course of the past year I have gone from being an occasional  writer to a steady, nearly every day one.\u00a0 I have just rounded the corner on my \" Blogaversary \" and looking forward to seeing where this next year of  blogging my life will take me.  \n \nNow, 2010 was a fairly crap year: My  father died , my  Mother-in-law died , my  gall bladder  punked out on me. But some mighty good things happened, too: \n \nI  started this blog  and found a whole new amazing online  community of bloggers , especially the Special Needs parenting bloggers.\u00a0 And the  Hopeful Parents  site asked me to become one of their regular monthly writers. \n \nWe found a  wonderful new school  for Jacob that just \"gets it,\" and where he is thriving.  Ethan started to  fall in love with reading  and books. \n \nBut, most importantly, we didn't let our losses drive us apart, but rather bind us tighter together as a family;  sad but solid . \n \nAnd 2011? This year so far, after recovering from my  Gall Bladder surgery , I have branched out, exploring new writing avenues and challenges.  \n \nThanks to  The Red Dress Club , an amazing, supportive virtual writers community, I have begun to plumb the depths of my own childhood, writing  memoir pieces . \n \nI began to participate in Jenny Matlock's  Alphabe-Thursdays  writing meme, finding the simple alphabet prompts fun, and engendering some really  interesting posts . \n \nAnd most recently and thrillingly, I launched a guest blog series:  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays , all about sibling relationships in families like mine, where there are children with special needs.  \n \n \n \n \n There are some awesome guest posters here, please come by to read on Saturdays!  \n \nAnd that's us. These nuts in this nutshell. I hope you've enjoyed your visit, come back soon! \n \nOh, and you can also tweet me on Twitter (you can find me there  @squashedmom ) or come like me on  facebook .

{"date": "Sunday, April 3, 2011", "body": "\n Still Sunday. Barely. No intro. Here it is: \n \n @@@@@@@ \nJacob is clearly still on my mind these days (see  last week's SOCS ). And I am really bumping up hard against the wall of sadness right now. \n \nToday he went to a birthday party for one of his classmates, and it was way the hell out in the middle of no where in Staten Island and we got thoroughly lost on the way there, but eventually did arrive. and it was just Jake & me because Ethan wouldn't be caught dead with his brother today. \n \nAnd he was a little disoriented because it was and wasn't like the\u00a0 Chuck E. Cheese in our neighborhood that we go to regularly.\u00a0 And even though we were at a party of Special Ed, kids Jake was still way more out of it than the others, less connected, less THERE.  \n \nAnd it hit me in the chest today, that at almost 9, my son is looking more, rather than less autistic.\u00a0 And his development veers further off form Ethan's. And the shit that you can wave off because he's little and little kids do goofy stuff, well... Not so much anymore. \n \nNow wherever we go, if he is in his \"quiet mode\" (which despite my complaining that he talks all the time does happen)\u00a0 when people hear me talk to my son, they look at me like \"why are you talking to that big kid as if he's still a little kid\" but then when he starts to talk and is clearly too loud, too repetitive, too sing-song-y, too simple in his speech for a kid his age they get it. \n \nAnd then there's \"the look\". which I just can't take anymore. Sometimes its sympathy and sometimes its pity and sometimes its \"Oh, no this is one of those kids, I hope they get off the damn bus soon\" \n \nI really am thinking of getting him a t-shirt... maybe one of those \"I am autistic. What's YOUR excuse.\" or \"Please be nice to my mom, I have autism\" ones? \n \nBecause I was getting way too much of \"the look\" in the women's room at CEC today. And I almost said out loud into the room where nobody said anything to me but I could feel the ice daggers coming out of people's brains \"Because he's too autistic to send into the men's room by himself, OK?\" \n \nAnd because I am just so tired of being grim here... here's a bit of levity form my other son: \n \nEthan tonight was being giddy in the bathroom at bedtime, getting silly and I just didn\u2019t have the energy for it. \n \nMe: \u201dEthan, I really hope you\u2019re not going to be a pain in the butt to put to bed tonight.\u201d Ethan: \u201cWell, Mom you know we can\u2019t get everything we wish for, right?\u201d \n \nSmart ass.  \n \n @@@@@@@ \nYeah, that was probably a little over 5 minutes again today. So sue me. \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "body": "\n \n Today, April 2nd is World Autism Awareness Day.  My post for this  went up yesterday, because today is also Saturday, which means it's time for  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays  here at The Squashed Bologna. (New here? For the origin of this recently launched guest post series,  read this .) \n \nBut enough about that. You\u2019re here for this...  \n \nToday: a post from the fabulous Jill, otherwise known as Jillsmo who blogs at  Yeah. Good Times.  Like me, she has  one son  who is on the autism spectrum and  one son  who is not.  \n\u00a0 \n Jill often blogs on the snarky/humor side of things, which is awesome since laughter is as cathartic as tears. And more fun.  \n \nAlso, she is often foul-mouthed (a girl after my own heart, but don\u2019t click on the links if you don\u2019t like to read the word \u201cfuck\u201d) and, when truly pissed off, can rock  a rant  like nobody\u2019s business. She is honest, irreverent and  side splittingly funny , but also capable of rending the heart, too, when the occasion calls for that sort of thing.  \n \nAlso?\u00a0 Her love for her children shines through in everything she says and does.\u00a0  \n \n @@@@@@@ \n Cat Dancing  - by Jill \n \nMy two boys cannot be more different from each other. \n \nJacob, my 9 year old with autism, is sweet and mellow and prefers to be alone most of the time. He\u2019s kind of like a cat, actually: happy on his own, rejects the company of other people, but sometimes he\u2019ll decide it\u2019s time to hang out with you and then he\u2019ll just come and sit on you.  \n \nAnd when he does, you\u2019re so honored. And then when he\u2019s done, he\u2019ll get up and leave. It all has to be on his terms, though. \n \nBen, my 5 year old uber-NT (neuro-typical) child, is exactly the opposite. He\u2019s extremely outgoing and social, hates to be by himself, is constantly demanding that I accompany him to the bathroom or to the kitchen to get water, etc.  \n \nHe spends very little time on his own and when he does it\u2019s because he\u2019s engrossed in something and doesn\u2019t notice right away, but when he does notice, he\u2019ll immediately get up and come looking for me. \n \nIt\u2019s an interesting dance these two do with each other. Ben craves the affection and attention of his brother while Jake, for the most part, rejects him. And then there are the rare, magical \u201ccat-like\u201d moments when Jake suddenly decides that Ben is worthy of his time, and they will chase each other and play games and laugh and shriek like siblings are supposed to.  \n \nBut then it will end, suddenly; Jake will decide that playtime is over and he\u2019ll leave Ben to himself. Just like a cat. \n \nThere\u2019s only one rule in my house and that is that you need to be a nice person, other than that the kids pretty much have free reign. I don\u2019t believe in what I call \u201cforced sharing;\u201d if a toy belongs to one kid, he doesn\u2019t have to share if he doesn\u2019t want to. If it\u2019s a communal toy, they need to take turns, but if it\u2019s his and the other kid wants it, I\u2019m not going to make him hand it over.  \n \nThere are frequent turf wars over toy possession and they will always come to me for mediation, and when that happens I make them work it out between themselves. Unless somebody is about to get hurt, or if somebody isn\u2019t being nice, I\u2019m not going to intervene. I usually just shrug my shoulders and say \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, tell him.\u201d  \n \nI think it\u2019s good for both of them to learn how to navigate these social matters on their own; and doing it at home, with your brother, with your mom watching, is a safe place to learn. \n \nThe same goes for socially interacting with each other. Ben always wants Jake\u2019s attention and Jake almost always wants Ben to leave him alone, but I\u2019m not going to make Jake interact with Ben if he doesn\u2019t want to (as long as he\u2019s nice). I will make him tell Ben this, though, when he turns to me and asks if I\u2019ll \u201ctell Ben to leave me alone.\u201d  \n \nIf he wants to be left alone, that\u2019s okay, but he needs to be the one to break the news. As long as he\u2019s nice (he always is). \n \nThe other night Jake was upset about something. As is typical for our house, I had no idea why and he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u00a0 Jake and I were in his room when Ben appears in the doorway asking what\u2019s going on.  \n \nI tell him not to worry about it, which is what I say often, and he says \u201cI just want to give Jacob a hug.\u201d That\u2019s very sweet. But Jake immediately says \u201cNO, NO, I don\u2019t want you to give me a hug!\u201d and he practically ran in the other direction to get away from Ben. \n \nOh. The look of disappointment on Ben\u2019s face was so heartbreaking. He was just trying to help, and giving somebody a hug is the nice thing to do when they\u2019re upset, but he asked and Jake said no, and we all have to honor that. I could feel his pain, though; the pain of rejection. The cat didn\u2019t want to snuggle and even if it\u2019s not personal, it still hurts a lot. \n \nLater when Jake was in bed I went into Ben\u2019s room and thanked him for being such a nice brother. I said I was sorry that Jake didn\u2019t want to hug him but the offer was such a nice thing to do and I was really proud of him for offering. I could tell that he immediately felt better.  \n \nI hope he doesn\u2019t give up on Jake. A person can only tolerate the sting of rejection so many times before they stop trying. You have to: to protect yourself. \n \nLike I said, it\u2019s an interesting dance we do here. Sometimes toes are stepped on, but I hope that in the end they become graceful, beautiful dancers because of it. \n \n @@@@@@@ \n So now that you have read this post, you want to read more Jill, right? Good for you, you will so not be disappointed. She\u2019s got such a strong, unique voice.\u00a0 \n \n Try:  Musings on Autism , or how about:  Autism Contradictions , or this one, about visiting her son's classroom:  The Talk .\u00a0 \n \nYou can also follow Jill on  Twitter , where she has figured out how to be funny and snarky in 140 characters or less.\u00a0 So, do! \n \n And? Because it is MY blog? I\u2019m putting my comment right HERE, on the bottom of the post itself. So I get to claim \u201cfirsties\u201d because I can, OK?  \n \nJill, the thing is? I have a cat who is actually more like  your  Ben. She follows us around the house meowing for attention. The  moment  anyone sits down, she is right in their lap. She\u2019s a disgrace to  the  cat world and she doesn\u2019t care. She just wants people, people,  people,  24/7. \n \nShe even puts up with my autistic son  Jacob\u2019s complete  obsession with and un-gentle treatment of her. She  will let him push her  ears down, pull her tail, and lay his face on her  back, just to have a  human right next to her. She is pretty amazing,  and we feel really lucky  to have her. \n \nExcept  when she lays on top of my  computer and won\u2019t budge because my petting  to typing ratio had dropped  below the required levels. So she moved  from my lap onto the keyboard to  notify me that it\u2019s time to type one  handed and pony up some cat  stroking. \n \nHmmmm,  if I had just used a different word for my kitty? That  last sentence  would have sounded awfully NSFW and brought some very WTF  head  scratching to the folks who landed at this blog via searching a   certain, um, phrase.\u00a0 Love Ya. ;-) \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, April 1, 2011", "body": "\nHere is my beautiful son, Jacob. He has Autism: \n \n \nThere, so now you are aware. \n \nOK, as you (hopefully) know, today, April 1st is the kick-off of the very official (and alliterative) sounding: Autism Awareness Month, with tomorrow, April 2nd being World Autism Awareness Day. Well now, that's starting to be a mouthful. \n \nRumor has it they were originally going set the big \"Day\" for April 1st, to coincide with the month's kick-off, but then some wise person realized it might be a tad um, cruel? ironic? to have that fall on April Fool's Day. Ya Think? \n \nBut around here? Well every day is really about Autism Awareness now, isn't it? \n \nThere isn't a day that goes by that I'm not acutely, astoundingly, profoundly and matter-of-factly aware of my son Jacob's autism. \n \nYou would think that by now it would seem to be old hat, taken for granted, a given. And in some ways it is;\u00a0 just Jakey being Jakey.  \n \nBut this, too: as the boys get older and as the ways that I parent, talk to and interact with Jacob and his (mostly) neuro-typical (NT) twin brother, Ethan, grow more and more disparate?\u00a0 I am strangely growing more aware of Jake's autism day-to-day, rather than less. Go figure. \n \nThe fact that it really isn't going to go away, he really isn't growing out of it, and that this Autism Mom thing is rather surely a lifetime gig? Starting to settle into my consciousness about now, now that he is eight and a half and perched on the edge of little boy becoming big boy, soon to morph into teendom.  \n \nI might remember to wear blue today, I might not. I am not in a place to make big promises. \n \nWhy is blue now the official color of autism, anyway? (I thought it was \"Rainbow Puzzle.\") Well... I know some people think it's because that's the color of Autism Speaks logo, but I like to think it's blue from autistic author Daniel Tammet's lovely book \" Born on a Blue Day. \"\u00a0 Because I really like what Autistic folks have to say, themselves, about themselves and how they experience their neurodiverse brains. \n \nWell, there  is  a  lot  of wonderful going on right now... \n \nBuildings are being lit up blue for WAAD. (I'm just not typing the whole thing out each time, OK, you all know what I'm talking about, yes?) The amazing Jess of   diary of a mom  has been one of those spearheading a campaign to  light the White House blue. \n \nAlysia of    Try Defying Gravity  got Parents Magazine to post autism family stories on their blog all month long  starting with hers , today! \n \nJust about every autism blogger I know -- and we are many, a veritable small (and feisty) army -- is posting about it, embracing the blue or explaining why they're not. \n \nI felt I should do one of two things... write another \"important, big thoughts\" post about autism like this one:  From Autist to Artist\u00a0  or this one:  The Beauty of Each, Our Every Child. \n\u00a0  \nOr, on the other hand, I thought I might write a moving tribute to my  beautiful son Jacob , celebrate his specialness, the gift that he is in our lives, a balanced view of the joy and the struggles.... \n \nBut, ahhhhhh, crap, that was just not to be. I've had sick kids home from school (one or both) for three days now. My heart is just not into it. I want to burrow inward, not expand outward. \n \nI am sleeping neither well nor enough. In short: I am really worn out, worn thin. (My soul that is, my body... due to stress eating... thin not the operative word here.) \n \nI feel light-years away from brilliance, from inspiring anyone, least of all myself. \n \nI am so glad that I started the  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays  guest post series, and have some amazing posts queued up in the hopper, so that at least something useful and wonderful will appear here every Saturday for the next month, and beyond. \n \nAnd yet, I feel like I have no good excuse for this. There is no one thing, nothing particularly, specifically going wrong in my life. \n \nIt's just the cumulative stress; the day in day out, never a day off, never turning the reins over to someone else, never catching my breath before running off to the next mini-crisis, never just turning my responsible brain off even if I have handed a few tasks over to someone else. \n \nI am feeling crushed, not by a boulder but under the million pebbles, the aggregated weight of being a special needs parent, of autism, today. \n \nAnd I so didn't want this to be the story I told today.\u00a0 I want to tell you all about the beauty of my son Jacob, who is on the autism spectrum... or has autism... or is autistic or... I don't know what's the \"correct\" way to phrase it anymore. \n \nMy friend  Peter,  who is himself on the spectrum with NVLD has a son who is likewise \"on the spectrum\" somewhere but without a clear diagnostic label.\u00a0 What he says about his son is: \"G\" has a 100% diagnosis... of being \"G.\"\u00a0 And some days that's what I want to say about Jake. \n \nJacob is... Jacob. Unique and beautiful.\u00a0 My autistic snowflake. \n \nOK, I know I'm rambling now. Some days I like to ramble, to explore my brain, where my tangled thoughts take me. Today I just feel lost, unfocused.\u00a0 But today, this will just have to do. \n \nThis is me, this is my (ADD-rific) brain, this is my family, with autism. Messy, but hanging in there. \n \nHere is my beautiful son, Jacob. His favorite color is yellow. He has Autism: \n \n \n \n There, so now you are aware. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

(We moved the summer after.) \n \nAnd of that year? Nothing remains. \n \nThe memory box is empty.  \n \nOf the building that I entered daily? There is nothing, less than nothing, not even a shadowy pseudo-memory, mocking me with its vagueness. Just... a blank, a black hole. \n \nOf the classroom where many hours were surely logged, I get... nothing. Almost nothing. A feeling that the walls might have been green. The smell of thick paste and finger paint. \n \nI think my teacher's name began with an \"F.\"\u00a0 Mrs. F... nothing.\u00a0 I have been told that I loved her, that I looked forward to school each day. \n \nThis is inconceivable.  \n \nI am someone who has memories of laying in her crib. I have sketched the layout of the city apartment my family inhabited from my birth to age three and a half, accurate to the utter astonishment of my parents. \n \nI remember elevator rides from a two year old's perspective, buttons frustratingly, impossibly high, mockingly out of reach. The shock of a Central Park orange creamsicle to my toddler mouth on a summer day. \n \nI remember. Everything. \n \nBut that whole year of my life? \n \nAstonishingly. Nothing. \n \nExcept this: a person. \n \nOne girl. \n \nA friend. \n \nBrown pigtails. Blue dress. Brown eyes. Brown skin. \n \nBig smile, just for me. \n \nA friend. \n \nA best friend. \n \nCheryl. \n \nInseparable.  \n \nUntil we moved, that afterward summer, to the other side of town. Across the divide: Old Country Road. \n \nA different school, a different, \"better\" school district. Decidedly paler. \n \nSeparated. \n \nSomehow, improbably, our friendship remained intact, though we became occasional friends, different than schoolmates. \n \nOf Cheryl, much remains. \n \nGames of hide and seek with her older brothers Darrell and Victor that always involved basements and crawl spaces, delicious in their slight danger. \n \nThe sulfur smell of cap guns mingling with burning leaves on crisp autumn days. \n \nWatching \"The Birds\" on the little TV in her bedroom and scaring ourselves silly. \n \nThe smile that broke across her handsome, dignified, Doctor father's face in the presence of his children.  \n \nHer southern raised mother, calling me \"Sugar\" and melting my heart. \n \nHer mother's home cooking attempting to put some meat on my then skinny bones. \n \nA love pervading that house that was ceaselessly demanding yet unconditional. A rare combination. The sense, always, of high expectations for those children, including  the brother with Cerebral Palsy. An example set, which I have never  forgotten.  \n \nSleepovers. \n \nLate night whisperings, gigglings. Eventual sleep.  \n \nRiding home from a sleepover in her father's strange, wonderful car. The intoxicating smell of sun warmed leather rising up from the seats. \n \nOur neighbors wondering who the hell we knew who drove a Rolls. \n \n \n This post was inspired by a  prompt at  The Red Dress Club .

{"date": "Monday, March 28, 2011", "body": "\n I know I'm a day late (hence the ridiculously long post title). When I didn't get to this on Sunday, I figured: OK, maybe next week. \n \nBut then Fadra wondered on Twitter where I was and reminded me the linky stays live all week. And then today I found there's some stuff stirring around in my brain that I wanted OUT, but I've got neither the time nor patience to craft a thoughtful and careful post. \n \nI just wanted to spew it out in something more like... stream of consciousness. Perfect. Here goes: \n \n @@@@@@@@@\u00a0 \nJacob, my son on the autism spectrum is weighing heavily on my mind these days. He's just... off, lately. If you don't know him it's hard to explain. He goes through these phases, these cycles. He's rolling along, moving ahead, feeling like we're on a nice even keel, and then Whammo. Not. \n \nI mean, he's always autistic, clearly still on the spectrum, but when he's \"up\"?\u00a0 When things are clicking, when his brain is humming, when he's \"on,\" on a roll, on his game... whatever you want to call it, he is brighter, happier, cheerful, eager to engage, eager to learn, very much related. \n \nNot necessarily easy to be around, since in his cheer and enthusiasm he is often still too loud, close, insistent and repetitive. But still, happiness makes up for a lot.  \n \nBut when he's \"off'? It's not that he doesn't still have these peppy days, hours, minutes. It's just that he is terribly and unpredictably variable. That the the \"up\" Jake interleaves with the \"off\" Jake, who is at times: cranky, Irascible, louder, withdrawn, sad, angry, tired, growling, manic, pale, wild, lethargic but generally, globally much LESS related.\u00a0 \n \nSo even in his offness? Very variable. There are \"cranked up\" and \"down & out\" flavors to the off. He says \"Get out of my way\" and \"Go away\" much more than the \"Mommy come here\" boy of his happy, shiny days. \n \nAnd when he's going through one of these variable times? On any given day, hour or minute, you never know which Jake you're going to get: amazing-Jake or not-here-Jake. Flip the coin, your guess is as good as mine.  \n \nAnd the not knowing who I'm getting and the not knowing why he is like this again? Is killing me slowly. \n \n @@@@@@@@@  \nYes, I'm probably being a little dramatic there. I have to say the last line surprised me. I didn't know I was going there until the words just popped out.  But so they did.\u00a0 So it's obviously something I'm feeling, however deeply buried it usually is. \n \nAlso, people? Not only did I write this in a real 5 minutes (I've been known to fudge a bit) I wrote it in a real New York five minutes... while riding on the #1 subway train, on my way to the midtown DMV to renew my street-parked-car's expired registration... at lunchtime... on a Monday... at the end of the month. \n \nGlutton for punishment? Perhaps. But it needed to be done, and the ADD of me just could. not. do. it. until it was overdue. Sigh.  \n \n \n New to SOCS?\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026   \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post. No   proofreading or spell-checking. (BOY, that part is hard for me!) This is    writing in the raw. \n You can do it, too!\u00a0 Click on the link and let's hear your 5 minutes of brilliance... \n \n   \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, March 31, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \"Y is a crooked letter.\" \n \nI have no idea what this means. \n \nBut it's what my mother's mother, my Grandma Dunia, would say to my mother when, as a little girl, she asked those ten thousand questions little girls are wont to ask, the ones that begin with \"Why...?\" \n \nNot big on answers, that one, my  Grandma Dunia . \n \nShe was not fond of questions, idle curiosity (unless it was hers, about the neighbors), or anything deemed frivolous, extraneous, unnecessary. \n \nShe gave nothing away. Played her cards close to the vest. \n \nAnd drove a hard bargain over everything else. A hard nosed businesswoman, albeit in a stained apron. \n \nSome of it was probably guilt, survivor guilt over the disappearance of her very large family, the many sisters and brothers left behind to perish. She was the only one who escaped Eastern Europe in time, made it to America, outran the Holocaust. \n \nShe never spoke of her lost family. My mother never even learned their names, nor knew exactly how many Aunts and Uncles she had once had. Start to discuss it and Grandma would change the subject, walk away, a chain-smoking wall of stone. \n \nDunia was decidedly old school, a keeper of old world traditions; superstitions, if you like.\u00a0 My mother had to bite on a thread if Grandma needed to sew on a button, repair a hem whilst a piece of clothing was still being worn. Otherwise my mother was deemed in grave danger of having her brains stitched together. \n \nSalt, spilled, needed to be ceremoniously tossed over the left shoulder, promptly; praises or declarations of good fortune followed immediately by spitting towards the evil eye. \n \nWalk out of the house having forgotten something?\u00a0 Spin around three times before you head back, or you are asking for trouble and misfortune to follow you in the door. \n \nThe rules my mother lived by, and didn't ask \"Why?' \n \n \n \n Me, Mom & Grandma Dunia, 1974 \n I don't remember the day my  dying father stopped asking and answering questions, I just noticed, eventually that it had happened. He lived in both an eternal now and also a somewhere and when else, simultaneously. No questions needed. \n \nJacob asks questions, but not that, most crucial one; the most open ended of all questions, the can opener of a thousand worms: \"Why?\" Another gift of his autism. \n \nHe can now answer \"why\" questions that have very direct, immediate, specific and concrete answers... or else they turn into cyclical, existential round-de-rounds. \n \n\"Why are you crying, Jakey?\" \n \n\"Because I'm sad, Mommy.\" \n \n\"Why are you sad, honey?\" \n \n\"Because I'm crying, Mommy.\" \n \nRepeat. \n \nBut show him a picture of a very obviously crying boy holding a very obviously just broken toy, direct his attention to the toy in the boy's hands, point out how it is broken, and then ask him: \"Why is that boy crying?\" And you likely -- if he's on his game, not  having an off day  -- to get the answer: \"Because his toy is broken.\" \n \nProgress. Of a sort. \n \nI'm not knocking it. \n \nBut I still want to know WHY Jake is sad. \n \nAnd I still want him to ask me why water is wet, why the sky is blue, why birds fly... the ten thousand questions (typical) kids are wont to ask.  \n \nAnd I promise I won't brush him off with that useless nonsense: \"Y is a crooked letter.\" \n \nI will sit and hold his hand, begin with \"Because...\" as I did (and still do) so many times with his brother.\u00a0 As I have dreamed so many times of doing with him, opening up the worm can, and feasting on \"Why...?\" \n \nAnd, because it makes the \"Because...\" all the more delicious, fun in the answering?\u00a0 The crookeder, the better, I say, so bring on the \"Y.\" \n \n \n Top Photo: \"Mama\" New York City, 1952, Jim Steinhardt. My mother named this photo, saying the mannequin reminded her of her mother, always wearing an apron, often stained, and with a torn pocket. \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's  Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And \"Y\"? What's so crooked about it, really? Maybe it made more sense in Yiddish. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, March 27, 2011", "body": "\nMy lovely friend across the pond, Jen of  The King and Eye  (and  Irish Autism Action ) hosts a fortnightly (that would be bi-weekly to us Americans) link-up on her blog. She calls it: \n \n \n Blog Gems - Air your Archives \nIt's a chance to get fresh eyeballs on your great posts from the past.\u00a0 Each time there is a specific theme, and you select a post from your archives that fits the prompt. \n \nBut, being the generous, kind-hearted person that Jen is, it's a lenient rule. She states:  \"Broad interpretations of the prompt are encouraged so this could be a good chance to be creative!\" \n \nThis week, for  Blog Gems #12 , the directions were: \n \n \"This week   is  about favourite posts. Link up a post that you love or that got more  attention than you expected, or continues to get hits loooong after it  has been posted!\" \n \nMy first thought was to link my most \"famous\" post  From Autist to Artist . But then I thought, nah, most of the folks there have seen that one before. \n \nSo I went rummaging about my blog (always a fun Sunday evening activity) and settled on this one, fairly recent (January 2011) but with a lot of good juju to it:  Baggage . If you haven't read this yet? What are you waiting for? Click. Read. \n \nSo if you blog? I highly recommend that you go over to  Jen's blog  and join in the linky, it's a nice way to get to know each other all over again. \n \nAnd if you just read blogs? Still go over there and find some great new reading material from the linky-list.\u00a0 It's a nice chance to meet some kick-ass women from Europe and Australia, too. \n \nAnd while you're there, stay and visit Jen for a while.\u00a0 She's going through a rough patch with her middle son, the one on the autism spectrum. He's having an unsettling and unexplained physical health problem, and she could use some support. So go, listen, and give her a virtual hug. Thanks. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Saturday, March 26, 2011", "body": "\n   \n Welcome to the launch of my first ever guest post series:  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays.  If you want to hear my thoughts behind its creation? Read  this post  that announces the series. \n \n What it all boils down to: I've been feeling the need to read, think and learn more about sibling issues. And what better way to make sure I have the proper reading material than to ask some fabulous bloggers to write it for me? \n \n When the idea for this series came to me, I thought of so many bloggers from the special needs parenting community that I would love to have the privilege of hosting. I also knew, immediately, who I wanted to ask to be my very first guest poster: the wonderful Alysia  of  Try Defying Gravity .   \n \n We all have those bloggers about whom we think \"my sister from another family\" and \"my parallel lives Mom\" and Alysia is that for me.\u00a0 \n \n Certainly not my doppelganger, there are differences: She is younger than me by more than a decade, she has three boys to my two (and none of them twins), she lives in a house just outside Boston not a small New York City apartment, her beloved father died years ago, way too young, versus my elderly father's recent passing.\u00a0 \n \n But when I read her, when she is speaking about her  child on the autism spectrum , her  other children , her  pain over her father's loss , all I can think is: \"YES! YES! YES! I could have written those words!\"\u00a0  \n \n We have never met in real life (although hopefully, if all the stars align right, that will change in May) but I think of her as a dear friend, an important voice in my life.\u00a0 That I have an intimate connection to the area of Vermont she grew up in? Just more icing on the delicious cake that is our burgeoning friendship. \n \n I was thrilled when Alysia agreed to be my very first guest. Her lovely  post captures so many of the contradictions that are just a part of life in a household where there are multiple children and special needs: the sweetness and the bitter. \n \n Thank you,  Alysia , for being my guinea pig here at The Squashed Bologna's Special Needs Sibling Saturdays. But I have been speaking for far too long, let me now turn this space over to Alysia, and her moving words: \n\u00a0  \n @@@@@@@ \n My Brother, My Brother  - by Alysia Butler \n \n I\u2019m sitting on the couch with my eight year old son.\u00a0 We\u2019re watching the PBS show \u201cArthur.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s the episode where one of the characters, George, befriends a boy named Carl, who has Asperger\u2019s.\u00a0 I recorded the show a few weeks ago, even though we had watched it when it first came out last year.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n We\u2019re watching the part where Carl gets upset about a missing piece from his puzzle, and has a meltdown that surprises George.\u00a0 I look over at my son as he\u2019s watching the show. \n \n\u201cDoes that look familiar?\u201d I ask him quietly. \n\u00a0 \n \u201cYes.\u00a0 I remember watching this last year.\u201d \n\u00a0 \n \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cDoes it look familiar from home?\u201d\u00a0 He glances at me, knowing where I\u2019m heading with this. \n\u00a0 \n \u201cIt\u2019s all about a kid with\u2026you know\u2026\u201d He looks at me but doesn\u2019t want to say the word. \n\u00a0 \n \u201cWith what?\u201d \n\u00a0 \n \u201cWith autism.\u00a0 It reminds me of Howie.\u201d \n \nWhen Varda told me that she was starting a new feature on her blog called Sibling Saturdays, I was so excited.\u00a0 And then when she asked me to be the first guest writer for the series, I was humbled and honored. \n \nThere was no way I could say no. After all, Varda is the one who suggested the book \u201cThe Strange Case of the Origami Yoda\u201d for my Star Wars loving son, and I have her to thank for the copious amount of paper Yodas covering my house. \n \nIn many ways, Varda and I have similar lives.\u00a0 We both have eight year old boys.\u00a0 And we both have children on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 So when she offered me the chance to talk about my three boys and how we deal with autism in our family, I immediately said \u201cYes.\u201d \n \nNow, I don\u2019t have twin boys like Varda but I have an eight year old named Gerry, a four year old named Howie, and Lewis is our two year old.\u00a0 My middle son Howie is on the spectrum. \n \n The \u201cArthur\u201d episode ends and the \u201cNow a word from us kids\u201d part of the show comes on.\u00a0 It\u2019s a two or three minute segment highlighting real kids who can relate to what the \u201cArthur\u201d characters experienced.\u00a0 This time, it\u2019s two girls on the spectrum.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n One is talking about how horseback riding has helped her with her autism.\u00a0 Another one is showing off her inclusion classroom in her school.\u00a0 The girl shows the camera the different accommodations she has in the classroom to help her with her sensory difficulties and her organizational skills.\u00a0  \n \nAgain, I turn to look at Gerry.\u00a0 He\u2019s fiddling with a toy but he\u2019s still watching the show intently.\u00a0  \n \n\u201cWhen Howie goes to kindergarten next year at your school, those are the kinds of things they\u2019ll do for him there so he can be in a regular kindergarten classroom like you were in.\u201d \n \nHe looks at me in a panic.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019ll be in a regular classroom? Are you sure?\u201d \n \nI say yes, he\u2019ll be in an inclusion classroom, and I take a moment to explain what that is.\u00a0 I tell him they\u2019ll be going to school now at the same time, but that Howie will take the special education van to school, instead of the regular bus. \n \n\u201cOh, phew.\u201d\u00a0 The panic look turns to relief.\u00a0 I ask him to explain. \n \n\u201cI was worried about him being on the bus.\u00a0 He could get yelled at.\u00a0 At least one kid a day gets yelled at on the bus.\u201d \n \nOriginally I thought his panic was about being embarrassed by his brother.\u00a0 I realize now it was about protecting him, and worrying about him becoming too overloaded on the bus. \n \nSince our son Howie\u2019s diagnosis in December 2009, we\u2019ve been pretty up front with Gerry about the whole thing.\u00a0 We had to.\u00a0 Things were about to be very different in our household \u2013 from visual schedules to new therapists to a change in our approach to parenting.\u00a0 Gerry was becoming increasingly frustrated by Howie\u2019s behavior, and we had to explain to him what was happening and why his brother acted the way he did. \n \nWe gave him some books and talked about how his brother\u2019s brain is wired differently, and the things that come easily for other kids would be a bit harder for Howie.\u00a0 We showed him the new tools that we had to help his brother and told him that as a family, we\u2019d work through this together.\u00a0  \n \nIt was one of the hardest conversations I\u2019ve ever had as a parent.\u00a0 And that conversation continues almost every day. \n \nGerry has made some huge improvements in his understanding of autism and how it affects his brother.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gone from him saying things like \u201cI think we need an autism specialist in here!\u201d when he got frustrated teaching his brother a new game to now he tells me that \u201cwrestling on the floor together helps Howie with his autism.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ve always made sure he\u2019s part of the conversation when therapists and teachers come to the house so he\u2019s in the loop. \n \nBut it\u2019s not always perfect.\u00a0 Almost once a day we have to remind Gerry that his brother\u2019s verbal stimming and need for constant hugs isn\u2019t something that he can control.\u00a0 I end many days in tears because I\u2019m pulled in three different directions with each of my boys wanting something, but Howie\u2019s needs always seem to come first. \n \nGerry does his homework upstairs away from the rest of us because the early evening chaos makes it too hard for him to concentrate.\u00a0 Two or three times a week, my boys eat dinner in different rooms because Gerry just can\u2019t take Howie\u2019s behavior at the table. \n \nThose are the moments that rip me open inside as a parent.\u00a0  \n \nWe\u2019re only a year into this, and we\u2019re figuring it all out.\u00a0 As my husband told my son one night: \u201cHowie can\u2019t help what he\u2019s doing, and if there was a way to magically fix it all, we would.\u00a0 We\u2019re a family.\u00a0 And families work together and help each other, no matter how frustrating it can be.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s later on that night and all three boys are playing in our toy room.\u00a0 They have out a play tent, and have created a home for their Club Penguin toy puffles.\u00a0 All three are working together to create a puffle house \u2013 adding couches, laying out toy food, and making silly puffle games.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I hear laughter.\u00a0 I see my boys playing nicely together, interacting like \u201cnormal\u201d siblings would.\u00a0 It is a ten minute glimpse into what life is like in other homes.\u00a0 \n \n I turn off my autism mom brain for a moment so that instead of seeing pretend play and social interactions, I just see my three boys being brothers.\u00a0 For that brief moment, I am just a mom to my three sons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n And it. is. awesome. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \u201cI know that we are different, and we've gone our separate way \u2028 \n But we've got to learn to accept each other, for who we are today\u00a0 \n \u2028I know it won't be easy, but we both have got to try \u2028 \n To hold onto each other, until the day we die \u2028 \n Nobody knows you quite the way that I do \u2028And if you're in trouble, come to me, come to me\u00a0 \n \n My Brother, my Brother, whatcha gonna do\u00a0 \n \u2028My Brother, my Brother, I'm here to help you \u2028 \n Tell me your sorrows, tell me your fears \u2028 \n My Brother, my Brother, I'll always be here\u201d  \u2013 My Brother, My Brother by Aaron Neville. \n \n @@@@@@@  \n Remember what I said in my intro about parallel lives? Reading Alysia's post I just had to laugh at the end, because right now? My sons are obsessed with Club Penguin and puffles. I've even mentioned them in recent posts. \n \nI am particularly touched by her husband's words at the end  \"We\u2019re a family. And families work together and help each other, no matter how frustrating it can be.\u201d  And also somewhat envious.\u00a0 \n \n Right now our family is far from functioning as a cohesive therapeutic unit, and Jacob's brother Ethan rarely exhibits her son Gerry's depth of understanding and concern for his autistic brother Howie. But it's inspiring to read about and I aspire for our family to move in this direction. \n \nAlso, did you note that song at the end? That's Alysia's blogging signature; all her post titles are song titles, and she ends each post with the lyrics that have inspired her. Want to read more? You should!\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Go to  her blog , and enjoy. If you want more posts about siblings? There is  this lovely one , thinking ahead to her son's upcoming transition to Kindergarten, or  this one  about watching her younger son's development overtake his middle brother's. And then  this one   will  simultaneously break and melt your heart.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n An active member of the Special Needs parenting community, Alysia can also be found posting at  Hopeful Parents  and the  SPD Blogger Network . Finally? Follow her on  Twitter  and like her on  Facebook . \n   \n Thank you again, Alysia for being my very first guest blogger here, for helping to launch Special Needs Sibling Saturdays so spectacularly, and with such soul.\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, March 25, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n Jim Steinhardt, Dad, in his early 20s \n My father, James Bruce Steinhardt was born on March 25th, 1917. \n \nAs anyone who has been reading this blog lately knows, he died last year -- 12 days shy of his 93rd birthday -- on March 13th, 2010. \n \nToday would have been his 94th birthday. \n \nHappy Birthday, Dad. \n \nI miss you.  \n \n \n \n Dad & I with cherry blossoms in Riverside Park, 1998 \n I was going to write a long post, thoroughly lionizing his life, I was going to have a massive\u00a0 scan-a-thon session and toss up a ton of new old photos of him, but I am just worn out, without the energy to do that AND parent my kids. \n \nAnd you know who wins that equation. The boys, they are here with me, and Dad, well, he really can wait, now.\u00a0 So to hear more about Dad's life? Read  the eulogy I wrote for him  and delivered at his memorial gathering on March 28th, 2010. \n \nFor photos?  Here's a post  with some of Dad and some of his photographic work. And  here's another  with many photos of him. I'll likely be putting more up soon. \n \nBut I thought, today, in honor of his birthday, I'd tell one of his stories that I have not told before. A story that began with his birth... \n \nMy father was not born \"James.\" No, his birth certificate reads very differently. It was supposed to have been Benjamin, but the story goes that the uncle who was supposed to tell the nurse who was registering the name got terribly flustered with excitement, or perhaps he was a bit tipsy on celebratory sherry. \n \nBut, in any event, he gave the registrar the wrong name, a different one that began with the same letter, and thus Dad's original birth certificate reads: Bertram Steinhardt.  \n \nNow when my father would tell this story to me as a young child, I would take the opportunity to fall down laughing at this point. I thought this was funniest thing, ever.\u00a0 I would repeat the name, \"Bertram?\" incredulous, rolling it around in my mouth,  making the most of that clunky cluster of consonants 'round the  middle of it. \n \nBeing quite old fashioned, it had fallen completely out of favor by my time, so I had never, ever, heard the name used, had no idea it was the long form of the rather pedestrian but equally mothballed \"Bert.\" (This was long before Sesame Street made Bert and Ernie household words.)  \n \nBut it didn't end up mattering, for my father was never actually called Bert or Bertram.\u00a0 My father was an adorable blond, chubby baby.\u00a0 Here he is in late 1917 or early 1918: \n \n \n \n Sunny Jim \n At that time there was a popular cartoon character named \"Sunny Jim\" and that's just what everyone called my Dad as a baby and young boy.\u00a0 According to my father's story, this character was a cherubic blond boy  from a comic strip, much like himself. \n \nBut when I  looked it up  to provide a link for you all, I found instead that  \"Sunny Jim\" was a strangely coiffed old man created to sell \"Force\" cereal flakes in 1903. \n \n \n Maybe Dad looked like a wizened old man, as babies are wont to do, or maybe it's just that \"Sunny Jim\" was such a wildly ubiquitous character of the popular imagination of the time. And it was a very common moniker; an expression much used (often ironically): \"He's a real Sunny Jim!\" \n \nIn any event, wherever it came from, that's what they called my father, from the time he was born... \"Sunny Jim.\" \n \nAnd then, as the story continues, one day when he was about five years old, my father got really tired of being left at home when his brother Allan went off to school. He tagged along, and as he was old enough for Kindergarten, and the younger brother of a bright, well behaved student, the teacher went ahead and registered him.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n Baby Jim and big brother Allan, 1917 \n (Now, my adult mind questions the veracity of this story. Even way back then weren't there more official channels for something as important as school registration? Wouldn't a parent, an official document be necessary for this procedure? But this is my father's tale and this is how it was told.) \n \nThe teacher sat my father down, asked his name, and he said: \"Sunny Jim\" (the only name he had ever knowingly answered to). And so into the record books was entered one James Steinhardt, younger brother to Allan. \n \nNo one ever corrected it. His name remained that way in school records, and somehow continued on to his employment records, no questions asked. I don't remember when he acquired the middle initial\"B\" but that might have been a nod to the original Bertram. \n \nBut then he wanted a passport, his birth certificate was unearthed and he was in for a shock: his name was still legally and officially \"Bertram\" so he had to have it legally changed.\u00a0 He decided to keep the B. as his middle initial, but as he now had a son named Bruce, he used that as his middle name.  \n \nAs a child, I loved that my father had acquired his name in an  interesting manner, that there was a story to it. In this, as in so many things, he was much less \"boring\" than most of my  friends parents.  \n \nAll in all? I don't know how much of this is 100% true, as all those who were present at the time are now long gone. But this is something remembered by my father and passed on to me. \n \nMy father was not a hidden man. He told me all his stories, in great detail. They live on in me and I will tell them to my sons, so he will live on in them. \n \nThis is the story of his name, as my father remembers it, and that is true enough for me. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, March 24, 2011", "body": "\n Look: it's another piece of  FICTION  this week, people! And it's a good thing I'm a writer, because otherwise? I'd be starting to worry about all these other people's voices I'm hearing yakking away at me, inside my head. \n \n \nLet me begin by saying I fucking hate pink. It's just so... so... pink, you know. And I'm sorry about the cursing. But don't worry, if my kid were around I'd have said \"freaking\" or some other such almost cuss word. I'm not an idiot, I'm a halfway decent parent, after all. Unless you think I'm all evil and Satan-spawned because I'm my kid's \"other mother\" but then YOU'RE a hopeless idiot and I don't really care what you think, anyway. \n \nSo, my partner, Jess, my kid Ruby's \"official mother of record,\" the one who got to go through the whole 9 months thing, the one she calls \"Mommy\" (I'm \"Mamma-lu\", don\u2019t ask) is a bit younger than I am, doesn't have the pink aversion.  \n \nWell, actually, a bit more than a bit younger. Really younger, but not scary, could-be-my-kid younger. 12 years. I mean, I guess I could\u2019ve had a kid at 12, but if I'd done that I'd be fucked up in so many other ways, having a somewhat younger girlfriend/life partner/wife/whatever-you-want-to-call-her would be the least of my problems, you know.  \n \nIt doesn't cause trouble much. Just now and again, we seem to come from different cultures. Because when I was 20? We were Dykes, called ourselves womyn. But when she was 20, it was all lipstick lesbians. Pink? Doesn't throw her a bit.  \n \nMe? I got dressed in way too much of it as a kid, well against my wishes. My brother, on the other hand, my twin? Secretly longed for pink. Yeah, we\u2019re that kind of family. We were quite the pair, drove our mother batshit. I was a full-on tomboy and my brother fairly well into the realm of sissy. \n \nI would be rich as Midas if I could've have a dollar for every time I'd heard \"you should have been the boy and he should have been the girl, just look at your muscles and his pretty eyelashes...\" and then there\u2019d be the tongue clucking, and the pitying looks cast at our Mom who, as always, had her game face on. \n \nBut we\u2019re close, my bro and I, real close, which is a good thing, as it\u2019s how I get to have a biological connection to our kid, too.\u00a0 Because the \"father,\" the guy who supplied the baby juice? Yeah, him.  \n \nOur mom was a little freaked out by this, but as it was the only way she was going to have a bio-grandkid she settled in after a relatively short period of kicking and harrumphing (she\u2019s not a screamer, thank God). See, my brother didn't want to take on the full responsibility of parenthood. He's a travel writer and his partner\u2019s a major international finance dude. They are actual globe trotters. And kids? That doesn't really mix.  \n \nBut he\u2019s happy to be Uncle Dad, and loves Ruby to pieces. They take her shopping, even buy her pink dresses. With gusto. Because our daughter is going through this\u2026 this\u2026 phase (please God, let it be only a phase), they even have a name for it -- the \"Pink Thing.\"  \n \nNow I know the history of pink, that it's a relatively new phenomenon (no self respecting Women's Studies major from my era worth her salt doesn't know all about the social creation & scaffolding of gender difference markers). But it's just so damn much worse now. There's even a new book out about it: \"Cinderella Ate my Daughter.\" When I saw that on the bookstore shelf I laughed my ass off because, crapola, that's how I'm feeling right now.  \n \nWhat happened to my feisty four year old who liked to make mud pies and gave as good as she got? Three weeks in public school Kindergarten and she's all \"I'm only wearing dresses now\u201d and \u201cI NEED more pink.\"\u00a0 She's all \" this  is for girls and  that  is for boys\" with most everything I like to do downgraded to the \"that\" category.  \n \nYeah, I'm feeling a wee bit rejected round about now. Why? Does it show. Yeah. Well, OK, so where I'm going with this...  \n \nIt was my birthday the other day. Um, Happy Birthday to me. 49. OK? I'm not super uptight about it. It's not like I'm a Hollywood starlet who is likely never to work again once the first un-Botoxable wrinkles set in. But still, with a life partner twelve years younger? Next year will be a big deal. But anyway... birthday...  \n \nBesides shopping with Jess for my \"big gift\" Ruby likes to buy me a little something special by herself with her \"very ownliest money.\" No she doesn't talk that way any more. But she did when she was three and started this tradition. Nostalgia, OK. Shut up. \n \nIt has to be a small thing since her \"money\" is mostly change we've let her keep rather than weigh down our pockets with it. And now, of course that the tooth fairy has started to visit, those precious Sacagawea \"gold\" dollars. \n \nThis year, my birthday gloriously fell on a Sunday, which meant that for once I did NOT have early morning duty. I got to escape watching My Little Hannah Strawberry iCarly Montanna Pony Shitcake with the dear one. (Because Sunday morning is her weekly TV time, folks, and she milks it for all its worth.)  \n \nAnd I got served y'all. Breakfast in bed. Fluffy scrambled eggs, extra crispy bacon. And on a special heart shaped plate: the pinkest frostedest donut I have ever seen.  \n \nNow, I have a weakness for donuts. Can't indulge it much anymore or my waistline would be the size of a small planet. But every now and then, for a special treat, like on my birthday... \n \nRuby knows it, and so this was her special gift for me. A very special donut, the one she would have chosen for herself, the one she would most have wanted to eat, of all the lovely donuts in the fancy new donut store that recently opened up in our 'hood:  \n \nStrawberry flavored, pink frosted, pink sprinkled... with tiny pale pink hearts on there as well, just in case it wasn\u2019t pink enough. \n \nA thing of beauty. If you like pink.  \n \nAs she set the wobbly breakfast tray down on the cleared off nightstand, my daughter's eyes shone with pride. And with something else, too. Love.  \n \nI guess I don't hate pink quite so much, anymore. Today. \n \n \n @@@@@@@ \n This post was written for The Red Writing Hood prompt: \"Write a post inspired by this photo\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2011", "body": "\nFolks? I just don't have a coherent post in me. \n \nPreparing for the launch of  Special Needs Sibling Saturdays,  writing yet another  memorial post for my late father's upcoming 94th Birthday, and having another fictional voice pop into my head and demand to be heard and written about for this week's  Red Writing Hood prompt  have left me written out. \n \nAdd to that real life, with two (SN) kids, an elderly mother, a husband and a cat to care for, and I'm just plain wrung out, too. \n \nAnd yet here sits my blog with nothing happening on it since last Saturday. I'm watching the tumbleweeds rolling down main street, and none too pleased about it. \n \nNothing majorly newsworthy going on in my life, but I have little bitty somethings jotted down here and there, bits and pieces that I would love to just throw up here... wait, that's  not *quite* the image I wanted to project. Let's just say that while it's not Friday, I'm doing a \"Fragments\" post today, anyway. \n \nSo herewith follow some little snippets I've written that don't quite have enough gravy or gravits on their own to expand into a full blown post, but are too convoluted or substantial to wrap up in 140 characters to tweet out on Twitter... \n\u00a0  \n @@@@@@@  \nThe other night, apropos of nothing, but everything, Ethan blurted out: \"I really miss Grandpa Jim, I wish he were still alive, he  was a lefty like me.\" He then asked for a big lap hug. \n \nWhile curled up together on the sofa, Ethan proceeded to tell me that he knew how much Grandpa loved him and how unfair it was that he had died while he (Ethan) was still so young. He even cried a little. Way to break my heart, kid. \n \nI hugged him close and confirmed how very much his Grandpa had loved him, was proud of him, and ever so grateful to have another southpaw in the family. \n \n @@@@@@@  \nJacob... Jacob... Jacob.\u00a0 Jacob is going through... something... right now. \n \nWe're tinkering with his medications and supplements. Not found the magic formula yet. A new medication that we had thought might really be wonderful for him, help him to focus? Instead induced some mild mania. Damn. He started being difficult to put to bed, woke up before 6 AM. Every day. \n \nAnd did I mention he was on this over the February \"break.\"\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 *That* was fun. \n \nHe was just getting over that when we hit... The Time Change. Which I am beginning to think is an evil conspiracy against people with autism & their parents, not just an unfortunate twice yearly event. \n \nJake laughed maniacally in his bed for 1/2 hour each night and was impossible to wake up in the AM. Things have nearly settled back to \"normal\" which is a good thing as I am getting *really* tired of this. \n \nThe mania has tamped down, but is not 100% gone.\u00a0 Jake is currently rather obsessed with a MAD TV bit: \"The Fast & The Curious, starring Vin Diesel & Curious George.\" Yup.\u00a0 He keeps thinking about it and cracking himself up. Loudly. In school, too.  At least he has a sense of humor. \n \n @@@@@@@  \nI  am a night writer.\u00a0 My best writing... any writing that I do that is   at all powerful, lyrical, evocative, my strongest pieces? Were inevitably   written around 1 to 3 AM. Something just comes out from me then, in the   quiet time when everyone and everything else is asleep. (Well, it *is* NYC, so not exactly *everyone* but the noise is considerably tamped down, here in my sleepy family neighborhood, the UWS.) \n \nIt's just my natural   circadian rhythm, has been that way since I was a kid. The problem with   being a parent and this? I can't really sleep in now, can I?\u00a0 Jake's bus is   coming for him at 6:45 whether I have slept or not. He needs to be up   by 6 to be ready for that bus, so I have to be up at 5:45 to be ready for him. \n \nAnd people? 5:45 AM? Not my natural waking time. Off by about... oh, four, five hours. Sigh. About 10 more years of this ahead of me. Minimum. Sigh. More coffee ice cream anyone? \n \n @@@@@@@  \nEthan has a new obsession: Disney's  Club Penguin , an online open  ended cyber-community for the seven to ten crowd. And it's free! \n \nRiiight. Unless you want to save stuff or acquire things that are that really cool. Then you must buy a membership. At a monthly fee that's small enough to feel insignificant but large enough to make your kid balk at spending his own hard earned allowance on it.. \n \nBut  your kid can play at the free level for quite a while. Until they are  totally hooked and have invested time and care creating their special character.\u00a0  Gotcha! \n\u00a0  \n @@@@@@@  \nReading a friend of mine's blog about her life with her daughter with Aspergers recently, I felt an odd and uncomfortable envy. It made  me think again about how hard it is for me, for my husband, for our  family that the biggest manifestation of Jacob's autism is in the realm of language processing. Because the rest of our family? We are  talkers. \n \nConversation is how we relate. We think and talk and talk and think. And talk. About everything. And Jacob is just completely left out of that. So  much of my time with him is spent in silence, or listening to his relentless,  repetitive questioning about whatever his currently obsessive pet subject  is.\u00a0 Right now it's movies and movie opening dates, or the cat. \n \nMuch of the time I try to re-direct him, work hard to steer our conversations toward any other subject.\u00a0 But it's rather like steering a car with a blown tire, always pulling hard and fast to one disastrous side. \n \nAnd  I know that at age 4, 5, 6, when not yet capable of even this, I would have  been deliriously happy to be having these \"conversations\" with him. But still, it's exhausting, and not very rewarding.  \n \nEspecially because I am so aware of how else it might be, how  a delightful conversation  with an eight year old can just blossom forth. \n \nAnd  I know there are parents of more severe, non-verbal kids on the  spectrum who would give their right arm to be having these  type of annoying and inane conversations with their children. \n \nBut still, I sometimes feel I was  MADE to be the mother of a precocious, ever-curious, quirky, mildly Aspergers kid because I  am the repository of a thousand bits of odd and arcane knowledge.\u00a0 Nothing would delight me more than spending our time together looking up all the questions that stump  me. But that is just so not to be. \n \nAlso? I know there's a \"grass is always greener\" syndrome here, I know how much those friends and their kids also struggle, suffer; would never mean to imply they have it easier, a better life; I do not play the ranking game.\u00a0 It's just that I was, myself, more like an Aspie as a kid than a PDD kid like Jake, and it seems to be just a bit more comfortable to parent kids who are more \"like us.\" Although, of course, sometimes, so NOT. \n \n @@@@@@@  \nSo it's a limbo sort of time, this late-winter, this not-quite-spring.\u00a0 It has been some  hard winter, and everything seems to be in retreat, just waiting for the warming. Including, it seems, my brain. \n \nWe are in a holding pattern, all of us. I have no big, brilliant thoughts  coming my way; just the day to day plodding, trodding of the same earth.  I just keeping on putting one foot in front of the other, and l make it  through each day, one at a time. Sometimes that just has to be enough. \n \nSpring will come. Warmth and sunshine will return to the earth. The cherry trees will blossom. \n \n \n \n Riverside Park, April 1998 \n @@@@@@@  \nAnd, because I want to leave things on a more upbeat note... the other day Ethan, trying to cheer me up, told me: \"Mom, you know I hate Jacob LESS than I hate broccoli, right?\" \n \nWell, that's something, isn't it? Because he REALLY hates broccoli. \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

I have loved the feeling of community engendered on others' sites where there are regular guest posts, especially those with a specific focus, a series on a theme. \n \nI have been especially inspired by these guest post series I have had the honor of writing for: \" Small Moments Mondays \" at  in these small moments , and \" Mommypants Moments \" at  Mommypants .  \n \n(It is no coincidence that Nichole and Cheryl are two of the three hosts of  The Red Dress Club,  the wonderful virtual group that is such a lovely and supportive community for writers, whose prompts have sparked some of my favorite posts lately.) \n \nSo I thought and thought about what would fit in here, and about what would be meaningful to me. \n \nAnd I realized that I wanted to do something kind of new and different. (Because I can't just take an easy, tried and true path can I? Don't even bother to answer that one.) \n \nI thought: \"What is my biggest, consistently hardest parenting issue? What do I struggle the most with, what do I truly NEED a community for?\"  \n \nAnd it came to me quickly... the sibling stuff. \n \nBecause Special Needs kids and sibling issues? An explosive combination. \n \nNothing makes me cry more. Not the death of my father. Not autism in and of itself. But this: the extremely difficult relationship between my twin sons, one on the Autism Spectrum, one not. \n \nI don't have a handle on it. I have NOT figured out how to make it work in our house. There is yelling, there are tears. There are often two unhappy, lonely, angry boys and a mother who is at the end of her rope in our house. I am not proud of this. I am saddened, deeply troubled. \n \nThat my children mostly do not get along, that it is so hard for us to function as a cohesive family unit?\u00a0 Is probably the single most consistent source of pain in my life. \n \nSo that's what I'm hosting a guest series about. Not what I do best, but what I do worst. Because that's what I need to hear other voices about. \n \nI want to know how others do it, and how others don't do it. \n \nI know there are families where the typical children are their special needs siblings best friends, function as mini-therapists.\u00a0 I know there are families where they have had to make the heart wrenching decision to send a child with special needs off to a residential unit, so dangerous were they to their other siblings. \n \nI know most families stories lie somewhere in between. And I want to hear all the stories. \n \nBecause in every family where there is more than one child, and at least one of these children has special needs? It deeply affects the family dynamic, the balance, the rules of the house. What a family can and cannot do together. If, how and where they spend family vacations. Every fiber of the day to day fabric of their lives.  \n \nI have written about this myself,  here . And I realize that while I mention it in passing all the time, with phrases like \"...dreading a four day weekend alone with my boys who get along as well as Tom & Jerry...\" I have only ever written a full post about it that one time. I guess it's just too painful. \n \nSo I want to create a safe place here for people to talk about this. All of it. The good and the bad. The beautiful moments and the ugly truths. \n \nTo spark their thoughts on this, I sent my guest posters a set of questions: \n \n How you handle issues that come up between your kids?\u00a0 How do the NT (neuro--typical) kids rise to the occasion - or not - of helping out their special sib?\u00a0 How you juggle vastly differing needs of kids, does someone usually get the short end of the stick?\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n What you do when the fighting gets bad?\u00a0 What you do to help your kids support each other? Does it work? Really? How you scaffold your SN kids interactions w/ their NT sibs? How do you talk to your NT kids about how the SN kid's needs affect or limit your family's experiences and activities.\u00a0 How do they feel about this? \n \nWhat you do when the typical sibs friends come over \u2013 what you say to them about the SN kid and what you do if/when meanness comes up? What you do when YOUR NT kid is leading the meanness towards their sib (yes this has happened here)?\u00a0 What have your NT kids said to you about their SN sibs - the positive and the negative. \n \n If all of your kids are SN, how do you balance the needs of the most affected one against the needs of the others and vice versa? \n \nAnd most importantly of all: how do you FEEL about all of this? \n \nBut this is just a starting point. I know this series will evolve, that my guests will write about things I have not yet even imagined. And that's one of the reasons I'm so excited about it all, a chance to learn something, myself, on my own blog. I am near giddy with delightful anticipation. \n \nSo that's what's coming: \n \nSpecial Needs Sibling Saturdays: a Guest Post series. \n \nIt's starting up next Saturday, March 26th, which is, not coincidentally, the day after my father's birthday. I know I will be looking deeply backward that day. I needed to turn around the next day and plant a foot firmly toward the future, and what better way than to start this series?  \n \nI hope you're looking forward to it, I know I am. The first posts are rolling in and they're wonderful. So stay tuned. It all starts next Saturday... \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "body": "\nW is for Wallowing. \n \nIt's March. \n \nI am  not fond of March , anymore. Probably forever.  \n \nThis is my month for wallowing. Sorry. \n \nIt's not pretty. \n \nI am fairly useless. \n \nI have missed appointments, important appointments. Flaked out on friends. This is not like me, not my usual m.o. At all. \n \nI have not failed to meet Jacob's school bus or appear on time to pick Ethan up from school. Yet. \n \nWe're only halfway through the month, so not counting my hatchlings. Yet. \n \nThey might not even be chickens, anyway. Maybe dragons. Ethan is certainly reading enough books about them these days. \n \nAnyway, I might have also said that W is for Wandering, as that's what I feel like I am doing here, right now. Purposeless meandering, shaggy ambling through this post, through my life. \n \nI know that for some people, a death focuses them like a laser beam. Not for me. \n \nFor me it has the opposite effect. I get unmoored, lost, drift into gray space that is neither here nor there nor... where? \n \nI have written of how waiting for someone to die  is like limbo , but there is yet another limbo space, too: the time after. Clear at first, mourning enters into an ill-defined phase when the river of grief carries you to its shores and you find yourself wading back from unknown lands.  \n \nThere's a reason nearly every culture codifies its period of mourning. There are specific rites and rituals, I think, to help contain what can so easily become an out of control morass. Societies need grief to not swallow up their members, yet death must be dealt with or it all goes underground, bubbling up as depression, paralysis, an ebbing away of the life within those left behind. \n \nSo there are rules to be followed, rituals to be observed. I am no student of the fine art of mourning but a few come to mind: the Jewish tradition of shiva, Mediterranean widows' black, the catharsis of an Irish wake. \n \nI am also now very much aware of how much the Jewish tradition of waiting a year to place a permanent marker upon a grave feels so right. This particular point, that I have just arrived at, carries with it a certain gravitas, the end of the first dreadful year of dreadful firsts. \n \nYear one now becomes just another number, a part of the larger passage of time. Much in the way that a baby's first year is so scrutinized, celebrated, counted in days, then weeks, then months, so too a fresh death is counted so slowly at first. \n \nThe first days immediately afterward are barely separated into a night and day, such a blur they are. There are periods of light and darkness, yet holding little relation to sleep and waking. \n \nThere are many things that must be done, and with immediacy, for wailing babies and rotting corpses are on their own immutable timetables, wait for no one. \n \nThen time speeds up. Days become weeks, then months and finally a year is upon us. I can't count the months any more, it seems silly. So it goes. \n \nMy father is merely gone. For how long? Long enough that I must sit for a moment, concentrate to conjure him. \n \nFor my mother it is, of course, infinitely worse. I have my children, my husband, my friends and my whole life to keep me more than occupied. \n \nHe was, by the end, her whole life. Now gone. \n \nShe is without purpose, her too same days bleeding into each other, one just like the next. She used to take care of someone, she used to have a  companion. My Dad gave her life shape & purpose.\u00a0 Gone now. \n \nThe social worker at her residence  thinks she's depressed, wants to adjust her medications. Um, hell yes, she's depressed. With good cause. She's also just plain sad. She's in mourning. They had fifty one years  together, and only one apart. Give her time. \n \nI took Mom to a doctor's appointment today, to have her hearing aid adjusted. Sitting next to her in the cab, in the doctor's waiting room, across from her in the restaurant we lunched in afterward, we fell often into silence.  \n \nIt's not that we have nothing to say to each other, but rather we are so full of my father's absence, it makes it hard to talk. We don't want to wallow, to obsess, to go on and on about him and the missing of him. But there he is: the invisible elephant in any room we are in, too big to ignore, but really, can't we talk of something else? Apparently not, today. \n \nSo we sit in companionable silence. An elderly mother, her middle aged daughter (who is, improbably, still a parent of young children herself at an age when others become grandparents). We cup our warm drinks in out hands. We smile wanly at each other. We sigh.  \n \nIt is good that we have each other. \n \nTo wallow together on a day like today when the missing is strong. \n \nTo laugh together on a day like tomorrow, when, surrounded by my sons, her grandsons, we are propelled towards the future, fond memories of her husband, my father, the warm wind at our backs.  \n \n \n \n \n This post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And \"W\"? It's really a double  \"V\" isn't it, not a double \"U.\" So what's up with that name? Really, English, get it together. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, March 18, 2011", "body": "\n People? What follows is something really different. This is  fiction . Written for this week's \"Red Writing Hood\" prompt. A first here at The Squashed Bologna. So, with trepidation, herein lies a story... \n \n \n@@@@@@@  \n \n \n \n \nI have my brother's heart. \n \nI wish I meant this in a metaphoric way,  like... my brother really loves me or I hold his emotional well being in my hands, gently. But, unfortunately,  this is just not true. \n \nOr rather it is true, was, my brother does love me, did...  crap! And I am often his somewhat unwilling keeper. Was. Why do I keep doing that? But that's not the point here. The point... shit... how did I get so far off track? \n \nOK, starting again: I have my brother's heart. Literally. \n \nThere was an  accident, a terrible accident. A moment of dreadful fucking fate, unavoidable. \n \nWe  were on a train going... well, does it matter where we were going, really?  Since we never got there. \n \n \n \n \nMy brother had bounded into the window seat. And, for once, I simply let him have it. I always fight. For  everything. And I always win. That's who I am. That's the way with us. Has always been, as far back as I can remember. I know it's childish, but did I ever claim to be mature? No. \n \nHe is larger but I am more powerful, wily. I  care about the winning more than he ever will. Did. \n \nThis is getting tiring, this  remembering to use the past tense: he was, not is. And isn't that the whole point here, really? \n \nThe point, yes, the point... there was an accident, a major derailing. I'm sure you read about it in the papers, saw it on TV. It was ugly. Newsworthy. \n \nA fucking idiot left his car on the tracks at a crossing, a big suburban SUV that had never been off-road in its shiny life. If this idiocy was by accident or design is not known, may never be knowable. The idiot isn't talking. But does that matter, really? \n \nThere was an accident. A terrifyingly metallic screech of brakes. We braced. I don't remember much of anything after the initial jolt. \n \nI was told: our car rolled off the tracks, onto its side, as some of the outside came inside. A stout tree made its way through the shattered window and into my brother's brain. \n \nHulk tree smashed  through his eye socket, destroyed all the higher functioning parts of  his brain but left the stem untouched. Autonomic systems intact, it  erased who he was, just pushed the fucking reset button. \n \nAnd me? Pierced my  heart (or near enough to). Ironic, if you knew us. \n \nHe had the window seat. For once. I  thought I was being kind. For once. Mature. Or was I being prescient, my finely  honed survival instinct kicked in yet again? My brother has, had none, the  ultimate sap. \n \nIn any case, it came down to this, a pair of twin brothers straight out of the Wizard of Oz: Tin Man with no heart and Scarecrow with no brain. \n \nFraternal though we  are, were, we shared enough: blood type, some obscure enzymatic  factors, the requisite snippets of DNA to make us a good match. \n \nAnd my, our, poor mother had a terrible choice to make that was not a  real choice. You can transplant a heart. Not so a  brain. \n \nI have my brother's heart.  \n \nShe wishes it had been the other way around. She will not say  this, but I know he was ever the favorite, the son of her heart. I  don't resent it, it's the simple truth, just is. \n \n \nI  was a rotten teenager. I looked out for number one, ever. He was always softer,  sweeter, almost the girl she had always wanted. Also, not as smart. Like, Special Ed not-as-smart. Like I was going to be keeping an eye on him for the rest of our lives not-as-smart. \n \nThey call it autism now, but back when we were kids, they didn't have a good name for it. The neighborhood kids used to call him, well I'm not going to say it, but it's the \"R\" word. Or they did until I heard them say it. Then I beat them up. I may have fought with my brother, but if you looked at him funny? He's my fucking twin and you will respect him, understand?  \n \nI  was academic, athletic. The ambitious one, the winner in all things, the golden boy. I have degrees, a big job and the big money that comes with it. It should have been enough to win the mother-love prize. But I understand why she loved him more. \n \nDon't take me wrong, she was never a cold mother, no refrigerator there (was that ever a stupid theory, anyway). She loved me. Demonstrably. And would never admit to a favorite, claimed to love her two sons both the most, equally. \n \nI'm a lawyer. There is no such thing as equal. Her head may have refused to calculate, but her heart surely did. He needed her. Always would. I'm rather self sufficient. \n \nAnd my mother loves me still, now more than  ever. All she has left. Especially with that piece of him walking around  inside me. His big, shaggy heart. And, save our mother, he loved none other more than me, his brother, his twin, his one true friend. \n \nI had the smarts, but he had the bigger heart. Now mine, too. I win. Again. Fuck it. \n \nWe set out together for  Boston, but neither of us made it, were detoured, side by side, onto diverging  paths. \n \nMine led to this hospital bed in this rehab unit. Will eventually  lead home, back to my life that is now other than my life, singular and  singularly altered. \n \nHis led to a grave, that, in a year's time will  bear stone fruit, a headstone solidifying his last place on earth, in it. \n \nHis heart however, is still free, walking about this world, in me. \n \nI suppose I will now have to strive to become a better man. More tolerant, find my own inner sap. I owe him that much, that small portion of the everything that I owe and cannot pay back, ever. \n \nI would have given him my brain. What good have I ever done with it, really? One less corporate lawyer in the world? So what. \n \nBut it doesn't work that way. \n \nI have my brother's heart. \n \n \n \n@@@@@@@  \n \n This post was written for The Red Writing Hood prompt: \"Write about a time when you took a detour. Where had you intended to go and where did you end up?\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nOK folks, that was really scary. This is the first piece of fiction I have attempted to write in 15 years, the first I have \"finished\" in maybe 30. \n \nI actually had two different real-life stories that this prompt drew out from me.\u00a0 But as I attempted to whittle them down and shape them,  pick one?\u00a0 This STORY just came roaring out instead. And so I was all WTF!?!?\u00a0 But felt like I should just go with it, since I have been told this is the space to don my daring  Red Dress  and not my familiar fuzzy pink pajamas. \n \nI am open to, and seeking concrit on this, but as it's my first time, please be gentle ;-) \n \nLet me say off the bat: I know it is too long, I am way over the word limit. If I had another week to finish it, I could probably get it down. The cutting, the honing is ever my weakness. But I wanted to get it up & out there in a timely fashion. So here it is, in all its overwritten glory. Have at it. \n \nAnd for those of you who read me regularly, know that I do actually have fraternal twins of very different natures, one with autism?\u00a0 Please rest assured, the characters in my story are not at all my sons. They are not even in any way an imagined or projected future version of my sons. They, and their dynamic are wholly invented, it's just the specific constellation of the family's make-up (fraternal twin boys, special needs) that is vaguely drawn from my own life. \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

He once was, there is even the photographic evidence of it. \n \n \n \n Jake with Blue Bear (actually blue) at 5 months \n Bedraggled yet beloved, he no longer resembles a bear, having lost most of his facial features to the ravages of time and Jacob\u2019s strong teeth and saliva in the time when he sucked and chewed on everything in sight, those many early years of mouthing for sensory input.  \n \nBut \u201cBlue Bear\u201d he was dubbed and \u201cBlue Bear\u201d he remains, even though \u201cGray Rat\u201d would be a more apt description of his appearance these days. \n \nJacob chose him as an infant, out of the many stuffed animals gifted to the boys when they were born.\u00a0 And from about the age of six months on, they were inseparable. \n \nJake was the easy to put to bed twin, right from the start.\u00a0 Once they found each other, as long as Blue bear was in his hands, all was right with the world and off into dreamland they marched together.\u00a0  \n \nEthan, on the other hand was not a stuffed animal baby, not a lovey lover.\u00a0 When he had to have ear tubes put in at 18 months, we were told to have him bring along a special toy for comfort, and he chose his then current favorite: a hard plastic toy tomato from his play food basket.\u00a0 The doctor\u2019s office staff was quite amused by this, having never seen a child soothed by a toy vegetable before. \n \nEthan eventually succumbed to the charms of a stuffed brown monkey, and then moved on to a whole family of dragons, eventually hosting a parade of Pokemon and  puffles in his bed. \n \n \n \n Ethan and (stuffed) friends, age five \n But for Jacob, it is now and forever, always Blue Bear. \n \nWhen Jacob\u2019s chewing and mouthing was especially fierce, from about 18 months to age three (at which time Jake\u2019s sensory issues were decidedly ameliorated by a course of  Tomatis ) Blue Bear was a favorite object for this, too.  \n \nHe was always in Jake's mouth, never dry.\u00a0 Which led to his nickname among family members and in-home therapists: \u201cStinky Blue Bear.\u201d\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a washing machine in the apartment, have to use the laundry room in the basement, only available certain hours, which meant opportunities to sneak the soggy bear out of Jake\u2019s hands and into the wash were quite limited. \n \nSo Blue Bear got washed about once a week, twice if we were lucky and very wily.\u00a0 He smelled\u2026 a lot... like wet dog, like old saliva and a little mildewed to boot.\u00a0 But he survived, we survived, and Blue Bear is still the guest of honor at any table Jake sits. \n \nOver these many years Blue Bear has been Mom-repaired too many times to count. His arms lie flat, their former filling having leaked out slowly, one tiny bead at a time.\u00a0 His head has been reattached, a bit awry. His stuffing re-stuffed at least thrice. \n \nHe has one original plastic eye, the other rendered in black thread, hastily stitched into an imperfect circle that was nonetheless accepted, his owner anxiously watching the process, worried over his one-eyed bear, happily now made whole. \n \nTo an outsider's eye, Blue Bear is an ugly old thing, over-washed and worn out, warped from his original shape to near unrecognizability.\u00a0  \n \nBut of course to us, we see neither the chewed upon ears nor the grayed matted fur.  \n \nWe see only the love that has been poured into him for eight years, the comfort given, the tears snuffled out with head burrowed into his soft, giving, forgiving belly.  \n \nWe see only the beauty of Blue Bear. \n \n \n \n This post was inspired by the  Red Writing Hood  assignment to write a short piece about something ugly - and find the beauty in it. \n \n \n \n   \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, March 13, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n My Dad, Jim Steinhardt, 1961 \n \nToday, March 13th, 2011 is the first anniversary of  my father's death . \n \nThe moment of his passing was easy, a small, shallow breath inhaled, that never came back out again. \n \nBut the months leading up to this had been tough, excruciating for all involved. \n \nThe downside of having been such a strong, hardy man was that  his body held on , clung fiercely to life long past the point when it should have let go, his spirit mostly fled, his dignity shredded, pain and confusion his constant companions. \n \nI happened to not be actually present when he passed, but instead, after months spent daily at his side, was trying to be away for two days. Terrible timing. Or possibly necessary, so he felt it alright to go. We will  never truly know . \n \nIf you are new to my blog, have not been following along since the beginning, I ask you to get to know my wonderful father a little bit.\u00a0 Read  the eulogy  that I wrote for him and read at his memorial service, held last March 28th, two weeks after his death. \n \nIf you want to know a little more about him, still? \n \nVisit  his dealer , see some of his incredibly moving body of photographic work.\u00a0 Read this post,  here , about his last lucid days, a visit with my brother and sister. \n \nI would also like to share a few photographs of my father, as I have known him: \n \n \n Me & Dad, 1969 \n \n \n \n Dad, playing tennis, 1973 (his Rasputin phase) \n \n \n Me & Dad, on vacation in Mexico, 1978 \n \n \n Mom & Dad in Jamaica, 1984 \n \n \n Dad celebrating his Birthday, Florida, 1999 \n \n \n Dad with grandsons, 2006 \n \n \n Mom & Dad's 50th Anniversary March, 2009 \n \n \n Dad & Bruce, August 2009 \n Finally, here is how I am trying to remember him, as he looked just before it all went to hell:\u00a0  \n \n \n \n Dad, September 2, 2009 \n This photo was taken on my mother's birthday. We had all gone out to  dinner, came back to my parents apartment for the cake because Dad was  tired and needed to rest. Jacob was chasing their cat Willie around the apartment, as usual. Ethan was impatiently eager for the chocolate cake (well, for the icing from it, at any rate). \n \nWe didn't know it at the time, these things can only be  known in hindsight, but this was the last good time, our last family  gathering with Dad still fully himself. \n \nI know that today will be hard for me, for my mother whom I will shortly go to pick up, bring along to spend the day with me.\u00a0 Today, she certainly should not be alone, needs to be surrounded by loved ones and in a place where it alright to wear her sadness. \n \nThe fact that we will be bringing her along to a  shivah  visit? That my husband's beloved Aunt Roz died this past Monday?\u00a0 Well, that's just the icing on the shit-cake that has been this past year.\u00a0 At least we'll be hanging out with a bunch of people likewise in mourning, so our sadness will fit right in. \n \nSo today we will look at old photographs, share memories, mourn my father's passing and celebrate his long life, anew.\u00a0 We will recall the ways we were blessed to have him in our lives. \n \nAnd we will fondly laugh at the ways in which he was also a royal pain in the ass.\u00a0 Because, a man of much humor, he would have wanted it this way. \n \n \n \n   \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, March 6, 2011", "body": "\n I am REALLY tired of thinking and writing about last March and my Dad, about being sad, about death. So I am going to think and write about my son Jacob and what's been going on with him lately. Here goes... \n@@@@@@@@@  \u00a0  \nJacob has just figured out that the word \"March\" has two meanings, as both the name of the month and the verb. It's amazing to watch an autistic kid \"get\" a funny concept about a word, as abstractions come to him with much difficulty. \n \nNow whenever you ask him what month it is, he says \"March\" and stomps his feet like he's marching, then laughs. My heart swells and hope springs anew. \n \nHe's also making great strides in his imaginary play, being mad into creating scenarios with his \"guys,\" his little playmobil dudes and action figures of various stripes... a wild mix superheroes, bad guys and strange creatures. we have tons of them, acquired at various points as I bought mixed lots of used action figures on E-bay or picked up boxes full of odd toys at school fair tag sales, also we had tons of hand-me-down toys bequeathed to us from friends with older kids. \n \nWe have nearly every incarnation of Power Ranger from inception to present, heroes and villains Marvel and DC, Movie and TV characters aplenty and quite a few mystery characters, unknown and sometimes unknowable.  \n \nMy husband works in the comic book business and knows pretty much everything there is to know about superheroes.\u00a0 When I am not sure who a character is, the answer is always \"go ask Daddy.\" The other day Jake held someone up to me & asked \"Who is this?\" \n \nHusband squinted at it for a bit and then pronounced \"Chuck Norris,\" and sure enough, it was (the \"CN\" on his belt a big clue). As he came in the same box as Arnold Schwarzenegger, it shouldn't have been surprising. Jake is very fond of Chuck right now, he is a current favorite, along with the Power Ranger villain Dai Shi, but whom Jacob had decided is named \"Steve.\" \n \nChuck fits (sort-of) in Batman's car and is often seen driving it about the apartment shouting \"Hold on, I'm coming to rescue you!\"\u00a0 When it's time to pack up the  big gray bag  to leave the house I will ask Jake \"are we bringing Chuck Norris with us today?\" just because it tickles me to ask that. \n \nIt could be worse... he could be head over heels over the smurfs. \n \n @@@@@@@@@  \nAlso, I just can't help myself, wanted to add this picture: \n \n \n \n Some of \"The Guys\" (Chuck is 2nd from Right) \n Because \"the rules\" say I can add an intro, I figured an addendum was kosher, too. (What, me miss an opportunity for more words and pictures? Not likely in this lifetime.)  \n \nThat's all folks, really, truly this time. Now it's your turn...\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain  dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026 \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post. No  proofreading or spell-checking. (BOY, that part is hard for me!)

{"date": "Wednesday, March 9, 2011", "body": "\nOne year ago, on a sunny but cold morning not unlike this one today, I received a call from my father's hospice care nurse, Ed. \n \nIt was time. \n \nDad had taken in very little to eat or drink for days. He was emaciated. He was dehydrated. \n \nIt was time for my father to make the final move of the bitter endgame that had been going on so long it was hard to recognize he was finally there.\u00a0 Until he so clearly was. \n \nHis pain could no longer be well managed by his in-home hospice care team. \n \nHe was suffering. \n \nHe had wanted to die at home, but had become so un-moored in time and space, he no longer know he was home when he was there. \n \nThe comfort of easement from pain trumped the comfort of his own unrecognized bed. \n \nAnd so we made plans to bring him to Calvary Hospital.\u00a0 A lovely, caring hospice center in a godforsaken corner of the Bronx.\u00a0 They specialized in cancer patients, but were known to take the frail elderly, dying of other causes, too, if asked properly.\u00a0 And Ed, of course, had connections. \n \nWhen I got the call, Ed didn't know if a bed would be available right away, but as I rushed through my morning routine to hurry to my father's side, I got a second call from Ed: yes, there's a bed, and yes, they're coming for my Dad today. \n \nI was told it would take a few hours for the transfer ambulance to arrive, but they pulled up to the door of my parent's senior residence precisely as I was approaching the building.\u00a0 We rode the elevator up together, they: on the job, jovial; me: grim, ground flat, pasting a thin smile on my face to greet my mother without sending her into tears.  \n \nIt was decided that my mother and their lovely, loyal aide, Mina would ride to Calvary with my father, while I would stay behind and make phone calls, arrangements; meet them about an hour later. \n \nThey hurried out, and soon I was busy on the phone canceling his in-home aides, alerting my siblings, arranging pick-ups and drop offs and all sorts of childcare for my kids for what I knew was going to be a very long day. \n \nAlso, my least favorite call, alerting the funeral home that it was likely to be sooner rather than later, checking in to see that things were still as I had left them in December, when I had first contacted them, when we had been told to prepare for his immediate departure.  \n \nMina called to let me know they had arrived, that all was OK. \n \nI completed my tasks, sat for a few moments, shell-shocked, in the suddenly too quiet and still apartment.\u00a0 A cranky meow reminded me of my last obligation here: leave food out and a light on for Willie.\u00a0 He wove himself about my ankles as I poured him fresh water, told him his \u201cDaddy\u201d was gone. \n \nI hailed a cab on the street. Actually I hailed three or four before I found one who hadn't begged off, whose eyes didn't go wide with terror when I explained we were traveling to the Bronx and I had no idea exactly where we were going, knowledge of only a street address and a general neighborhood name to steer us. \n \nWe drove through grim, gray, blighted streets; past sagging houses whose children tumbled out to play on concrete playgrounds washed in visible car exhaust.\u00a0 I had thought I was too numb to feel any sadder, but that did it. \n \nI arrived, found Dad's room with Mom sitting by his side holding his hand. \n \nHe was grimacing, agitated, seemed to be in pain. We notified the nursing staff and mere moments later a morphine shot mercifully appeared. His face softend, his body relaxed once again into sleep.  \n \nI looked around the small, spare, clean room, noticed a shopping bag on the window sill, clearly come from home. \"What's that?\" I asked my mother, hoping it might be items she had packed to keep herself comfortable and occupied while waiting with my father.  \n \nHer unexpected answer: \"Oh, that's some clothing I brought along for your Dad.\u00a0 He'll need something to come home in.\" I must have looked perplexed because she added \"Remember? He was only wearing underwear when they brought him in here.\" \n \nMina comes up beside me, whispers that she had tried to dissuade Mom from bringing this bag, but Mom had insisted. \n \nI sigh.\u00a0 I take my mother's hand, stroke it.\u00a0 Look down.\u00a0 Look up.\u00a0 Bite my lip. \n \nAs gently as I can, I remind her: \"Mom. He's not coming home from here.\" \n \n\"He's not?\" she asks, her voice quavering; confusion, doubt, veiling her eyes. \n \nI understand. The many other times my father has gone into the hospital, gotten fixed up, he has always come home. \n \n\"It's not that kind of hospital\" I try to explain. \"This is a hospice. Here they will make his final days as easy and pain free as possible.\" \n \n\"Really?\" My mother asks, all teary. \"This is the end?\" her voice crackling, sadness swamping her anew. \n \nThis is the tragedy of my mother's terrible memory.\u00a0 While it has provided her the welcome relief from having to live day-to-day as we do, with the knowledge of Dad's immanent demise hanging over her head, it makes it constantly heart wrenching for us, who must over and over and over again inform her, as if for the first time, that his life is soon drawing to a close. \n \nOn the other hand, it does occasionally provide some comic relief.\u00a0 When my sister Lois called to discuss her travel plans for Friday, she asked to speak to Mom, too.\u00a0 I didn't listen in on their conversation, let my mind wander. \n \nAfterward, Mom asked me: \"Where are we? What is this place called? Lois asked and I couldn't remember... I told her it had something to do with horses.\" \n \nIt took me a moment to figure out the exact disconnect, and then I laughed.\u00a0 \"No mom, you're thinking of the cavalry.\u00a0 This place is called Calvary.\"\u00a0 She laughed.\u00a0  \n \nI didn't add that it is named for Jesus's suffering, the location of his crucifixion.\u00a0 Better for her think of rescue by a charge of horses, instead.\u00a0  \n \nIn a bit, Mina brought my mother to the cafeteria to get something to eat, to give her a break, and I was alone with my father for a little while. \n \nI watched him sleep.\u00a0 He woke for a moment, I stroked his gaunt cheek.\u00a0 He fell back asleep. \n \nAnd then? \n \nGod help me, I pulled out my phone and I took some photos of him, there. \n \nI knew they would be sad, awful, ghastly; not how he would want to be remembered. \n \nBut I also knew they were an important document, a testament to his great strength of will that I should not forget. \n \nI knew that exactly how he looked at the end would fade, and that somehow I needed it to not disappear completely; that I would need to remember, and that my father the photographer, the documentation, would understand this impulse, and approve. \n \nSo I took a few quick photos, the last of my father.\u00a0 At the very bitter end of his very long sweet life.  \n \nFor those who do not want to see the ending?\u00a0 For those of you want to remember him as the proud, strong, handsome man he was until nearly the end?\u00a0 Look immediately below, then do not scroll down further. \n \nHere is a lovely photo of my Dad, taken on my Mother's birthday in September, 2009, on one of his last good days: \n \n \n \n Dad, September 2, 2009 \n \nAnd now, if you are willing to bear witness to my father's gruesome ending, keep scrolling down to find this: a set of photos taken in my father's hospice room, three days before he died.  \n \nThey are not lovely. \n\u00a0  \nHe is emaciated. \n \nThere are scabbed bruises on his forehead and nose from the last time he had tried to get out of bed at home, tried  to stand , long after it was possible.\u00a0 He had banged his head on the protective bed-rail.\u00a0 Hard.\u00a0  \n \nHe barely looks alive.  \n \nBut still I need to share this. \n \nI need to show you, who wish to look, the father I last saw, held, kissed goodbye, one more last time, this one year ago. \n \nThese photos were taken on my phone, the only camera I had handy. \n \nThey are blurry and of odd color, the blue light from the window, the yellowed incandescence of his room lamp blending in the middle over his face, adding a further edge of the surreal. \n \nBut no, this was all too real: \n \n \n \n Dad, March 10, 2010 \n \nIt was hard to leave him, late that night, but I had to go home, rest, gather strength for the coming day. \n \nMy mother stayed.

{"date": "Saturday, March 5, 2011", "body": "\nAs some of you may have noticed, this week I have posted a little less frequently than has been my recent custom. In the year or so I have been writing this blog, I have gone from occasional blogger to  frequent blogger, revving up my blogging pace a bit last August and then again, considerably, in November.\u00a0 I have loved writing so often, found I have much I want to say. \n \nBut also? It's taking its toll. Writing is hard work. Wonderful and exhilarating and deeply fulfilling, but also? Lots of work, very time consuming. \n \nI know the answer for many would be to simply write briefer, simpler posts for a while. But that's not going to fly. Because me? I am long form. I can't help it. I have vowed to try to be shot and sweet, churn out fluffy bits like a \"real\" blogger is supposed to. I've even  written posts  vowing to do this. \n \nIt doesn't work. Of the 140 posts I have written, a handful are shorter than 600 words (many more than double that).\u00a0 And one of them was the  announcement of my father's death , choked out between tears and numbing post-mortem tasks. \n \nEven my purportedly \"Wordless Wednesday\" posts? Full of words.  \n \nSometimes I think: \"Oh, this one can be concise, pithy, this is one thought, one idea, one story... how long can this possibly get really?\" But then a funny thing happens on the way to the \"page.\" Between my brain and my tappity fingers on the keyboard more thoughts poke their way in. I make associations, spin fancy flights. In my world, convolution happens. all. the. time. \n \nAnd what was simple has become complex; full of words; words that need to be made just right, arranged and rearranged, expanded, shortened, pushed and pulled, tugged this way and that.\u00a0 And it has to have a button, an ending that pulls it all together, circles round to the beginning, does a special hat trick. I won't hit publish unless it's got that final punch. \n \nAnd I've wondered where my son Ethan gets his annoying perfectionist streak from.\u00a0 Silly me. \n \nIn any event, what I am (as ever, long windedly) saying here, is that if you continue to find fewer posts coming out in the next few weeks, don't panic. I'm not grinding to a halt, just taking a little slow down period, down-shifting, as it were, to a lower gear. \n \nThis year really started with a bang. The winter holidays were hard. My gall bladder was galling me, and I was also all keyed up in anticipation of my then-upcoming surgery.\u00a0 Then there was the  actual surgery . \n \nAround the time I started finally feeling nearly fully myself, recovered from the operation, I got a nasty viral bug that begat some nasty bacterial bugs. Finally the knock-me-on-my-ass sinus and bronchial infections were vanquished by nasty knock-me-on-my-ass antibiotics whose course was fully run at the end of February. Right in time for March. \n \nAnd March? Have I mentioned March? Not my favorite month right now. Or probably ever again. \n \nI used to love March, full of the formerly happy dates of my parents anniversary and my father's birthday. The first budding days of spring. The earth emerging from her hibernation in a spray of flowers and golden green shoots. \n \nBefore children, when my parents were younger old folks, active and sprightly, I would often go to visit them in Florida during March, to be there for my Dad's birthday, swim with them in the inviting green gulf. \n \nWe would walk the whiter than white beaches of Siesta Key and marvel at the coolness of the pure quartz sand beneath our toes, comb the black sand of Venice beach for fossilized shark teeth treasures. We would dine as often as possible outdoors, quayside, crack open lobsters together, decimate them, greedily sucking the meat out of even the tiniest legs. \n \nThey were so full of life, then and there. Remembering this makes me smile. And cry. \n \nMy first two posts of this month? About last year, my Dad, and the ending. Intense. Re-visiting my grief. I don't want to go on and on in this vein here. But I am not finding any other words easily coming to me right now.\u00a0 And I'm not going to push it, write about nothing just for the sake of taking up cyber-real estate  \n \nSo there may be fewer words for a while. But not forever. Expect a few more highly intense posts around the 13th, and again the 25th.  \n \nI do have a few posts that are nearly done, just hanging out in the hopper, needing a tweak and polish, and some of those will hopefully go up. I will also try to put up an actually  Wordless Wednesday post or two (well, one that has less than 100 words to it, to wordy me that's wordless) so be on the lookout for that, too. \n \nThere is also something big I am working on, about kids, the future, hopefully ready to launch at the end of this month. More on that soon. Today: just the faintest tease.  \n \nSo if things are just a little bit quieter here at The Squashed  Bologna for the next little while, do not despair, keep checking back. For like the Iris's bulbs lying underground, I will emerge from this fallow time, send fresh shoots up through the hard earth, seeking sunshine, reaching again for the light. \n \nIn other words: I'll see you around, pardners. (Yeah, I saw Rango today with Jake. Why do you ask?) \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?  To read or leave a comment, click on THIS post's title, or  HERE , to bring you to the post's page view.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 1, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n My parents in 2009, just before the big slide \n Today, March 1st, 2011 would have been my parents 52nd anniversary. \n \nI do not have to call my mother to know how sad she is today.\u00a0 I will visit her, take her out, provide distraction, a shoulder to cry on. \n \nI am sure I will have to rouse her when I arrive, in spite of my having called her yesterday, last night, again this morning to confirm that I am coming by.\u00a0 Sleep is the great drug, and my mother will have drunk its draught in full. \n \nMy mother tells me she wakes up some mornings forgetting, reaches out a hand towards the other side of the bed, feeling for my father, her husband, partner, lover, best friend of fifty one years.\u00a0 She finds instead Willie, the cat; a piss poor substitute, but he will have to do. \n \nWhen I come upon her in bed, my mother will wave me away, ask me to leave her alone, to sleep and wallow.\u00a0  But I will not.\u00a0 I will coax and cajole her, my third child to rouse  this morning. \n \nI am not trying to jolly her up, am not asking her to forget what day this is, but rather to let me join her in her sadness, in remembering him and their love.\u00a0  \n \nI will bring with me the book of photos I made, staying up all night the night before his memorial service, pulling all the pictures  I could find out of their frames, stripping other albums, pawing through boxes upon boxes of photos; trying to sum up, contain his life in one album. \n \nWe will leaf through photo after photo of Dad from mewling babe to smart boy in short pants to handsome young man (all fathers I never knew) and then onto his first marriage, son and daughter. And after that comes my mom, then me and our many wonderful years together, flattened out, frozen in time. \n \nLast March my father miraculously held out past their anniversary, although it was not a happy one. I wrote a post that day,  Nearly Finished Business,  fueled by love and sadness, looking towards the short horizon I clearly saw.  \n \nHe made it thirteen more days, halfway to the 25th, his 93rd birthday that I sensed he was aiming for.\u00a0 But, skeletal as a living corpse, strength that had held on past all reason for three long months finally gave out.  \n \nI think one of the reasons that zombies hold zero appeal for me, in spite of their recent, inexplicable popularity, is that I witnessed my father become one.\u00a0 By the end he was a barely animated thing, his body a husk, his mind long freed. \n \nAnyone who has gone through this process with a loved one?\u00a0 I am sure, likewise, finds nothing amusing about the fictional walking dead.\u00a0 We have lived with and cared for an actual one. \n \nThey are not scary-cute.\u00a0 They are sadness beyond knowing.  \n \nI have been dreading the coming of this.\u00a0 This month.\u00a0 This March.\u00a0 This explosive ending of our year of empty firsts, of sad anniversaries.  \n \nMarch is bracketed by my parents wedding anniversary and my father's birthday, and contains within it the date of his last drawn breath. \n \nA month from now, April 1st will breeze in on spring's wet wings and I will run to embrace it.\u00a0 It is also Autism Awareness Day, and that, too, shall be embraced with enthusiasm.  \n \nI apologize in advance for any dearth of cheer and mirth you may find in this coming month on my blog.  \n \nOne year ago, today, I was engulfed in my father's long, protracted dying. \n \nToday, this year, I will hug and tickle my children awake; kiss my husband a morning hello and goodbye; enfold my mother in love as we remember my father, her husband, together; embrace life. \n \n \n In all honesty, I must admit that I was already writing this post  when I got Mama Kat's latest writing prompts, so I can't truly say  \"inspired by\" this week. \n \nBut when I read those prompts  and got to number 3: \"What were you blogging about last year at this  time? What has changed?\" I thought \"Has Mama Kat been reading my mind?\"\u00a0  Because that is EXACTLY what I have been kind of obsessed with for a  while.\u00a0 This prompt seemed spookily tailor made to fit in with what's on  my mind this week. \n \nSo even though it feels a tiny  bit like cheating, I am linking up this post to  Mama Kat's writers workshop .\u00a0 Because it *is* OK for the universe to occasionally throw me a  bone, right?  \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Sunday, February 27, 2011", "body": "\nSunday, bloody Sunday.\u00a0 Yawn.\u00a0 OK... \n \n @@@@@@@@@  \nThis is not the first time I have  complained   whined   ranted  talked about this, (nor will it likely be the last) but tihs morning at 6:30 AM I sent out this tweet: \n \n \nThe puking thing last night was highly unusual (my kids have not been THANK GOODNESS stomach buggy pukey types, even when babies, they were not big into the spit-up thing).\u00a0 Usually it\u2019s just his brain that keeps Ethan up until 10, 11, 12 at night.\u00a0 Every night. Talking talking talking. \n \nAnd yes, he is my twin WITHOUT autism. And yes, I know how unusual that is. Jacob, the one WITH the autism is usually easy to put to bed. (Unusual for autism, I know.)\u00a0 Really, he\u2019s out like a light in like 5 minutes. \n \nJake has to get up at 6 AM for his bus on school days, and the downside to that is, once the habit sets into his brain? It doesn\u2019t un-set. so weekends, holidays? Still 6, maybe 6:30 if I\u2019m lucky. \n \nBut with Ethan his ADD or anxiety or some combination thereof makes him a terrible sleeper. It may also be his circadian rhythms. My husband and I are naturally both night owls, even as kids, too. We\u2019re writers, this is not unusual. Comes with the territory for many. \n \nAnd you know what I have also often said about apples and trees, yes?\u00a0 When I was a kid I was scared, no, *terrified* of the dark. Slept with the light on until I was 14. Yes, 14.\u00a0 Yes the light, full on, no wimpy, shadow inducing night-light for me. But I was an only child, I could do that without disturbing anyone else.  \n \nWe live in a small NYC apartment, they HAVE to share a room. Which sucks in so many other ways, but I won\u2019t go into that now.  \n \nBut here\u2019s the other, NEW thing.\u00a0 While this is our normal pattern, It has suddenly gotten worse. Last night Ethan was unable to sleep because his stomach hurt (not unusual, anxiety often does this) but then? the puking. Ended around 1 am. \n \nAnd, also? For the past 2 nights Jacob has suddenly been having trouble falling asleep, waking in the night, up BEFORE 6 yesterday\u2026\u00a0 We\u2019ve been trying a new medication on him, one that 2 different doctors had high hopes would really help calm down the constant talking, quiet the busyness in his brain, help him focus.\u00a0  \n \nIt may be doing a tiny bit of that.\u00a0 But the main thing it seems to be doing is disturbing his sleep. And the One thing I have been able to count on is his being my good sleeper. CRAP!  \n \nWriting this down, I am realizeing I am more upset about this than I thought I was.\u00a0 I was hoping this was the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d for Jake. Both Dr. H AND Dr. N independently came up with this,\u00a0 thought it might really make a big difference for him, that he was the right \u201ctype\u201d to respond to this particular medication. CRAP! Crappity crap, crap! \n \nAnd that\u2019s so NOT how I love to end my posts, with \u201ccrap\u201d. But today? It will have to do. \n \n @@@@@@@@@  \n This was my 5 minute Stream of Consciousness Sunday post.\u00a0 It\u2019s five  minutes of your time and a brain dump.\u00a0 Want to try it?\u00a0 Here are the  rules\u2026 Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n The Room \n \nThere was nothing particularly special about this room. In fact, what stood out most about it was its lack of outstanding features, defined, by default, by its utter ordinariness.\u00a0  \n \nBoxy, square, white walls, one wide window with white venetian blinds. Rented, transitory, stripped of all but the increasingly bare necessities:  \n \nBed. Dresser. TV that is no longer turned on. Nightstand where books had once piled high, reading glasses at the ever handy, now filled with supplies: tissues, non-latex disposable gloves, chucks, Depends, Vaseline, bandages. \n \nThe room my father spent the last three months of his life in.  \n \nHome. But not really home. The assisted living facility my parents had moved to a scant nine months before. \n \nMy father, he who had traveled the world, danced in tavernas on Greek isles, hiked the terraced rice paddies of upland Bali, swam with dolphins in Caribbean waters, now lived, or rather existed, in about 150 square feet of white room. \n \nWhen first home from the hospital, he would leave the room occasionally, shamble out to the living room to perch on the sofa, briefly.\u00a0 Once or twice he made it into the second bedroom, the room filled floor to ceiling with his life\u2019s work: his photographs. \n \nShelves overflowing with boxes of negatives, prints; once ordered, now haphazard and random as his brain. A worktable splayed with his astonishing  black and white images,  waiting in vain for his hand to turn them once again, leaf through, arrange, plan books, shows, a future.  \n \nBut in the last, his final month, there was no more walking. There were  no more words . Up until the very end though, he would still, on occasion, stand.  \n \nIt was impossible. He had no muscles left in his legs, no strength, no breath, hardly any blood coursed through his desiccating limbs.  \n \nYet stand he would, and, for a handful of heartbeats, gaze out the window into the vast brightness.  \n \nFrom the 19 th  floor, looking west from the east, there were mostly rooftops, a glass and steel high-rise or two looming above, piercing the sky, proclaiming the cityness of this cityscape view. \n \nBusses rumbled below. Pedestrians well bundled in their winter wraps. Dogs being walked, children being strolled.  \n \nBut my father did not look down. He looked out. And up. Into gray wintering skies. I have no idea what he saw, what beckoned at his horizon.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nAnd then, at the very end, his domain shrank again. No longer inhabiting the room, he instead inhabited the bed. A rectangle, roughly six feet by five. Covered in the soft mauve comforter I had purchased for him when he came home from the hospital.\u00a0  \n \nMy mother hated it then, wanted her old down comforter back, resisted the truth of the need for machine washability and fast drying. Now she loves it, runs her hand over it, thanks me for buying it. Not remembering why. \n \nWe would all take turns laying beside him, ever so gently stoking his back. Because only with the reassurance of touch would he rest, sleep deep.\u00a0 Like a colicky baby that needs to be held and rocked 24/7, so too was my father at the end of his life. \n \nAfter he died, and a little time had passed, my mother moved to a smaller apartment within the building. \n \nIt was my job to pack her, to move her, and then to slowly go through all of my father\u2019s many things, to dismantle his workspace, parcel out his photographs, his life\u2018s work, for cataloging, storage, posterity. \n \nAt long last I was done. And as I left their apartment for the last time, I needed to stand in that bedroom once again. Empty this time, truly, but for faint ghosts. \n \nI stood at the window, looked out, up.  \n \n \n \n The Window \n \nA moment froze in time. I took a photograph. I cannot say what I saw, felt. \n \nI then looked west, towards my home, towards the schoolbus that needed to be met, the dinner made, the homework supervised, the bustled life lived in our too full, overflowing rooms. \n \nI left, closed this door for the last time. \n \nI went down to my mother, waiting in her apartment, twelve stories below, to sit with her in her widow's lair and look out together on the city, a little bit closer to the earth. \n \n \n This post is linked up with the  memoir prompt over at The Red Dress Club.\u00a0  To see the prompt, click here. \u00a0 To go to the link-up and read other posts, click on the button below:\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Friday, February 25, 2011", "body": "\nT is for Television.  \n \nTelevision... \n \nTV. \n \nIdiot box.  \n \nOne eyed monster. \n \nThe lazy mom's babysitter. \n \nMy son Jacob's true love, language teacher, and best friend. \n \nI have such a love/hate relationship with this beast.  \n \nI am a child of the second great age of television, the 1960s.\u00a0 My husband, seven years my senior, was a child of the first, the golden age, the 1950s. \n \nWe watched TV, we loved TV, but it was different. Inane kids programming wasn't available 24/7.\u00a0 We watched family shows, as a family. \n \nWe watched the news, because that was on and our families were interested in the world and what was happening in it.\u00a0 My family watched a lot of public television, and I learned a lot of science, culture, history there. \n \nThere was a downside. In the 1960s everybody on TV was white. Really, very few exceptions. They stood out. It was bizarre, a weird, completely un-true mirror of the world. I got to witness the sea change, the transformation across my lifetime. Although I skipped a few years. \n \nHard to believe, but it's true: from about 1978 through 1987, nearly a decade, I did not own a television. I would watch when I went home to visit my family, at friend's houses, in bars, Superbowl parties, Oscar nights. \n \nBut TV, in those years? Not a daily part of my life. \n \nHard to imagine, now, where barely an hour goes by that some screen doesn't come on. \n \nMy kids watch too much, are too enamored. I know that, but its hard to change. \n \nJacob, like many autistic kids, learns well through repetition. He really did learn much of his early language from the television, from videos that tied visuals to words, helped to make more abstract concepts (above, before, friend) visual, visceral. Computer programs helped him learn to read. \n \nBut the line between helpful and too much? Very fuzzy, a quite wavering line in the sand.  \n \nThe other night the boys and I were watching the rather inane, yet somehow enjoyed by us, \"Family Game Night\" show on TV and I had a moment where the normality of TV dissolved away. (When words appear to lose their coherence and meaning it's called dereifying... I wonder what to call it for an object?)  \n \nAnd I was staring at this box of moving lights and pictures squatting on a low table in our living room. (Yeah, we still have a deep square box of a TV, circa 1995, wanna make something of it?) \n \nA person appeared on it and I thought \"How strange... here's this person I do not know, in my living room talking to me. This... box... delivers stories and entertainment, information, and so much more into my very living room.\" \n \nAnd I thought about what a strange thing it is to live at this specific time in history where this is so, and for such a large part of humanity. More people in the USA have televisions than have indoor plumbing. No lie. \n \nThink about it: a thousand channels and still crapping in the woods seems like an OK trade off to some folks. \n \nAnd we have so many of these screens in our lives, I know my children will find it very hard to conceive of a time before; before these magic panels of information and entertainment... capable of enabling heretofore unprecedented levels of connectedness, or  our isolation. \n \nIt made me wonder (constantly, as a former anthropology major like me wonders about, questions, ponders every presumably unquestionable cornerstone of my own culture) what someone from a completely pre- or post- modern civilization (or an alien visitor) would think if they wandered into an American living room and saw that object of frequent worship on the mantelpiece in all its glory. \n \nI would love to explore from a fresh, clean slate perspective the role that TV has in our lives. But it's not easy to do, precisely because the first thing this glut, this overload of info does is to make a clean slate impossible. \n \nIt is very difficult to have my own thoughts and ideas on things when so many others are available in overwhelming, flooding proportion with the click of a key, the push of a button, the swipe of a finger. \n \nAnd as I dive into all these other images/ideas? The first thing that comes to mind is this perspective... \n \nMy friend Todd Alcott, long before he was a hotshot LA screenwriter, when he was a not-quite-starving but always quite brilliant New York City playwright and performance artist / monologist, wrote a fabulous piece wherein he speaks in the voice of the Television, embodying the spirit of TV, as it were. \n \nI have seen him perform this monologue, have a copy of it in a closet somewhere, in a cardboard box full of his early writings, solemnly handed to me to read once (for that is how writers seduce, with our words) in the five minutes, twenty plus years ago, when I was his girlfriend. \n \nSomeone recently created a video to go along with Todd reading his Television monologue.\u00a0 And, because this is 2011 and anything created can now be found, uploaded, widely distributed... you can watch it here: \n \n Television is a drug.  by Todd Alcott.  \n \nRight now, I think I will let this stand, add nothing more; but this... \n \nThere is small part of my soul,  luddite, that wonders what life would be like unplugged, and longs to experience that with my kids, for even a brief while, a vacation, perhaps.\u00a0 Although they would enter that experiment howling and screaming, probably becoming completely unhinged. \n \nBut afterward?\u00a0 The real world; unmediated, unfiltered, unveiled, unshrouded, un-predigested by the screens...\u00a0 it beckons. \n \nBut, oh...? If I want to blog about it? I'll have to bring along at least one screen-like device. Oh, well. \n \n \n \nThis post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And isn't it nice that \"T\" is also the letter and name of my favorite drink, tea? \n \n   \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, February 22, 2011", "body": "\nMemory is tricky.\u00a0 There is the memory of childhood events and the telling of these events. \n \nThe older the memory and the more frequently retold, the less distinction exists between these two, the fuzzier the line between actual, visceral memory and mere story, until I can only guess what was my direct experience and what has been told to and by me and now feels remembered. \n \nBut tonight I shall attempt to trick the trickster, to carve back the lacquered layers of an oft-told tale to find the little girl hidden within\u2026 \n \n \u00a0***** \nIt is dark.\u00a0  And I hate the dark.\u00a0 I find it very frightening, the quiet and the shadows. \n \nI see things in the shadows, always.\u00a0 The swirling shapes that menace, the snakes under my bed, the things I cannot name, that I know intend me harm.\u00a0 Light vanquishes them all, and I long for light. \n \nYet here I am in the dark, forgotten in this forgotten room in my grandmother\u2019s house.\u00a0  In here, there is darkness, but not quiet, for the sounds from the living room, from the commotion without, still flood in. \n \nWhen I was hustled into this room and bade to stay still and quiet, the door was pulled closed, but not completely, so there is a slim rectangle of yellowed light brightly rimming the doorway through which the world continues to exist. \n \nAs my eyes adjust to the darkness I see that the shape in front of me is an ancient cot, folded up like an inchworm humped in mid crawl.\u00a0 I crouch down behind it, lean my face in, seeking comfort.\u00a0  But its sprung wire cage presses harshly into my soft six year-old cheeks, so I retreat, sit on the wooden floor and warily wait. \n\u00a0  \nThe musty smell of things long unused overlays the cigarette smoke drifting in from the living room, which has itself mixed with the usual scent of the house, a heady blend of fried onion and old dog.\u00a0 But then a new tang wafts in, tinged with something odd, metallic. \n \nWatching occasional shadows flicker through the yellow rectangle, I listen for clues, cues as to what is going on and why I am here. \n \nFirst there was a guttural male voice and high pitched female screaming, then police sirens wailing closer and closer, doors banging, more voices, male and female, talking, shouting, talking again.\u00a0 And through it all, the soft sounds of a woman sobbing. \n \nI almost drift off, but for the churning in my gut, the fear I have been forgotten, will remain here, always.\u00a0  \n \nThen, eventually, someone remembers - the child! - and comes to get me.  \n \nIt has been a long time.   \n \nIt is over.\u00a0  This is the aftermath.   \n \nThere is still a policeman, a doctor.\u00a0  In the alcove, between the doorways of the unused bedrooms I see a young woman in a short dress with bandages covering her legs, arms, face.\u00a0 She is talking to the police, shaking her head.   \n \nThe doctor is putting on more bandages.\u00a0  There are many of them.\u00a0  They look pale against her warm brown skin, and some are starting to turn crimson as the blood leaks through.  \n \nI fall asleep on the sofa, and wake in my mother\u2019s cradling arms, being carried out to our waiting car, their evening out cut short; my father, somber, at the wheel. \n \nI never sleep over my Grandmother\u2019s house again. \n \n ***** \nThis is what I believe I have actually clearly remembered from that evening.  The rest of the tale, cobbled together from memory bits and what was subsequently told to me over the years to become part of my memory, is in my repertoire of colorful childhood stories, and goes like this:  \n \nWhen I was six years old, my parents were going out and asked my grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother, to watch me.\u00a0  As it was Saturday night, the night of a regularly scheduled poker game, she didn\u2019t want to, but reluctantly allowed my parents to drop me off to stay with her for the night.  Naturally the game went on as scheduled and I was left to entertain myself, as I saw fit.   \n \nWhen you think of the term \u201cGrandmotherly,\u201d the soft, warm, nurturing indulgent presence that implies?\u00a0 An image of my grandmother will not come to mind.\u00a0  She was anything but.\u00a0  She did not like children.\u00a0  My mother\u2019s childhood?\u00a0 Not particularly happy. \n \nOn this particular evening the poker crowd was large, so card tables had been erected in the living room, with maybe a dozen players gathered round.\u00a0  There was much smoking, probably a fair amount of drinking, though that really didn\u2019t register to my six year-old self. \n \nThey were having a jolly time.\u00a0 I was sitting in the pushed to the wall sofa, playing with my etch-a-sketch, oblivious, when the trouble started.   \n \nOne of the card players was a young woman who had recently broken up with her man, and he had not taken it well.\u00a0 His mind had turned to a decidedly \u201cif I can\u2019t have you then no one will\u201d bent, and he walked through the front door that evening with a knife, intent on ruining her beauty. \n \nI did not see this.\u00a0 I heard a door bang open, a male shout, a female scream.\u00a0 And then I was swiftly picked up and deposited in that dark, musty, unused bedroom turned storeroom.\u00a0 As it was just off the living room, I heard everything, but made little sense of it, having no context. \n \nThey really did forget about me in there for the longest time.\u00a0  When I came out there were police taking statements and a doctor bandaging up the girl.   \n \nI was told what had happened was this: The ex-boyfriend had come in with a switchblade held high.\u00a0  The crowd had attempted to keep him from the woman, but he got to her and began slashing away. \n \nSomeone had procured a baseball bat at about the same time the police arrived.\u00a0 So whether it was because he heard the sirens or wanted to avoid the bat, he bolted out the back door, vowing to return with a gun, finish the job.   \n \nMy grandmother got a hold of my parents and told them to come get me, which they did rapidly and with great alarm.   \n \nWe were told that this man did indeed come back later with a gun, but the police were laying in wait, and apprehended him at the door.  \n \nMy grandmother continued to live in that house and play poker nightly with that same crowd until she was felled by a stroke some four years later, to live out her remaining years in a nursing home (where she stripped all the other old ladies of their nickels daily in gin rummy).   \n \nThe stroke came upon her during a poker game, and the rumor was that she finished the round before she keeled over because she had held the winning hand. \n \nSomehow, I believe this to be true.\u00a0  \n \n \n This post is linked up with the  memoir prompt over at The Red Dress Club.\u00a0  To see the prompt, click here. \u00a0 To go to the link-up and read other posts, click on the button below:\u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, February 23, 2011", "body": "\nYesterday I told an...  interesting story...  that took place in my Grandmother's house when I was six years old. \n \nSince I haven't picked up my camera in over a week, and have no new pictures to share, I thought I would show you some old ones, and link it to yesterday's post. Make this a \"theme week\" as it were. \n \nSo here are some photos (and further tales) of my mother's mother, my Grandma Dunia. She was a tough cookie, a no-nonsense broad. Not the least bit sweet and cuddly; I have no idea what that kind of grandmother would be like. \n \n \n \n Dunia and Joe, my Mother's parents, around 1920 \n \n \n Grandma Dunia, with her children and their spouses, around 1960. \n \n \n \n Grandma, me and Dad, my house, 1967 \n My father had no great love for his mother-in-law. He said of her: \"She has no appreciation of art, not a drop of poetry in her soul. If you can't eat it, make money from it or gain status by it, it's useless to her.\" \n \nAnd he was not wrong. She was a survivor, the only member of her family to leave Eastern Europe before the holocaust. She was a shrewd businesswoman. And not a very nice mother. My mother has spent much of her adult life in psychotherapy. Not without cause. \n \n \n \n Grandma shortly after her stroke, surrounded by her granddaughters. \n Many years ago my mother tried to explain to her  mother why she was in therapy. Unable to find the right words, she eventually blurted out: \"Because I'm just not happy, Mom.\"\u00a0 To which my grandmother replied (just like in the old joke): \"Happy? Pffft. Who's happy?\" \n \nGrandma was decidedly old world, old school. In her world, people don't go into \"therapy,\" they just go about their business. Unless they don't. Unless they break down. \n \nThen they lie on the living room floor for two months in a semi-catatonic state while their twelve year-old, eldest daughter takes over running the business and the care of her younger siblings. And when they snap back out of this breakdown? They never thank their daughter for holding the family together. In fact, they never speak of it again, because weakness is shameful.  \n \n \n \n Three generations (Me, Mom, Grandma) 1974 \n Yes, my mother is the eldest. Her younger brother, my Uncle Walter, is a psychologist and her younger sister, my  Aunt Marilyn , is certifiably crazy. Go figure. \n \n \n \n Surrounded by granddaughters (Jess, Annette & Me), 1974 \n Grandma Dunia: businesswoman, candy-store proprietor, poker-player, chain-smoker, bootlegger, the go-to-woman if you were a gal \"in trouble\" before abortions became legal. \n \nYes, I may have some more stories to tell. \n \n \n I\u2019m linking up to Wordless Wednesday at  Angry Julie Monday . \n \n \n \n Looking for comments?

(I must be getting old, this time speeding up thing is getting really out of hand.) \n \n OK, I'm going to stop promising \"no more whining\" like I did here last week.\u00a0 Because you know it's going to happen again.\u00a0 Like today.\u00a0 Sorry I feel like crap.\u00a0 I can't WAIT to be off the antibiotics, they really do mess with my head.  \n \n \u00a0@@@@@@@@ I've been suffering bouts of blog envy lately, and I really don't like feeling that way. You know the \"why does she have 1500 followers and get 100 comments on every post when I only have 170 and usually only get a handful of comments and she's been blogging for less time than I have\" thing. Sigh. Resisting the urge to try to change my blog or my voice to become more \"popular.\" time to shake my head clear and get over THAT. \n \nAnd the funny thing is that while I've been running all over the internet reading other people's blogs and comparing myself to them? I haven't been doing what I love best, which is writing. My own stuff. DUH. \n \nSo I\u2019m unhappy. That I\u2019m not writing. So what do I do? Do I write? DUH, that would make sense, so no\u2026 Read more other peoples stuff. Go on Twitter and listen in on other peoples scintillating conversations and not join in but feel bad I\u2019m not included. Check my sitemeter every 5 minutes and feel bad no one new came. Oh, someone came, but they stayed for less than a minute. Why do I do this to myself? \nAnd thank goodness I got my period Friday night (sorry for the TMI, guy readers of which I have maybe 10) because that helped explain some of my blues.\u00a0 I call the down day or 2 before the event my \u201cseeing the world through shit-colored glasses\u201d time.  \n \nAnd when I feel like this? Five minutes with the kids exhausts me. And don\u2019t you know it\u2019s school vacation week! And I would be looking forward to spending time with the kids, if we all could do the same fun things, if my kids actually enjoyed being with each other.  \n \nActually that\u2019s not the problem. Jacob loves being with Ethan, wants to play together all the time.\u00a0 Ethan would prefer for his twin brother to be swallowed by a black hole never to reappear again. And I have a week of this to look forward to: Jacob pleading and pining and Ethan yelling and rejecting, unless I separate them, but there are two of them and only one me.  \n \nSo I guess maybe this is also why I have been tiptoeing a little too much through the tulips of other people\u2019s bloggy lives, and obsessing about truly meaningless trivial things like my blog stats lately: Escape baby, escape from the crap that is my life. Sigh.  \n \nTime to catch an hour of sleep before Sunday with the kids is upon me. I love them, I do, I just wish family time existed in any sort of easy way right now. And can I add??

I'm just a bundle of joy and light these days.  \n \nHey, stick with me, it's not that bad... \n \nI am NOT about to whinge* away right now.\u00a0 (No promises for the future, though, sorry.) \n \nThis is actually a Mommy Confessional; a tale of habitual mom-fail. \n \nIt is *I* who am sucktastic, not my life. (Well, OK, my life IS sucktastic, but that's another tale for another day.) \n \nReady for it?  \n \nMost days, this is dinner for my eight year-old son, Ethan: \n \n \nYes, indeed, that's shaped chicken nuggets and peeled apple slices.\u00a0 Do you see anything green on his plate?\u00a0 No, I didn't think so.\u00a0 If you give the man a vegetable he acts like you've tried to poison him. \n \nIf you give the man a cooked meal that involves multiple ingredients, sauces, spices; actual, you know, cooking involved in the preparation?\u00a0 He acts like you've tried to poison him. \n \nIf you give the man anything to eat that does not fit the definition of \"kid food\" Ethan keeps in his head?\u00a0 He acts like you've tried to poison him. \n \nIf you giver the man a piece of fruit that is not an apple, peach or apricot... if you give the man an apple that is not a Granny Smith... if you give the man a dessert that is not chocolate or lemon... if you give the man Chinese food that is not fried pot-sticker dumplings... if you give the man milk that is not chocolate... if you put any sort of topping on his pizza... well, you know.\u00a0 Poison, ACK!!!! \n \nOK, you're getting the point.\u00a0 Ethan is incredibly rigid about food. \n \nI feed him as well as I can within the constraints of his limits.\u00a0 Grains are often whole.\u00a0 Everything is mostly organic.\u00a0 He eats the high quality, high-end version of junky kid food.\u00a0 He takes daily vitamins to make up for the lack of anything green in his diet.  \n \nHow has this come to pass?\u00a0 It's complicated.\u00a0 It evolved.\u00a0 And it centers mostly on my survival. \n \nAnd I know this is not abysmal failure.\u00a0 He doesn't eat fruit loops with coca-cola for breakfast.  \n \nBut I still feel bad, knowing that I have not done everything I could have done to help make him a better eater. \n \nI was a child that had family meals every night, where we all sat down together, ate the same home-cooked food and engaged in lively conversation. \n \nThis is not what I pictured feeding my family would look like: the kids eating separately, and completely different meals from each other, often with the TV on so they actually eat and do not fight through the whole thing. \n \nYeah, I said completely different meals.\u00a0 And it's not just the constraints of Jacob's special gluten-free / casein-free (GF/CF) diet that causes that.\u00a0 It's this.... \n \nEvidence I am not a COMPLETE mom-feeding-failure.\u00a0 This is dinner for Jacob, Ethan's twin brother: \n \n \u00a0  \nYes, indeed, that's real chicken, fresh fruit salad (pear and pineapple), GF/CF crackers, and, wait for it... broccoli.\u00a0 Which he asked for by name.\u00a0 As in: \"I want broccoli for dinner tonight, Mom.\" \n \nI know this not a real home-cooked meal.\u00a0 This was assembly.\u00a0 The chicken is rotisserie from the market.\u00a0 Someone else made those crackers.\u00a0 I did cut up the fruit and steam the broccoli myself, though (ooooo, cooooking). \n \nBut still, all basic food groups represented?\u00a0 Eaten with enthusiasm?\u00a0 It's a win. \n \n\"Wait,\" you think, \"isn't Jacob your autistic son, the one on the autism spectrum, who are usually notoriously difficult eaters?\"  \n \nWhy yes, yes he is.\u00a0 But no, no he isn't.\u00a0 Because, as I've said before (and I'm sure I'll say again), if you've met one kid on the autism spectrum... you've met *one* kid on the autism spectrum. \n \nAnd Jacob breaks a lot of the rules and assumptions people have about autistic kids.\u00a0 His version is: he loves food, vegetables included.\u00a0 He is willing to try anything once.\u00a0 Interesting flavors?\u00a0 Bring them on.\u00a0 Not rigid at all. \n \nAlso, about sleep?\u00a0 Kiddos on the spectrum are notoriously bad sleepers, many needing melatonin to help them shut down their brains.\u00a0 But Jacob has always been the better sleeper of the twins. \n \nPut him to bed and he's down in five minutes.\u00a0 And his  snuggly bedtime routine ?\u00a0 Takes about five minutes.\u00a0 He needs (and mostly gets) a good 10 to 11 hours a night of sleep.\u00a0 Goes to bed at 7:30 on school-nights.  \n \nEthan on the other hand, as I have noted before (and if you follow me on Twitter you have heard many a 140 character grumble from me about), is just HELL to put to bed.\u00a0 He's a classic night owl. He revs up at bedtime. Gets anxious. Wants to talk for hours.\u00a0 Is scared of the dark.\u00a0 Hates to go to sleep. \n \nSometimes he melts down completely and literally rolls around in his bed kicking and snarling like a cartoon Tasmanian Devil. Sigh. This is usually on a Sunday night, when the anticipation of the transition from weekend-time to school-time just unhinges him. \n \nThere are many, many ways in which my autistic son is actually the mellower, easier going, more laid back of my two boys.\u00a0 Go figure. \n \nSo if I feed my high-strung, high-maintenance non-autistic son on (high-quality) kid food until his tastes expand and his palate matures?\u00a0 Please don't judge me. \n \nI know it's a mom-fail.\u00a0 But sometimes these are necessary. \n \nSometimes we just have to let ourselves be sucktastic at one part of life, so we can carry on  brilliantly  with at least some of the rest. \n \n \n \nThis post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's Alphabe-Thursday writing meme. And isn't \"S\" just a curvaceous, sexy looking letter?\u00a0 DOH! Wouldn't \"S is for Sexy\" have been a much more fun post? Next time, my friends. \n \n \n * I know I am American and here we say \"whine\" but I  like the Britishism  \"whinge\" so much better. Must be the influence of  my dear Australian  friend.

I apologize. I don;t like being a whiney whiner. It is just the convergence of so much crap. \n \nJust as I was FINALLy feeling about 90% recovered from my January's gall bladder surgery? I came down with a stupid head cold. It seemed like nothing much at first, annoying, but then instead of getting better it lingered, got worse, and I started feeling just generally awful, deeply fatigued. \n \nI kept carrying on, and stupidly, of course, on a day I felt a little better I went out and got everything done that I had not been able to do on the down days preceding it, causing me to completely fall apart the next day. I have kids, one with autism, I have a mother who needs to go to doctors. Mom's not allowed to be sick, remember? \n \nThis past friday I FINALY hauled myself off to doctor who diagnosed me with a really nasty sinus infection PLUS bronchitis.\u00a0 He was even saying things like \"Wow, that's really inflamed in there!\" Um, not what you really want to hear from a man with a scope up your nose. And can I say OW! that's the first time anyone ever did that to me. and? It fucking HURTS! Especially when you're infected and inflamed (Duh!) \n \nAnyway, I'm on this really nasty heavy duty antibiotic (Levaquin if you must know). I HATE this antibiotic passionately. It is anti-life. And the crazy thing? I ASKED for it. I said to the doctor: let's pretend you gave me a Z-pack and I took it and then started feeling better but as soon as it was two days past my last dose I strted feeling worse again and came back to you and then you prescribed the evil but effective Levaquin.\u00a0 Let's just skip that whole first part and cut to the chase, give me the bad shit. \n \n(OK I didn't say \"shit\" to the Doctor, just thought it loudly) Because Levaquin, for me?\u00a0 It completely knocks me on my ass with intense fatigue, constant low-grade nausea and\u00a0 dizziness / wooziness. And did I mention how expensive it is? $13 dollars a PILL is my CO-PAY.\u00a0 But also?\u00a0 It fucking works. (It also, apparently, causes me to curse much more frequently in my blog than usual, sorry!) \n \nSO this is my LAST whiny rant about feeling like shit.\u00a0 Even if I keel over tomorrow, I won't blog about it - promise! \n \n @@@@@@@@ \nOK, I went a little over 5 minutes. So sue me.\u00a0  \n \n Also?\u00a0 Did I mention that it's 6 AM and I have not really been to bed. Because besides knocking me on my ass?\u00a0 This  antibiotic also makes me wired and jittery. \n So the 2 hours of sleep I  got sitting up on the sofa is all I'm getting tonight.\u00a0 So it's going to  be FUN being me (or married to me) today. \n Cheers, folks!\u00a0 \n New to Stream of Consciousness Sundays?\u00a0 Here's the beef: Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post.

{"date": "Sunday, February 6, 2011", "body": "\nOne year ago today, on February 6th, 2010: \n \nMy father was still alive, but very busy dying.\u00a0 And I was very busy caring for him and for my very sad, overwhelmed mother. \n \nMy son Jacob was still in a school that was not wonderful enough for him, where they did not truly see him, did not love or challenge him.\u00a0 And so I was very busy trying to find a new Special Ed school for him for the coming academic year. \n \nI sat down at my computer and wrote my first blog post, began this blog: The Squashed Bologna \n \nAnd so on this, the occasion of my one year anniversary of starting this blog (or \"Blogaversary\" if you will), I thought I would reflect a bit and take you back to  the beginning . \n \nSomeone asked me recently why I blog.\u00a0 They didn't quite get it.\u00a0 I suppose it seems odd to those who don't.\u00a0 Like wearing your underwear on the outside for all the world to see.  \n \nFor me the answer started out simply, and grew more complex as my blog writing and my relationship with the blogging world grew, expanded, and became more complicated, too. \n \nThe basic answer: I began blogging as my father was actively, painfully dying a long, drawn out, difficult death.\u00a0 I just could. not. tell. one. more. person. what. was. happening. and. how. I was. doing. \n \nA friend of mine was keeping a blog about children's books and what her kids were reading, and I loved reading  her blog .\u00a0 She told me how easy it was to just go on Blogger and start writing and encouraged me to do it.\u00a0 And so I did.\u00a0 (Thanks, Jill!) \n \nI needed to be able to say to people: \"You want to know what's going on with me and my Dad?\u00a0 Read the (damn) blog.\"\u00a0 I could pour it all out there and not have to tear myself up repeating everything over and over again to everyone. \n \nI had thought up the title \"The Squashed Bologna\" some time ago, as I was feeling so caught up in sandwich generation stuff.\u00a0 The few years leading up to my father's death were full of emergency room visits and hospitalizations; health crises and rehabilitations.\u00a0 Many were the times I would disappear from my family for days on end to be by my father's or mother's side in hospitals. \n \nI had also been writing about and thinking about autism for a long time  (because of my son, Jacob), but privately, in my journal, just for me.\u00a0 I had done a lot of research, learned a lot about neurobiology and brain biochemistry. Was turning into an autism auto-didact. \n \nPeople had been encouraging me to write a book, but that seemed like  such a big deal, and I couldn't picture taking on such a huge enterprise  at that time.\u00a0 Plus my ADDish brain balks at large projects, gets  overwhelmed by the amount of details that need to be taken care of.\u00a0 I  freeze up, unable to begin, daunted. \n \nA blog post however?\u00a0 A trifling thing, short, sweet (at least in theory, I know my posts often go into overtime), un-daunting, attempt-able, do-able.\u00a0 So I did. \n \nAs I began to write and post I realized that I wanted to use my blog to speak about  autism  and  ADD  and to tell  sweet stories about my children , too.\u00a0 I wanted to show what family life looked like to us; so, so different from what I had imagined while I was peacefully gestating.\u00a0 (Well, maybe not so peacefully considering how nauseated and generally uncomfortable I was throughout my pregnancy.)  \n \nThe good and bad about blogging, being self-published, is that there is immediate gratification there, a big plus for ADD-brained folks like me.\u00a0 You write it, you hit the button, poof out it goes into the world, for better or worse. \n \nAlso?\u00a0 I have spent pretty much all of my adult life as a blocked writer.\u00a0 Everyone who has known me well has encouraged to write.\u00a0 I have many pages of half written stories,  plays and essays in files dating back to 1978.\u00a0 Yeah. \n \nAny time I came close to taking myself seriously about it, any time a writing teacher encouraged me, told me I was truly \"a writer\" and to stick with it?\u00a0 It completely terrified me, freaked me out, caused me to drop my \"pen\" and not write another word for months, sometimes longer. \n \nWhen James Baldwin (with whom I took an intimate writing seminar in college) praised my work?\u00a0 Ack!\u00a0 My writing mojo went cold for years afterward. \n \nBut there is something to be said for getting older, becoming a parent, learning to get over yourself, get on with it, learning to be someone who gets it done because it has to be done.\u00a0 Old inhibitions, fears, neuroses, fall by the wayside.\u00a0 (Well, some of them, anyway.) \n \nI no longer care about meeting the definition of \"a writer.\"\u00a0 Simply, I write.\u00a0 I call myself a writer.\u00a0 Like me or not, read me or not.\u00a0 Whatever. \n \nAnd so I am writing, freeing up something inside me long dormant, long coiled up; my voice coming loose, unfurled.\u00a0 Finding the storyteller within.\u00a0 Letting my love of words, of language out into the world, through my blog. \n \nAnd the other part of this?\u00a0 Is the amazing community that I have found here in this cyber-world, the \"blogosphere\".\u00a0 A world of writers, of (mostly) women, amazing and strong, unbelievably supportive (at least the ones I have chosen to connect with are). \n \nAnd then there is the online special needs parenting  community , which I could go on and on about.\u00a0 I have,  elsewhere , but I will just say this: they help to keep me sane.\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \nObviously, I also have a personality that tends towards revealing rather than concealing, an over-sharing   bent, or else I would be wearing my underwear on the inside, hidden  away from view, like the rest of the non-blogging population. \n \nAnd so here, among my blogging brethren, my over-sharing peers?\u00a0 I feel mighty normal.\u00a0 So now, instead of overwhelming my \"real life\" friends (whom I know love me very much) when I'm feeling intense or all soapbox-ranty, I can splay that all out here, and then tell people: \n \n\"You want to know about that?\u00a0 OK, I can tell you, and possibly have your eyeballs roll around in their sockets by the time I'm through.\u00a0 Or?\u00a0 Read the damn blog.\"\u00a0 (And this way you can skip the boring parts and I'll never know.) \n \nAlso?\u00a0 I would like to take this moment to thank you, my readers: the ones I know from my real life, the ones I know from the blogosphere, and the ones I will never know, you who silently read and glide on. \n \nThat my words may have meaning for you; make you laugh, cry, think, see something in your own life in a new light?\u00a0 Pleases me beyond knowing. \n \nAnd finally?\u00a0 May I say:\u00a0 What a year this has been!\u00a0 (I'm not going to re-cap it again, I've done that recently in my New Year's year-end  wrap-up post .) \n \nI'm just going to say:\u00a0 Whew!\u00a0 Glad that's over.\u00a0 Let's move on.\u00a0 (And please, nobody else die, OK?) \n \nWhere this next year, this next turn of the big wheel will take me?\u00a0 I have not a clue. \n \nI am working hard right now to be present each day; to fully be awake and aware of the individual moments, here with my family, paying attention. \n \nAnd not JUST so that I can blog about it tomorrow.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://extrabloggage.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2011/02/full-year-of-bologna.html", "title": "\nA Full Year of Bologna\n"},

(So I feel guilty for complaining.) \n \nAnd I know that when the boys were  18 months old and not talking , when I wondered if I would ever hear their sweet voices, I longed for days like this, filled with their chatter.\u00a0 And that when people told me this time would pass and I'd one day be wishing they'd just shut up, I looked at them like they had two heads, could not possibly picture that day.\u00a0 (They may now say: \"I told you so.\") \n \nAnd I am not hermit like, I like a full, lively house.\u00a0 I regularly invite multiple kids over for group play-dates.\u00a0 I wish we had a bigger apartment so we could cram in even more. \n \nI often go out for after drop-off coffee with herds of  mom friends .\u00a0 We laugh so hard and carry on to the point of occasionally being shushed by old ladies wishing to caffeinate in peace. \n \nI am a very social person. \n \nAnd?\u00a0 Truth?\u00a0 A major league talker, myself.  \n \nBut also, I do wish for occasional peace.\u00a0 For Sunday mornings of quietly shared reading.\u00a0 Of taking a nature hike with my family and actually serenely  observing nature whilst on it. \n \nThis is not my life now, and it may never be. \n \nI have boisterous, noisy boys.\u00a0 I may have Jacob on my hands for years after other children would have left home.\u00a0 (I hope not, wish for his independence, but cannot discount the possibility.) \n \nI take my moments of quietude when I can catch them, fleeting, but still savored. \n \nAnd try to remember why the sound of my boys never-quiet voices should ring sweetly in my ears. \n \n \n \nThis post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's Alphabe-Thursday writing meme.

{"date": "Friday, January 28, 2011", "body": "\nThere are actually two blog posts I really wanted to write for today. \n \nOne is supposed to be a short introduction to me and my blog for Household6Diva's Blizzard Bloghop: \n \n \nAnd the other?\u00a0 I wanted to share the lovely  sweetness of yesterday's no-school Snow Day in photos and words.  \n \nAs I was trying to decide which way to go, I thought: \"why not have it both ways?\" and thus this double purposed post was born. \n \n {NOTE: If you are already familiar with me and my blog, don't need no stinkin' introduction, and just want the Snow Day news, simply skip down to the snow photo below for part two.}  \n \nFirst, The Squashed Bologna in a nutshell (perfect metaphor there, folks, think about it): \n \nIn February of 2010 my nearly 93 year-old father was actively dying, fast.\u00a0 To avoid becoming completely squashed flat between caring for him, taking care of my soon-to-be-widowed mother, and taking care of my then 7 year-old twin boys with special needs (one of them is on the Autism Spectrum and the other has some ADD/anxiety) I began this blog. \n \nPouring out all my thoughts and feelings onto the page, finding my words instead of just howling helped me to sort things out, allowed me to plumb the depths without being torn apart by the pressure down there. \n \nI found that I loved writing as much as I had when I was a girl, a young woman who had thought she might some day become a writer. \n \nI write about the familiar: my family.\u00a0 I write a lot about Death and Autism because these things press up against me every day.\u00a0 I write about ADD because not only does my son have a brain that tends that way, but so do I, so you get to come along for the wild ride. \n \nI write about love and thankfulness because that is what underlies all the other stuff, keeps it from descending into sadness and madness. \n \nI write about friendship because without my friends I wouldn't be here, and I appreciate them with every fiber of my being. \n \nI don't write much about my husband because he is a private man and the story of our marriage is half his, not really mine to tell.\u00a0 (But he does come up from time to time.)  \n \nI also sometimes lighten things up, share delightful stories about my sons, Ethan and Jacob, now eight and a half.\u00a0 Because I really am a funny, light-hearted person, most of the time (when no one is in the middle of dying that is). \n \nOver the course of the past year I have gone from being an occasional writer to a steady, nearly every day one.\u00a0 I am coming up on my \"Blogaversary\" and looking forward to seeing where this second year of blogging my life will take me, what 2011 has in store for us.  \n \nNow, 2010 was a fairly crap year: My  father died , my  Mother-in-law died , my  gall bladder  punked out on me. \n \nBut some mighty good things happened, too: \n \nI  started this blog  and found a whole new amazing online  community of bloggers , especially the Special Needs parenting bloggers.\u00a0 And the  Hopeful Parents  site asked me to become one of their regular monthly writers. \n \nWe found a  wonderful new school  for Jacob that just \"gets it,\" and where he is thriving. \n \nEthan started to  fall in love with reading  and books. \n \nBut, most importantly, we didn't let our losses drive us apart, but rather bind us tighter together as a family;  sad but solid . \n \nAnd that's us.\u00a0 These nuts in this nutshell. \n \nIf, you've got a short attention span (no judgement here) and, curiosity satisfied, you're ready to move on, you can stop reading here, continue hopping with the hop.\u00a0 If, however, you want to hear how the Squashed family rolls on a snow day and see some incredibly cute pictures of my sons and our snowman?\u00a0 Read on for a bit.\u00a0 It's short and sweet today. \n \n(Well, what passes for short and sweet around here.\u00a0 I didn't develop my frequently used blog tag: \"Ruminating Rambles\" and earn my title: \"Queen of the Run-On Sentence {with parenthetical clauses}\" for nothing you know) \n \n \n \n Wednesday afternoon: snow coming down on Riverside Drive \n And now the magnificence of our  Snow Day : \n \nWell, we, of course, had an official Snow Day yesterday, here in New York City, with an unexpected 19 fresh inches of the fluffy white stuff coming our way Wednesday into Thursday morning. \n \n(Only the 9th time they have closed NYC public schools for a Snow Day since 1978.\u00a0 I told you, we are NOT wimps about snow here in New York) \n \nOur apartment building is right next to one of the best sledding hills in Riverside Park, so our apartment becomes \"sledding central\" on Snow Days. \n \nWhich means that yesterday we had a gaggle of 8 year-old boys (and a younger sibling) over both before and after the big outdoor sledding / snowman building / snowball fighting event. \n \nHere is what it looked like out in the glorious snow: \n \n \n \n Jake \n \n \n This year's snowman: kind of wistful face, no? \n \n \n Ethan \n \n \n Our sledding hill: \"Suicide Hill\" Riverside Park at 90th Street \n \n \n Jakey talks to the snowman \n \n \n Ethan contemplates his next snowball fight target \n \n \n Ethan and friend Sage defend their home turf \n \n \n I loved the moody sky \n An hour and a half in the snow and we were done. We retreated back to our apartment, peeled off sodden outer layers, hung them to drip into the tub, dry on the radiators.\u00a0 Fresh dry socks from our excessed sock bin were distributed all around. \n \nLego towers were created and destroyed.\u00a0 Apple slices and goldfish  crackers were munched and crunched.\u00a0 Vats of hot cocoa were guzzled  (mocha coffee for the moms).\u00a0 Mmmmm.\u00a0 Snow Day. \n \n Vote for me yet today?\u00a0 One click is all you need to show me your love!   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.household6diva.com/2011/01/2011-blizzard-bloghop-during-blissdom.html", "http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/author/varda-squashedmom", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUK3SI9fZvI/AAAAAAAAAaM/ennwUtN2ldc/s1600/DSC00653.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUKJwcnIW2I/AAAAAAAAAZo/gqRzZRPMbt8/s1600/DSC00671.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUKKGZZKAzI/AAAAAAAAAZw/aECVFy7aBLw/s1600/DSC00720.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUKL18CIq3I/AAAAAAAAAaA/W6CpERG_fG8/s1600/DSC00711.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUKLQRlvprI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/5bxPvnkNLKI/s1600/DSC00678.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUK3bsfDFBI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/Fsp_4VTPuHE/s1600/DSC00686.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUK3lkw8V_I/AAAAAAAAAaU/24OpiPqxELQ/s1600/DSC00692.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUK3CuUFj0I/AAAAAAAAAaI/Pj1RQIdao7c/s1600/DSC00698.jpg", "http://www.topmommyblogs.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2011/01/snow-day-perfect-for-two-timing.html", "title": "\nSnow Day: Perfect for Two-Timing\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 29, 2011", "body": "\nToday is my boys' half-birthday. Remember celebrating half-birthdays?\u00a0 It seems to work only when you're still in the single digits, like my guys. \n \nEight and a half, today.\u00a0 How did that happen?\u00a0 One more birthday on this side of the fence, and then after that they're into the double digits.\u00a0 Big boys.\u00a0 Blink, blink.\u00a0  \n \nThey were summer babies, and to think of their birthday is to think of late July's deep heat. \n \n \n \n Jacob & Ethan, 1 day old \n Not a bad thought today, as the mercury hovers just around the freezing point and we may be expecting a bit more snow later this afternoon. \n \nOur car, street parked in New York City?\u00a0 Is not currently a vehicle, but rather a vaguely car-shaped snowbank.\u00a0 Plow-piled snow encases our car up to the windows plus the 19 fresh inches sit atop the roof like so much white fluffy frosting. \n \nFrosting... that gets me to thinking... of cakes in general, and then birthday cakes in particular.\u00a0 Which draws us right back round again to the matter at hand: boys and half-birthdays, half-birthdays and boys. \n \nSo maybe I should take my cue from the above, combat a case of the mid-winter blues, cheer myself up, inspired by all this birthday and cake talk, and herewith take you on a photographic tour down birthday memory lane via my ONE claim to domestic awesomeness: my amazing mommy-made birthday cakes: \n \nIn the beginning were cupcakes for birthdays one and two. Easy to make, no big knives need be left laying around curious toddlers with swift, fat, grabby fingers.\u00a0 And?\u00a0 They didn't know any better, what was important was the eating of them. \n \nBut then they turned three, and had seen birthday cakes in books and on TV.\u00a0\u00a0 Beautiful, decorated cakes.\u00a0 And Ethan pounced, begged, made specific  demands  requests. \n \nSo it all began in 2005, when the boys were Thomas the Tank Engine obsessed 3 year-olds.\u00a0 Ethan had asked for a James cake, as his then love of the color red extended to all things, including trains.\u00a0 And I knew that for Jacob, who still yet did not always make his desires known, Thomas, the main character was the right choice. \n \nSince I was making two cakes, and not everyone loves chocolate (although that makes no sense to Ethan who believes non-chocolate deserts have no reason to live), I made one cake, Ethan's, chocolate and the other, Jacob's, vanilla.  \n \nI pulled out the boys Thomas placements, and painstakingly copied the illustrations onto the cakes:  \n \n \n 2005: My FIRST cake - Thomas for Jacob \n As Ethan's chocolate frosting was so dark, problem solving how to write a legible \"Happy Birthday\" in the requested blue gel inspired the bug puffy steam cloud coming out of the smokestack, possibly my favorite part.  \n \n \n 2005: James the red engine for Ethan \n I wasn't sure I could pull it off, had never attempted anything quite like this before.\u00a0 I dove in, in pure experimental mode, and... I succeeded, damn it!\u00a0 The problem here being: once you do this well, once?\u00a0 It becomes expected every year.\u00a0 And I'm supposed to improve, too, to top myself, as it were. \n \nOK,  2006 : Once again, one chocolate, one not.\u00a0 Lemon-vanilla, this time.\u00a0 Also?\u00a0 This was the first year Jacob was on his special Gluten Free/Casein Free diet.\u00a0 So I had to find a really good vanilla GF/CF cake mix and make a practice cake before I inflicted it upon the masses.  \n \nI was, once again, taking design requests.\u00a0 And this year I figured out that printing out  simple line-drawing coloring pages  found online was the best way to  create a \"pattern\" for my decorating.\u00a0  \n \nSo, four year-old Jacob was in love with  Pingu the penguin : \n \n \n 2006: Pingu for Jake \n While Ethan at four showed  considerable loyalty to his father as his nascent superhero obsession  erupted.\u00a0 He chose Spider-man: \n \n \n 2006: Spidey for Ethan \n Spider-main turned out a little lumpier than he was supposed to be, but within tolerable limits, I think. \n \nAnd in  2007 ?\u00a0 Cars, baby!\u00a0 Jake was in love, I mean IN LOVE with Mac, the big Mac truck who is Lightning's best friend:  \n \n \n 2007: Mac for Jake \n Ethan  wanted 5 cars\u00a0 on his, which I nixed, but did acquiesce (after  much  begging) to a 2 car road scene tableau, from above, with a Route 66   logo.\u00a0 I'm a sucker, what can I say: \n \n \n 2007 for Ethan: Route 66 \n I can admit, this was not my best effort.\u00a0 It was late, I was getting tired.\u00a0 In an ideal world, I would have filled in more green at the side of the road instead of just that lame lone squiggle.\u00a0 Oh, well, it was devoured and enjoyed, just the same. \n \nIn  2008  I discovered the existence of Wilton shaped cake pans.\u00a0 Who knew?\u00a0 Learning  about these was a revelation.\u00a0 There was still a fuck-ton of work involved, but at least I didn't have to research the design.\u00a0 Just E-bay the pans.\u00a0 (You didn't think my kids wanted any of the current, easy to obtain designs, did you?\u00a0 My kids?) \n \nOnce again the current superhero obsessions  ruled: Batman for Jake and Power Ranger for Ethan. Jake's Batman cake was orange vanilla flavored and really delicious, no one would ever guess it was GF/CF unless they knew: \n \n \n 2008: Jake loved Batman \n \n \n 2008: Ethan was all about the Power Rangers  \n Ethan had directed me in  the color choice for the Power Ranger's costume.\u00a0 I bit my lip and  restrained myself from sharing with him that making the Ranger sleeve's  trim into a pink and green argyle made me refer to this one as \"Buffy  the Connecticut Wasp Power Ranger\" in my mind.\u00a0  \n \nIn  2009 , I had some serious fun.\u00a0 Ethan had switched allegiances  from the Bakugan to the Pokemon Japanimation tribe just before his birthday, and  decided to \"make it easy for you, Mom\" by requesting a simple Pokeball  design, as opposed to an elaborate character re-creation. \n \nMay I present the Pokeball cake: simple, elegant, nearly modernistic: \n \n \n 2009: Ethan gets a Pokeball \n Jake, on the other hand, got his most elaborate cake to date in 2009.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n That  summer he was a bit obsessed with the very hungry caterpillar character   from the self named Eric Carle storybook.\u00a0 His class had performed a   stirring reading of this story at their graduation & moving up   ceremony in June. \n \n One  day in June I had ducked into a Williams Sonoma store when a torrential  rain suddenly came down upon me while waiting for the crosstown bus.\u00a0  What was in the sale bin, but a shaped caterpillar cakelet pan, and the  inspiration struck: \n \n \n 2009: A Very Hungry Caterpillar for Jacob \n \n \n 2009: Close up of the head cakelet \n I had so much fun making this.\u00a0 My little addition: I doubled the body pieces to make him really long.\u00a0 Also?\u00a0 I am very fond of my embellishments: the green colored sugar crusted over green frosting to make the eyes sparkle and then the grape twizzler antennae. (The mold was for a generic caterpillar with a different face. I turned him into Eric Carle's specific caterpillar.)  \n \nWhich brings us up to the present. This past year,  2010 , was the boys' year of Pokemon. A shaped cake pan Pikachu (thank you Wilton) for Jacob, whose favorite color progressed to yellow this summer: \n \n \n 2010: Pikachu for Jake \n And for Ethan?\u00a0 I think I outdid myself this past year.\u00a0 He initially wanted some particularly complex and difficult to draw Pokemon, but we finally settled on this guy, Lapras, who seemed actually do-able.\u00a0 I think I did a pretty damn good job re-creating him, using, once again, a computer coloring page pattern: \n \n \n 2010: Lapras for Ethan \n OK, here's the Lapras, image I used, you be the judge: \n Whew! \n \n And now, in hindsight (because when have I ever NOT over-thought things), I realize that while I had thought I was doing this particular post to bring a little summer cheer into the winter gray, I also see, as this rolls along, that I had ulterior motives (when do I ever not, isn't there always a secondary agenda floating along under the overt... or is that just me?)*  \n \nI think I needed to remind myself, to prove to you all, that there's some things in life at which I do not, actually, completely suck.\u00a0 Because lately?\u00a0 I've been feeling pretty sucktastic, especially when it comes to the state of my messy home and all things domestic.\u00a0 Sigh. \n \nAnd maybe it's just the inevitable post-operative depression talking (I had been warned it might set in at about 3 weeks when the physical was mostly healed but I was not yet back to 100%).\u00a0\u00a0 But anyway, here it is: my house may be an absolute disaster, but there is something domestic at which I am fairly glorious.\u00a0 So take that! \n \nAlso, before you go suggesting I do something like this for a living?\u00a0 No, no and no.\u00a0 These take me FOREVER.\u00a0 I love doing this for my kids, they are a labor of love, and shall remain that way.\u00a0 Once a year.\u00a0 My kids only.\u00a0 Probably my grand-kids (way) down the road. \n \nAnd now I'm off to make a special half-birthday lunch for my dear boys.\u00a0 Tomorrow they will be closer to nine, one day closer to being claimed fully by the world.\u00a0 Today they are still eight and a half, still mine. \n \n *another example of how I have legitimately earned my crown as \"Queen of the Run-on Sentence\u00a0 (with parenthetical clauses). \n \n \n Vote for me yet today?\u00a0 One click is all you need to show me your love!   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TFip3UKAU2I/AAAAAAAAAEY/ikBdYWiNP-A/s1600/img009_2.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUREHmxhNbI/AAAAAAAAAag/BZ38iR0SFqw/s1600/2005Cakes+J.jpg.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUREFFL1bXI/AAAAAAAAAac/X2eJ9p_R8Js/s1600/2005Cakes.jpg.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Chillin-Pingu-Carlo-Bonomi/dp/B0002B54LC?ie=UTF8&tag=thesquashedbo-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9YW98VWdI/AAAAAAAAAYw/x0I7_Scgl5E/s1600/DSCN1174.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9Yd5iYsGI/AAAAAAAAAY0/yfynY12idyY/s1600/DSCN1177.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9X9zlBFvI/AAAAAAAAAYk/WMxhNzWKZz4/s1600/DSCN3422.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9YHvjYm9I/AAAAAAAAAYo/sIv39kvkQww/s1600/DSCN3423.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9XvH0NSNI/AAAAAAAAAYg/ae_TM9kc8OI/s1600/DSC00492.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9XkW4gKUI/AAAAAAAAAYc/4S0qWnHrkW8/s1600/DSC00485.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9RDJXIHMI/AAAAAAAAAYM/gTgoDe1kOao/s1600/DSC06125.JPG", "http://www.amazon.com/Very-Hungry-Caterpillar-Eric-Carle/dp/0399226230?ie=UTF8&tag=thesquashedbo-20&link_code=bil&camp=213689&creative=392969", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9TCZSiEdI/AAAAAAAAAYU/PjJIH3o6zEM/s1600/DSC06136.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT9TLbgRMcI/AAAAAAAAAYY/qu35OYQDJi0/s1600/DSC06139_1.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT01NK6SGNI/AAAAAAAAAX0/mIbCk8VLZ_8/s1600/DSC07656.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TT011NPAudI/AAAAAAAAAX4/HL1IVBwoxHs/s1600/DSC07677.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TUOBkuNi5SI/AAAAAAAAAaY/q4f4nVWHGcA/s1600/ani131.gif", "http://www.topmommyblogs.com/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2011/01/half-birthday.html", "title": "\nHalf-Birthday\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, January 27, 2011", "body": "\nP is for Poopyhead \n \nBet you saw this one coming. \n \nDid you even doubt it for an instant?\u00a0 I have, after all, written of Jacob's sometime  favorite word before . \n \nAs always there are so many other P's in our lives from which I could have chosen... Pokemon, Public Schools, (Club) Penguin, Popcorn (Jake's favorite food), Prydain (Ethan's newly discovered realm), just to name a few. \n \nBut first and foremost, I suppose, would be Processing whose challenges for Jacob rule his and our lives.\u00a0  \n \nYes, that's right... now that I've  made you giggle with a potty word, hooked you and reeled you in, I'm going to turn it all around.\u00a0 I'm going to get all serious and talk about my son Jacob and his autism.\u00a0 Again.\u00a0 Sorry, I do that all the time, the old bait and switch.\u00a0 But it works, doesn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 OK, stay with me then. \n \nThe Sensory and Language Processing Differences (much gentler, kinder  word than \"disorder,\" don't you think) are primary ways in which Jake's  autism manifests at this point. \n\u00a0  \nIt took a long time for me to actually process this information when he was young and I was new to the wacky world of special needs: how Jacob might be experiencing life in a way that would differ so far from my own. \n \nI think it is just so hard for people to understand that we  don't  experience reality and the world with our senses, but with our  brain,  through its interpretation of our senses.\u00a0\u00a0 And if someone's brain  is  wired a different way, speaking a completely different language then   yours, how can you expect them to draw the same conclusions?\u00a0  \n \nI   remember an early OT of my son's trying to get me to understand how  his  sensory issues affect all of his learning and his ability to  function  in the world.\u00a0 She said: \"imagine you are walking on a high  wire  suspended 200 feet in the air between tiny platforms, and with no  net.\u00a0  Are you going to be able to carry on a causal conversation while  you  cross it, or do you have to put every fiber of your being into  your footsteps?\u00a0 Well, for your son?\u00a0 Walking across the room on the  floor  takes as much concentration  out of him as the tightrope walk would for you.\" \n \nThat was just what I needed to hear.\u00a0 I got it.\u00a0 Snap. \n \nAnd   then I thought about me driving the car.\u00a0 I love to have conversations   and listen to music while I'm driving, as long as I'm going somewhere I   know how to get to, and the road and weather conditions are fairly  normal  and reasonable.\u00a0 But put me on a winding, unknown road at night,  in a  rainstorm?\u00a0 Shut up and turn that damn radio off, I need to  concentrate  if we're all going to survive.\u00a0 \n \nAnd if conditions change  mid-drive and  there is already a noise filled car?\u00a0 It may take a while  for me to notice  that I am getting tenser and tenser, and in desperate  need of silence.\u00a0  And once that silence has been achieved?\u00a0 Try to talk  to me or flip on  the radio and I will get nasty and snappish. \n \nThese  are  really helpful metaphors I remind myself of whenever I start to  get  impatient with Jacob's being distracted by or flipping out over what are ordinary sensory  experiences to me.\u00a0 Or his need for tremendous amounts of input to make sense of a situation your brain or mine would intuit in an instant. \n \n \n \n This photo in no way actually illustrates this post. There is no reason to throw it in here, other than to say: look at my beautiful son, Jacob, enjoying his Snow Day today. And since this is MY blog, I can do that. So there. \n And then there's the Language Processing piece, that whole other ball of wax, but I've written about this before ( last week , in fact).  \n \nAnd besides, you have a bunch of other blogs to go read, the ones that will actually keep you laughing throughout.\u00a0 Go, have fun. \n \n \nThis post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's Alphabe-Thursday writing meme.

It\u2019s been almost 3 weeks now, life should be getting back to normal, which it nearly is, except for this\u2026 I am still handing Jake off to everyone else \u2013 his Dad, babysitters, etc. - far more than is my usual m.o.\u00a0 And I could say it\u2019s because he gets so physical with me and I am worried about hurting, and that would be semi-true, but really? I need the break. I love Jake to pieces but he is exhausting. Talking about the same subjects over and over, being bored to tears entering his world with him or working up a sweat to drag him into mine. How many times can I listen to all the upcoming movies and their attendant opening dates (if you want to know when Cars 2, Rio, Rango, the Green Lantern, Cowboys and aliens, Kung fu Panda 2 are due to open this winter/spring/summer? Just ask me. I\u2019ve heard it a thousand times.) Or to keep saying to Jake \u201cNo more movie talk, lets talk about something else,\u201d only to have him veer back there after a whole minute talking about\u2026 his other favorite subject: our cat.\u00a0 I love our cat as much as the next person, but really, she\u2019s a cat. The answer to Jake\u2019s incessant question \u201dWhat\u2019s cocoa doing, mommy?\u201d\u00a0 Is 99% of the time \u201csleeping\u201d although the more honest answer would probably be \u201cHiding from YOU, because you are obsessed with her.\u201d\u00a0 This winter is killing me because we can\u2019t just go for a walk in the park and I am in no shape for sledding and snowman building and when we sit around the house there is WAY too much screen time because it is easy: TVcomputerDS\u2026 I am SICK of them.\u00a0 So I fob him off & feel guilty, guilty, guilty.

He pesters me to tell him the secrets, to answer the deep mysteries that are revealed only at the very end. \n \nHe howls at my reply: \"You'll have to keep reading to find that one out,\" is placated by the one or two bones I toss him to keep him from dying of curiosity. \n \nAnd tonight Ethan uttered the words that made my book-loving mother's heart melt anew: \"Mom, I love this book.\" \n \nI am  kvelling .\u00a0 I am over the moon.\u00a0 The fact that I was exactly Ethan's age when I first read this book?\u00a0 As thrilling to him as to me.\u00a0  \n \nFor you see, I am a reader, I have been all my life.\u00a0 Books have been my dearest friends since I was a young child.\u00a0 And the Prydain series?\u00a0 My very best friend for many years. \n \nHow many times I read these books over and over as a child I could not count.\u00a0 There is something that deeply captivated me about them, the stories full of large and small perfect moments, the characters richly nuanced.\u00a0 Watching Taran mature and grow from a feckless youth to a young man, wise and capable of leadership, still stirs my soul. \n \nI always imagined sharing these books with a child of mine someday.\u00a0 And that day is finally today, and my heart is fluttering.\u00a0 This is a moment made ever more sweet and precious because for a long time I wasn't sure we would ever get here. \n \nBecause Ethan, while like me in many ways, is also clearly not me, made little.\u00a0 He did not come to reading with joy in his heart.\u00a0 He is a child of the age of electronics, a computer game kid.\u00a0 And when he was learning to read at 5?\u00a0 He declared reading and books \"boring.\"\u00a0 Way to stab an ice pick into your book-loving mom's heart, kidddo! \n \nIt was hard to find the right book to hook him with, a gateway book, as it were, but I worked at it, patiently (don't laugh, I can be patient when I need to).\u00a0 A lot of trial and error, me holding my peace when books I thought would be a bit hit were declared \"stupid\" \"boring\" \"girly\" \"babyish\" \"scary\" and otherwise rejected. \n \nWe finally found a few that he liked, such as Louis Sachar's wonderful  Sideways Stories from Wayside School  books and proceeded from there. \n \n \n Ethan reading a Wayside School book, summer 2009 \n Remember, I had a deeply hidden agenda in my back pocket: there were those books from my childhood that had meant so much to me, that I had hoped to someday share at least some of with my children. \n \nHaving only boys, and in particular a boy who (my best feminist intentions to the contrary) despised all things deemed \"girly,\" I realized it was unlikely we were going to be visiting my well loved  Little House on the Prairie  or  All-of-a-Kind Family  series together.\u00a0  Island of the Blue Dolphins ?\u00a0 Not likely either. \n \nBut a visit to Prydain, Ursula LeGuin's  Earthsea ?\u00a0 Maybe... probably... oh YES! \n \nAnd?\u00a0 The next \"hold my breath\" beloved yet boy-friendly childhood book?  A Wrinkle in Time .\u00a0   Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, Mrs Which, chill your jets a little bit longer.\u00a0 All signs are pointing in the right direction, we're coming soon. \n \n Disclosure: I am an Amazon Associate.\u00a0 If you click on any of the hotlinks to buy a book, I will receive a (very) small percentage from this purchase.  \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Thursday, January 20, 2011", "body": "\nO is for Oxygen \n \nBecause? \n \nOh, why the hell not? \n \nIt is the most abundant element in our world's crust, makes up about 20% of the earth's atmosphere, is the useful part of the air we breathe, suffusing our very cells, the source of their energy. \n \nBut do we ever think much about it?\u00a0 No, it's just there, all around us. Unless of course, it's not. And then, well, we're in trouble, unless that gets fixed, and fast. \n \nKind of like language. Being human, we use it all the time, every day.\u00a0 We think in it, but don't think about it much.\u00a0 Unless, of course, it's not working; not developing right from the start or slipping away, disappearing, suddenly due to trauma or slowly at  the end of life .\u00a0  \n \nAnd then?\u00a0 There is trouble. \n \nI was an early talker, precocious, creating my first poem at two: \"Mom, it's the moon in the afternoon!\"\u00a0 And my kids?\u00a0 I expected them to be just like me.\u00a0 Silly how first time parents are about that stuff, no? \n \nWhen the boys weren't talking at a year I was frustrated, but everyone told me to chill my jets, that my expectations were unrealistic.\u00a0 I was reminded that they were boys, they were twins, both reasons they would be a little later in their talking. \n \nAt fifteen months, I knew something was wrong, but once again, everyone pretty much patted me on the head and told me not to worry, all still well within the norm. \n \nThis was just a scant few years ago, before autism and speech delay were firmly embedded in the national psyche.\u00a0 Before every pediatrician had a five point checklist of developmental milestones to go over at check-ups with big red flags for autism clearly spelled out.\u00a0 When they were still things being whispered about in the dark corners of mommy and me classes. \n \nWhen I asked for a referral to Early Intervention at a year, I was scorned; when I asked at fifteen months, I was dismissed again.\u00a0 At eighteen months with neither Ethan nor Jake able to claim a stitch of functional language to their names, I finally got the go ahead to pull the parachute cord, stop my sons' developmental free-fall. \n \nAnd the funny thing?\u00a0 In spite of both having no language?\u00a0 It was for completely different reasons. \n \nJacob had no language, but he did have occasional words,\u00a0 You would say a word to him and he would repeat it, clear as a bell, right back to you, but then it would disappear, never to be heard again.\u00a0 There were all the mechanics of speech in place but no communicative intent. And without that?\u00a0 Speech does not become language. \n \nEthan, on the other hand, had a ton of communicative intent, but was having trouble with the mechanics of speech, wrapping his mouth around the words.\u00a0 And boy, was he frustrated.\u00a0 His tantrums at a year and a half, engendered by the frustration of being unable to let his thoughts be known?\u00a0 Awe inspiring.\u00a0 And heartbreaking. \n \nWe taught him a few signs and he worked them furiously, useful ones like \"more\" and \"enough.\"\u00a0 He took to the speech therapy offered by Early Intervention like a duck to water, slowly learned how to talk to us. \n \nBy two Ethan had a few words, but they were not easy to understand.\u00a0 He had initial consonants  only, and then it was all vowel soup.\u00a0  I had to translate, was the only one who knew that \u201ccoh-ee\u201d  was a crayon, while \u201ccoo-ee\u201d was a  cookie.\u00a0  \n \nAnd then?\u00a0 At two and a half, nearly on the dot, he had a language explosion and we never looked back.\u00a0 Ethan is now a \"high verbal\" kid; a  conversationalist  with a huge, sometimes surprising vocabulary. \n \nJacob, on the other hand, was clearly another story.\u00a0 It was slow going. We figured out there was a lot more than speech delay going on there.\u00a0 Eventually he got a  diagnosis , and the therapies he needed, including ABA, to begin his march up the language ladder.\u00a0 It was a struggle.\u00a0 I had to put on my autism-mom-cast-iron-underwear, my  mommypants,  and scrap, scrape and fight to get all of his necessary services and therapy hours. \n \nThere is too much story here to tell in this one post, but this small part I will... \n \nMost people don't realize that speech and language are not the same thing, that words can be used to label and to communicate, and that one will not necessarily evolve into the other, unless a vital connection is made. That spark that is communicative intent.  \n \nAt nearly two and a half Jacob had words, could label like a champ.\u00a0 Show him a cup, he said \"cup,\" turn on the faucet and he quickly came up with \"water.\"\u00a0 But when thirsty?\u00a0 Jacob would just cry and cry. \n \nBecause the switch had not yet been thrown in his brain; the one that let him know that these fun labeling things, these words?\u00a0 They had a purpose; could be used to communicate his thoughts, his needs, and most importantly, to get those needs met. \n \nAnd then, the switch got tripped.  \n \nThe day Jacob made his first request, I think it was \"Up?\" when he wanted to be picked up, was one of the happiest days of my life. \n \nI think I had been holding my breath, at that point, for nearly two years.\u00a0 And finally, that day, I was able to exhale, inhale again.\u00a0 Bring some fresh oxygen, that stuff of life, into my brain; know that Jake would, could, eventually, enter the world of language, and be alright.  \n \n \n \nThis post has been inspired by and linked up to   Jenny Matlock 's Alphabe-Thursday writing meme.

If you read my blog, you know how highly I  value honesty \u2013 the kind where a blogger spills her or his guts in such a  way that we all remember that we\u2019re never, ever alone in the world. This award is for bloggers who write posts that cut right to the heart  of the human experience. It doesn\u2019t have to be tragic or devastating or  earth-shattering (though it may be); it just has to be  real .\" \n \nWow.\u00a0 I couldn't possibly me more honored than to receive this award.\u00a0\u00a0 Adrienne is one of the bravest writers I know, and also one of my blogging mentors.\u00a0 These are the writers I read every day (or as often as they post) and whose own blogs have given me the courage to experiment, to try new things, who I have looked to to see what I can get away with here in the blogosphere. \n \nCan I go from gut wrenching sad to goofily funny on my one same blog?\u00a0 From one day to the next?\u00a0 How about inside one post?\u00a0 Why the hell not.\u00a0 As long as it's real and in my voice. \n \nThank you, thank you, thank you, Adrienne.\u00a0 And if you don't already read her blog \" No Points for Style \"?\u00a0 Go.\u00a0 Read.\u00a0 Because I said so.\u00a0 You're welcome. \n \nThen (ahem) there is this next award: \n \n \nAnd what can I say about THIS lovely piece of, um, art?\u00a0 This was bestowed upon me by Cheryl of  Little Bit Quirky .\u00a0 I *might* have replied to the comment in which she let me know about this with the words: \"Um, Cheryl, you do know you will burn in hell for this, right?\" \n \nBut I was just kidding.\u00a0 You know that, right Cheryl?\u00a0 (And go read her, too, because she's one smart, funny cookie!) \n \nActually I'm thrilled and flattered to be chosen for this one, too.\u00a0 Because I know I can get (more than) a little heavy here at The Squashed Bologna, what with mainly trafficking in Autism and Death and all, being handed a silly meme award with its attendant demand for lighthearted response is kinda awesome. \n \nTo have my potential for humor acknowledged is no small thing for me, so thank you, Cheryl.  \n \nAnd now the  meme ... \n \nJill at  Yeah. Good Times  actually developed this award (she gave one to Jennie B. over at  Anybody Want a Peanut , who passed it on to Cheryl).\u00a0 And here is what she says about it: \n \n\"I present to you all:  The Memetastic Award!  Named as such because  these things are memes and its purpose is solely to celebrate the  memeness of the award giving process. Let's rejoice in our memeocity by  passing this award on to other people! It will be memelicious! (BTW, that's pronounced meem-tastic. I didn't want you pronouncing it wrong in your head. How embarrassing....)\" \n \n Here are the rules (according to Jill): \n \n1.  You must  proudly display the absolutely disgusting graphic  that I have created for these purposes (put it in your post, you don't  have to put it in your sidebar, I think that would seriously be asking  too much). It's so bad that not only did I use COMIC SANS, but there's  even a little fucking jumping, celebrating kitten down there at the  bottom.  It's horrifying!  But its presence in your award  celebration is crucial to the memetastic process we're creating here.  \n \n2.  You must  list 5 things about yourself, and 4 of them  must   be bold-faced lies. Just make some shit up, we'll never know; one of  them has to be true, though. Of course, nobody will ever know the  difference, so we're just on the honor system here. I trust you. Except  for the 4 that you lied about, you lying bastards! But don't go crazy  trying to think of stuff, we're not really interested in quality here. \n \n3.  You must  pass this award on to 5 bloggers that you either like  or don't like or don't really have much of an opinion about. I don't  care who you pick, and nobody needs to know why.  \n \n4. If you fail to follow any of the above rules, I will fucking hunt  your ass down and harass you incessantly until you either block me on  Twitter or ban my IP address from visiting your blog. I'm  serious. I'm going to do these things.\u00a0  NOTE: This is JILL speaking, I on the other hand am a really nice person and would never hunt down ANYBODY. (Well, except for a psycho ex-babysitter who was my personal troll for a while, but that's another story for another time.)  \n \nOK, now it's my turn! \n \n Here's 5 things about me, Varda the Squashed Mom, 1 of which is actually true: \n \n1.\u00a0 I am actually an heiress, but gave away my entire trust fund to noble causes in my anti-capitalist early 20's. \n \n2.\u00a0 I was born with webbed toes, but had an operation as a child to make my feet \"normal.\" \n \n3.\u00a0 I have been arrested multiple times in my youth, on purpose, for anti-nuclear activism. \n \n4.\u00a0  I have never been in love with a woman. \n \n5.\u00a0 I was a child actor, seen in many TV commercials of the 1960s. \n \n And now I will pass this award on to the following \"lucky \" recipients * :  \n \n1.\u00a0 Sandra of  It's Always An Adventure \n \n2.\u00a0 Jen of  The King and Eye \n \n3.\u00a0 Jean/Stimey of  Stimeyland\u00a0 \n \n4.\u00a0 Aunt Becky of    Mommy Wants Vodka\u00a0 \n \n5.\u00a0 The Empress Alexandra of  Good Day, Regular People \n \nGo to town, girls! \n \nFinally, it's interesting to note that both of these award-bestowing bloggers are also special needs parents, which makes them my uber-peeps in so many ways.\u00a0 Thanks again, Adrienne and Cheryl. \n \nAnd Cheryl?\u00a0 You know I WILL get you back for this some day.\u00a0 Just when you least suspect it... Boo!\u00a0 Count on it.\u00a0  \n \n * Please don't hate me, please don't hate me, please don't hate me. \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, January 18, 2011", "body": "\nI had a somewhat sad epiphany this past Sunday, when I  took a trip with Ethan  alone that I have always taken with both boys before.\u00a0 And it was a real eye opener for me.\u00a0 One of those moments when you peel back the veil and catch a glimpse of how the other half lives. \n \nBecause packing for a day trip with Jacob is like packing for an expedition: multiple changes of clothing (due to his complete intolerance of his clothes getting the  least bit wet ), lots and lots of food for his special GF/CF diet, vitamin/supplement/medicine packs for a full 2 days (because what if something happens and we need to stay overnight?)\u00a0  \n \nAlso?\u00a0 A ton of car food, because Jake can get extremely hungry at the drop of a hat (and frantically unhappy when hungry or thirsty).\u00a0 And a collection of his currently favorite toys to entertain and engage him if he needs to be distracted, soothed. \n \nIt takes at least an hour.\u00a0 We always run late. \n \nPacking for just me and Ethan?\u00a0 Took five minutes.\u00a0 I couldn't believe it.\u00a0 I kept turning around in circles, thinking there must be something else I must do, must pack.\u00a0 But no, that was it.\u00a0 Really. \n \nSnow pants for sledding, a single change of clothes for Ethan (we're talking 8 year old boy here, after all, disaster is always possible), an extra pair of socks for me, present for the birthday boy, bottle of wine for the hosts, water bottles for the car, one snack item for the car.\u00a0 Five minutes.\u00a0 Done. \n \nAnd then I nearly wept. \n \nBecause most of the time I keep those thoughts at bay, the evil \"what ifs,\" but this just smacks it all up in my face: what life might be like if Jacob didn't have Autism. \n \nNow, I love my son, Jacob to pieces, love who he is, would not change him.\u00a0 He is full of love, overflowing with joy, enthusiastic in his embrace of the world. \n \nBut life with him is certainly 10 times harder than life with Ethan.\u00a0 And 99.95% of the time I don't think about it, it just is.\u00a0 I parent him the way he needs to be parented, the work-load is just what it is. \n \nI am not a member of the \"oh my life is so hard because I have a child with special needs\" moanings and groanings crowd, really want to slap people upside the head that define themselves that way. \n \n(Which is not to say it's not OK to complain, to say \"this is fucking hard.\"\u00a0 Because you know?\u00a0 It is fucking hard.\u00a0 And we are human, we are allowed to complain, should not have to slap on the happy face all the time just to make others more comfortable.\u00a0 It's just when people constantly throw themselves a pity party and expect everyone else to join in, that truly annoys me.)  \n \nBut every now and then?\u00a0 I allow myself to think about it.\u00a0 To picture that other, \"what if\" life, with the attendant freedoms therein.\u00a0 And then I sigh.\u00a0 And then I set it aside, and get on with it. \n \n(I also daydream about winning the lottery from time to time.) \n \nAlso?\u00a0 I know that there are many whose work-load (if you want to avoid a head smack, do not EVER use the word \"burden\" around me, either) is so much more intense than mine, who might fantasize about MY life:\u00a0 Those with severely autistic kids who are self injuring and cannot communicate even their most basic needs; parents of kids who have medical issues that require life maintaining equipment, who need round the clock nursing care, whose mobility issues are extreme. \n \nI look at those parents and while I don't think \"How do they do it?\" (another big no-no, we SN parents HATE those thoughts and comments; you just do it; because it's your kid, duh!) I do think \"thank goodness I don't have to do that right now.\"\u00a0 Because it's what I already do, times another 10, or 20, and well, that would be tougher, yet more work. \n \nWhen the boys were still tiny, maybe a year and a half old, and any outing required military expedition level packing, an  out of town friend came to visit with her family, and she was happy as a clam.\u00a0 She had somewhat older children and, she was explaining, as her youngest was now four, she had her exit pass in hand from the \"age of schlepping equipment\" forever.\u00a0 She could pack light for the trip and then traipse about the city unencumbered, procuring any necessary items on the fly, as needed. \n \nI began to look forward to this time in our lives, this passage into relative parenting ease.\u00a0 And now, with the boys at eight and a half?\u00a0 I'm clearly still waiting. \n \nBut the other day I got a glimpse, a sliver of vision into what it would be like to live that way.\u00a0 And I liked it, I realy liked it.\u00a0 And who knows what time and development and maturity will bring to Jacob.\u00a0 Someday, hopefully, maybe someday soon, we will get there.\u00a0  \n \nAnd until then?\u00a0 There is a large, always packed backpack, waiting for me by the door.\u00a0 And a deep groove in my shoulder, eight and a half years in the making.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2011/01/baggage.html", "title": "\nBaggage\n"},

Yes I still have one. Allayed my fears that had sprung up when I read an account of a laproscopy gone terribly wrong with the poor woman ending up with a navel-less belly like a classic Barbie.)  \n \nI even actually went on a date with my husband for the first time in a month.\u00a0 We kept it short and simple.\u00a0 I figured sitting in a movie theater was pretty much the same as sitting on my sofa.\u00a0 So we saw True Grit.\u00a0 Really enjoyed it. \n \nBut by the end?\u00a0 I was really hurting.\u00a0 I'd conveniently forgotten that I don't actually SIT on the sofa, I LIE on it.\u00a0 And sitting up engages the abdominal muscles.\u00a0 Two hours of that?\u00a0 Too long for me right now.\u00a0 Damn. \n \nOnce again I'd let my ambitions get the better of me.\u00a0 Feeling a little better didn't mean all better.\u00a0 And today I'm paying the price for over-doing it yesterday. \n \nAnd yes, I have a sense of perspective.\u00a0 I know these are small bumps in the road, minor disturbances. \n \nMy husband will take Jake to the movies.  \n \nAnd Ethan may perk up later today, feel better and go off to his scheduled play-date with his best friend while my husband takes Jake off to his beloved  basketball  program. \n \nBut I also know that what I will be doing if I get a moment to myself is sleeping, being horizontal, non-abdominal-muscle-engagingly prone. \n \nHealing my body.\u00a0 Not writing.  \n \nAnother day. \n \nNot this one.\u00a0  \n \n Looking for  Comments?

REALLY. IS. ME. \n \nAnd sometimes I may respond to only one or two comments in a post that has received many, and please don't feel slighted it its not yours.\u00a0 The comments I have responded to may have really needed a response, or touched something specific in me, or been from an actual non-blog world  IRL friend that I really needed to say something to.  \n \nOr, also highly likely, I had three seconds to sit down at the computer to respond and that's the first comment I read at that moment.\u00a0\u00a0 Randomness, luck (or lack thereof if my response sucks), pure chance; all significant factors here. \n \nOK, that's now enough about me. \n \nTell me something about you, I'm listening.... \n \n Looking for  Comments?

Not quite ready to pop. \n \nThe snows that have fallen?\u00a0 Were watched through windows. \n \nFriday's fat happy dancing flakes looked lovely drifting down.\u00a0 It was a giant shaken snow dome of a day.\u00a0 I had a visitor.\u00a0 I was still loopy on percoset.\u00a0 I drifted in and out of a gauzy sleep, my children kept at the periphery, pain still ever-present at my core. \n \nToday's snow was sharper, colder; a different shape to its crystalline structure.\u00a0 I was sharper, too; the pain receding, the pain-killers now three days tossed. \n \nWe had all been waiting on tenterhooks: Snow day / no snow day?\u00a0 Six inches...\u00a0 ten...\u00a0 fourteen? \n \nA rumor whipped around Ethan's school yesterday, fueled by children eager for fun... \n \nIf you want a snow day the next day, you must do three things: \n1.\u00a0 Put a spoon under your pillow when you go to sleep that night. \n2.\u00a0 Take some ice cubes and flush them down the toilet. \n3.\u00a0 Put your PJs on inside out and wear them that way to bed. \n \nNone of us have any idea where this came from, although one Kindergartner told her mom that her TEACHER had told them to do this.\u00a0 I guess she really wanted a day off. \n \nHowever, we moms needed the day off, too, so a bunch of us made our own counter-magic by buying new sleds. \n \nThe Mom magic prevailed.\u00a0 At 5AM the mayor spoke: No Snow Day; business as usual; carry on.\u00a0 This is par for the course here in New York.\u00a0 This is not a city of snow wimps, we are walkers.\u00a0 We go out in it all (well, I didn't, but you know that story).\u00a0 \n \nIf there is less than a foot, a foot and a half of snow?\u00a0 Go to school! \n \nJacob's school, on the other hand, had called a snow day early the evening before, as had most of the other private special ed schools in the city.\u00a0 That's because there is so much more prepping that takes place to get these kids off to school, and they thoughtfully know we need more lead time to scramble and lay plans for an unexpected day off.\u00a0  \n \nI needed to know earlier rather than later whether or not I would be waking my son as usual at o'dark hundred to make ready and catch his way-too-early bus, for his way-too-long ride to school.  \n \nEthan, of course, was livid, wailing at the injustice of it all.\u00a0 He had been pulling hard for a snow day to spend holed up with the upstairs neighbor boys in front of screens, large and small.\u00a0 His hopes had been dashed, his plans all gone to rot. \n \nAnd his brother, HIS TWIN BROTHER, got to stay home in pajamas and watch TV while he had to bundle up and shuffle off to school.\u00a0 The disappointment nearly did him in, but off to school with his father he went.  \n \nAs better as I am feeling, I was still in no shape for a full day of Jacob, challenging and sweat provoking even in the best of circumstances.\u00a0 So I called in the cavalry: a sitter.\u00a0 Mid-morning, as my barely emerging energy was flagging, I sent Jake out into the world with movie, library and snowballs on his plate for the day. \n \nAnd me?\u00a0 I furled my butterfly wings back in, tucked them round.\u00a0 Cocooned* once more, facing a day of sleep, healing and listening to the snowplows grumble as they slowly scrape their way down our street. \n \n \n*Ethan would surely like to tell you that I am using the cocoon metaphor incorrectly here. Butterflies form in chrysalises, cocoons are the exclusive domain of moths.\u00a0 I say pffft, poetic license, dude. \n \n Looking for  Comments?

BUT, they are also asking for nominations and votes for the rest of us: the little guys, the also-rans. \n \nAnd that's where your part comes in.\u00a0 I have been nominated.\u00a0 Now, all you have to do is find me there and click on a \"like\" button.\u00a0 That's it.\u00a0 Easy peasey.\u00a0 Let's go... \n \nClick  HERE  to go to Babble's nomination page: \n \n \nNow let's find me, The Squashed Bologna.\u00a0 First click on the alphabetical tab, then go to the \"T\"s.\u00a0 As of this morning I was number 516 alphabetically, on page 11, but that could change.\u00a0 (Annoying: you first have to click on page 9 to get to the higher numbers, I trust you can figure this one out.) \n \n Now (here's the easy part): click on the thumbs-up \"I like this blogger\" button.\u00a0 (You do like me, right?) \n \nDONE! \n \nOK, now, here's the last part (or you can just skip to the funny story at the end if you're exhausted by now, really I won't take offense):  \n \n \n The 2011 Bloggies  \n There's this thing, the Eleventh Annual Weblog Awards, known around the inter-webs as \"The Bloggies.\"\u00a0 They're kind of a big deal in the blogging community.\u00a0 I have less than a snowball's chance in hell of winning one, but it would be nice to be nominated. \n \nSo I would love for you to nominate me.\u00a0 You have until January 16th to do this.  \n \nThe cool part?\u00a0 You only have to do this once.\u00a0 Promise.\u00a0 (If you do it twice, it cancels your first one.) \n \nHere's how this one works:\u00a0 You go to the nomination website,  here. \n \nFirst:\u00a0 READ THE RULES \n \nAs they say, you can nominate a blog in any and all categories for which it is appropriate (multiple categories OK). \n \nSo for me, may I suggest (in order of appearance on the form): \n Best Parenting Weblog \nBest Writing of a Weblog \nBest-Kept Secret Weblog \nBest New Weblog \nWeblog of the Year but definitely NOT \n Best Food Weblog (not that kind of Bologna, remember?) \n \nYou fill in the nominee's blog name and blog URL. These are the correct ones for me (you can copy and paste them): \n \nNominee: The Squashed Bologna\u00a0\u00a0 URL: http://www.squashedmom.com \n \nAnd this is how it looks on the ballot: \n \n \nNow, here's the catch, and this part is VERY important: \n \nAccording to the rules, you cannot just nominate me, you MUST nominate at least three (3) blogs altogether, and they can be in any categories on the ballot.\u00a0 So besides The Squashed Bologna?\u00a0 You must pick at least two other blogs to nominate. \n \nIf you're a blogger or blog reader, this will be a cake-walk. I'm sure you're already planning on how to fill up the ballot. \n \nBut if you're not?\u00a0 If mine is the only blog you read?\u00a0 May I suggest three wonderful other blogs that fall into the \"Best Group or Community Weblog\" category.\u00a0 I am a member of all of these, and they are quite worthy of praise and support.\u00a0 Here's their info: \n \nNominee: Hopeful Parents\u00a0 URL: http://www.hopefulparents.org \nNominee: Band Back Together\u00a0 URL: http://www.bandbacktogether.com \nNominee: The Red Dress Club URL: http://thereddressclub.blogspot.com  \n \nAnd how the ballot looks filled in: \u00a0  \n \nFinally, you need to fill in your e-mail address at the very bottom, here, and then \"Submit\": \n \nAnd then, when the Bloggies send you a validation e-mail?\u00a0 For goodness sakes, please click the link inside it to make it so! \n \nYou are now done.\u00a0 Thank you! \n \nI know that was a bit of work, and I really appreciate all those of you who have gone the distance with me, here.\u00a0 I'm certainly not the biggest or most popular blog out there, but I know I have some loyal readers, and it just feels good to get that jolt of validation now and then; gives me the juice to keep on writing. \n \nMaybe this will help me to get a little more noticed.\u00a0 Because if I can get a bigger readership?\u00a0 Find a way to make some money from my writing?\u00a0 My whole family will benefit greatly.\u00a0 If I have to go out into the world to get a \"real\" job that requires me to be absent from home for large blocks of time, I know my kids in general and Jake in particular will pay a price. \n \nOK, I promised you a cute story if you stuck with me through to the bitter end, and here it is: \n \nThe other day, Jacob's wonderful ABA therapist, Becca, had a late session with him that was overlapping his dinner time.\u00a0 Jake was hungry, had finished all his homework, and so Becca sat with him while he ate.\u00a0 They were practicing the fine art of dinner-table conversation. \n \nThese days, Jacob tends to go on and on about movies he has seen advertisements and trailers for, reciting their names and talking about their future opening dates.\u00a0 And, Jake being Jake, his conversational forays tend to take the form of questions: \"Can we go see  Rio ? Opening on April 15th, Mommy?\" (He's got our weekend entertainment planned out through early summer.) \n \nBut wise Becca has found a way to steer the conversation away from movies, and they are actually discussing... his actual dinner.\u00a0 And I get to overhear this gem:  \n \nJake is holding a piece of (GF/CF organic chicken-apple) sausage  aloft on his fork, studying it.  \n \nBecca:\u00a0 \"What is that, Jacob?\" \n \nJake:\u00a0 \"Mr. Sausage.\" \n \nBecca:\u00a0 \"What does Mr. Sausage say?\" \n \nJake (glint in his eye, doing a funny little voice):\u00a0 \"Don't eat me!\" \n \nFollowed by... CHOMP!\u00a0 And laughter.\u00a0 My son, the merciless sausage devourer. \n \nI've  said it before , and I'll say it again: \n \nAnyone who thinks people on the spectrum have no sense of humor can go suck an egg.\u00a0 They have clearly never met my son, Jacob, who IS da bomb. \n \n \n Looking for  Comments?

(Surely you figured out that my last post was pre-written before the surgery & then scheduled to go up on Friday.\u00a0 No?\u00a0 Did it sound all loopy like something written by someone on painkillers?\u00a0 Really?\u00a0 Didn't think so.) \n \nAnd what could be more perfect for this than Fadra's weekly \"Stream of Consciousness Sunday\" meme: where I'm supposed to just free write and whatever pours out of my brain is OK?  \n \n The rules are such: \n Set a timer and write for 5 minutes only. \n Write an intro to the post if you want but don\u2019t edit the post. No proofreading or spell-checking. This is  writing in the raw . \n \nOK, so, here goes.... \n ********* \nToday is day four after my surgery and I am feeling grateful for all the small things that are allowing me to truly rest and heal today.\u00a0 this weekend everything came together just perfectly to allow Ethan to have a million playdates, be the social creature that he is. He had a sleepover Friday night, and the mom even picked him up from afterschool, so I didn't see him from the moment I kissed him goodbye Friday morning as Danny swept him out the door to go to school until he was dropped off back at home at 11:30 yesterday.\u00a0 Then he had an afternoon playdate with the neighbor kid across the street, and after that an evening with the upstairs neighbors, who even took him out to dinner with them and didn;t send him home until 8:30 PM, PERFECTLY timed for 10 minutes after Jake had gone to bed. \n \nBecause right now? the fighting is the worst part, when the kids get most physically out of controll and therefore dangerous to me.\u00a0 but also I'm actually missing the guy. feeling like I;m catching glimpses of the future when he's a teen and barely home.\u00a0 Makes me appreciate him even more when\u00a0 he's around, because Ethan?\u00a0 He's a really great kid and I do so enjoy his company, when he's not in obnoxious-ville, that is. \n \nJake has been having a hard time not climbing in my lap, but all things considered is doing a great job of being gentle with me, being a real trooper.\u00a0 It's hard because he chose tihs week to want to watch less TV and play with me more.\u00a0 His playmobil people are involved in all sorts of adventures and now he wants them all to have names.\u00a0 Jake: \"What's his name, Mom?\" \"That guy is Steve\" (not terribly exciting, but first name to pop into my head, what can I say).\u00a0 \"Oh, Steve come over here right now and help change this tire!\" \n \nIt is awesome that his imaginative play is really taking off right now, but the timing, really?\u00a0 Couldn't have waited 2-3 weeks? No?\u00a0 But really I am am very, very grateful.\u00a0 Just wish it was easier for me to sit on the floor with him and play. \n \nAnd then there's my sweet kitty who is so happy that I am acting properly for the first time in 8 years, and spending most of my time laying around being a good cat pillow.\u00a0 It has been very comforting having her leaning up against me gently while I sleep and sleep. except for the moment she tried to step up on me, placing her paw EXACTLY in the spot where up until Wednesday my Gall Bladder had resided.\u00a0 Can I say OUCH?\u00a0 I believe I did.\u00a0 OUCH!!!!! \n \nOK, it's true, this has been a bit more than 5 minutes, because you know I forgot to set the timer, right? But I have the perfect excuse: I'm all loopy on painkillers. \n \nSo now?\u00a0 Back to my nap!\u00a0 Zzzzzzzz \n \n ******* OK, I hope that made even a little bit of sense!\u00a0\u00a0 Now YOU  click on the link and let's hear your brain droppings! \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Friday, January 7, 2011", "body": "\nSometimes change creeps up on you so slowly you don't even notice it, but there's your kid, seemingly suddenly different.\u00a0 And you know it's truly not sudden, that it has been evolving for some time, but you've missed it, even though it was going on right in front of your nose.\u00a0  \n \nThat happened recently with Jacob.\u00a0 I looked down at his hand the other day and noticed his nails were dirty.\u00a0 Wait - what?\u00a0 They were long enough to be dirty?\u00a0 Jacob's nails? \n \nYep, long and dirty; and I had to double take.\u00a0 Not  because I knew I had cut them recently, but because I haven't seen them  this long, haven't had to cut them for two or three years.\u00a0 Ever. \n \nBecause Jacob, you see, is a nail biter.\u00a0 He is a really bad, constant nail biter, down to the quick and sometimes beyond. \n \nMake that \"was.\" \n \n \n \n Jacob loves to pet our cat. \n And somehow whatever had propelled him towards nail biting in the past, presumably anxiety, has abated.\u00a0 I am so happy about this, grateful even, and also somewhat sad that I hadn't noticed until now. \n \nYou think you are watching your kids so carefully, but some things just do slip through the cracks.\u00a0 Especially with Jacob, who doesn't talk about the \"why\" of things.\u00a0\u00a0 We are often left guessing as to exactly what's going on. \n \nThree years ago, we had never gotten an answer as to why he started biting his nails.\u00a0 Never knew what was at the core of his unhappiness, that the biting of his nails helped with.\u00a0 Also, at the time he hated having nails that stuck up at all, and biting certainly kept them super short all the time.\u00a0 So it might have started as a sensory issue that then fulfilled an emotional need too. \n \nWhich is the cart, which is the horse?\u00a0 Don't know, probably never will. \n \nBut now?\u00a0 He's happy to have them growing, a little annoyed at me cutting them, but OK with it when distracted by TV.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 What changed?\u00a0 Good question.\u00a0 We certainly don't know now, may never know. \n \nSometimes with Jacob detective work actually helps us to figure out what's going on.\u00a0 Sometimes an answer appears weeks, months later, out of the blue.\u00a0 Yet other times the mystery is just that, remaining mysterious, locked inside Jake's head; his inability to explain, a wall of silence. \n \nThree years ago, shortly after Jacob transitioned from pre-school to elementary school, he had a backslide in his toileting habits.\u00a0 Jake had toilet trained easily, when he was completely ready, at age four.\u00a0 Really, one long Columbus Day weekend intensive and he was done.\u00a0 Zero accidents, dry at night just weeks later, too. \n \nBut a few weeks into Kindergarten?\u00a0 He was having poop accidents. \n \nIt appeared he was withholding and then when he couldn't hold it in any longer, it was coming out in skid marks.\u00a0 And of course, once poop is withheld, it gets backed up, becomes hard, painful to release and a bad cycle has begun, difficult to break, especially with a child who cannot describe what is going on with him. \n \nAnd we couldn't for the life of us figure out what was going wrong, what had set all this in motion.\u00a0 That school was not his  current wonderful school , communication was not a strong point with them. They were getting mad at me, thinking I had lied about him being thoroughly toilet trained.\u00a0 I was starting to wonder if something  really  bad was happening to him in the bathroom at his school.\u00a0 It was NOT good.\u00a0  \n \nAbout three months into this, I had taken Jake to the movies.\u00a0 We were in the bathroom, he had pooped, and when I went to wipe him, he yelled \"NO!\" \n \nAnd as I balled up the awful cheap movie theater t.p. in my hand I suddenly had an epiphany: \n \n\"Jake is this toilet paper scratchy and yucky, does it hurt your bottom?\" \n \n\"YES! Hurts!\" \n \n\"Is the toilet paper at school like this?\" \n \n\"YES! Hurts!\"\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \nWhew!\u00a0 Mystery solved.\u00a0 At home, we used soft, moist flushable wipes and our t.p. is the soft expensive kind, too.\u00a0 I never would have figured this out except for that moment of serendipity.  \n \nJacob, at eight is now able to communicate much more, often initiates conversations.\u00a0 But still, mysteries abound.\u00a0 Like the nail biting.\u00a0 I am happy it is gone, but a small part of me would still love to know why?\u00a0 Why? \n \nBut asking is going to get me nowhere.\u00a0 Because about important things like this?\u00a0 Conversations still often have a circular quality to them: \n \n\"Jacob, why are you crying? What's going on?\" \n \n\"I'm crying because I'm sad Mommy.\" \n \n\"Yes, honey, I can see that. But why are you sad?\"  \n \n\"I'm sad because... I'm crying mommy.\" \n \n\"Oh, honey you are  crying  because you are  sad .\u00a0 But why are you sad, what is making you feel sad? Did something happen?\" \n \n\"Yes, Mommy.\" \n \n\"What happened?\" \n \n\"I'm sad, Mommy.\u00a0 I'm crying, Mommy.\" \n \nAnd on and on.\u00a0 And I can't make suggestions, because anything I suggest he will agree to.\u00a0 He would make a terrible criminal suspect, easily confessing to the most heinous of crimes, just to please his questioner, to be able to put forth an answer. \n \nI discovered this the hard way a while ago when trying to get a sense of what had happened during a regular day at school.\u00a0 I had asked: \n \n\"Did you do math, today?\" \n \n\"Yes mommy I did math\" \n \n\"Did you read?\" \n \n\"Yes mommy I did reading.\" \n \n\"What did you read, Jakey?\" \n \n\"I read a book, Mommy!\"\u00a0 OK, that's likely, and details are not his strong point. \n \nBut then to test if this was real information or just agreeableness, I threw in a ringer: \n \n\"Did you go to the moon, today, Jakey?\" \n \n\"Yes Mommy, I went to the moon.\" \n \nDamn!\u00a0 Back to square one. \n \n Looking for  Comments?

Really?)\u00a0 No non-medically oriented person knows what the heck it does, until it stops doing its job properly.\u00a0 Then you know.\u00a0 Oh boy, do you know. \n \nI will, of course, not dwell too long upon my loss because life will barely be paused, giving me little time for rumination.\u00a0 My children will still need to be woken up, fed, clothed, cleansed, organized,\u00a0 shuttled to and from school, played with and play-dated, homework-supervised, kissed and put to bed. \n \nAnd though the physical side of these tasks will be fobbed off to others for a few days while my body recovers the assault inflicted upon it, my expertise will still be constantly called upon.\u00a0 I am the one who is large and in charge in our house, the general in command of all things child. \n \nAnd while Ethan does not like what is happening to his mom, he understands it, will go along with the program: demand less, help more, gentle his physical love for me. \n \nJacob on the other hand, thanks to autism, is likely to be confused, feel terribly rejected by his mother's arms length embraces.\u00a0 My unavailability will weigh heavily upon him, I who am nearly always the one who is there with and for him, every day in every way.  \n \nI will try to throw up a simple update sometime within a day of my surgery, but don't expect posts relevant to current events for about a week, post surgery.\u00a0 I may end up surprising myself, but I wouldn't count on it. \n\u00a0  \nI am guessing I will have precious little energy and focus for writing, so although I have prepared a few posts to pop up like this  one, seeming fresh made, they are actually mostly pre-fab.\u00a0 I don't want  my blog space to remain blank for too long.\u00a0  \n \nAnd if I am deficient in my  commenting on your blog and responding to comments on my own?\u00a0 I'm sure you'll understand. \n \nI will, likely, be sleeping,  reading  and attempting to move about tenderly.\u00a0 Air hugging my children.\u00a0 Running the ship from the sofa. \n \nI will be doing my best imitation of a lox, more still than I have been in the eight and a half years since the boys popped out and my current hurricane life began.\u00a0 I may even catch up on my sleep.\u00a0 (One can always hope.) \n \nWish me luck! \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, December 29, 2010", "body": "\nAt the pediatrician's office with my son this morning, I was reminded of something to be thankful for.\u00a0 We hadn't been there in five months, not since my sons' annual physicals this summer.\u00a0 And before that?\u00a0 Last spring... maybe? \n \nThis morning at 8 AM when I went to call the doctor's office, I had needed to look up the number. \n \nAnd then the particular pediatrician my son saw was the same one he had seen first at a week old, on his first doctor's visit ever. \u00a0 She'd had another child herself in the intervening years, had a few more gray hairs mixed in with the chestnut brown.\u00a0 She was happy to report that my son had a simple cold with his croup, and write that very dear prescription for prednisone, which will (hopefully) keep Jake from having another night like last, tonight. \n \nAnd then we spent a moment acknowledging that we had barely seen each other in years.\u00a0 \"Yes,\" I'd said, \"we are no longer frequent fliers here.\u00a0 Remember those first years when I had your practice's number on speed dial?\u00a0 I think you were on call some of those nights when I had to phone in with a sick child at 2 AM.\"\u00a0  \n \nAnd truly, it was like looking back to another lifetime ago, remembering those early years, because things are so different now.\u00a0 My sons are eight, nearly eight and a half, poised on the brink of big-boy-ness, but still seeking Mom's lap for cuddles.\u00a0 And Jacob, with autism in the picture, will clearly be little-boy-like longer still.\u00a0 But also?\u00a0 Getting big, fast. \n \nToday it was hard to move myself out of my whiny, complaining space into finding my gratefulness.\u00a0 But I wanted to, needed to. \n \nAs I look back over this year there has been so much shitty, shitty crap, but also, amidst the crap, the gems are there, too.\u00a0 And today I was actively treasure hunting, trying to focus on the positive as the year winds down to its last few days. \n \nFour more 24 hour periods, and then, onto the next.\u00a0 Thank goodness. \n \nAnd yes I know how arbitrary a marker a year is, that calendars are an invention, a human creation, like longitude and latitude marks on a globe, imaginary lines that hold significance only because we all agree on them. \n \nAnd being Jewish makes this even clearer since we get to have two \"New Years\" every year.\u00a0 Ethan asked recently which one was the \"real\" one, which lead to a whole discussion of the above, how they are both real and also both artificial. \n \nI guess the truest year markers are the natural ones, things like the solstices and equinoxes, that have observable dimensions; the winter solstice being the clearly measurable shortest day, longest night (with the summer one the opposite).\u00a0 The vernal and autumnal equinoxes have those perfectly equal day and night ratios, twice a year precisely.\u00a0 At least here, far north (or there, down south) of the equator, they do. \n \nAt the actual equator where day and night are always exactly the same, each 24 hours offering alternating 12 hour periods  of light and dark?\u00a0 All this stuff is hooey. \n \nIs this one reason why tropical cultures have often embraced a more \"live for today\" attitude while those evolving in the nether regions where one must hunker down to pass through a long cold dark winter holding the promise of warmth and sunshine solely in your mind for months have frequently taken on a more \"work hard and suffer now, enjoy later\" philosophy?\u00a0 Possibly. \n \nAll I know is that right now I need to mark the passing of time, to find a way to put this dreadful year behind me.\u00a0 And also?\u00a0 To acknowledge the lovely things that have happened this year, too, the gems among the crap: \n \nI  began this blog , and found a whole world, a community I did not know existed, which has blossomed into something wonderful beyond my wildest dreams. \n \nWe found  a new school  for Jacob, which has been all we hoped and dared to dream it would be: the right school for him.\u00a0 He is growing and blossoming there something wonderful, beyond our wildest dreams. \n \nEthan has the perfect teacher for him in this so important third grade year.\u00a0 She is lovely, a living  Ms. Frizzle .\u00a0 He no longer thinks history is boring.\u00a0 He spent an hour the other day quizzing me about the Kennedy family.\u00a0 He wants to know who my favorite president was.\u00a0 We are googling interesting facts about WWI together. \u00a0 It's something wonderful beyond my wildest dreams. \n \nAnd as to 2011? \n \nHere's to hoping it is something wonderful, beyond our wildest dreams. \n \nFor me and my family, and for you and yours. \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Saturday, December 25, 2010", "body": "\nThere is a documentary that's gotten a lot of buzz lately called  \u201cWhere's Molly?\u201d\u00a0 A recent CBS news feature on it has been making the  rounds on the internet.\u00a0 I am assuming that many readers who are part of the Special Needs parenting community are familiar with it.\u00a0 If you're not, you can see it  here . \n \nIt's the story of a man\u2019s search for his autistic sister, who disappeared  from his family when she was 2 and he was 5.\u00a0 She was vanished into  thin air; \"sent away\" never to be heard from or spoken of again.\u00a0 And  then, some 47 years later he began to look for her.\u00a0 And he found her. \n \nI  saw that video the other day and couldn't stop crying; rivers of tears  just poured down my face.\u00a0 And knowing that there are so many other  stories like this one?\u00a0 So many children that were just thrown away like  yesterday\u2019s rubbish?\u00a0 Is beyond heartbreaking. \n \nLast month we had  our first parent-teacher conference for our son Jacob (who is on the  Autism Spectrum) at his  wonderful new school. \u00a0 It went so well, and was lovely to  see how fully his teachers and support team saw Jacob's strengths as  well as his deficits. \n \nBut just before the meeting, when my  husband and I were having a quick coffee together, he looked up at me  and asked \"If Jake had been born in our time, they would have called him  'retarded' wouldn't they?\"\u00a0  \n \nAnd I had to say \"yes.\"\u00a0 No one  would have looked under the language deficit, beyond the sensory seeking  behaviors and seen his intelligence and humor.  \n \nIf he had been  my brother instead of my son?\u00a0 He might have been sent away.\u00a0 How sad  that makes me can't even begin to be touched. \n \nAnd then, tucked away in the back of the December 5th Sunday New York Times Style Magazine, there was yet another  article ,  an excerpt from a book written by Allen Shawn about his autistic twin  sister, sent away to \"camp\" when they were 8 years old (my sons' age)  never to return.\u00a0  \n \nUnlike Molly, she didn\u2019t completely disappear.  Her family visited, kept contact.\u00a0 But still, they lived apart, in  separate worlds, her home lost. \n \nAnd then I have been having even  darker thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0 Because Jake's twin brother Ethan has been doing a  school unit on immigration, he had to do a lengthy report on his family  history.\u00a0 He was interviewing me and I told the tale of my mother's  parents both coming over on boats from Eastern Europe, through Ellis  Island (the classic New York Jewish immigrant story).\u00a0  \n \n \n \n My mother's father's family right off the boat.\u00a0 Literally.\u00a0 On Ellis Island, 1920. \n As part  of this, I had to answer questions about who came over and who was left  behind.\u00a0 And while my grandfather's whole family came over, my  grandmother's whole family stayed behind; they had a business they  didn\u2019t want to leave.\u00a0 She was the only one who crossed to America.\u00a0 And  she lived.\u00a0 And they all disappeared.\u00a0  \n \nTelling this tale opened  up the story of the Holocaust to Ethan, who, at 8 is starting to be  able to handle some harsh truths like this.\u00a0 As I was finding gentle  ways to talk to him about this, I wanted to make sure he knew this was  not just about the Jews - our personal part of the story, the 6 million lost -  but also to include the other 5 million, the long list of those  considered \"other,\" \"lesser,\" \"unworthy to live.\"\u00a0  \n \nAnd I listed  Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and Gypsies, talked about the  absurdity of using skin color as a measurement of value.\u00a0 And then,  racking my brain to remember who else was on the list I hit the disabled  including \"Mental Defectives.\"\u00a0 I was remembering they were among the  first to go, near the top of Hitler's \"undesirables\" list.\u00a0 How he had  \"gas vans\" drive around cities picking up the mentally unfit and  disposing of them immediately.\u00a0  \n \nAnd I nearly lost it because I realized that meant Jacob.  \n \nThat would have been Jacob, had we lived there, then. \n \nOr if that were to suddenly be replicated here, now. \n \n(Don't be complacent and think that couldn't happen.\u00a0 The German Jews thought they were essentially regular German citizens, completely assimilated into society.\u00a0 All it takes is a charismatic leader with really bad ideas, good spin doctors, and a strong military to back him / her up.) \n \nAnd  so I struggled not to let anything show on my face as I felt the full  on horror of that scenario playing out in my mind while I blithely went  on, deflecting Ethan from this too soon knowledge. \n \nStumbling over my  words: \u201cThere are others on the list, I don\u2019t remember exactly who, but  that's not important. What\u2019s important to remember is how wrong it is to  judge whole categories of people by  what  they are instead of by  who   they are, as individuals.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nThe assigning of differential  values to human beings because they belong to one category or another is  fundamentally wrong in my book, and I work hard to convey those values  to my sons.\u00a0 It was ever this way with me, but has become even more so  now, as I look at Jacob through the eyes of others and see how easy it  is to dismiss him, to place him in a category of \"lesser.\"  \n \nI, like so many other Autism Moms was particularly struck by one moment in the wonderful  Temple Grandin bio pic  on HBO this year.\u00a0 When her mother says, fiercely \"Different, not less.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nAnd  that has become, I think, for many of us our rousing battle cry as we  seek for our children all that they deserve: dignity and respect; to be  included in all that they want to be included in; to be educated BEYOND  the lowest rung of \u201cappropriate\u201d - to be educated creatively and  caringly to the fullest possible extent, so that they can achieve their  highest possible potential. \n \nAnd to never stop searching for what that  potential might be.\u00a0 Even when it is hidden inside an infirm, floppy  body, or tied up in knotty language that tangles with every turn inside  the brain.\u00a0  \n \nAs more and more of these stories of hidden away,  lost children come out, as I think of the many other times and places  where children like Jacob would have been thrown away, I am so thankful  for the time and place he managed to be born into. \n \nWe are nowhere near  where we need to be, to truly be an open-minded society that sees value  in every individual.\u00a0 But still, it\u2019s the best time yet that has ever  been for being born different. \n \nThe gas vans are not coming for my son. \n \nNot today. \n \nAnd  I find comfort in the knowledge that all of us folks in the Special Needs parenting community around the world are striving to  make a brighter future real; to help everyone, everywhere see our  children as different, but not less.\u00a0  \n \nTo discover and to truly value the wonders that lie within; the beauty of each, our every child. \n \n Note: This was originally posted at  Hopeful Parents , on my regular monthly day there, the 10th of December, as \" Value-Able .\"\u00a0 But I had posted it very late in the day (you can read why,  here )  and I have strong feelings about this post.\u00a0 It's another \"big one,\"\u00a0  full of things I'd been mulling over for a long time before they  coalesced into a post.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I almost held it back,  to keep it on my own blog, but I had nothing else to put up over at  Hopeful Parents.\u00a0 I take my commitment to that blog and community  seriously, did not want to miss my appointed time, so up it went.\u00a0 But  now I realize, I also want it here, back \"at home\" with me.\u00a0 So I am  re-posting it here, with a few additions and tweaks.\u00a0 And choosing  today, Christmas Day, to put it up?

Warning:  it's been a pretty intense year with two important deaths and a lot of pain around my son's autism.\u00a0 So if you want light and funny?\u00a0 May I suggest November's post. \n \n Here are some of my favorite Squashed Mom posts from 2010: \n January:  {This one is easy - I wasn't blogging in January - so nothing!}  \n \n February:  Imagine that  {My first official \"Ruminating Ramble\" about age and memory and looking ahead and...} \n \n March:  Nearly Finished Business   {My thoughts on lovingly letting go of my father, preparing for his impending death} \n \n April:   From Birth To Death (and the messy stuff in the middle)  {The post I took my tag line from; reflections about my sons, sparked by their differing reactions to my father's recent death} \n \n May:  From Autist to Artist  {This is my \"big one\" about autism, the one that put my little blog on the map} \n \n June:   A Little Respect  {My love letter to Jacob's new special needs school that sent their acceptance letter to HIM} \n \n July:   Mourning in the Morning \u00a0 {Feeling sad about how my sons are just not getting along any more} \n \n August:   Flowers of Late Summer  {Reflecting on the bittersweetness at summer's end and looking ahead toward my mother-in-law's passing} \n \n September:   Sitting Here in Limbo  {What it feels like in the hospital, waiting for my mother-in-law to die} \n \n October:   Sometimes it's the little things   {Finding and cherishing the little bits of happiness among the sad, the pearls amidst the turds} \n \n November:   The Conversationalist  {Reporting a hysterical conversation with my son Ethan} \n \n December:   The Beauty of Each, Our Every Child  {Another \"big\" post about autism: thinking what might have happened to my son Jacob, were he born in another time and/or place} \n \n and on to 2011 we go.... \nNow, me being me, I couldn't possibly do this without talking about the process by which I made my selections.\u00a0  \n \nFor some of these months the choice was a no-brainer, like  May, which held my \"famous \" post about autism.\u00a0 For others it wasn't  easy.\u00a0 Especially for March the month  my father died , there were a number of very meaningful posts there. \n \nAnd then there was that notion of \"favorite.\"\u00a0 Some months had posts which had been specifically linked to by others.\u00a0 While I may have liked these posts, was I being influenced to chose them myself because they had the added shine of having been acknowledged by outside others as being \"good\"? (And does that matter?) \n \nAnd then there were months like September... how do I chose between poignant posts about my  dead father , about my dying mother-in-law, or a sweet funny one about  my autistic son? \n \nIn the end, of course the list is somewhat arbitrary, based on how I felt about my posts at the moment I sat down to my computer to write this list.\u00a0 On another day, the list would have a somewhat different configuration, and that's OK, no need to be definitively definitive. \n \nFinally, I would like to thank each and every member of the many intersecting communities who read my blog and whose lives my writing touches. \n \nMany of you are writers yourselves, and this year, my first year of blogging, has been an incredible expansion of my life as I have connected with you.\u00a0 Others of you are my friends in real life, and I so appreciate your support here as well as out there in \"the real world.\" \n \nThere are no words to properly say \"Thank You\" from the depths to which I mean that. \n \nMy life has been transformed this year.\u00a0 I lost my father, but found my voice.\u00a0 And life will never be the same. \n \nHere's to another year of community building! \n \nHappy New Year to one and all! \n\u00a0  \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, December 28, 2010", "body": "\nYeah that's the best title I can come up with after being up all night with poor Jakey.\u00a0 Sorry.\u00a0 \n \nI should have known it was coming when he sounded so froggy this afternoon, as laryngitis is related to croup.\u00a0 But it had been so many years since he'd had it that I was hoping he'd outgrown his tendency toward it.\u00a0 Apparently not. \n \nThere is a nasty cold making the rounds in our family and now it's his turn, apparently.\u00a0 On vacation week. Of course. \n \nThe thing is he hasn't been sick in so long, I'd kind of forgotten the drill.\u00a0 Yeah, I know how strange that sounds.\u00a0 He goes to school, he goes to therapy groups, goes to Ethan's school to pick him up; he rides a school bus, city buses and at least once a week he takes the subway with me. \n \nJake is exposed to a thousand germs every week. But he has gotten sick about once, maybe twice a year for the past 4 years or so.\u00a0 Go figure. \n \nI am guessing that the thousand vitamins and supplements we give him to strengthen and balance his immune system have something to do with this. Or maybe he's just naturally resilient. \n \nWhen he was 2 and 3 years old he had the requisite 7 or 8 yearly colds/bugs/flus that they say are necessary to teach the immune system how to recognize and fight invasions properly, priming the pump, as it were, to function well. \n \nAnd when he did get sick, well, at 13 months he had his first case of croup. On vacation, of course, the first summer vacation we ever took with the boys.\u00a0 And it was a doozy.\u00a0 I was flat out panicked, it being our first experience with the boys ever being that dreadfully ill. \n \nThere is that awful barking cough, that if you've ever heard it?\u00a0 Sounds like nothing else on earth.\u00a0 It sends icicle shards of fear down every nerve fiber of a mother's being when you hear it.\u00a0 It sounds BAD.\u00a0 Because your kid, when you hear it?\u00a0 Is struggling to breathe.  \n \nAnd then tonight poor Jake was really panicking himself.\u00a0 Fearing that he can't breathe, sobbing and barking and making it all so worse.\u00a0 Because the panic also constricts the airways.\u00a0 Add in autism and his language processing disorder and calming him down is a tough, tough task.\u00a0 Crap! \n \nAnd at 80 pounds, it's not so easy anymore to sit on the closed toilet and hold him on my lap while the steam does its magic in the bathroom.\u00a0 That was followed by holding him in my bed with the windows wide open in my bedroom (steam followed by cold air being the best way to open up the passages) chilled down to a nice 55 degrees or so with arctic blasts coming in from the river.\u00a0\u00a0 Whatever it takes. \n \nTomorrow we will go to the doctor, get Jake some prednisone so that tomorrow night we can both truly sleep. (And why, oh, why is it always the worst at night?) \n \nBut for now, I have crept away from my child-tossed, fever-sweat-soaked bed to steal a few minutes to myself, knowing that this is all I will have. \n \nFor tomorrow will also bring Jacob wanting all mommy all the time, as every ill child wants and needs to have; the full on glow of his mother's attention and tender ministrations being the comfort thing. \n \nThat and lollipops and ginger ale and (gluten-free) pretzels.\u00a0 And lots of TV.  \n \nNot what I was picturing for \"How I spent my winter vacation.\"\u00a0 But somehow, for this crap year?\u00a0 I shouldn't have been so surprised. \n \nSo I spend tomorrow snuggling my Jacob, curled up on the sofa watching WALL-E for the hundredth time, with non-stop Jakey commentary.\u00a0 It could be worse.\u00a0 Ethan could have it, too (spitting over left shoulder as I type this).  \n \nBecause my lap?\u00a0 While ample?\u00a0 No longer big enough for two. \n \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Wednesday, December 22, 2010", "body": "\nI was going to skip Wordless Wednesday today because I feel like talking, but I've got a few readers that would disappoint (and I'd hate to do that).\u00a0 So this post is going to be a double header. \n \nFirst: a few cute pictures of my family.\u00a0 And then?\u00a0 Some chatter because my brain is all a-clatter.\u00a0 And me?\u00a0 I like to share the noise. \n \nIt's the second day of winter.\u00a0 Let's take a walk down memory lane today to winters past... \n \nHere's one from 2004: \n \n \n Jakey and Me, February 2004 (when my hair was still blonde-ish) \n Snowy day, December 2005:\u00a0  \n \n \n Time to get 3 year-old twins into bundled into snowsuits?\u00a0 Half hour. \n \n \n Maximum time 3 year-olds will spend out sledding?\u00a0 15 minutes. \n How about these from New Year's Eve, 2008?\u00a0\u00a0 We had been up in Great Barrington and were supposed to return to the city that day, but got socked in by a blizzard.\u00a0 So we played in the snow for hours.\u00a0 Yipeee! \n \n \n That was a lot of snow! \n \n \n What could be better than a toboggan pulled by Dad? \n \n \n Snowy Jacob \n \n \n Snowy Ethan \n Looking at these pictures is making me long for snow.\u00a0 So far this winter: bitter cold aplenty, but no snow.\u00a0 Sigh.  \n \nAnd now, for part 2 -- those pesky words:  \n \nI'm actually feeling human today.\u00a0 Today, for the first time in nearly two weeks I woke up without feeling like I was something scraped off the bottom of a shoe. \n \nI forgot how reductive pain is, how it strips the layers of the self away.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been hunkered down in survival mode for so long, I was shocked by clarity and lightness. \n \nIt made me see how I have been not  thinking for days.\u00a0 When you are deep in the brain fog you can't see it, it just feels like atmosphere.\u00a0 It's only when it lifts that I understand how limited of vision, short-sighted as well as short-tempered I have been of late.\u00a0 I know I've been less than 100% present, but how much less was not clear until today; today when I am at least somewhat myself. \n \nMy beast-brain had been at the forefront, large and in charge; now somewhat quelled.\u00a0 My executive functioning is up and running (as much as it ever is in this ADD brain of mine, that is) my frontal lobes asserting themselves once more. \n \nI felt like throwing myself a welcome home party.\u00a0 I've missed me, truly.\u00a0 But I so didn't have time for that.\u00a0 I had so much that needed to get done, that I had not just left un-done but hadn't even realized was sliding off the plate.\u00a0 Especially: arrangements for my post-surgery recovery, which surely involve other people tending to my children for a few days. \n \nYesterday I slept all day.\u00a0 Really... ALL. DAY. \n \nI made it to Ethan's class publishing party at his school, got the car re-parked (NYC alternate parking, it was on the wrong side) then came home and collapsed.\u00a0\u00a0 Set the alarm for 3:55... five minutes before Jake's bus wait-time begins and thanked the gods that someone else was picking up Ethan to take him to Hebrew School.\u00a0 Then?\u00a0 Sleep. \n \nMy husband and I have a running joke...\u00a0 I say: \"I'm so tired I could sleep for a week.\" \n \nHe says: \"Honey, that's called a coma.\" \n \nI pretend to consider the consequences, then conclude: \"That's OK, I'll take it.\" \n \nOnly yesterday?\u00a0 It wasn't so funny.\u00a0 I really did feel that I was nanometers away from not being able to wake. \n \nIf you could call the zombie-like state in which I have been carrying out my minimalist functioning\u00a0 \"awake.\"\u00a0 It's a miracle that I have been able to execute the bare minimum required of competent parenting (kids are taken to school and picked up, fed, clean, homework done and in bed before midnight - CHECK!) \n \nSo you can imagine how happy I was today to be able to think, to function like a normal human being (well, my usual crude imitation of one, anyway). \n \nAnd all this makes me think of Jake, and wondering how his level of internal distraction and discomfort is contributing to his sometime foggy state.\u00a0\u00a0 When he's so busy trying to get enough input to make sense of his senses, there's no room in his brain for the other good stuff. \n \nHe clearly has attention issues, but they're not of the ADD variety.\u00a0 We've tried ADD meds; they do nothing for him, just make him highly cranky and even more distracted (if that's possible) and who needs that?\u00a0 His attention issues are puzzling and seeing how distracted and completely unable to think I've been these past two weeks gets my brain a-humming (now that it's finally awake). \n \nAnyway, I don't have any answers to this, no conclusions drawn.\u00a0 Just musings and questions, lines of inquiry worth chasing down a bit, sometime.\u00a0 When I have some spare time.\u00a0 (Don't all fall off your chairs laughing now.) \n \nAnd now my energy is flagging, and the sofa so inviting.\u00a0 My spurt of productivity of has sputtered out; time for rest and renewal.\u00a0 If I am going to retain my human form tomorrow?\u00a0 I must now put down the mouse, step away from the keyboard. \n \nGoodnight, my friends, goodnight.\u00a0  \n \n I\u2019m linking up to Wordless Wednesday at  Angry Julie Monday . \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, December 21, 2010", "body": "\n I have, lately, had a few people wondering and asking about the origin of my blog's name, and my related nickname/twitter handle. \n \nThey want to know why my blog is called \"The Squashed Bologna: a slice  of life in the sandwich generation\" and I call myself \"The Squashed  Mom.\"\u00a0 What's squashing me?\u00a0  \n \n \n Literally squashed between my boys & my parents, March 2009 \n I didn't think this was such a head-scratcher.\u00a0  I figured appending the subtitle \"a slice of life in the sandwich  generation\" would have made everything clear.\u00a0\u00a0 \nBut apparently?\u00a0 Not. \n \nSo here to set the record straight is my blog name's genesis story, plucked from my  first post  on February 6th, 2010 (with a few edits): \n \n In  February 2005 my very elderly parents moved back to New York  from  Florida, ostensibly to be nearer to their adorable then 2 year-old  twin  grandsons.\u00a0  In reality, so I could take care of them, too.\u00a0 \n That was when I realized what  it meant to be a part of that often cited \u201cSandwich Generation\u201d  demographic.\u00a0\u00a0 \n I  am especially so because I am an older parent who is  also the daughter  of older parents.  Common for my generation / locale /  socioeconomic  milieu.  Very uncommon for theirs.  Heard often at my  suburban  elementary school, when my parents came to an event: \u201dOh, your   grandparents are here.\u201d \n \nI chose to call my blog \u201cThe Squashed Bologna\u201d because that\u2019s what I   started saying, at first laughingly, then later less so, as the   responsibilities of intensive elder care bumped up against the all   encompassing, wonderful maelstrom that is the parenting of young   children:  \u201cOh, this is \u2018the sandwich generation\u2019, that must be why I   feel like the squashed meat in the middle all the time.\u201d \nSo there it is folks, it's \"The Squashed Bologna\" because I felt, and still often feel, like the squashed meat in the middle.\u00a0 Add the autism and ADD into the equation and it's like sticking a 100 lb. weight on top.\u00a0 I guess that means I've been turned into a pressed sandwich, a living croque-madame. \n \nAnd then when I joined Twitter in April 2010, I naturally became @SquashedMom. \n \nAlso, about the pronunciation? \n \nMy \"Bologna\" is the sandwich meat (\"sandwich generation\" - duh),  not  the  city in Italy, so pronounce it like \"baloney\" - \"buh-low-nee\" NOT  \"boh-low-nya\". \n \nWhy did I spell it \"Bologna\" then? \n \nBecause, like I said in  this post , spelling bologna \"baloney\" is just WRONG.\u00a0 Oscar Mayer had me trained right at a young age. \n \nAny other questions?

{"date": "Thursday, December 16, 2010", "body": "\nToday was test day number two for me: repeat bloodwork and a  HIDA scan  of my gall bladder.  This is the one where they inject a bit of radioactive tracer into my vein and watch what happens inside my gall bladder.\u00a0  Ethan is excited by the idea that I *might* just start to develop mutant superpowers afterward, like the characters in his beloved cartoon shows do. \n \nWhat?\u00a0  It could happen?\u00a0 (Remember who I'm married to.\u00a0 Spider-Man, right?) \n \nAnyway, I have not been the happiest camper these last couple of days.\u00a0 I've been edgy and cranky, not my usual self.\u00a0 I have had less patience with the kids at a time when they are needing extra-kind-Mommy, and so I'm not very happy with the parent I'm being. \n \nEthan, little sponge that he is, is really picking up on the heightened anxiety floating freely about our home right now.\u00a0 He has been moody, cranky, a little anxious himself. \n \nAnd for Ethan?\u00a0 This delightfully translates into extra obnoxious.\u00a0 When anxious his impulse control, dubious at the best of times, becomes completely non-existent. \n \nIf I tell him to stop doing something because it is annoying me?\u00a0 He will compulsively do it over and over giggling all the while.\u00a0 And though I know he is not trying to be evil, that it's his anxiety pushing him into this, my reptilian brain reacts not well. \n \nAnd Jacob?\u00a0 When Ethan is bouncing off the walls?\u00a0 Thinks everything about it is funny, and laughs.\u00a0 Maniacally.\u00a0 In Ethan's face.\u00a0 Guess how much Ethan likes  that? \u00a0 Yup. \n \nSo you can see how we're a lovely combo right now.\u00a0 Deep breaths required. \n \nSo, this morning after I brought Ethan to school, I stayed for the  beginning of the PA meeting then stepped out  after the principal's report to head off to doctorville.\u00a0 Then I had a happy surprise: a moment with a dear friend I have just  not had a chance to see hardly at all this fall.  \n \nI got a  quick hug and a big smile; the 3 minute update.\u00a0 Just what I needed.\u00a0 She  wished me luck in my scans today, I told her I would be fine because I  had my book with me. (Leaving it home was my miserable fail on Monday,  although I did catch up on a thousand trashy magazines worth of gossip  about celebrities I didn't care about and fashion I would never in a  zillion years wear.)  \n \nMy friend's eyes lit up; she got all excited the  way only a reader will: \"what-are-you-reading-how-do-you-like-it?\"\u00a0 She works in the  school system, and so her vacations correspond with the kids.\u00a0 Thus the  snuggly week between Christmas & New Year is  her big reading week. \n \nWhen I  told her the three books I am currently in the middle* of,\u00a0 I swear she squealed. \"I want to read all of those. You have to  do a reading list post.\" \u00a0  \n \nAnd this friend?\u00a0 When she talks and  commands  requests?\u00a0 You listen and say yes.\u00a0 Hence the title of this post, which she also  demanded  suggested.\u00a0  \n \nAlso?\u00a0 I am a reader and I love books.\u00a0 (You all knew I was a reader, right?\u00a0 Is there a writer who is not?\u00a0 Doubtful.)\u00a0 So I have been thinking about writing about reading for some time.\u00a0 And it  has perfectly coalesced to be now. \n \nThus I am starting to write this post sitting in the waiting room of the imaging center, as there seems to be a substantial delay in my scan start.\u00a0 And I have figured out  something... writing is even a better distraction from the anxiety of  waiting than reading. \n \nEven if my thumbs are starting to ache.\u00a0 (And have I  mentioned I want an iPad?\u00a0 YES, I WANT AN iPAD.\u00a0 Just saying. \u00a0You know.\u00a0 In  case anyone has an extra $600 sitting around and wants to buy me a belated Chanukkah present. Would be  terrific for Jake, too.) \n \nSitting next to me in the waiting room, there's an old man loudly discussing how to fill out the intake forms with his slightly less elderly wife.\u00a0\u00a0 He is 90 and frail and now I am missing my Dad so achingly much.\u00a0 Being here without him  feels so very odd,  still not right. \n \n I'm  the patient this time?\u00a0 Really?\u00a0 Well OK, if you say so. \n \nThe old couple are misinterpreting and answering a lot of questions wrong, and it takes every ounce of self control in my body to not sidle over and help them.\u00a0 But not today.\u00a0 I'm minding my own business, yes I am. \n \nI'm not listening to the young woman making arrangements to settle back into her life here after having lived abroad for some years.\u00a0 She's trying to renew her very expired driver's license and also to get tenants out of her condo so she can move back in. (People, if you don't want the world knowing the details of your private life?\u00a0 Don't discuss them loudly on your cell phone in waiting rooms.) \n \nThe room abounds in lovely distraction.\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 Have I mentioned I have to fast for this test again today?\u00a0 I am getting so hungry the plump arm of the woman sitting next to me is starting to look good.\u00a0 Or the potted plant in the corner. \n \nDistractions, yes, some days my ADD is wonderful useful.\u00a0 Because folks?\u00a0 I really don't want to think about  why I'm here .  \n \nSo back to the topic at hand: what am I reading? \n \n Well, the  book I brought with me is \" Lit \" the latest book by the wonderful memoirist Mary  Karr.\u00a0 Having been primarily and voraciously a fiction reader my whole  life, I am finding myself increasingly drawn to memoir as my current writing is obviously mining that vein. \n \nThis is a powerful book, and I am happily still close to the beginning, just digging in for a good meal.\u00a0 To quote the back cover blurb (because it's been a long day and I'm feeling tired, so taking a tiny lazy cheat here), Lit is \"about getting drunk and getting sober; becoming a mother by letting go of a mother; learning to write by learning to live.\"\u00a0 Yup, that's the basics. \n \nI love how in spite of the harrowing facts of her life, she keeps a biting sense of humor about everything.\u00a0 How she begins by running from knowledge about herself, but obviously evolves to embrace it.\u00a0 How she reflects constantly on the process of writing, moving from poetry to memoir. \n \nHere's my favorite quote so far: \"Such a small, pure object a poem could be, made of nothing but air, a tiny string of letters, maybe small enough to fit into the palm of your hand.\u00a0 But it could blow everybody's head off.\"  \n \n On my bedroom nightstand, you would find  The Mind's Eye .\u00a0 No one makes neurobiology more interesting and personal than Oliver Sacks.\u00a0 He was the conduit through which most of the world was originally introduced to the amazing autist Temple Grandin. \n \nThis book is yet his most personal, as he is a patient & subject as well as the doctor & observer.\u00a0 In it he documents his growing vision problems due to ocular cancer, leading to blindness in one eye and the accompanying loss of stereoscopic vision.\u00a0 He also talks about his face blindness, a fascinating condition that many people on the autism spectrum share.  \n \nIt is dense and intense writing.\u00a0 It makes my brain tick and click and spin in very good ways.\u00a0 But if I try to read it when I'm too tired?\u00a0 I realize I'm reading the same paragraph over and over, not making enough sense.\u00a0 But when I'm fresh?\u00a0 Wonderful stuff.  \n\u00a0  \n Also, in my bathroom (AKA the Library) is the incredible Rosanne Cash memoir  Composed .\u00a0 This is a re-read for me, a delicious one.\u00a0 I had devoured it when it came out this summer (on my 50th birthday, no less) it being one of those \"can't put it down\" books. \n \nAnd now I have the decided pleasure of coming back to it and taking my time. I know where it is going so I don't have to rush through.\u00a0 I can savor, roll the words around in my mouth and images around in my mind for a while, like tasting a good aged wine. Maybe a Cahors; complex, leathery but delicate, hints of flowers and fruit but lots of earth too.\u00a0  \n \nThis is a great book for bloggers, as it clearly swims in our rivers.\u00a0 Rosanne is a dyed in the wool storyteller with prodigious talents.\u00a0 A few critics have called it rambling.\u00a0 I am a vocal fan of rambling; I say to hell with straightforward.\u00a0 Some folks confuse a lyrical and fluid, organic flow with chaos and lack of structure.\u00a0 Don't listen to them.\u00a0 This book moves like a river; jump in, let it take you for a ride. \n \nYes, there are stories she chooses not to tell.\u00a0 We all have those stories.\u00a0 That hers is such a public life just raises the stakes for her.\u00a0 As any blogger knows, this is not just her story, it's her life, and because she is a mother, it's her children's lives being laid out here. What is told is so lovely and full, emotionally rich and giving of herself, only a greedy fool would call her on what she holds back.  \n \nAt the core of this book are motherhood, parental loss and her creative process.\u00a0 Could anything be more tailor made for me to both enjoy and relate to?\u00a0  \n \nFinally, I have also just finished a children's book that I am really looking forward to Ethan being ready for.\u00a0 It's for a slightly older kid, or a more precocious 8 year old reader than he.\u00a0 This book was brought to my attention by my wonderful book-loving friend Jill. \n \nJill is a children's book editor and writer who keeps a (terrific, if sporadic)  blog  about children's literature and what she and her kids are reading, and also about what she's writing, as she is in the middle of a writing MFA. \n \n The book is  The Wednesday Wars , and it is fabulous.\u00a0 It takes place on Long Island in the late 1960s, which is also the time and place of my own childhood, and the author, Gary D. Schmidt gets it just right (as he was born in Hicksville, New York, so he should). \n \nIt's the story of Holling Hoodhood, the only Presbyterian in his seventh grade class.\u00a0 It takes place over a school year and is about his relationship with a special teacher, his family, a girl, Shakespeare, friendship, the Vietnam War, loyalty, kindness... \n \nI don't want to call it a \"coming of age\" story because that makes people think cliche, and this is anything but.\u00a0 But there is growing up and coming to truths in there, without ever any heavy handedness for even a moment.\u00a0 The book is deep as the ocean and yet full of light.\u00a0 Buy it for a 10 to 12 year old boy you know. But read it first yourself, as you will really enjoy this funny and deeply moving novel. \n \nOK, enough books.\u00a0 Enough blog. \n \nTomorrow I will talk to my doctors, get the results from today's tests, strategize our game plan for going forward. \n \nTomorrow I will eat more skinless chicken and pita bread while dreaming of blue cheese and chocolate truffles. \n \nAnd now, dear friends, I must sleep.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n*writing this on  my Droid, auto-correct tried to make that \"muddle of\" which also feels about  right. \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Saturday, December 18, 2010", "body": "\nWell, I'm two days late for the Special Needs Blog Hop this week.  It's been one of those weeks.  The kind you can't believe was actually ONE week because so much happened during it.   \n \nThe whole Gall Bladder drama.\u00a0  Was it really only a week ago I doubled over in  sudden searing pain ?\u00a0 And now I have a date with a  surgeon . \n \nThen there was Thursday.\u00a0  It started off with a PA meeting, then a trip to the doctors office for repeat blood-work (because my liver panel had come back with scary high numbers), followed by what turned into an all day ordeal at the imaging center.\u00a0  (I did get a really cool  blog post  out of it, though.) \n \nBy the time I got home from the scan, I  was done in.\u00a0  But no.   \n \nThursday evening was: our apartment building's Holiday Party  AND  Jakey's School Holiday Party and Show.\u00a0 (Not to mention, also Ethan's school's annual Teacher Appreciation dinner which I loved working at and would never miss.\u00a0 Until this year.\u00a0 Grumble, grumble.) \n \nA week earlier I had apprised Ethan of Jake's upcoming school event and he had balked.\u00a0 Big time.\u00a0 I had gotten all preachy about how \"he's your brother\" and the value of supporting family members. \n \nHe dug his heels in that he didn't want to go.\u00a0 I dug my heels in that he was going.\u00a0  Then I backpedaled.\u00a0 It was also our building's annual holiday party, an important event for us. \n \nOur apartment building, like many large buildings in New York City with family size apartments, is also somewhat of a community.\u00a0 And of all those I've seen, we are more so than most.\u00a0  We have two awesomely kick-ass building-wide parties a year in our (ridiculously large) lobby:  Halloween  and Holiday.   \n \nWe don't miss them for anything.\u00a0  But for something as important as Jake's school show?\u00a0 We were going to be missing the Holiday one this year.  \n \nAnd I realized this would cause Ethan much sadness.\u00a0  He is good friends with the two boys who live right upstairs from us.\u00a0 They have a standing Friday night playdate.\u00a0 They run up and down the back stairs at will, popping in and out of each other's apartments.\u00a0  If the phone rings at 7:30 AM on a Sunday, I know it's the upstairs neighbor kids calling to see if Ethan can come up.  \n \nSo Thursday I took the \"choose your battles\" and \"try to make your kids happy\" injunctions to heart and left Ethan at home with the upstairs neighbors to attend the Holiday Party and eat candy canes until they came out his ears. \n \nDid I mention I felt like 100% shit by 6 PM Thursday night? \n \nThey had \"challenged my gall bladder\" for the scan.\u00a0 I'd had no idea they were going to do this, would have scheduled the test for Friday if I had known that, so I could go home and just collapse Thursday night, like I  wanted  needed to.\u00a0  \n \nBut there was no chance for that.\u00a0 It was Jacob's school event and we needed to go.\u00a0 He needed to be a part of it. \n \nMy husband was likewise less than enthusiastic.\u00a0 Not a crowd, group, join-y person in any way, shape or form; he loathes large, loud events where he knows few people.\u00a0 And kids?\u00a0 In groups?\u00a0 To say \"not his thing\"?\u00a0 Understatement of the year. \n \nAnd Jacob?\u00a0 Even though it was his event?\u00a0 He wanted to stay home, doesn't like going out in evenings much, wants to play with his toys and watch TV. \n \nSo you can see what a bundle of joy we were as we headed out to this shindig.\u00a0\u00a0 We were stressed and snipping at each other.\u00a0 Not a jolly thought within a mile of us.\u00a0 And did it help that it was a frigid, wind-whipped night, and cabs were as scarce as hen's teeth?\u00a0 No, not at all. \n \nWe finally arrived at the Interfaith Center where the party was taking place.\u00a0 There was a pizza dinner party first, but none of us were eating pizza, so we had purposefully come late for that.\u00a0 The room was full, at that point a sea of strangers to me. \n \nTo briefly explain: Jake's school is unusual.\u00a0 Instead of being housed in a single building, it is diffuse, two or three classrooms of Special Ed kids co-located in a handful of Catholic Schools (for active inclusion purposes) scattered up and down Manhattan's West Side.\u00a0 There were only 20 kids total at Jake's specific location, and this was a gathering of ALL of everybody, up through middle school.\u00a0 And this being Jake's new school, this was my first such gathering of the masses. \n \nAnd then, as we stood there, surely looking a bit like the lost lambs we felt ourselves to be, I heard a voice cry out from the crowd: \n \n\"Jake! There's Jakey! He's here!\"\u00a0 And an eight year old boy appeared before us, with a big grin on his face, trailed by two more.\u00a0 They hugged and high-fived our son, took him by the hand and carted him off to the table where his teacher and much of the rest of his class were munching on pizza. \n \nTears sprang into my eyes.\u00a0 Grateful tears. \n \nI turned to my husband.\u00a0 \"This is why we're here.\"\u00a0 And by \"here\" I meant both this night AND his school.  \n \nI was mopping up the tears that kept running down my cheek (good thing I hadn't had time for mascara) as we waded through the crowd to catch up with our son. \n \nWhen we found \"our crowd\" all the teachers, therapists, administrators who work with our son smiled at him, at us.\u00a0 Were so happy we were there.\u00a0 Many hugs all around.\u00a0 And I was once again filled with knowing how lucky we were to have landed here. \n \nI can hardly imagine a nicer, kinder, more intelligent, open and thoughtful group of people to be in charge of my son.\u00a0 And the tears just kept on coming. \n \nThen it was time to move into the great hall and see the show.\u00a0 Each class had a song or two to show us, and there was a sing-a-long in the plans, too.\u00a0  \n \nIt was exactly as adorably amateurish and goofy as you are imagining.\u00a0 Some of the kids were so excited, they were bubbling over, jumping around like grasshoppers. \n \n \n Jake waiting with classmates \n Others seemed more subdued, some even a little shy, reticent.\u00a0 Some needed leading, more direction than others.\u00a0 It's a very diverse community.\u00a0 This is not an all autism school, but one that serves kids with a whole mix of special needs.  \n \nBut the kids do have one thing in common.\u00a0 They are sweet kids.\u00a0 There's not a mean one in the bunch.\u00a0 This is so important to us in ways too numerous to count. \n \nAnd tonight I am loving everybody.\u00a0 From the how-could-they-be-that-tiny Kindergartners in their grass skirts doing something like the hula to a tropical christmas song to the loping pre-teenagers clearly not ready to inhabit those awkward bodies, but making a go of it anyway, swaying and singing along to \"Feed the World\" and a rousing \"Hanukkah, Oh Hanukkah.\" \n \nThere were, of course, some technical difficulties, but everyone pulled through like the troopers they were.\u00a0  \n \n \n Waiting for the music to start \n Jacob's class sang a boisterous holiday medley that included \"Happy Diwali\" in honor of their Indian teacher. \n \n \n Still waiting for the music to start \n \n \n Jake's class putting on a fine show \n We left exhausted, but with big grins on our faces.\u00a0 We wouldn't have missed this for all the world. \n \nWait, didn't I start off this post mentioning the Special Needs Blog hop?\u00a0 Yes, yes I did, and here's the connection (and the link)... \n \n \nThe prompt this week was \"What I Want for the Holidays:\" (Actually it was \"What I Want for Christmas\", but being Jewish, we don't do Christmas, so I'm paraphrasing.) \n \nAnd what I want is what I got Thursday night: a Community for Jacob.\u00a0 Friendship and a place where he fits in, belongs.\u00a0 He has never quite had this before.\u00a0 We are very, very lucky. \n \nAnd for that I am grateful, deeply grateful.\u00a0 And weeping happy, grateful tears. \n \n \n \nNote: As it seems appropriate, I am also linking this up to Maxabella loves \"Grateful Saturday\" blog hop.\u00a0 Click her button below to join in or just visit this lovely Australian blogger. \n \n \n \n \u00a0Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2010", "body": "\nGall Stones, that is. \n \nWhat?\u00a0 You thought I was talking about my  Mom-balls  again? \n \nYeah, I've got those, too.\u00a0 Just try to take away a vital service from my autistic son, Jacob.\u00a0 Mess with him and you will see my giant huevos come out, big time. \n \nI mean, even though my *actual* eggs are kind of over-cooked at this point (see my  last post ), my metaphorical ones?\u00a0 My \"don't mess with my family\" ones? \n \nOutsize and ready for action. \n \nBut about that other thing?\u00a0 Yeah, I'd really like to pretend this isn't happening. \n \nBut doubling over in slicing, cramped pain and then making a mad dash to the women's room to gag and dry heave for 10 minutes during my son's basketball practice on Saturday sorta makes that impossible. \n \nI cannot say enough about how happy I am to have the good fortune to have actual medical professionals in my family, both natal and the machatunim.\u00a0 (That's Yiddish for the whole {damned} family you marry into - you know, the in-laws.) \n \nI had already self diagnosed via the friendly internet on Saturday night.\u00a0 When I was finally able to stop moaning and sit upright, that is. \n \nBut you know?\u00a0 The internet?\u00a0 Scary place to do medical research.\u00a0 Reminds me of that old  Nicole Hollander  cartoon, the one where Sylvia is reading a book called \"Infectious Diseases.\"\u00a0 As her daughter warns her to put the book down, she yells out \"Oh my god, I've got anthrax!\" \n \nIn spite of the chance to just completely terrify myself, I kept a mostly level head. \n \nBut the problem with hot-knife style searing pain of mind bending proportions in the area of one's major organs?\u00a0 Hard to believe it's no biggie, not connected to a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention. \n \nBut a nice chat with my lovely ER doc cousin, Jessie, in Vermont reassured me that had I come into her ER, she would have been all \"Crap! Why is this person in my ER?\u00a0 It's just a gall bladder attack, nothing dangerous. I had to wake up from my nap for THIS?\" (She often works the overnight shift.) \n \nShe told me to see my doctor on Monday, went over the warning signs that should send me rushing to the ER for real, and gave me advice for how to get myself comfortable in the meantime (antacid, Tylenol, rest, duh).  \n \nAnd the next day I felt mostly better, which was a mighty good thing, it being the Sunday of my husband's family's annual Big Chanukkah Party.\u00a0 (I know, not technically Chanukkah anymore.\u00a0 But?\u00a0 Shhhhhhh.\u00a0 It was so early this year.) \n \nWhat?\u00a0 You want to see pictures of that?\u00a0 OK here's a few: \n \n \n Lighting Grandma Blanche's menorah \n \n \n Presents Galore! \n \n \n Grandma Sylvia got a zhu zhu pet \n And at this bash?\u00a0 Yes, indeed, I sidled up to Danny's cousin who happens to be a G.I. with that \"you are about to be cornered by a relative with a medical question\" look on my face, and he did not back off and disappear, which I took to be the go-ahead sign.\u00a0 (If you're confused here?\u00a0 Folks, we're Jewish.\u00a0 To us \"G.I.\" is short for Gastro-Intestinal as in a doctor's specialist degree, NOT Government Issue as in \"G.I. Joe\".\u00a0 Please!) \n \nSo I asked cousin David, \"Do you do Gall Bladder?\"\u00a0 And he gestured for me to continue. \n \nI described my symptoms, and when I got to the part about the pain finally localizing in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen and then radiating to my back under my shoulder blade, he nodded.\u00a0 Then he poked at a spot and I yelped and he said to call his office at 8:30 the next morning and they'd get me in right away. \n \nOh yes, I married into the right family! \n \nSo all this is how, yesterday, I came to have my first complete and thorough physical exam in... maybe 10 years? \n \nThe problem with being essentially healthy and taking care of multiple elderly parents and young kids with all sorts of issues is that you can neglect your own health big time.\u00a0 (I *might* have done that.) \n \nUntil there's a big wake-up call.\u00a0 Like, oh, feeling like you're being sliced in half by a ninja out of the clear blue at 2:45 on a Saturday afternoon while your autistic son is attempting to play basketball. \n \nWhat?\u00a0 You want to know how the basketball is going? \n \nYes, I did  share my excitement  about it, and planned to report back right away.\u00a0\u00a0 But life got... busy, you know? \n \nBriefly: it's going well-ish.\u00a0  (A full post account is coming up soon, I sort-of promise.)\u00a0 Here, look at some cute pictures (sorry about the odd color, there's weird yellow lights in that gym): \n \n \n One excited boy \n \n \n Playing basketball, sort of \n So, back to my foray into all things medical yesterday... having been a basically healthy person for 50 years (and believe me, I know how blessedly lucky I am about this, am grateful & do not take it for granted) my experience with medical procedures has been mostly on the sidelines. \n \nLet me tell you, there was a more than slightly surreal quality to be personally undergoing the same diagnostic procedures that I had sat through countless times as the support person for a parent or friend. \n \nLike deja-vu with a side-step.\u00a0 Like in those dreams when your point of view flashes back and forth between a first and third person perspective, leaving you wondering if you are watching or experiencing the events at hand.  \n \nTo be the one in the ugly, ill-fitting gown on the table myself?\u00a0 Very, very weird. \n \nWhat?\u00a0 You want pictures of that, too?\u00a0 Well, here's me waiting for someone to come into the room and do something to me: \u00a0  \n \n \n Beige is so NOT my color \n So I've now had my first echocardiogram, folks.\u00a0 And you young people with healthy hearts who have never had to care for someone with cardiac troubles will not get what a big deal this is.\u00a0 But if you're on my side of the fence, you will understand the thrill, and why I'm bragging:  \n \nMy ejection fraction?\u00a0 Was terrific.\u00a0 (The \" ejection fraction \" is a measurement of the heart's efficiency at pumping blood, and is severely compromised in Aortic Stenosis, the condition that did my father in.) \n \nI jumped with joy.\u00a0 (Well, I would have if I weren't laying on a table covered in yucky ultrasound goop.)\u00a0  \n \nConsidering that I am essentially allergic to exercise?\u00a0\u00a0 I have no right to have a heart as healthy as mine appears to be.\u00a0 And I am NOT going to take this for granted.\u00a0 I am going to thank my  lucky stars and work from here on outward to not let this good start  turn sour through inactivity and complacency. \n \nI am a 50  year old with young children. I need to do all I can to ensure I am  here to care for them through their formative years, to do all that is  within my power to not abandon them too young.\u00a0 (Please hold me to this.\u00a0 Yell at me if I don't start to take better care of myself in the future.) \n \nI am guessing I have my love of dancing to thank for the positive state of things.\u00a0 Those years of my late teens through mid-twenties when I went out dancing with wild abandon two or three nights a week. \n \nAnd the way I danced?\u00a0 Way aerobic.\u00a0 I would work up quite a sweat.\u00a0 Hell, I would often sweat completely through and thoroughly soak my clothes.\u00a0\u00a0 Looking back it's a wonder anyone ever dared go home with me afterward, sweatball that I was. \n \nAlthough it must have helped that, as an old boyfriend put it, I \"danced like a girl who likes to fuck.\"\u00a0 Ahem.\u00a0 Guess I wasn't afraid to move my hips. \n \nSigh.\u00a0 It's nice thinking about a time when my body was more about pleasure than pain. \n \nBut getting back to the icky medical stuff.\u00a0 I ended my day at the imaging center I had taken my father to many a time before.\u00a0 Once again, the odd disconnect of shifted perspective. \n \n\"You've been a patient here before?\"\u00a0 The receptionist asked the question as a not-question, rhetorical. Clearly I looked familiar.\u00a0 She thought I was a returner, a repeat customer. \n \n\"No\" I answer.\u00a0 Then, because she has raised her eyebrow sceptically I start to question it myself.\u00a0 \"I don't think so...\" I stammeringly add, \"I've been here so many times, but I'm pretty sure that it was always to bring my father in.\" \n \n\"Well, let's check, then\" she says, inputting my statistics into the computer, which spits back... nothing. First timer.\u00a0 Fill out the thousand forms and bring back the clipboard.  \n \nThe technician is friendly, chatty, and I don't mind.\u00a0 Gowned and gelled yet again, I am lying on the table when she swings the monitor around to show me: a solid white almond shaped nugget in the black hole that is my ultrasound gall bladder.\u00a0 \"Stone\" she says.  \n \nWell, at least I wasn't imagining things.  \n \n\"Is it a big one?\" I ask, watching this thing taking up a good quarter of my gall bladder float around like an jumbo olive in a small martini glass. \n \n\"Oh, yeah, I would say that. The good thing is, it's too big to pass through the duct.\" \n \n\"That's a  good  thing?\" \n \n\"Yeah, better than the granules, they really hurt going through.\" \n \nOK, I'm happy to just take her word on that. \n \nSo now we wait on the blood-work, schedule another test in a few days (they're going to make my blood a teensy bit radioactive), and then?\u00a0\u00a0 Review the findings and evaluate my options. \n \nApparently, wave a magic wand and make it all go away?\u00a0 Not among them.\u00a0 Damn! \n \nI may have a date with a laproscopic surgeon in my near future.\u00a0 We may wait and see. \n \nAnd if I do end up having my Gall Bladder removed?\u00a0 Here's to hoping the guy doing it looks just like Weird Al Yankovic in his classic \"Like a Surgeon\"  video . \n \nBecause I want to go under the knife laughing. \n \n Looking for  Comments?

{"date": "Tuesday, December 7, 2010", "body": "\nI am feeling down today.\u00a0 Blue.\u00a0 Under-slept and over-tired.\u00a0 Getting absolutely nothing done.\u00a0 Reading, eating cookies.\u00a0 Not answering the phone, just not feeling social enough.  \n \nAnd that shower I was going to take this morning?\u00a0 Not yet, my friends (be very glad computers aren't equipped with smell-o-vision). \n \nAnd it wasn't even classic peri-menopausal insomnia keeping me up last night; I just didn't let myself go to bed.\u00a0 Because, don't you know, if you don't go to sleep, then tomorrow never comes.\u00a0 Convenient little trick, isn't it?  \n \nWhat?\u00a0 That doesn't work?\u00a0 Yeah, I kind of figured that out myself. \n \nI was wondering why I was such a hot mess right now, and then realized, of course, it's an anniversary. And not a happy one. \n \nOn this day, December 7th, last year, Dad went into the hospital for back to back check-ups with his cardiac and vascular doctors.\u00a0 I had cleared the whole morning.\u00a0 I didn't get home until nearly midnight. \n \nWhen the vascular doctor could find absolutely no blood flow to his left leg, and his cardiologist looked at his echo-cardiogram, it was clearly all going south.\u00a0 Fast. \n \nThere was an operation. There were events and procedures.  \n \nWhen they sent him home a few days later, it was to die.  \n \nWe were told to expect him to last a few days, a few weeks at the absolute outside. \n \nIt was not an easy or happy holiday season last year and all the festiveness circling round me this year is leaving me likewise cold.  \n \nIn some ways it\u2019s even harder.  \n \nLast year there was my father's constant needs to be met, his acute care to engage in; my brother and sister charging in to spend final, precious time with Dad; my devastated mother to comfort; a swirl of practical activity as we prepared for his last few final days. \n \n And then ?\u00a0 He lived three more months. The whole winter.  \n \nMy father spent last winter, the whole fucking winter, dying. Very slowly.\u00a0 (Sometimes being strong can work against you.)  \n \nAnd now, to me, winter =  death . And I don't want to have anything to do with it.\u00a0 I want to stay inside and hide.  \n \nBut I have children.\u00a0 They need to come and go, and can\u2019t do it alone. \n \nThis cold blustery weather brings me back to all those freezing late night trips across town to buy the adult diapers that my mother informs me they are out of at 11 pm.  \n \nThose 2 a.m. trips to pick him up off the floor when he had fallen, getting out of bed and walking to the kitchen, which his doctors had assured us was an utter impossibility for one so frail and infirm.  \n \nThey had no idea what a  stubborn, willful man  my father was.\u00a0 If he wanted to go to the kitchen, he was walking into the kitchen, damn it, dying body or no. \n \nAnd then he was no longer capable of even that.\u00a0 And then there needed to be round the clock care.  \n \nAnd then, finally, for his final three days, he was in the caring shelter of a hospice in the nether regions of the Bronx.\u00a0 I hated the long ride out there on traffic choked streets through those blasted, blighted neighborhoods more than anything in my life to that point. \n \nIn the gray March chill of a clinging winter that would not loose hold, I said farewell to my father.\u00a0 To the ragged, skin-stretched skeleton that was what was left of him.  \n \nI am not looking forward to these next three months, re-living those days.\u00a0 I wish for an end to this awful year of bereft firsts.  \n \nI am wishing I could just fly south, like birds and butterflies. Flee; fly free of winter; skip out on all this. \n \nBut I have children, here.\u00a0 A husband.\u00a0 An elderly, sad, increasingly lost mother.  \n \nAnd these ties that bind also offer what solace there is. They are my warmth, my light; my summer-in-winter.  \n \nAnd if I hold them a little too tightly tonight, with my eyes shining a little too brightly, I hope they will understand. \n \n Looking for\u00a0 Comments?\u00a0 I still  haven't fixed my \"Intense Debate  disappearing comment link on home page  view problem\" yet, so if you are  viewing this on my home page and want  to read my comments or make one of  your own, click on the post's title  to bring you to the post page view.

\n \nAnd then it all froze up.\u00a0 I was in Siberia.\u00a0 Every post I wrote, including the one that had inspired my inquiry, turned into something else.\u00a0 Lovely posts for  MY  blog, but for Nichole?\u00a0 Bupkis. \n \nI kept thinking I should write to her to let her know I was not there yet, not even close.\u00a0 But instead I kept starting more posts thinking *THIS* would be the one, only to watch them drive off the cliff once again into long rambling tangles messes full of \"big ideas\" or cranky, humorously complaining rants (otherwise known as my usual posting styles). \n \nThen I got really busy.\u00a0 Distracted. \n \nThanksgiving.\u00a0 Chanukkah, blasted early this year.\u00a0\u00a0 Dinners and parties.\u00a0\u00a0 Presents to buy and wrap.\u00a0 Latkes to purchase.\u00a0 (You didn't think I was going to say \"fry\" did you?\u00a0 Maybe I have not thoroughly explained the nature of my un-domestic-goddessness at this point in my life.) \n \nAnd then on Saturday, as I was heading off to our Synagogue's Chanukkah party, I received this DM on Twitter from Nichole, an ever so gentle and gracious check-in: \n \n \nOh, Holy Crap! \n \nSo I sent her a stream of DMs back - about 10 in a row - because seriously, people, 140 characters is not nearly enough space to back pedal and hem and haw and wheel and deal and promise but not promise and, um, I'dbeentryingandhadamillionunfinishedposts and wasstillworkinghardtofinishone and  IthoughtI'dhaveitdone yesIwillbutmaybeIwon't and... \n \nI am  not  copying and pasting them in here, way too embarrassing.\u00a0 Let's just say that they were a cut above \"the dog ate my homework, I promise I'll bring it in tomorrow.\"\u00a0 It was all true, but really, did Nichole need my anxiety about finishing this piece splayed out for her (in 140 character mini-blasts, no less)? \n \nUm, I don't think so. \n \nShe replied.\u00a0 Graciously.\u00a0 Let me know she understood how the holidays can be a stressful time and maybe I had too much on my plate, she would write something herself for this Monday.\u00a0 She would take my post whenever I was ready and re-schedule me for January. \n \nThere was not a hint of reproach in her \"voice\" but I knew I had disappointed her.\u00a0 And that just did not sit right by me.\u00a0 I had made a commitment, damn it. \n \nSo? \n \nOh, Holy Crap, I have a post to write for Monday. \n \nBut unlike my own blog where I can, if need be, finish a post at 11:59 p.m. and have that count for the day, I have to send this to someone else.\u00a0 Nichole has to get it BEFORE Monday at 6 a.m.\u00a0 Significantly before. \n \nSo even though I said I wouldn't and couldn't, I stayed up til 4 a.m. Saturday, the night before our little Chanukkah party (because sleep is only for the sane). \n \nGot it done.  \n \nChucked everything else I had written (and some of those are turning out to be damn fine posts for my blog, you'll be seeing them soon) and wrote a fresh post that ended up being a lot about the process of figuring out how to write my small moments post. \n \nBut don't worry, me being me, there's death, autism and ADD in there.\u00a0 Also a little humor. \n \nNichole: I publicly apologize for any and all agony I caused you while waiting for my post.\u00a0 You are a very nice person, and no one should ever torture you.\u00a0 When, someday, I meet you in real life, I will buy you the beverage of your choice as a token of my gratitude for your kind patience. \n \nSo now I figure I should come with a warning label:\u00a0 If you ask me to write a guest post for you, you have to give me a deadline, or it will never get done.\u00a0 But then, you should expect me to torture you and make you think it might not get done, but then in the end I will pull through and get it done, because I just can't stand to disappoint my friends. \n \nUm, think I'm going to get any more guest post offers? \n \nWell, you never know, bloggers being a generally neurotic lot, I might.\u00a0 They just might understand. \n \nAnd also?\u00a0 If they're smart?\u00a0 Have another post waiting in the wings just in case I truly crash and burn next time without pulling something useful from the wreckage. \n \nSo, now, if you haven't done it already, click on that button up at the top.\u00a0 Or this one, conveniently placed just below (because I'm all about convenience, don't you know): \n \n \nSee you back here tomorrow!  \n \n \n Looking for\u00a0 Comments?\u00a0 I still haven't fixed my \"Intense Debate disappearing comment link on home page view problem\" yet, so if you are viewing this on my home page and want to read my comments or make one of your own, click on the post's title to bring you to the post page view.

The busy, busy season is upon us, with lots of (how am I ever going to get through it) school vacation days.\u00a0 And so I am pushing off this blog project onto the new year. \n \nSo until then: welcome, everyone, to a work in progress. \n \nI'm even tinkering around with the HTML a little, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.\u00a0 I'm not a real computer person, though I find them to be intriguing little beasties.\u00a0 I've figured a few things out myself, and can do a bit of code cut and pasting, some basic HTML tagging without doing too much harm.\u00a0 Yet. \n \nIf you ever show up and my blog is utterly broken, please have patience, it will be fixed soon. It just means my beginners luck has run out and I've done something heinous to my code and will be working to rapidly undo it, once I've figured out what that should be. \n \nAlso the other breaking news is that I have finally gotten so tired of Blogger's non-interactive comment system that I've gone and installed the IntenseDebate system for comments.\u00a0 This will be my first post with it up and running, so let's hope its functional.\u00a0 And also?\u00a0 Now with CommentLuv.\u00a0 Because I can. \n \nLeave me a comment, and I'll ANSWER you!\u00a0 Whoo hoo!\u00a0 (Unless it's broken, then let me go cry in the corner for a minute before I pick myself up off the floor and fix it.) \n \nThe only other option was to switch to Wordpress, as many of you have done and have urged me to do.

{"date": "Saturday, December 4, 2010", "body": "\n    If you want to see my son Jacob completely lose his shit, if you want to see him totally fall apart, weeping and wailing like his puppy just died (no we don't have a puppy)? \n \nGet him wet. \n \nSplash him from a water fountain.\u00a0 Or better yet?\u00a0 Spill an entire glass of water right down his front, completely soaking him to the skin through his shirt, pants, and underwear. \n \nTo make it even better?\u00a0  Have it be the last clean short sleeve school uniform shirt in the house that he was wearing.\u00a0  And have the school bus coming in five minutes. \n \nWe might have done that the other morning.\u00a0 Yes, we did. \u00a0 And I'm amazed the upstairs neighbors didn't call the police.\u00a0 (Glad they're friends of ours and very understanding). \n \nAnd the funny thing?\u00a0 Jacob LOVES water.\u00a0 When he's naked or in a bathing suit. \n \nJake takes long baths and has the time of his life playing in the tub. \u00a0 He swims like a fish, will spend all day in the pool, laughing. \n \nBut get two drops of water on his street clothing? \n \nScreams like a banshee.  Will not be consoled.  Must be immediately stripped of said wet clothing and changed into dry. \n \nEven in the summer when its 102 and is cooling him off nicely, will dry in 5 minutes.\u00a0  That's 5 minutes of screaming bloody murder, folks.\u00a0  Now you know why if you ever see me out on the street with Jacob, you will see one of us carrying a rather full backpack.   \n \nBecause, Jacob, while being more flexible, embracing of new experiences, less rigid than 99% of his brethren on the autism spectrum?  Still has a few specific things that will send him over the edge.  Like getting his clothes wet, even the teensy, tiniest bit.\u00a0 Like becoming thirsty or hungry, even the teensy, tiniest bit.   \n \nSo with our boys at age 8 we are not yet the light-hearted, light-packing folks, the parents of older kids who can step out of our apartments with nothing but our bodies and a few dollars in our pockets, tripping along the sidewalk, confident that anything suddenly needed can be purchased along the way. \n \nNo, we still travel heavy, like the parents of infants and toddlers who must anticipate and pack for a multitude of possible scenarios.  \n \nIt always comes as a surprise when something freaks Jake out because it is so out of keeping to his regular M.O.\u00a0 Jake's particular variety of SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder) is mostly  hypo -sensitive, that is his brain under interprets the information from his senses, needing MORE rather than less input/information to make sense of his environment. \n \nThus Jake is a \"sensory seeker\" and excited by the new, by the big and bold.\u00a0 He is happy in a noisy crowd that would cower his hyper- or over-sensitive counterparts on the continuum.\u00a0 So we go out a lot.\u00a0 Feed his hungry brain. \n \nIt appears there is one sensory sensation he is not seeking: wet clothes.\u00a0 But I think the root of the problem is not sensory, it's emotional / developmental.\u00a0 And it connects to his language processing differences, to boot (as seemingly nearly everything about Jake does). \n \nThe big issue is that when he gets water on himself accidentally, it's because of some sort of accident or mistake.\u00a0 He will often say \"This is bad\" in a quavering voice before he totally loses it. \n \nAnd at the core?\u00a0 Jacob still doesn't understand the difference between something feeling bad to him and himself BEING bad.\u00a0 And because this is all such and abstract concept, the difference between feeling and being, Jake feels like he IS bad when he is wet. \n \nAnd it just breaks my heart over and over again as I hold him while he sobs and I try to get him to calm down, to understand that it is really no big deal. \n \nI can say \"It's just water, we all get wet, you'll be dry in a minute...\" until I'm blue in the face.\u00a0 I have even splashed myself on purpose to show him how casually I regard getting wet.\u00a0 But it does no good. \n \nHe will get over this when he is ready to get over it, when some new understanding dawns. \n \nAnd until then? \n \nI hold my boy and get a bit wet myself as his tears cascade over me.\u00a0\u00a0 I fetch him clean dry clothes and make all it right with the universe again. \n \nUntil next time the rains come down.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPp99_5ImYI/AAAAAAAAATU/6tQDwzAoJU8/s1600/IMAG0369.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/12/here-comes-rain-again.html", "title": "\nHere Comes the Rain Again\n"},

What is a recent accomplishment that your child  has\u00a0made? \n \nI can do this!\u00a0 Because Jacob, even when  I'm  feeling stuck in the middle of all  the fears  and frustrations about him, is always full of all kinds of awesome and wonderful.\u00a0  \n \nOK, here's one... although to many this may sound more like a problem, believe me, it's an accomplishment: \n \nJacob had started to verbally protest the things he doesn't like in his life.\u00a0 A\u00a0 lot.\u00a0 He has become the king of \"No.\"\u00a0  \n \nHe knows what he wants and doesn't want, and wants  US  to know it too.\u00a0 Even when he goes along, he does so under protest.\u00a0  \n \nWhy is this good?\u00a0 If, like me until recently, you have had a kid on the spectrum who has been too compliant, too unnaturally \"good\" for his age, you know what I'm talking about, here. \n \nSweetness and good nature are fine.\u00a0 But an eight year old who meekly goes along with everything they are asked to do, or who shows his displeasure by getting all spacey/sleepy and shutting down?\u00a0 Not so good.\u00a0 In fact, highly untypical. \n \nI should know.\u00a0 Jake has a twin.\u00a0 A spunky, opinionated, adorably obstinate, wise-ass twin.\u00a0 Jake is becoming more like him, in this regard, at last.\u00a0 God help me. \n \nThis has been brewing for a while.\u00a0 I have  written about it before .\u00a0 But these days?\u00a0 The spunk is front and center.\u00a0 So I thought I'd celebrate it here, as an accomplishment.\u00a0 Because it is one.\u00a0 Not the most convenient and pleasant development for me, but important for him.\u00a0 And that's what counts, right? \n \nAnd also?\u00a0 Sometimes?\u00a0 It can be entertaining, when I remember to keep my sense of humor intact. \n \nJake had me cracking up today.\u00a0 Once again, he did NOT want to do his homework.\u00a0 Who wants to do homework?\u00a0 Not me!\u00a0 Not his (sort of) typical brother, Ethan, either.\u00a0 All I have to do is say \"Homework Wars\" to my mom friends and they all groan in sympathy. \n \nSo when Jake gets home and I say: \"Homework time, Jake\" he says: \"No, no homework, Mommy!\" and also: \"I don't like homework.\" \n \nWhich I acknowledge is his prerogative. \u00a0 He may protest as much as he wants, can tell me how much he hates it.\u00a0 But we're still doing homework. \n \n\"You are a student.\u00a0 Doing homework is part of your job, Jake.\u00a0 Time to do your job.\"\u00a0 In spite of his new found spunk, Jacob is still, at heart, a sweet and compliant boy.\u00a0 So when he sees that, all desire to the contrary, he is not in charge and that homework must be done, he comes to sit at the table, picks up his pencil. \n \nI give him a choice of starting with the math sheet or the writing.\u00a0 He chooses math, and settles in, I *think* peacefully.\u00a0 Sure enough, he marches through the problems like a trooper.\u00a0 But *NOT* like a good soldier. \n \nAs always, he narrates the process out loud as he does the math, but this time with a little creativity: \n \n\"Seven plus five is... twelve. NO!\" \n \n\"Four plus four is eight. NO!\" \n \n\"Fifteen minus nine is... six. NO!\" \n \nAnd so it went. \n \nYes, a whole page of math problems, punctuated with a loud \"NO!\" after each correct answer.\u00a0\u00a0 Protest duly noted, we went on to the writing sheet. \n \n\"What is the dog in the picture doing, Jake?\" \n \n\"Playing with the boy.

{"date": "Tuesday, November 30, 2010", "body": "\n    This morning I had coffee with a friend after we dropped our kids off at school.\u00a0 I should have gone right home and done the 10,000 things on my un-done to-do list, but this had been one of  those  mornings. \n \nUp too late followed by up too early.\u00a0 My morning Twitter stream reflected this: \n \n \n \u00a0 \nSo, clearly, I needed the coffee and the friendship to get my morning turned around.  \n \nMy friend, in turn, really needed to talk to someone about another friendship of hers which was hitting a rough patch. And, somehow, of all the people in her life, I am the one who has a direct yet separate connection to this other person, will understand where her frustrations are coming from, and also why she values this friend so deeply.\u00a0 So we talked for a while, and strategized, and sighed big sighs.\u00a0 Because this friendship stuff?\u00a0 While wonderful?\u00a0 Can also be really hard. \n \nAnd then, this morning,  I started to talk about Jacob and how he's doing.\u00a0 And for some reason, this morning, something gathered momentum and came together in my brain that I had never let coalesce before, and I was crying and blurting out my fears for Jacob's future. \n \nAt this point, although things are far from certain, there is growing in me the gnawing fear that Jake will never be able to live completely independently, will always need some sort of care, a custodian to watch out for him for the rest of his life.\u00a0 And that shit just tears me apart. \n \nBecause at ages 4, 5, 6?\u00a0 The future is wide open.\u00a0 We were still thinking we might find the magic hat trick that would rapidly pull Jacob together.\u00a0\u00a0 Not a \"cure\", not a miracle; we were under no illusions that Jake will suddenly fall off the autism spectrum and become \"normal\" (whatever THAT is).\u00a0 But some kids I had known since Jake was little, who seemed much more messed up than he was then, have had these rapid turnarounds where they are now merely quirky and odd.\u00a0 They are now kids who are socially \"off\" but still in the realm of regular. \n \nThey can go into regular classrooms with a bit of help, they are now like the kids we called \"nerds\" back in my day.\u00a0 But they will clearly be able to navigate some sort of life for themselves as adults, with jobs (likely in the computer industry).\u00a0 They will be part of the growing high-functioning Autism/Aspergers community; they will have their own place to fit in. \n \nJacob on the other hand?\u00a0 At eight?\u00a0 Is a lovely, loving boy, making slow, gradual, steady progress.\u00a0 He is a boy who can talk, but not yet carry on a real conversation.\u00a0\u00a0 A boy who still prefers to meow, and growl; who struggles to find the right words.  \n \nJacob is still so often and easily baffled by the world and the expectations of others in it.\u00a0\u00a0 And to learn and stay focused?\u00a0 He needs a lot of support.\u00a0 Someone right at his elbow keeping his attention on where it needs to be.\u00a0 And that's not changing much.\u00a0 And I don't know if it ever will.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope so, but I just don't know. \n \nAnd I think in how few years he will be be a big boy, a teenager, an adult.\u00a0 Blink, blink.\u00a0 And I am afraid.\u00a0 And I cried. \n \nAnd then, because we so needed to, we laughed until we snorted our lattes out our noses. \n \nI had pulled out my Droid and showed my friend the website I had found last night, that one that had my husband calling out from the other room wondering if I were all right or having an attack of some sort. \n \nThe website is called  Damn You Auto Correct! \u00a0 and it's a \"reality\" humor site, like  Sh*t My Kids Ruined  and  Cake Wrecks .\u00a0 In this case, people copy and send in texted conversations that have gone horribly wrong because the typing auto-correct feature on iPhones (and other devices like them) has made a baaad, baaad guess and changed an intended word or phrase into something... more interesting. \n \nAnd often?\u00a0 Rather obscene.\u00a0 Or disgusting, or humiliating, or disturbing. \n \nBut always?\u00a0 Utterly hilarious. \n \nLatte snorting hilarious.\u00a0 Hyena laugh hilarious.\u00a0 Give yourself the hiccups hilarious.\u00a0 OK, you get my point. \n \nThe funniest are (of course) the filthiest, and I'm not going to share those with you here, keeping some small semblance of decorum on this blog.\u00a0 But I'm notifying you they are there, don't go there if you don't want to see that.\u00a0 But if you do?\u00a0 Please go and snort away. \n \nAlso?\u00a0 Do not be drinking anything when you go to this site.\u00a0 You have been warned.\u00a0 I will NOT be held responsible for your messed up computer/smartphone/iPad/husband if you spit-take all over it/him.  \n \nHere are a few choice examples that had my friend and I\u00a0sprawled across the table trying to compose ourselves and happily ignoring the questioning stares of the other coffee shop patrons as we brayed away and used up all our napkins wiping off the laughter tears: \n \n \nOr this one: \n \nI like the twist in this one: \n \nOK, this is truly 8 year-old boy humor.\u00a0 But also?\u00a0 Funny. \n \nAnd I thought it was bad when my phone turns \"Ethan\" into \"Ethanol\": \n \nHere's one that's actually completely clean, yet surprisingly still funny: \n \nBut, finally, I think this one is truly my favorite: \n \nSee?\u00a0 So the next time you are getting all scowly at life?\u00a0 Go there and gleefully waste a few minutes.

The \"do not touch\" proscriptive was unbearable to them and I got really tired of having to pull them off temptingly climbable sarcophagi while the guards gave us bloody murder stares as they yelled at my kids. \n \nEthan even claims to want to be an artist, while remaining completely ignorant of art history.\u00a0 I feel like I have lost my vision of myself as the parent I thought I would be, sharing my many cultural interests and enthusiasms with my kids. The combo of boy energy and Autism has slowly eroded that, and I can see now that I have to try to find a way back.\u00a0 I think a pair of solo visits, just one boy at a time with me, and on an uncrowded day is in order in our near future. \n \nBut back to our outing... \n \nThe crowds were out, but not unbearable.\u00a0 We managed to stay reasonably together and regroup when separated.\u00a0 We hit up Egypt and then European painting up through the impressionists.\u00a0 The boys were not completely awful.\u00a0 Small victories, but significant. \n \nDid they get something out of it, besides cousinly bonding?\u00a0 I like to think so.\u00a0 Jacob was sometimes looking at the art, occasionally engaged, sometimes sprawling on the benches claiming he wanted to sleep. \n \nJake stood in front of this somewhat gruesome, rather morbid painting titled \"Massacre of the innocents\" and asked \"Does he have an owie, Mom?\"\u00a0 Sometimes autism provides the best punch lines. \n \n \n Jake thinks this (dead) kid has \"an owie\" \n Ethan, on the other hand was mostly practicing his kung-fu moves at the sculptures.  \n \n Also?\u00a0 Giggling away and pointing at all the \"privates\" exposed.\u00a0 Having the time of his life yelling \"Mom, come look at the weird penis on this one!\" \n \nI *might* have hissed at him to get a little class.  \n \nHe did have some insight, though.\u00a0 When confronted with a wall full of Picassos I told him they were from his \"Blue Period\" and said, \"You can see why they called it that, right?\", thinking he'd go for the obvious color suffused throughout them all.\u00a0 But he surprised me.\u00a0 \"I think it's also because he was sad.\"\u00a0 So there is hope for him.\u00a0 Also?\u00a0 He recognized Benjamin Franklin from his portrait. \n \nFinally, a nice Italian restaurant dinner was eaten, and then dessert procured at a very New York deli of many sugary delights.  \n \n \n Think Ethan has had enough chocolate yet, huh, huh, huh? \n Cousins were kissed, and sent on their way back to Penn Station. \n \nAnd when it was all over?\u00a0 Three \"vacation\" days were blessedly down, with only one to go. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPSKNXdxEhI/AAAAAAAAAR8/xyuWC9HV9Ok/s1600/DSC00202.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPIsH1YJ2jI/AAAAAAAAARk/J96i_U9peXk/s1600/DSC00187.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPQQYIzImII/AAAAAAAAAR0/uS2hhvCBgMs/s1600/Met+2005+300a.jpg", "http://www.metmuseum.org/", "http://www.moma.org/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPIZLbXinXI/AAAAAAAAARY/gooh1wRCIMk/s1600/DSC00204.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPIlvsHGKbI/AAAAAAAAARg/iXjhPd4MD0E/s1600/DSC00194.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPIlECjnfkI/AAAAAAAAARc/BQzao_y5buw/s1600/DSC00207.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TPSHLdhgnJI/AAAAAAAAAR4/jufCn_xRcWI/s1600/DSC00211.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/doing-met-thing.html", "title": "\nDoing the Met Thing\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 25, 2010", "body": "\n    I know it's going to be hard to give thanks and be grateful this year at Thanksgiving. There has been so much loss this year, so much stripping away of the good in our lives. \n \nAnd yet, I want to push myself to do this.\u00a0 There is a strong streak of \"glass-half-empty\" in our family's psychological make up.\u00a0 Especially prevalent in Ethan and my husband.\u00a0 I can go that way myself, but also have a big kernel of optimism in my heart.\u00a0 And I work to consciously feed it, nurture its growth. \n \nOne day I will blossom forth, a full blown optimist, contemplating the half-full glass before me.\u00a0 For now, it's work.\u00a0 Work that I willingly, willfully do because I want to set an example for our children whose eyes are ever upon us, observing, learning how to be.\u00a0 From us.\u00a0 Gulp. \n \nI'm always nattering on to Ethan about how it's not how  much  you have in life that determines happiness, but how  grateful  you are for what you have, no matter how large or small that amount is.\u00a0 I do believe this, really I do.\u00a0 Even if it's more in my nature to kvetch than count my blessings.\u00a0 And I so try to remind myself of this, constantly, and especially at this time. \n \nToday, looking toward Thanksgiving I need to find what has held, has grown and thrived, not what has withered up, been washed away.\u00a0 This year my husband and I have each lost a parent; my Father in March, his Mother in October.\u00a0 The Thanksgiving table will be bereft of a whole generation this year, for while my Mother remains, she has begged off celebrating with us. \n \nShe is feeling too sad, too worn out to make herself rise to the occasion.\u00a0 And the drive is long, and we are with my husband's family, not her own. \u00a0 And so, though I briefly considered kidnapping her and forcing her to come along, I have decided to let her be.\u00a0 My Mother is not eating alone, she will be with her friends in the assisted living community where she lives.\u00a0 I have been told they make a nice festive meal there. \n \nThe table will feel simultaneously lighter and heavier.\u00a0 Absent of old folks, full of sadness.\u00a0 Not full of yet the next generation, my month-old twin grand-nephews.\u00a0 Even though their grandmother is hosting the dinner, it felt too daunting to our niece to travel with such young twins.\u00a0 I understand, remember well those first, heady, exhausting months.  \n \nThe year Ethan and Jake were born they were older, four months already at their first Thanksgiving, and we only had to pop them in a cab and head crosstown to the Upper East Side.\u00a0 And still, I have no memory of it, am guessing I barely ate, so busy would I have been tending to their every, many needs. \n \nThinking about glasses, half-empty and half-full, I am reminded of a crystallizing moment when the boys were still quite young, maybe 2, eating dinner side by side in their giant high chairs.  \n \nWe used to bring simple toys to their tray tables to help us keep them entertained as they dined.\u00a0 I had placed a stack of five cups on Ethan's tray, then lifted one off the top and put it in front of Jake.\u00a0 Even though Ethan had four cups and Jacob only one, even though Ethan had four lovely colorful plastic cups to play with, he could not get over that Jacob had been given one.\u00a0 He would not play with the four cups on his tray, he would only stare at and reach for the one on Jacob's tray.\u00a0 And let me know in no uncertain terms that he. wanted. it. back. \n \nJacob, on the other hand was blithely unaware of the drama, didn't care that he had a paltry one to his brother's four cups, was deliriously happy playing with his cup while eating his supper. \n \nI looked at my boys and sighed, took a zen snapshot of the moment and realized this was it, I was staring at the distilled essence of their ingrained personalities: \n \nEthan, always focused on the one thing he didn't have instead of enjoying the multitude of what he did.\u00a0 Jacob, delighted with whatever the world happened to grace him with at the moment. \n \nIt immediately called to mind a tarot card, the 5 of cups. \n The man is so focused on the 3 cups that have been spilled, lost, that he neither notices nor acknowledges the 2 still full cups standing behind him. The admonition of this card is to not be like this man, the lesson is to turn away from the spilled cups and to pick up the full.\u00a0 This is the card of the pessimist, the eternally glass-half-empty attitude. \n \nI did not want this moment to define Ethan, but could not deny how clearly he was embodying this archetype that day.\u00a0 This would not be Jacob. He would be playing with those 2 cups like nobody's business.\u00a0 This is something that I wish Jacob could teach Ethan.\u00a0 Although you would not for all the world get Ethan to acknowledge he has anything to possibly learn from his autistic brother. \n \nSo this year, for my children's sake, I will try hard to not dwell on the sadness, the loss.\u00a0 We all know that this is the first Thanksgiving without Jim, without Blanche.\u00a0 I will raise a cup of red wine to my father. We will all be holding them in our hearts while we talk, eat, sit together, remember the past and look to the future. \n \nBesides the new babies we have another beginning in our lives.\u00a0 Barbara's son, our nephew Michael married the lovely Rachel this past May.\u00a0 They will be there this afternoon, at his mother's house, a young couple on the start of their journey together.\u00a0 They are the half-full cups at our table, as are our sons. \n \nToday I will look to what connects us.\u00a0 I will hold our sons, Ethan and Jacob, in my arms and my heart.\u00a0 They are my glasses more than half-full, they are full-on, full up and brimming over. \n \nI will ignore the fighting, the whingeing, the every annoyance, and hold to the laughter, the silly, joyful exuberance of their beings.\u00a0 I will not yell or scold.\u00a0 I will play, laugh, celebrate a house full of family, full of life. \n \nAnd hopefully, if the occasion permits, I will take a commemorative sofa nap, in honor of my father, who could be found after every Thanksgiving meal, gracing the couch with his gently snoring presence. \n \nAnd then I will get up and once more enter the fray, the messy swirl that is family, that is life. \n \n \n Update: My mother changed her mind at the eleventh hour and joined us.\u00a0 It was lovely and meaningful to have her with us and I was so glad she agreed to come, other than the hour and fifteen minutes it added to our travel time to pick her up (but well worth it). \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TO6NXn6wr9I/AAAAAAAAARQ/GCG5QvPhdAE/s1600/cups05.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/regarding-table-half-full.html", "title": "\nRegarding a Table Half Full\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, November 18, 2010", "body": "\n    (You might want to read my added comment about the inappropriately upbeat tone of this post's title BEFORE you read this post.\u00a0 Just saying.) \n OK, I'm here at  the Special Needs Blog Hop.\u00a0 And the prompt for this week is... \nShare a Thanksgiving Memory \n \nAnd yes it's late into the evening, almost Friday, and still, I have not been able to tackle this one.\u00a0 I am rarely at a loss for words, but in this case?\u00a0 It's hard for me to think about Thanksgiving. \n \nNot because of my children, they are generally reasonably well behaved on Thanksgiving (well, as long as there is a television in the house).\u00a0  \n \nIt's my Dad. \n \nThis will be the first Thanksgiving without him, our first without my Dad  and  my Mother-in-law. \n \nEthan is mad about this.\u00a0 \"Why did Grandma and Grandpa have to die in the same year?\u00a0 I lost TWO grandparents in ONE year, it's just not fair!\u00a0 I used to have THREE grandparents and now all I have left is one Grandmother.\" \n \nAnd Jacob?\u00a0 I don't know how he has processed these deaths.\u00a0 I'm guessing not that much, because he will still ask to \"Go see Grandma and Grandpa?\"\u00a0 And he still calls it \"Grandma and Grandpa's\" house.\u00a0 Death being such an abstract concept.\u00a0 (And abstract being so hard for his autistic, language-processing challenged brain.)  \n \nAbstract in one way, thudingly concrete in others. \n \nLast year my father was at our apartment for Thanksgiving, this year he is gone forever. \n \nAnd also last year?\u00a0 Thanksgiving?\u00a0 Was the last time he was ever in our apartment, at all. \n \nTo tell the truth, even then he was barely there. \n \nEver to be counted on for a post-dinner couch nap, this time Dad slept on the sofa the  whole  time.\u00a0 We could not get him to come to the table.\u00a0 He barely ate, a man who usually loved him some turkey.\u00a0 He only roused himself for a healthy big slice of Pumkin Pie.  \n \n\"He's diabetic\" my mother fretted,\u00a0 \"Should he have pie?\" \n \nI did not know how to kindly say what I saw and knew, that he was so clearly frail and failing, with such little time left, what did it matter?\u00a0 It gave him pleasure.\u00a0 It was what he hungered for.\u00a0 Let him have pie. \n \nTwo months earlier I would have jumped in all motherly and whittled down his slice to a sliver, stood over him and pecked at him until he ate some turkey with trimmings.\u00a0 Something green, too.\u00a0 But there was still a man to feed in September.\u00a0 By November, a completely different story. \n \nAnd indeed, less than two weeks later we stepped into the serious end game. \n \nSo right now my Thanksgiving memories?\u00a0 All the happy ones of recent years past with this, my chosen family and way back when, with my family of origin, the aunts, and uncle, cousins tumbling together in joy? \n \nShadowed by the terrible losses of this terrible year. \n \nI have done very little thinking and planning for Thanksgiving this year.\u00a0 And it's good that there is very little I have to do.\u00a0 Bringing wine and my mother to my husband's family's house in Westchester (and, as always, GF/CF goodies for Jacob) is about the limit of what I can manage. \n \nWe will eat and drink and talk and laugh, but it will be hard to find true merriment in my heart.\u00a0 I will celebrate what remains, I will let the warmth and light of family wash over me.\u00a0 But I know I will spend some moments staring out through the big windows into the vast dark, saying goodbye once again to my father, to Blanche. \n \nOur family has grown both  smaller  and  larger  this year, the wheel of life has churned on, spinning wildly.\u00a0 It will spin on ever still, and I am still feeling dizzy.  \n \nI will stand still for a moment at Thanksgiving this year, remembering the last: my father in our entrance hall holding my warm hands in his cool, papery, trembling ones.\u00a0 He thanked me for dinner, told me how much he loved me (as ever he did), remarked on how nicely Jacob was coming along.\u00a0 I may have reminded him that I would be taking him to the doctor the following week, that appointment that set the final tumble in motion. \n \nWe had borrowed a wheelchair from their assisted living facility to get my father over to our place, so I towered over him a bit.\u00a0\u00a0 I kissed the top of his head as I took my parents down the elevator to catch their ride.\u00a0\u00a0 Dad's last exit from my home. \n \nSo while many of us find Thanksgiving to be a day tinged with a drop of melancholy, a tiny hint of mourning for the \"perfect\" family we had wished for mixed in with celebrating the wonderful, special family we have, I will be doing some actual mourning.\u00a0 Ticking off another \"first\" in my year of sad firsts. \n \nAnd I will raise a glass of red wine (the nice  Saint-Joseph  I'll be bringing) to my Dad.\u00a0 And maybe (if the kids let me) take a little couch nap in his memory. \n \nWishing everyone an enjoyable (and not too frazzling) Thanksgiving. \n \nAnd?\u00a0 If you're in the mood?\u00a0 Hop in and tell  your  story... \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismlearningfelt.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-memory.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Joseph_AOC"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/lets-go-to-hop.html", "title": "\nLet's Go to the Hop!\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 21, 2010", "body": "\n Friday morning, in spite of feeling like like something scraped off the bottom of a shoe, I pulled my (wheezing, coughing, snot-nosed) self together and went to a meeting at a local public elementary school. \n \nThere was a talk being given there about after-school and weekend sports programs for special needs children. And specifically, on the flier that Jake's fairy godmother had obviously guided into my hands, there was mention of a basketball program. \n \nBASKETBALL!!!! \n \nJake loves basketball, loves to watch the big kids play and loves to shoot baskets himself.\u00a0 And also?\u00a0 He's not half bad. \n \nI had been searching for a local SN basketball connection for a long time now, but nothing ever came up on any search engine, nothing but head scratching from any mom I asked. \n \nI was a bit late to the meeting (head cold induced ass dragging and all), missed the basketball guy's presentation, but managed to snag the LAST cup of coffee from the Dunkin Donuts box (score!) and there was even a little milk left for it.\u00a0\u00a0 So I caffeinated myself and sat and listened all about martial arts and SN kids and how balance is hard for many SN kids, but improving it is important for the brain. \n \nAll interesting stuff, but where was that basketball guy?\u00a0 Thankfully, still there, sticking around to answer questions at the end. \n \nAnd afterward a small group of moms swarmed the basketball coach, surrounding him, our eyes all anxious and hopeful.\u00a0 And he was such a nice guy.\u00a0 He stayed and stayed; talked to us for a long time, explaining the program in depth, answering specific questions, allaying fears. \n \nYes, they will take a non-verbal autistic kid: not a problem, they pair them with an older teenage volunteer \"buddy\" for a one-on-one connection.\u00a0 One word came to my mind: support. \n \nThe coach told us something wonderful.\u00a0 He said after lessons and practice and drills, they play a short game every Saturday, and somehow or other, for this youngest age group?\u00a0 It's always a tie game. \n \nHe laughed and demonstrated how he stands in front of the scoreboard during the game and then quickly manipulates the numbers at the end to come out that way.\u00a0 \"Look 40 - 40... another tie!\" \n \nHe said he does it because so many of these kids are sensitive and might fall apart at being on the losing team. And also there are some kids who only want to play when they win, and this keeps them coming back.\u00a0 Maybe next week, they'll win... \n \nI was contrasting this with a horrific story I had read at  a diary of a mom  this week about a child participating in a basketball program that the mom had supposedly carefully vetted beforehand.\u00a0 A place the mom had THOUGHT was supportive of SN kids.\u00a0 But they ended up engaging in a practice that boggled my mind.\u00a0 I can't even describe it here, it will make my blood boil. \n \nGo read that post  here , then come back.\u00a0 If you really don't want to, let's just say that meanness and humiliation were involved.\u00a0 A complete lack of thoughtfulness and sensitivity on the part of the coach. A set-up for bad feelings, even if the boy had been typical. \n \nI thought about the difference between this coach and that \"coach\" all day.\u00a0 I was so damn happy I had stumbled upon this meeting, finally found this program, so right for my son.\u00a0 I had to contain myself to stop from jumping up and down in glee as I walked out of the auditorium into the wan autumn sunshine.  \n \nStill, I broke out into a huge grin, and am sure I looked slightly deranged as I picked up some of my favorite Winesap apples at the weekly Friday farmer's market that sets up in front of the school.\u00a0 The market workers were all swaying from foot to foot, blowing on the fingertips peeking out of their functional fingerless gloves.\u00a0 The hot cider was selling at a brisk pace.  \n \nLate fall is most assuredly upon us. And finally, this year, that will mean basketball season for Jacob. \n \nI dare not tell him about it yet, because he will want to go RIGHT NOW and play.\u00a0 Waiting, patience, understanding what \"in 2 weeks\" means?\u00a0 Not his strong suit. \n \nBut come December 4th we will be there in that gym.\u00a0 I will have bells on and my son will be the happiest clam on the block. \n \nJacob will be learning to be part of a team, playing his beloved basketball.\u00a0 For once, not the guy sitting on the sidelines, watching his twin brother Ethan participate as a member of the group. \n \nThe belonging will belong to Jake, for once.\u00a0 And hopefully?\u00a0\u00a0 For all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/adam/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/adam/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/score.html", "title": "\nScore!\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 16, 2010", "body": "\n    Yesterday I was a bit of a hot mess.\u00a0 I wanted to write a new blog post, because, as you may have noticed, I have written nearly every day this month. Way more than I ever have. \n \nMaybe I'm feeling inspired by all my friends doing the  NaNoWriMo  or the  NaBloPoMo  challenges (apologies to my civilian readers, that's real insider bloggity-bloggish stuff).\u00a0 Or maybe I just have bucketloads of stuff to say and am giving up unimportant things this month, like sleep. \n \nBut yesterday?\u00a0 I was just all unfocused and fuzzy, like my slippers, which I almost walked out the door in that morning. \n \nAnd writing?\u00a0 Takes focus.\u00a0 Even if it's a dreamy focus like when I'm deep in the grief and go into a fugue-ish state and the words just flood out of me like water from a cracked jug. \n \nBut tweeting?\u00a0 Reading (and commenting on) OTHER people's blogs?\u00a0 Perfect for ADD-rific me some days.\u00a0 Like yesterday, when all my writing mojo spilled out across the internet, splashed onto other people's blogs.\u00a0 I was a commenting dervish. \n \nAnd then there's Twitter.\u00a0 If you tweet, you understand the appeal of the fairy dust.\u00a0 And if you don't?\u00a0 You (probably) think I'm a twit.\u00a0 Well, you're both right.\u00a0 Probably. \n \nSo (focus, please, here!), yesterday, when I sat down to write, I just didn't have it in me.\u00a0 I thought: \"Damn, I have no words left today, I dropped them all off at other people's houses.\" \n \nBut you know?\u00a0 Maybe I can visit them tonight, and take a picture and show you  (because I am a technical genius and know how to make my Mac do screen shots) and impress you with how smart/funny/cute/ranty and... commenty I was yesterday. \n \nAnd at the sheer wonderfulness of this approach?\u00a0 Besides not having to write anything really coherent tonight?\u00a0 I get to introduce you to some more terrific blogs and bloggers.  \n \nAnd also?\u00a0 I'm kind of new-ish to this blogging thing, haven't even had my \"bloggaversary\" yet. So I don't really know what the rules of this world are, and if I'm breaking any of them by doing this bit here. \n \nBut also?\u00a0 I don't really care.\u00a0 I'm following one of the operational rules of my old career in TV/film production: it is often easier to ask forgiveness than permission.\u00a0  \n \nSo here is me yesterday, flying in from elsewhere, inspired by the wonderful funny, smart or heartbreaking words of others to add a few of my own.\u00a0 Or in my case, more than a few.\u00a0 Because, as you may have noticed, I tend to be \"long-form\" (that's not baggage, that's just the size of my suitcase)...  \n \nFirst off, lets mosey on over and take a look at my early morning Twitterstream: \n   \n   And then, after joking about it, I nearly did just that by accident.\u00a0 Clairvoyance? \n Um, I was a bit tired yesterday morning.\u00a0 But also?\u00a0 Somehow giggly instead of grumpy.\u00a0 Thank goodness, because I really hate having a three dwarf morning. \n Yeah, I'm going to win a Pulitzer with my tweets. \n \nWell, no.\u00a0 But it does help to blow off steam and let me be kind and nice mom instead of bearish snappy mom.\u00a0 And THAT is most definitely a good thing. \n \nSo after dropping off the offspring and spending a few hours in Jacob-life-management mode (wherein\u00a0 I inventoried and re-ordered all my son's 10,000 medicines, vitamins and nutritional supplements from 5,000 different sources, and  then poured out a week's worth of his 6 different types of a daily  packets of them -- don't you just wish you had my life, now?) I allowed myself a little time to surf the interwebs, visiting old friends, discovering new wonders and dropping bits of myself off, my commenty calling cards, along the way. \n \nYes, I know, if that sentence were any longer it would need its own zip code.\u00a0 I am working hard to earn my title \"Queen of the Run-on-Sentence (with parenthetical clauses)\".\u00a0 How am I doing?  \n \nSo, back to the matter at hand.\u00a0\u00a0 Picture me tiptoeing through the tulips in the garden of web... looking kind of like this: \n That is an illustration from the amazing Allie Brosh's blog  Hyperbole and a Half .\u00a0 If you ever really NEED to laugh?\u00a0 Like, if your life depended on it? \u00a0 Go there.  \n \nOK, so on Kris's blog  Pretty All True  my response to her funny/painful/honest post  \" Call Me \"  was this:  \n One of the (many) amazing things about Kris is that she always replies to each and every comment, often inciting layers of dialogue.\u00a0 She is the most interactive blogger I know. And sometimes the comments are ALMOST more wonderful than her wonderful posts.\u00a0 And best of all?\u00a0 She likes me, she really likes me.\u00a0 Cyber-me that is. Which is just fine. \n \nThen I went to visit Jess's blog,  a diary of a mom , and read her moving post \" The Donut Shop .\"\u00a0 Jess is an Autism Mom blogger, and this post was about how hard it is to go out to eat with her family.\u00a0 But really, it was about so much more, about all the dreams you have for your family and what happens when you add Autism into the blender and hit pulverize.\u00a0 Her post brought up all kinds of feelings for me, and I left this mini-rant of a comment: \n \n \n And yes, I need to work on my proof-reading. That should have been \" struck \" not \"truck.\" \n And finally?\u00a0 Yesterday was Stimey's monthly day over on the  Hopeful Parents  site (where I post every  10th of the month ).\u00a0 Stimey (real name Jean) is my web-friend and yet another Autism Mom Blogger.\u00a0 She was a  DC Metro  area member of the defunct (and just now  resurrected ) Silicon Valley Moms Group blog,\u00a0 a sister site to the  NYC Moms Blog  site I wrote for last spring.\u00a0 We actually met (yes, in the real world, with our meat puppet bodies) at the  BlogHer10 conference  in NYC this past summer, and in fact kept bumping into each other every 5 minutes to the point where it became a running joke: \"Oh, you again!

{"date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "body": "\n \n \n Some spoils from a hunting/gathering expedition to Trader Joe's \n We have recently acquired a Trader Joe's in our Upper West Side neighborhood, and it still the object of much amusement and wonder to me and my Mom friends.\u00a0 It's located closer to my kid's school than to my home, so while I talk about it a fair amount, I only actually show up to shop there sporadically. \n \nYesterday morning I was having coffee after drop-off at Ethan's school with a bunch of mom friends. We've all been rather busy, so it's been awhile since we've gotten a good coffee-klatch going.\u00a0 There was the usual hysteria.\u00a0 In the midst of a conversation one mom said, \"they should call him Ari\" to which another mom at the far end of the table, mishearing, piped up, \"What about calamari?\"\u00a0 This caused the first mom to turn bright red as she made the heroic decision to nearly die choking rather than spray coffee all over the mom sitting across from her, aborting her spit-take moment. \n \nWith our kids in third grade, most of us have been hanging out together for four years now, and I have to say I have the best collection of friends I have ever had in my life, hands down.\u00a0 I knew having kids was going to turn my life around in so many ways, but I had no idea it would bring me this incredible circle of women friends. I am wondrously grateful for them, constantly. \n \nThis morning after our allotted hour of caffeination and mirth, as we were preparing to scatter to our various errands and jobs, one mom made the announcement that she was off to Trader Joe's for some food shopping, and did anyone want to come along? \n \nI had 10,000 things on my plate, but hadn't been to see Joe in a while, so I thought \"What the hell?\" and joined in.\u00a0 Also?\u00a0 It seemed a very virtuous way to avoid all my necessary \"to do\" items that needed to be done. \"Can't you see I'm shopping for my family, not just procrastinating & hanging out with my friends, prolonging the fun before knuckling down to being a responsible adult.\u00a0 How DARE you suggest otherwise?\" \n \nBut of course that was exactly what I was doing.\u00a0 Sure we needed food in the house, but I wasn't planning on shopping this morning yet, hadn't taken inventory of the cupboard, hadn't surveyed the fridge, and menu planning?\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 No such beast in our house right now.\u00a0\u00a0 So really, I had no list and no clear idea of what was needed at home food-wise. \n \nMight I mention?\u00a0 Not the wisest of plans.\u00a0 It was however, boatloads of fun.\u00a0 There were four of us altogether who set off on the expedition to feed our families, and a merry band we were.\u00a0 Maybe we shouldn't have had the free coffee samples at Trader Joe's as we were already caffeinated to the hilt.\u00a0 In any event, when you're at a store called \"Trader Joe's\" and the staff all wear Hawaiian shirts and have leis around their necks, shouldn't it be an adventure? \n \nWell, I learned something new. With no plan and no shopping list, food not really on my mind, but WITH a bunch of fun giggly good friends in good spirits?\u00a0 Was  way  too much like being in college and going food shopping with housemates, thoroughly stoned.\u00a0 As I distantly recall (it's probably been 30 years).\u00a0 (Yes, I'm  that  old, and yes it's been that long since I've done  THAT , if you must know.) \n \nSo I'm being all: Oh, over there, that looks yummy... into the cart the  chazzerai  goes.\u00a0 Also?\u00a0 I was highly suggestible: whatever my friends bought that looked good, I bought, too.\u00a0 Whether I or my family members will actually eat those items?\u00a0 Remains to be seen.\u00a0 All in the spirit of \"let's try new things.\" \n \nWe were giddy.\u00a0 We were having fun food shopping.\u00a0 Awesomeness abounded. \n \nNow, the Trader Joe's on the UWS is a strange subterranean sort, real estate in NYC being at a premium and all, existing on two below-ground levels.\u00a0 So there are these strange cart & people dual escalator things (I'm sure you've seen them) to travel between the levels.\u00a0 Fun! \n \nWe had just finished shopping the upper level and descended to the bottom when a friend lost her cart.\u00a0 She had put it on the conveyor, but when she arrived at the bottom?\u00a0 Not to be seen.\u00a0 It just... disappeared.\u00a0 There was a cart, but it was not hers; was someone else pushing her cart?\u00a0 Quel mystery... \n \nWhile scratching our heads, I noticed another woman walking by with an employee in tow, looking for  her  missing cart.\u00a0 On a hunch I pointed to the one that had come down the escalator just after my friend.\u00a0 Yes, that was it!\u00a0 But, she did not, reciprocally, have my friend's cart.\u00a0 Stolen?\u00a0 Unthinkable. After much searching, it was finally located -- still upstairs. \n \nAs best we figured it out: distracted by the levity and conversation, my friend had grabbed the wrong cart (this other woman's) and sent that down the cart escalator, leaving hers waiting forlorn, abandoned at the top.\u00a0 Mystery solved, cart firmly in hand, onward we rolled. \n \nWe had each been to Trader Joe's numerous times but never together, so the advice was free flowing, always useful, often entertaining.\u00a0 A big improvement over asking opinions and advice from strangers or employees.\u00a0 Who knows what they eat? \n \n\"Ever tried their\u00a0 hummus?\" \n\"Yes, delicious!\" \nInto the cart it goes. \n \nThe cinnamon almonds? \n\"Do NOT buy, more addictive than crack!\" \n \n \n \"irresistible snack\" indeed \n Should have listened, polished off the bag in under 24 hours.\u00a0 (I was considering suing them but it has that warning right there on the bag, damn, guess there's no one to blame for my gluttony but myself.) \n \nAnd no, it wasn't all useless junk in my cart, look at the picture up top, there's fruits & veggies: strawberries, heirloom tomatoes, oranges... oh, wait, those are  chocolate  oranges, my bad. \n \nAlso?\u00a0 Trader Joe's is all with the program of having a lot of well labeled gluten-free, dairy-free items which I am always on the lookout for. \u00a0 My son Jacob is on the GF/CF diet for autism, and has been for 5 years.\u00a0 New yummy stuff is important to keep him from getting bored, keep expanding his food options.\u00a0 Scored a lot of that stuff, too (mommy non-fail). \n \nEventually our carts filled and we had to hurry home to keep the frozen stuff frozen, so we finally settled into the checkout lines.\u00a0 While there, we, of course, fell prey to the shiny objects lined up alongside the line, designed to catch our eyes and leap into our carts (hence the chocolate oranges). \n \nThe lines moved fast and the conversation was still sparking, and the mom next to the chocolate oranges was kept busy tossing them to the rest of us, so in no time we were all checking out. \n \nOnce again, I remembered why I love coming there, as I had an awesome cashier who was upbeat and chatty without being annoying and over the top.\u00a0 Her lovely British accent may have been a part of the magic, that and the fact that she actually packed my groceries with a system and managed to put the heavy crushy things on the bottom the delicate ones on top  and  all my freezer foods in one bag together - genius! \n \nThank you, Lola, you are the best checkout-person ever. \n \nThe guy running the elevator looked at the four of us in terror as we piled in with our carts for the ride back up to the surface, but we all fit, and were comparing this experience with the evil elevator of the other, competing neighborhood market, Fairway. \n \n\"I have a friend who says she has to have a Xanax before she walks into Fairway.\" \n \n\"Everyone needs Xanax to survive Fairway\" \n \n\"Hey, that's a great idea, they should have a free Xanax station at the door there, alongside the shopping carts.\" \n \nWe all decided Trader Joe's was infinitely more fun. \n \nAnd when I got home? A million things to snack on, but nothing really to make for dinner.\u00a0 Oh, well.\u00a0 The local pizza place is on speed dial for a reason, folks. \n \n \nP.S. You know?\u00a0 Trader Joe's must have major blogging mojo going on, because  Kris  just wrote a hysterical post on her blog  Pretty All True  about shopping there with her family recently:  Hence the sarcasm. \u00a0 Go, read, laugh. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TN17ySWI2_I/AAAAAAAAAQc/G70MLPLfqDk/s1600/73547_1705852407373_1269915654_31913359_5227509_n.jpg", "http://quarterlifecuriosity.blogspot.com/2010/03/yiddish-tuesday-chazzerai.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TN8p7WKbSUI/AAAAAAAAAQg/dg_85KtwzOE/s1600/148176_1708211466348_1269915654_31918071_4724615_n.jpg", "http://twitter.com/PrettyAllTrue", "http://www.prettyalltrue.com/", "http://www.prettyalltrue.com/2010/11/hence-the-sarcasm/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/having-my-trader-joes-moment.html", "title": "\nHaving My Trader Joe's Moment\n"},

At the time psychiatry and diagnosis were not what they are now.\u00a0 He was labeled with \"severe depression due to hardening of the arteries\", drugged up to the eyeballs, and died a ragged lonely man when I was seven. \n \nFor Marilyn, it's been a struggle most all of her life.\u00a0 She held a job until 1968 or so, but that was only due to the kindness and generosity of her employer who treated her like family, put up with much mishegoss, and then, finally, couldn't any longer. \n \nShe was never homeless.\u00a0 A rent controlled apartment was very helpful in that regard.\u00a0 Although during a psychotic break, when she went missing for a week, she was found, finally, living in the bathroom at Penn Station with her life's savings in cash incredibly still stuffed into the pockets of her overcoat.\u00a0 The radio that had been implanted in her head had told her to leave home, go there. \n \nThe fact that she has made it to this ripe old age is somewhat of a miracle.\u00a0 A miracle combined with the fact that when she is being less crazy (she is never, truly sane, just more and less crazy) her core personality can actually shine through.\u00a0 And Marilyn, the less crazy person?\u00a0 Is all kinds of smart and funny, charming and wonderful, irresistible and charismatic.\u00a0 Also, in her younger days?\u00a0 Quite beautiful. \n \n \n That's Marilyn on the left, with my Mother, Aunt Eva, Grandmother, Father, Uncle Walter.  \n So when she is being her somewhat saner self, Marilyn gets people to care about her, to help her, to take care of her... until she cracks wide open again and acerbically and emphatically pushes everyone away.\u00a0 Paranoia manifested big and bold is no fun at all for anyone, deeply destructive of the self and shredding of all relationships; corrosive acid sprayed in all directions. \n \nWhich is why I haven't seen her in a dozen or so years.\u00a0 My helping hand has been bitten too many times, I stopped stretching it out.\u00a0 Same with my mother (although she has seen her more recently).\u00a0 She would visit Marilyn, whether in her apartment (while she still had an apartment), or in the hospital (during one of her many psychiatric hospitalizations) bearing gifts aplenty.\u00a0 A few visits would go well, and then the tide would turn, there would be accusations and bitter words, because nothing was ever enough for Marilyn, whatever you generously gave, you were accused of withholding all the rest. \n \nThere would be attacks, usually verbal, occasionally physical, and my mother would storm off, muttering \"The hell with her!\" under her breath, tears streaming down her eyes; wounded by and hurting for her beautiful baby sister who had come to this, become this wretched miserable creature.\u00a0 And then some time would pass, sometimes months, sometimes years.\u00a0 And it would start up again. \n \nBut age is not kind to the mentally ill, and in the past dozen or so years there have been very few periods of lucidity, and our last encounter ended quite horribly.\u00a0 There was violence, we withdrew.\u00a0 And Marilyn finally lost her apartment, entered into a series of nursing homes, and we lost track of her for a while. \n \nBut she is still family, so when my Uncle Walter, her big brother, called me Sunday night to tell me Marilyn was in the hospital and not doing well, and could I please tell my mother (his big sister) about this, and could we go see her and meet with her doctors?\u00a0 Of course I said yes. \n \nCoincidentally, I had been thinking about Marilyn a lot lately.\u00a0 Jacob's new school is in her old neighborhood.\u00a0 On the days when I pick him up, we sit and eat our snack in the square where she hung out, was a regular; one of those people settled in all comfortable on their own personal benches, one of those \"crazies\" that you avoid because their laugh is a little too close to a cackle, and maybe they don't smell so nice.\u00a0 I've been thinking I should try to find her again, wondering if she were still alive, thinking my mom would be wanting to see her sister about now.\u00a0 And then, Sunday, the call. \n \nSo today, after going to my mother's apartment and yet again \"fixing\" her \"broken\" TV (\"Mom, you changed the input again -- just don't touch THAT button, OK?\") bringing my mother to the audiologist to pick up her hearing aid (yay!) and having them program it (\"Why is everything so loud now?\") we headed over to the hospital to visit Marilyn. \n \nI was acutely queasy as we walked down the long, long corridor to her room at the end of the ward, my dread growing with each slow step forward.\u00a0 I knew she would be in terrible shape, aged well beyond her years by the hard life she had led. \n \nI'd learned she had been hospitalized for a week, transferred from her current nursing home to the ICU with a raging, life threatening UTI gone septic.\u00a0 Infection vanquished, she had remained nearly catatonic, refusing to speak, refusing to eat.\u00a0 Feeding tubes had been put in and were quickly pulled out, rejected.\u00a0 She wanted to be left alone.\u00a0 She wanted to die. \n \nWe tiptoed into the room, she was indeed looking ragged.\u00a0 My mother started to pass the first bed, head toward the next when I stopped her, recognizing a familiar shape of nose.\u00a0 Asleep when we arrived, I touched her arm to awaken her.\u00a0 She stared, startled, but recognized us.\u00a0 Behind her large eyes, now sunken, the piercing intelligence that has always been there peered out, missing nothing.\u00a0 \"Is it cold out?\" she asked, noticing our down coats piled on the chair.\u00a0 Her voice was a horse whisper, speech slurred by a complete lack of teeth. \n \nWe told her we had lost her, but that now found we were here to stay in her life.\u00a0 We took turns holding her hand, stroking her arm.\u00a0 I showed her pictures of my boys.\u00a0 My mother shared with her the death of my father, her brother-in-law.\u00a0  \n \nShe was clearly glad to see us.\u00a0 But when lunch came she  still refused to eat, set in her determination to be done with it all.\u00a0 Or maybe the senior dementia has overtaken her everyday crazy and she has forgotten how to eat.\u00a0 Or maybe she thought they were trying to poison her.\u00a0 In any event, the outcome will be the same, soon. \n \nIt was, by necessity, a short visit (I had to return home to retrieve a child) but we reassured her we would be back within a few days.\u00a0 Her eyes followed us out of the room.\u00a0 Her doctor arrived just as we were leaving, hurried words exchanged, my promise to return the next day extracted. \n \nSometime soon I will tell more tales of my Aunt Marilyn, of the years of  my childhood when she was a regular part of my life, when the \"crazy\"  referenced more of the zany and wacky, the youthful and fun aspects of her personality, and less of  the truly meshuggina.\u00a0  \n \n \n Marilyn, my Dad, my Grandma, cousins Annette & Jessie (with cello) & Me \n Believe it or not, in our family \"Crazy Aunt Marilyn\" is a term of  affection, of acceptance.\u00a0 It's just who she is.\u00a0 And we have always loved her,  even in absence, even though when around she often drove us... crazy. \n \nTomorrow I will meet with her \"team\" at the hospital and we will decide how to move her into palliative, hospice care; how to prepare for her ending.\u00a0 Tomorrow we will plan for the final days of a life that unraveled a long time ago, a life that has been hanging in lonely, stringy tatters for oh, so long. \n \nTomorrow I will again hold the hand of my childlike, wizened Aunt, as she turns her piercing gaze upon me.\u00a0 Tomorrow I will look back through the tunnel of time to see before me the beautiful girl with the big dark eyes who wanted to be a dancer, my mother's baby sister, my \"Crazy Aunt\", Marilyn. \n\u00a0 \nUpdate: My Aunt actually rallied, did not die, began to accept some nutrients, she will still eat no solid food, but will drink juice and milkshakes.\u00a0 She has since moved back to a nursing home, although she cycles in and out of the hospital every few weeks with some minor crisis. My mother and I visit her regularly, and although she never speaks more than a few words to us, is still deep in her dementia, she knows we are there and it means so much to her.\u00a0  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TNnfLziwcqI/AAAAAAAAAPw/br1HzIFI_U4/s1600/IMAG1137.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TNqCqWozy3I/AAAAAAAAAP4/g2BjoDkT0Ic/s1600/1959%253F+Dinner300crop.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TNopWMEwqgI/AAAAAAAAAP0/D8HvfW_sgUQ/s1600/Spring+1970+A.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/here-we-go-again.html", "title": "\nHere We Go Again\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 6, 2010", "body": "\n    \n \n Ethan, himself \n The other night, Ethan was all wonderful and full of surprises. \n \nEarly in the evening we were looking for a book for him to read as he had finished \u201c The Strange Case of the Origami Yoda \u201d and was ready to move on. \n \nWe have about a thousand books in our apartment, but he tends to reject a lot of books out of hand, as either \"boring\" or \"too scary to read at night.\"\u00a0 So it is often tough to come up with something he is willing to read, if it\u2019s not a  Pokemon Adventure  book, that is. \n \nI spotted a book I had bought some time ago thinking it might be helpful to him, but he had shunned it for years. It\u2019s a story written by a (then) 8 year old girl about her autistic brother, called \u201c All About My Brother .\u201d \n \nI handed it to him with a casual \u201cHow about this one?\" fully expecting scathing rejection. It had pictures and was written by a GIRL (cooties!) but he said \"cool\" and took it.\u00a0 And readers, he read it!  \n \nAnd afterward he said \"Mom, maybe we should write a book together about Jake.\" \n \nYou could have blown me over with a feather.\u00a0 Lately his statements about Jacob usually begin with \"Do you know why Jacob is the most annoying brother in the world, and why I hate him?\" \n \nI recovered quickly \u201cSure, Ethan I would really like that.\" And felt more than a little glowy for a while. \n \nA little later that same evening, we had this conversation, out of the blue:  \n \nE: \"Mom? Maybe I\u2019ll get married in my 20\u2019s\" \n \nMe: (not sure where this is coming from or leading to) \"Umm, OK.\" \n \nE: \"My late 20\u2019s.\"  \n \nMe: \"Um, OK.\"  \n \nE: \"Then I can have kids in my early 30\u2019s and you\u2019ll still be young enough to help take care of them.\" \n \nMe: (oh, a plan) \"\u2026OK.\" \n \nE: \"Like when I\u2019m 30 you\u2019ll be (brow furrowed in mathly concentration)\u2026 72.\u00a0 That\u2019s not too old, right?\" \n \nMe: \"No, not at all.\" \n \nE: \"You\u2019ll still be alive then right?\u00a0 Promise?\"  \n(Oh how I wish I could make that promise, but I\u2019m a realist)  \n \nMe: \"I would certainly hope so honey, I plan on it.\u00a0 I want to be.\u00a0 I really would love to be a Grandma to your kids.\u00a0 But you know I can\u2019t promise these kinds of things, right?\" \n \nE: \"Yeah...\u00a0 (pause)\u00a0 Can I have a cookie?\" \n \nWith all the Grandparents dying lately death must be on his mind.\u00a0 I forget how with boys just because they're not talking about it doesn't mean it's not sitting there under the surface, hot lava bubbling away.  \n \nLater still, he started up a conversation again. \n \nE: \u201cMom, what\u2019s your favorite flower?\u201d \n(Ethan is all about the icebreaker question that comes out of nowhere.)  \n \nMe: \"Well, I love all flowers so much, so I don\u2019t have just one. But I do love  hydrangeas , especially the blue-violet ones, you know that, I\u2019m always pointing them out to you. And peonies, because they smell so lovely.\u00a0 Also lilacs, definitely lilacs.\" \n \nE: \"How about carnations?\" \n \nMe: \"They can be pretty, but they're not my favorite.\" \n \nE: \"I like carnations.\" \n \nMe: \"That's fine, we don't have to like the same things.\u00a0 But Ethan, later on, when you're grown up and you like a girl?\u00a0 Don't buy her carnations, they're cheap, you'll never impress her that way.\" \n(I'm all full of useful, womanly advice) \n \nE: \"How about Daisies? Oh, wait, Daisy is a girl\u2019s name.\"  \n \nMe: \"That's true. There are lots of flower names that are girl\u2019s names. Daisy... Lily... Rose... Iris... Heather... Violet...\" \n \nE: \"Hey that\u2019s a color!\"  \n \nMe: \"But also a flower.\" \n \nE: \"Did they name the color for the flower or the flower for the color?\" \n \nMe: \"Good question. I would guess the flower was probably named for the color, but it could be the other way around.\" \n \nE: \"What about emerald?\" \n \nMe: \"You mean the green color?\u00a0 That's a color named for a gemstone, not a flower.\" \n \nE: \"But is it a name?\" \n \nMe: \"No.\u00a0 Well, yes.\u00a0 It's not really used in English for a name, but in Spanish emerald is Esmeralda and that IS a girl's name\"\u00a0 (I should really shut up now, but I don't, I'm on a roll.)\u00a0 \"There are also lots of girls named for gemstones and jewels: Pearl... Ruby... Opal... Amber...\" \n \nE: \"Oh! I know amber, there\u2019s an amber Pokemon, it's the amber fossil Pokemon!\"  \n(I love his frames of reference\u2026 it always all boils down to Japanimation) \n \nMe: \"OK, I didn't know that.\" \n(I think I'm ready to end this conversation now. Bedtime rapidly approaches...) \n \nE: \"So what should I name my kids?\" (Um, is there something I need to know here?) \"How about Daisy and Amber for the girls?\" \n \nMe: \"Why not?\" \n \nE: \"Can I name my daughter Venus-Fly-Trap?\" \n \nMe: \"Um I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a great idea, honey.\" \n \nE: \"Why not, it\u2019s a flower?\" \n \nMe: \"Well, it\u2019s not a flower, really, more like a carnivorous plant.\u00a0 Just plain Venus would be better, that\u2019s a Goddess.\" (Because goodness knows we don't want to give his hypothetical children weird names.) \n \nE: \"But it\u2019s a planet.\" \n \nMe: \"That\u2019s right, and the planet is named for the Goddess, the Roman name for the Goddess of love and beauty, whose Greek name is Aphrodite.\" (Because TMI is my MO.) \n \nE: \"What about Jupiter? Boy or Girl?\"  \n \nMe: \"Jupiter is a boy, he's the king of the gods.\" \n \nE: \"I thought that was Zeus!\"  \n \nMe: \"The name Jupiter is Roman, that\u2019s the same God as Zeus to the Greeks.\u00a0 The Greeks created the pantheon of the Gods and the Romans borrowed them and changed their names.\" (Someone stop me, please, it's getting late.)  \n \nE: \"How about Mars?\" \n \nMe: \"Boy\" \n \nE: \"Neptune?\" \n \nMe: \"Boy again, God of the ocean.\" \n \nE: \"I thought that was Poseidon.\" \n \nMe: \"Roman / Greek thing again, honey.\" \n \nE: \"Mercury?\u00a0 Hey, I know a Mercury!\" \n \nMe: \"Look, except for Venus, they're all boys, OK?\"  \n \nE: \"That's not fair!\" \n \nMe: \"I know, probably some ancient boys did the naming, what can I say?\" \n \nE: \"Well, what about Earth - girl or boy? Can you name a kid Earth?\" \n \nMe: \"Well, I don\u2019t really know where name came from,\" (What, me admitting to not knowing something?) \"but we always call the planet she, and there's this concept of Mother Earth, so I would say girl. But it's not a name.\" \n \n(Oops, I had forgotten all about  Eartha Kitt . Sorry, Eartha!) \n \nE: \"OK, for girls: Venus and Emerald, for the boys: Mohawk and John.\u00a0 And maybe Uncle.\" \n \nMe: \"Um, honey, how many kids are you planning to have?\" (Not that I don\u2019t want to be a Grandma & all\u2026) \n \nE: \"Is Rocky a boy or girl name? Can it be a girl\u2019s name as well as a boys\u2019s name? Because that would be awesome. I want to name my girl Rocky.\" \n \nMe: \"Sure\" (I'm starting the \"just say yes\" phase of the evening)  \n \nE: \"So how\u2019s this: Speed, Lightning\u2026 and Jewel\"  \n(He's not even waiting for my answers now, he's on fire, he's on a roll...) \n \nE: \"Oh, I know, the boys: Houdini and Marvin\"\u00a0  \n(Where does he GET this stuff?)  \n \nE: \"Wait, what about middle names?\u00a0 Flame Daisy for the girl, and Lightning Hank for the boy.\u00a0 That way they each have one cool name and one normal name and they can decide what they want to be called.\"  \n \nMe: \"Good thinking honey, you\u2019re really planning ahead. But, um, don\u2019t you think you need to grow up and go off to college and meet a woman and date her and get married before you start planning on naming your kids?\u00a0 And then she is going to want some input into this process, too, you know.\"  \n \nE: \"Uh, Huh.\u00a0 How about Jupiter and Pegasus?\" \n \nThen it started getting really silly: \n \nE: \"Count Dracula?\"\u00a0 (Giggling.) \n \nE: \"Hand-cuffs & Underpants!\"\u00a0 (Much Giggling.) \n \nBut in the end, he was all sensible about some things. \n \nE: \u201cI know what NOT to name my kid: Evil.\u00a0 That would be a bad idea.\u201d  \n \n(Yes, dear, you are all wise like that.) \n \nMe: \"You're right, very bad idea. And now, BEDTIME!\u00a0 For reals.\" \n \nAnd finally you should know that while the earlier conversations took place in the living room, this last one took place in the bathroom, Ethan on the toilet, me perched on the tub next to the sink at the far end, thumbing through a Mimi-Boden catalog (and then frantically writing notes all over the catalog white spaces so I could quote him verbatim as everything he said got funnier and funnier). \n \nBecause sometimes it\u2019s spooky in our low-lit bathroom at night and he needs a bit of company.  \n \nBecause while I like to read on toilet, he prefers to talk. \n \nMy son is a conversationalist.\u00a0  \n \nA bathroom conversationalist.\u00a0  \n \nI pity his future wife.\u00a0  \n \nAnd his future children, my grandchildren: Houdini, Uncle and Venus-Fly-Trap.  \n \n \n (Very long) P.S. on why this post is not like the others and giving credit where credit is due:  \nI am trying something new with this post.\u00a0 I am trying to be flat-out funny.\u00a0 For a long time I have wanted to \u201clighten up\u201d things around here at The Squashed Bologna.\u00a0 But it\u2019s been kind of hard to do that, what with all the dying going on.\u00a0 And then there\u2019s Jake\u2019s autism popping up around every corner.\u00a0 But since my mother has promised to try to stick around until the boys bar mitzvahs, and with things going well at school for Jake right now, I thought it might be safe to attempt a humor piece.\u00a0 Well, me being me, I had to stick in some autism and a little death stuff.\u00a0 But still, for me?\u00a0 We\u2019re in fluffernutter range here. \n \nAnd what made me think I could do this, what gave me the courage to step out of my comfort zone? My inspiration totally comes from two of my favorite bloggers, my blogging heroes:\u00a0  Kris  of \u201c Pretty All True \u201d and  Adrienne  of \u201c No Points for Style .\u201d  \n \nThese women are writers.\u00a0 Their blogs have a genuine voice.\u00a0 And they both are not afraid of deep emotion and fierce thought.\u00a0 They to go where their hearts, minds and souls take them.\u00a0 And they are hysterically funny and totally irreverent when they chose to be, which is often.\u00a0 One post will rip your heart to shreds and the next will have you peeing in your pants in hysterics.\u00a0 And their willingness to go from one to the other, and of their readers to journey with them from tears to laughter made me think of the possibility: \u201cWhy not me, too?\u201d \n \nKris & Adrienne are often at their funniest when they are \u201creporting\u201d conversations with their husbands and kids, which is why when Ethan stared down this road the other night I immediately flashed on the idea of turning our conversation into a blog post. \n \nSo thank you, ladies, for being my bloggy mentors.\u00a0 Unless this post totally fails and falls flat on its face.\u00a0 Then of course, I don\u2019t know you and you don't know me.\u00a0 Wink, wink. \n \n \nP.P.S. Disclosure: I have linked to the books mentioned in this post, and I am an Amazon Associate. So if you follow my book links to Amazon and buy them I get a few cents.

Your second favorite? Your third favorite?\" And of course: \"Who do you love more, Jake or me?\" \n \nSo I have a policy: I just don't answer those questions. \n \nBecause in true ADD fashion, I view things more as points scattered across a field as opposed to in tidy lists.\u00a0 Yes, even my brain is messy.\u00a0 Although ADD leap-frog thinking does lead to insight and invention, it also makes it really hard for me to answer conventional questions simply. \n \nFilling out those essay style applications for special needs schools for Jacob?\u00a0 Pure torture.\u00a0 I would go on and on and never get to the point, then have to seriously trim and edit for days. Because they were asking me open ended questions like: \"What are your child's greatest strengths and challenges?\" And my view of Jacob is so complex and ever changing it is impossible to distill down to the basic and quantifiable. \n \nAnd then to be trying to be truthful about him while still making him sound like the perfect package, exactly what they want in a student (because the competition for these schools is fierce, you know)?

{"date": "Tuesday, November 2, 2010", "body": "\n    \n \n Halloween 2010 \n I love this post title, but I have a confession to make: I don't have much at all in the way of an exciting, dramatic story to back it up.\u00a0 Because the conclusion of that sentence is the very boring \"...by laying low.\" \n \nAnd I feel really disappointed in Halloween this year, mostly in myself.\u00a0 We didn't go out into the world this year, not even for 10 minutes.\u00a0 We stayed home. \n \nNow, when I say \"stayed home\" I mean we went to the fabulous party our big kid-filled apartment building throws in the lobby every year.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n Halloween Party, 2010 \n And the kids trick-or-treated inside the building in full regalia, and a friend with her twins joined us.\u00a0 Ethan went to the upstairs neighbors apartment in the afternoon to help them decorate their back door landing (where the trick-or-treaters come for candy). \n \nAnd we did step outside. \n \nWe stood right in front of our building for two minutes so I could take pictures.\u00a0 But Ethan was, shall we say, less than thrilled as he was anxious to get back inside; champing at the bit to get the trick-or-treating candy acquisition process started. \n \n \n Ethan as Electabuzz (Pokemon) and Jake as Ironman \n Jake on the other hand?\u00a0 Really getting into character.\u00a0 Maybe a little bit TOO into character. \n \n \n Talk to the Iron Hand \n But really, THIS year?\u00a0 This was kind of lame.\u00a0 Because this year Halloween fell on a Sunday.\u00a0 That meant the city in general, and our kid-filled, kid-oriented, kid-friendly Upper West Side neighborhood in particular was Halloween-crazy and it would have been a blast to go out with the kids up to Broadway where all the stores were giving out candy and the sidewalks looked like a chaotically organized Halloween parade. \n \nIf you want to get a sense of how fabulous Halloween on the Upper West Side in NYC can be?\u00a0 Read my friend Sandra's post about it  here .\u00a0 She and her family did it up righteous proper this year, her first in New York City. \n \nIn past years we have always joined in the Halloween party at Riverside Park's Hippo Playground.\u00a0 It begins with a procession down the hill from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument into the park, lead by bagpipes. Then inside the playground there is more bagpiping and free donuts and cider. \n \n \n Ethan the White Rhino Power Ranger and bagpiper, Halloween 2008 \n \n \n Jacob the Red Power Ranger comparing notes with fellow super heroes, Halloween, 2008 \n But that lovely mini-parade and party?\u00a0 Is for little kids.\u00a0 We squeezed in one final hurrah last year.\u00a0 But this year, the kids are too big and that event is now deemed \"for babies. \"\u00a0 Sigh.\u00a0 Growing up they are.\u00a0 (Yes, I'm channeling my inner Yoda in the syntax department. Wanna make something of it?) \n \nWe had planned to go out and about in the city as a family; trick-or-treat on Broadway, visit some or those fabulous, famous, blocked-off Halloween Block Party blocks, maybe meet up with some friends.\u00a0 But my husband wasn't feeling well, and is not a crowd person on his best days.\u00a0 And I just couldn't face managing an over-excited\u00a0 Jacob and the Ethan/Jacob dynamic in a crazy crowded scene alone.\u00a0 Other times I might have been game, but this year, right now?\u00a0 I am just managing to stay afloat on ordinary days, so no, I took a pass on that one. \n \nAlso?\u00a0 Ethan's home made costume was MUCH more time consuming to make than I had counted on, and I was still finishing and finishing, and finishing, and finishing until rather late in the day (and I never did get to the last finishing touch, sewing the little round antenna things on). But he was very pleased with the results, so I think it was well worth the effort.  \n \n \n \n Electabuzz Pokemon \n \n \n Electabuzz Ethan \n At least our building does host a lovely party. \n \n \n Jake loved this tree \n It helps that it is full of family-size apartments and actual families with lots and lots of kids of all ages.\u00a0 I remember when our kids were the youngest, newest members of the gang, and now they're firmly in the middle of the pack. \n \nThen: \n \n \n My little carrot and pea-pod, First Halloween, 2002  \n And now: \n \n \n Candy-mouthed Electabuzz Ethan in conversation with a butterfly, Halloween 2010 \n \n\u00a0There is food: pizza and yummy sweets, ghoulish goodies aplenty \n \n \n gives new meaning to the term \"finger food\" \n And did I mention what they do with the elevators?\u00a0 I forgot to photograph the elevators this year (doh!) but here's what they looked like in years past: \n \n \n Vampire elevator operator, Halloween 2008 \n \n \n \n E & J hanging out in the haunted elevator with friends, Halloween 2006 \n Now imagine without the flash, with only a spooky black light on in the elevator...\u00a0 Like I said, our building?\u00a0 Halloweenly  Awesome.\u00a0  \n \nSo I kept thinking: \"We'll do the big hullabaloo next year.\"\u00a0 But then, only after it was all over, I realized that next year Halloween will fall on a Monday,\u00a0 a regular work day.\u00a0 And while there will be merriment, it won't be an all day affair, it won't be that magic Halloween weekend thing.\u00a0 Not for another five years.\u00a0 And in 2015?\u00a0 The boys will be 13.\u00a0 They will have been (god willing) Bar Mitzvahed already.\u00a0 Too old to be swept up in the kiddie magic of Halloween. \n \nNow, Jacob, due to the naivete and innocence that is one of the gifts of autism, will probably still be into the costume and candy excitement.\u00a0 He really loves his Halloween:  \n \n \n Jake dancing with one of  our building's resident Halloween Ghosts \n \nBut Ethan?\u00a0  \n \n \n Ethan showing off his massive 'tude \n Likely to be too cool to play the fool.\u00a0 But you never know.\u00a0 It could happen. \n \nSince a good time was had by all, I'm probably being too hard on myself.\u00a0 I should just chillax.\u00a0 A Twix Bar stolen from Ethan's candy bucket should do the trick... now where did I hide that thing?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://nycitsalwaysanadventure.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/our-first-fright-night-in-the-city/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TM_2BKf3htI/AAAAAAAAAMY/XebpKrXiB0s/s1600/DSC04787.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TNAngJPVx5I/AAAAAAAAAM8/MYX9u-KOr4w/s1600/1st+Halloween300crop.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TNAoR4mR-gI/AAAAAAAAANA/zEUxDJpuO2E/s1600/DSC08042.JPG"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/11/how-i-survived-halloween.html", "title": "\nHow I Survived Halloween...\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 3, 2010", "body": "\n    \n \n Halloween 2010 - My tough guys \n I know I promised more scan-madness, and hate to disappoint, but could not for the life of me find those Halloween pictures from my childhood that I KNOW exist somewhere.\u00a0 Damn, I know you were dying to see me as a 6 year-old fairy with saran wrap over bent coat-hanger wings. (Did I mention that my childhood costumes were always lovingly handmade by my parents?) Next year for sure. \n \nSo for now the \"then\" is going to have to be a more recent then... my kids' Halloweens through time: \n \nFor their first Halloween, the boys were three months old and I was a wee bit tired.  \n \n \n Jake the Carrot & Ethan the Pea-pod, Halloween 2002 \n Poor Ethan is horrified that he was once a GREEN VEGETABLE for Halloween.\u00a0 Very scary. \n \nWhen they were one, we did our first (and only) whole family matching costume thing. May I present THE WIGGLES: \n \n \n A very Wiggly family, Halloween, 2003 \n Boy, was that cheap and easy, and once I peeled the stickers off the shirts, we could all just keep wearing them as regular shirts. SCORE. \n \nThen at two we discovered Teletubbies. And really cheap Teletubby costumes on deep sale on October 30th. They were size 4-7, but I figured, we'll have them for years. \n \n \n Ethan as Po and Jake as Dipsy, Halloween 2004 \n Ethan is now mortified that he was Po, a GIRL Teletubby.\u00a0 But at the time red was his favorite color.\u00a0 In fact from age 2 to 3, it was the ONLY color he would wear.\u00a0 But that's another long story for another time. \n \nWhen the boys were three, Jacob decided he didn't want a costume, was  unhappy with the idea, so we just put him in his orange and black  striped PJs, drew on his face a little bit and called him a tiger. Worked for him. \n \n \n Jake tolerating a hug from his brother, Halloween 2005 \n And Ethan went with a different Teletubby - Lala. Yes, I had bought all four Teletubbies the year before. They were on  sale. And we wore them as dress-up for years. And now our friends kids  wear them. \n \n \n Ethan as Lala, Halloween 2005 \n Shhh don't tell Ethan that Lala is a girl, too. \n \nAt four Ethan discovered superheros in general and Spider-Man in particular.\u00a0 Naturally.\u00a0 No more Teletubbies for him.\u00a0 Jacob was happy to stay in Teletubby-land.\u00a0 This time it was HIS turn to be Lala.  \n \n \n That's Ethan in there, Halloween 2006 \n \n \n Jake rocks Lala, Halloween 2006 \n At five: Ethan, much to my relief, was happy to be Spider-Man  again.  (YES!) and for Jacob... James the Red Engine.\u00a0 But you'll have to take my word for it, because I cannot find any photos from Halloween 2007.\u00a0 Major mom fail. I'm sure they will turn up someday. Besides, the kids will need something to talk about in therapy. \n \nAt six it was all Power Rangers all the time in our house, so naturally, may I present: \n \n \n Jacob the Red Tiger Jungle Fury Ranger & Ethan the White Rhino Jungle Fury Ranger, 2008 \n That was the easiest year by far, two store-bought costumes, easily obtained. Sigh. \n \nLast year, at seven, Jacob was easy again... his store-bought Batman costume made him deliriously happy. (I know he doesn't look it in this picture, but trust me, he was, it was just not my most stellar year for photos) \n \n \n Jacob as Batman, Halloween, 2009 \n Ethan, on the other hand, had entered the world of Pokemon-madness and could not be talked out of wanting to be Lucario, an obscure Pokemon that there was no ready-made costume available for on this earth. (Believe me, I looked.) So I made it myself: \n \n \n Ethan is the Pokemon Lucario, Halloween 2009 \n I didn't know if I could pull it off, but I gamely tried.\u00a0  \n \n \n The \"real\" Lucario \n \n \n Ethan Showing off his tail \n \n \n Ethan showing off his 'tude \n Not too shabby, if I may say so myself.  \n \nThis year, the price of my success in creating Lucario so well last year was not Ethan getting a second year's wear out of it as promised last October, but my being talked into making yet another Pokemon from scratch.\u00a0 So meet Electabuzz, an electric Pokemon from the Kanto region (if you care to know): \n \n \n Ethan as Electabuzz, Halloween 2010 \n The secret to these things is finding the right colored hoodie sweatshirt & sweatpants for the \"base\", by the way.\u00a0 And then, of course it helps to be a crazy person, and be willing to cut, sew and glue for hours on end.\u00a0 A black sharpie comes in handy, too. \n \n \n Ethan and his tail \n Jacob, once again was sublimely content with a cheap, shoddy, nylon, store-bought, already disintegrating costume, thank GOD. This year's superhero: Iron Man! \n \n \n That's my sweet Jake in there, somewhere \n And this year for the first time since 2003, I dressed up, too. A witch you see, to match my mood these days: \n \n \n Me and Jake, Halloween 2010 \n And at the end of the day, we were tired.  \n \n \n Big hugs for the big Daddy \n \n \n One very tired Iron Man \n That's all folks!\u00a0 Hope your Halloween was happy.\u00a0 Now, where's that last Almond Joy stashed? \n \n \n I\u2019m linking up to Wordless Wednesday at  Angry Julie Monday . \n I'm also linked to  Special Exposure Wednesday  at  5 Minutes for Special Needs . \n \n Linkety link link, whoohoooo. (Sorry, got a little carried away with myself there. It's OK, I've got it under control now. Really. You can go home, you don't have to worry about me. I'm going to step away from the computer now.

{"date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "body": "\n    I am trying hard to not have this post turn into a long, humorless, whiny rant. But it\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 I think I may have failed in that. Forgive me.  \n \nI had another post scheduled for today, called \u201cJust Say Yes\u201d full of light and fluff and about the lovely serendipity you welcome into your life when you say \u201cyes\u201d to things. But today is not the day for that post. I\u2019m sure it will surface soon.\u00a0 But not today, no.\u00a0 Today is all about the \u201cno.\u201d \n \nI was in a bad, bad mood this morning, in a growly, snarly bear of a funk.\u00a0 And for no single specific or discernible reason.\u00a0 It was just the grains of sand filling up my jar; itchy, irritating, miserable, motherloving sand.  \n \nI know I wrote recently about  the little things that lift me up .\u00a0 But today?\u00a0 This morning?\u00a0 The little things were squashing me down, dragging me under.\u00a0 I was in quicksand.\u00a0 Jacob waking up early in spite of it being a weekend; Ethan's homemade Halloween costume still only half made; a vital supplement of Jacob's delayed in delivery, the boys endless squabble over computer time... little, stupid, things; minor annoyances. But this morning? I was hell on wheels, sporting my own personal gloom and doom, like a cartoon character with a traveling rain-cloud overhead. \n \nThe biggest problem with me having a crabby, cranky, craptastic day is that my kids pay the price, and I hate that. I am not my kindest, gentlest mommy self. I\u2019m her evil twin.\u00a0 Even when they're the ones torturing me, I still feel bad for not seeking the higher ground, putting on my happy face and acting \u201cas if.\u201d As if I were not bone weary and at my last nerve ending. \n \nAnd we all know the real stressor was not all those little things, it is the way Autism clouds everything in life, and brings on the dread. My dreading that even still, after eight long years, everything with the kids, all day long, has to be planned, structured, negotiated, managed.  \n \nToday I dreaded having to figure out how to manage Jacob at the birthday party we were headed to this morning, how to manage leaving Jake home with his Daddy when I took Ethan out to his school's Halloween \"Harvest Festival\" this afternoon.\u00a0 I am dreading the thought of managing Jake while we are out trick-or-treating on Broadway tomorrow, worried about how to manage Jake at our building\u2019s wonderful Halloween party tomorrow night. (And, for an autistic kid, Jake is not even that hard to manage.)  \n \nI just didn't want the job anymore, today; the mom job in general and the autism-mom-warrior job in particular. I wanted to go on strike.\u00a0 But the problem, the irony, the joke on me is: I am not just the worker bee, I am also... the management. And therefore I would be on strike against myself, never a good thing.\u00a0 I would be having to step over myself on the picket line, and go in to do the job anyway, so why bother with the fuss in the first place. \n \nYesterday I had finally input Jacobs schedule into my calendar for the whole year and that's when my heart jumped. Holy hell in a hand basket -- Jake has a two week spring vacation. Two (2!) whole motherloving weeks in April.\u00a0 When I will slowly be losing my mind.\u00a0 This is on top of both\u00a0 week-long winter AND mid-winter vacations.  \n \nI was hyperventilating as I input half-day after half-day, no-school-Friday after no-school-Friday. The month of June? Noooooooo!\u00a0 Jake's school ends a whole week earlier than Ethan's. And?\u00a0 That last week?\u00a0 Motherloving half-days. All. Of. Them. \n \nAnd the hardest part? It was heartbreaking that I was dreading spending time with my son.\u00a0 I could feel bits of my heart splinter off and shatter because I wasn\u2019t feeling: \u201cWow, how exciting, family time, look at all the wonderful things we can do that we never have time for during the busy school weeks.\u201d \n \nInstead I\u2019m thinking: Holy fuckballs, how am I going to get Jacob through two unstructured weeks?\u00a0 How am I going to keep my kids happy and occupied when they can\u2019t be in the same room with each other without war breaking out and threats of annihilation flying? Where are we going to go every day? What are we going to do when I can't take them out ANYWHERE together without the yelling? Ethan at Jake, me at Ethan, Jake just in general, getting louder and louder and more and more annoying as he doesn\u2019t get what he wants from Ethan. Me wanting to just melt through the floor as I see myself becoming THAT mom.  \n \nYou know THAT mom: the one with the out of control kids, yelling at them and looking to be at the end of her rope. The one the other moms swallow their lips and shake their heads over.\u00a0 I am tired of being the mom on the bus the old ladies give the evil eye to, while they loudly remark about my children\u2019s loudness.  \n \nAnd none of this what I imagined when I told my husband on our first date, those many years ago: \u201cI really want to have kids, and soon.\u201d\u00a0 (And he didn't run screaming from the restaurant. Which is, I suppose, why we find ourselves here, today.) \n \nBig sigh.  \n \nOK, the ranty rant rant is done now.\u00a0 Temper tantrum over. \n \nTime to finish up sewing Ethan\u2019s  Electabuzz  costume -- an obscure Pokemon, don't ask! (And did I mention that Jacob ATE a piece of it while Ethan and I were out at the Harvest Festival and there were tears and high drama when we got back?\u00a0 And yet another trip out to Broadway for a replacement part purchase.) \n \nTime to pour out Jacob\u2019s vitamins supplements & medicines for the next three days: Pre-breakfast, Breakfast, Lunch, Mid-afternoon, and Dinnertime packets to be made.  \n \nTime to fire up the scanner; to look for old photos of Halloweens past for tomorrow\u2019s post, marveling again at the incredible cuteness of my boys, remembering the fun we had, remembering why it\u2019s all worth it, why I\u2019ll wake up tomorrow with hugs and cuddles and smiles, and start it all again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Electabuzz"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/10/on-having-had-craptastic-day.html", "title": "\nOn Having Had a Craptastic Day\n"},

We just don't have much energy for the usual fall razzmatazz.\u00a0 We haven't been apple picking, haven't taken a hike in the woods, not a leaf has been peeped.\u00a0 It's a small miracle I got the boys to our upstate friends annual  Halloween Party , although we arrived late and Jake's pumpkin never got carved. \n \nSeems I am half-assed right now about... just about everything.

{"date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "body": "\n    \nI was at Jacob's school yesterday, picking him up.\u00a0 His class was a bit late getting back, having taken advantage of the glorious October weather to sneak out for an end of the day visit to the park. That's one of the many things I love about  his new school , how they get the kids out and about as much as possible; fresh air and sunshine, folks! So, I had some time to kill in the school's lobby. \n \nHave I mentioned before that Jacob's school is a small, private, Special Ed one that is co-located in, and practices active inclusion with a \"regular\" school?\u00a0 In fact, it's in a Catholic School, so yes, my little Jewish boy is going to school in a big old church. \n \nI was hanging out, casually observing the comings and goings, noting one lovely boy who seemed to have a lot of energy; bounding up the stairs, he had tripped and fallen quite hard, but seemed unscathed.\u00a0 He looked so adorable in full \"miniature man\" uniform with neatly pressed oxford shirt and tie slightly askew. \n \nI then got to witness a scene which is now seared into my memory and haunting me, that I need to share here and use it to stand on my soapbox for a moment:\u00a0 I watched a mother eviscerate her son; just scald him with scorn, in an attempt to get him to measure up. \n \nThe boy looked to be about Jake's age, maybe 8 or 9, and was, in fact that same boy I had seen going up the stairs.\u00a0 The mother was yelling at her son because he had failed to write down the homework assignment. Again. She accused him of being lazy, of not caring, this sweet boy with such an earnest and eager face.\u00a0 She told him that there would be no snacks until \"things improved.\" \n \nThis was very clearly a repetitive pattern, that this boy always fails to write down the homework assignment, and his mother was exacerbated.\u00a0 She saw a willfully disobedient child, a bad boy; she saw a failure. He clearly felt himself to be a failure, too; tears sprung up as he repeated his excuses as to why this time he had once again not gotten the job done.\u00a0 \n \nYou could see in his eyes the pain, the panic, that he just didn't know why he kept failing.\u00a0 I wanted to go hug him, but couldn't, I'm a stranger.\u00a0  \n \nHis mother saw laziness, badness.\u00a0 What I saw was this: a boy who had ADD and/or executive functioning disorder written all over him.\u00a0 I realized I had felt a spark of recognition earlier, watching him stumble up the stairs, that radar we have to detect our own kind. \n \nAnd it broke my heart to see him so broken and his mother's heart so hardened against her disappointing son, who had no idea why what was so easy for others was so hard for him. \n \n\"Did the other kids get the assignment written down?\" she asked accusingly, making it clear that if they did & he didn't the failing was his. \n \nAnd I couldn't say anything, not a peep, this woman was a stranger, a parent at the school in whose good graces we need to remain. And I?\u00a0 I was one of the moms of the \"weird kids\" and she certainly would never want to think her son was like one of those.\u00a0 So I kept my mouth shut, and wept inside my head, and felt my heart crackle. \n \nI couldn't say it to her, but I'm saying it here to all of you, my readers. Many of you have children with special needs yourselves, so you know this shit already, but for those who don't, I say this: \n \nIf your child repeatedly fails at something, especially if it is something that their peers seem to find easy, do not immediately go to finding fault with and blaming your child, thinking they are lazy and stupid, bad and wrong. \n \nYour child is clearly STRUGGLING, your child needs HELP, not a kick in the teeth. \n \nWe are not all the same.\u00a0 We have different brains.\u00a0 Just because something is easy for YOU or for your other three kids, doesn't mean it will be for them all.\u00a0  \n \nIf your child were blind would you yell at him for not being able to see the blackboard? No? Well, what if your child has a brain that CAN NOT organize itself?\u00a0 Trying harder is not going to cut it,\u00a0 and his feelings of failure will just make his gears spin faster, in place. \n \nHe needs understanding, and actual help.\u00a0 Executive function tutors, specific accommodations, maybe even thoughtful medication. \n \n\"We can not keep doing your work for you. It is your job to write down and understand the homework assignment.\" She said, the anger and disgust palpable in her voice.\u00a0 \"You're on your own here, you're on your own.\"\u00a0 Wow. \n \nThose words just felt so chilling, and I could only imagine how abandoned that boy must have felt in that moment.\u00a0\u00a0 And I'm sure she thought she was being a good parent, helping her son to shape up.\u00a0 She is involved, she cares that he succeeds in school, she wants him to \"do it right\", to be a success.\u00a0 And she has no idea that she is undermining him completely, eroding his sense of self worth and setting him down a path for repleted failure and pain.  \n \nI think: If her son was drowning, flailing about in a pool, would she stand there and yell at him that he was \"on his own\" there?\u00a0 Assume that it was his fault he hadn't learned to swim better, that the coordination of remaining afloat was just beyond his grasp?\u00a0 Would she call him stupid and lazy and tell him to just swim harder, look at all the other kids not drowning? \n \nOr would she toss him a life preserver, or maybe even jump in herself and try to save him?\u00a0 And then help him figure out why swimming is so specifically hard for him, get him the special instruction he needs to be a more functional swimmer.\u00a0 Or, if that's impossible, the equipment he needs to not drown. \n \nSo I ask again: Why are we parents so quick to find fault with our children; to see willful disobedience, laziness, moral deficit, when a child is struggling and clueless? Why punish when a child needs help? \n \nSchool is a big, scary pool.\u00a0 Don't let your kids drown. \n \nOK, off my soapbox now. \n \nI hugged Jacob extra tight when he finally came out, told him how proud I was of him, how hard he works every day to wrestle with what comes so easily for many others. \n \nAnd I vowed to catch myself when I, too, start to blame his brother, my ADD kid, for what he can't help: his race-car brain trying to navigate these pedestrian streets. \n \n \n Photo credit: Jim Steinhardt \"Boy looking out window\" 1948 Vintage Print available for sale at  Gendell Gallery \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TLbjLFD9GvI/AAAAAAAAAJg/FmwJBGvv3eQ/s1600/steinhardtvintageboywindowsnow.jpg", "http://artseal.ypguides.net/page/1f4p6/Children_of_the_20th_Century.html"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/10/breaking-my-heart.html", "title": "\nBreaking my Heart\n"},

I am just scooped out again, like I was this past spring when  my father passed away . \n \nSo instead of my usual, labored-over writing, I offer up here a few illustrative pictures from the past two weeks: \n \nFrom the awesomest Halloween Party (a thousand \"thank yous\" Meilan & Billy):  \n \n \n \u00a0Um, let's be clear on this: Ethan DREW the design in black marker. Mom (that would be me) was the one with the pumpkin gut hands. \n \n \n Boo! \n I think my favorite part of this day was deep into the evening, when it had gotten dark and the kids were running around outside, barely supervised. They had been together all afternoon and had formed a cohesive kid gang; were playing games whose rules they could not explain to us even if they tried. This is a freedom that city kids don't ever get: to be outside at night in the true dark without a bossy parent standing right over you. I love being able to give my kids the magic of the inky night, even if just a few times a year. \n \n \nFrom NYC Comic Con: \n \n \n Beyblade forever! \n \n \n Happily obsessed \n Ethan found this booth with the soon to be released Beyblade Metal Fusion video game for both Wii and DS. Lucky for us, we own both platforms (Oy!)\u00a0 He LOVED playing the game, had to be torn away from the booth kicking & screaming. Can you say \"top of the Hannukah list\"? \n \nIt was so sad to be there without my husband who is a comics professional and was actually a consultant for the Con. He had put together many of the wonderful panels, was supposed to be on or moderating many of them. A highlight of going to the Con has always been visiting Dad at his booth, walking around with him and being the proud son of. We felt his absence keenly this year.\u00a0 I wanted to bring the boys anyway, was glad I did, but wow, was it crowded. \n \n \nFinally, this is why I love coming to pick Jacob up from his new school a few days a week (the bus ride home is ridiculously long.)\u00a0 How much I will love doing it in freezing snowy January is questionable. But for now: \n \n \n \n \n I wish you all a happier Wednesday than I'm having. I have a stupid cold and am going to crawl back into bed now & pull the covers up over my head.

Oscar Mayer hammered that into me at a young age.\u00a0 For all you young things reading this who were not kids in the '60s & early '70s, and are head scratching at that reference, watch  THIS . Now imagine seeing THAT nearly every day for years. You'll never spell it wrong again. \n \nAnd while \"The Squashed Bologna: a slice of life in the sandwich generation\" is going to remain the name of my blog -- since I so clearly AM still quite stuck smack dab in the middle of the sandwich, and since \"squashed\" doesn't even begin to describe how I'm feeling most days, what with my Mother-in-Law's passing, and Jake's new school, and all my Mother's neediness -- I wanted something... catchier for my domain name. \n \nAnd since I'm  squashedmom  on Twitter, I figured why not go for it.\u00a0 So I'm rocking the mom.com rhyme thing, now. \n \nAnd it may help make clear that I'm a MOM blog, not a food blog (or an Italian travel blog, if you try to pronounce \"Bologna\" that way.) \n \nBut now that other part: My blog is fugly, I know that. \n \n \n Here is what my blog looked like as I was writing this post.\u00a0 Hopefully soon you will be viewing this post in the archives on my lovely, newly designed blog and need this visual reference for the fugly. \n I need to get a real design, not just me noodling around the Blogger design system in an  momsomniac  haze at 3 AM. \n \nI need a banner and a logo and a cute little button.\u00a0 And a kick ass background. You know: a DESIGN. \n \nProblem is I have no idea what I want to do with it. \n \nOr rather I have too many ideas, and none of them quite right.\u00a0 I'm not cutesy and girly, but I do love flowers.\u00a0 I'm not the stark and modern minimalist type either, although I love abstract imagery and design elements.\u00a0 I admire the simplicity of black words on white and bold black & white graphics but I am a lover of color, and generally, the more saturated the better (or hadn't you noticed the lurid purple of my current \"design\"?) \n \nAnd then I need to somehow have the design match up at least somewhat with the content and/or tone of my blog. But not at all literally.\u00a0 Because visuals for squashed?\u00a0 Bologna?\u00a0 The whole sandwich thing, as a metaphoric image?\u00a0 Yuk.\u00a0 Not a food blogger, remember? \n \nSo I'm a bit stumped. \n \nAnd I know I need to get a designer to do everything right, as I'm not really a techie (though I love to dabble in a little HTML tampering occasionally.)\u00a0 And once again, the problem here is that I don't have the $$$ to lay out for what is currently a hobby (although of course I have dreams of \"the more\".)\u00a0 Also I am finding I have a fierce and stubborn DIY streak emerging around this, have caught myself nursing delusions of teaching myself HTML in order to do it all on my own. Overnight.

Idiots. \n \nIt is one of the mythic stories of my childhood, that when they finally brought me to my mother, (after she hollered and yelled and refused to do anything unless they. brought. me. to. her. NOW!) my mom scooped me up and cooed at me: \"You may not be the most beautiful baby in the world, but you're mine, all mine!\" \n \nAnd, yes, I fattened up and a few weeks later was supposedly a knock-out (and Dad even used me as a model for his advertising photography portfolio.) \n \n \n Mother and child, 1960\u00a0 by Jim Steinhardt \n So just bear with me while I get through this awkward phase.\u00a0 The ugly duckling will turn swan.\u00a0 Eventually.\u00a0 Give me just a little more time.\u00a0 Thanks! \n \nP.S.

As the old saying goes: if you've met one kid with autism... you\u2019ve met one kid with autism.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Jacob right now is in an awkward phase of wanting to relate all the time but having no sense whatever for what are appropriate and inappropriate ways to connect. He has no innate inner  compass\u00a0 to guide him, and taking lessons from his often highly inappropriate twin brother Ethan is, shall we say, problematic.  \u00a0 \n \n A while back Ethan taught Jake to say \"poopy-head\" which is why when Ethan comes to me complaining that Jacob is sing-songing the phrase \"Ethan is a poopy-head, we like you very muuuch\" over and over, I tell him: \"You're not getting much sympathy from me on this one, kid. You taught him that lovely term, so it's you own damn fault.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n And no, I don't actually say \"damn\" to my kid. I just think it very loudly.\u00a0 \n \n And then I tell Jake to stop it, that it's not OK to tease, that that is NOT a nice word to use.\u00a0 So \"poopy-head\" goes underground for a while, but you never know when it's going to surface again. \n \n Last night Jake got to bed late, even  later than usual for  a non-school night. We listened to the radio during his bath because Jacob has a great love of music and seems to not mind his mother's off-key crooning along.\u00a0 There may have been some dancing mixed in with the drying off and the donning of the PJs, for, you see, great songs just kept on coming on every time I was about to turn it off.\u00a0 \n \n And I know it's hard to go from dancing right to bed, but when his eyes light up and he enjoins me with a \"Dance with me Mommy, pleeeeease?\" how can I resist? \n \n   How can I resist  engaging in joy with my son, for whom so much of his day is lessons, lessons, lessons, and directives. Jacob hears all day long: \"do this, do that, don't do that, stop, STOP!, for heaven's sake don't do THAT.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n So I said \"Yes\" and we danced away, bouncing, wriggling, stomping and wailing. \"Stop in the name of love, before you break my heart...\" \n \n And then of course, a glance at the clock and: BED, NOW! \u00a0 \n \n Jacob has, historically, always been my easier son to put to bed. He climbs up into his top bunk, blue-bear is located and securely crooked underarm, we sing our two requisite songs; I tell him about the day that has been in the form of a story (\"once upon a time there was a boy named Jacob...\") and then let him know what's coming up (\"And what's tomorrow, Mommy?\") a kiss and he's gone.\u00a0 \n \n \"Goodnight Mommy, tomorrow's another day.\" \u00a0 \n \n But lately his spunk has been rising, and the compliant, perhaps too compliant little boy is falling back a bit as Mr. Sass is starting to feel his oats.\u00a0 And I know this is all for the good, that typical eight-year-olds are not nearly as sweet and obedient as Jacob has been, that he is veering toward normal as his feisty gently rears up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n A large part of me is grateful, cheering him on even, while another part (the one that is already short on sleep) is groaning, bitching and moaning.\u00a0 I know that for Jacob to grow into his own, the ways in which he is pliant and \"easy\" will have to fall by the wayside for a while.\u00a0 I even wrote a  post  about how happy I was that he learned to \"cuss\" when frustrated. \n \n But the teenage years?\u00a0 I don't even want to think about that yet, though they loom, they loom. \n So now, at bedtime, instead of meekly marching into his room when Mom says \"Bed, Jake\", I'm getting the \"No\", the \"I hate bedtime\", the \"I don't want to go!\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n  And then last night, in spite of being in the giggliest of moods, post dance-marathon, he starts sweetly singing our first bedtime song as he climbs up into his bunk, seemingly without too much protest. \n \n  \"Twinkle,  twinkle...\"   \n \n \"Oh, good\" I think \"relatively easy, tonight\"  \n \n \"little...\" \n \n I'm already planning\u00a0 my rapid escape. \n \n ...poopy-head!\"\u00a0 Raucous laughter ensues. \n \n My son is da bomb.\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0   \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thesquashedbologna.blogspot.com/2010/04/s-word-is-stupid.html"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/09/twinkle-twinkle-little-poopyhead.html", "title": "\nTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Poopyhead\n"},

His glasses had gone dark and smoky in the brilliant afternoon light, so I couldn\u2019t tell if his gray eyes were reflecting back the blue of the sky or the green of the trees, they shift so. \n \n He was happy in a quiet sort of way.\u00a0 I looked at him and saw him, not just my little boy that has always been, but this boy now.\u00a0 Bigger, older, handsome in his somber uniform of white and navy blue.\u00a0 There was a teenager-like stillness in him, observing the world while munching his chips.\u00a0 It was one of those perfect September days New York City sometimes throws at you: the air crackling, warming in the sun, cool in the shade, and Jake so cool in his shades. \n \n \u00a0  \n I know it may sound strange and shallow, but I thank my lucky stars that he is handsome.\u00a0 Because humans?\u00a0 We are strange and shallow, we forgive more from the good looking.\u00a0 We spot them a few points, we give them the benefit of the doubt, assume they are better, smarter, toss them a free pass.\u00a0 Statistics prove this, it\u2019s a favorite social science study subject: how anything attached to an attractive photo is scored higher than the exact same content tied to the ugly.\u00a0 Human nature.\u00a0 Which will work to the advantage for my son\u2019s future, so it is forgiven.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a little weird, but so handsome, let\u2019s let him in the club.\u201d\u00a0 See? \n \n I\u2019ve been sporting a lot of fantasies of this future lately, seeing as he\u2019s on the cusp of so much change.\u00a0 Jake\u2019s finally at a school that is setting the bar nice and high, and he seems to be rising up to the challenges.\u00a0 The limit?\u00a0 Pure blue September sky. \n \n Inspired by a Scooby Do episode Jacob recently announced: \u201cI want to be a rock star, Mom, I want to go on stage, can I go play on stage?\u201d\u00a0 And I had an epiphany.\u00a0 What a perfect job for Jacob that would be: drummer in a rock and roll band.\u00a0 He would make a terrific rock star.\u00a0 Large, handsome and strong, he is very musical, loves to sing, has great rhythm. And?\u00a0 Drummers?\u00a0 No one expects them to talk much.\u00a0 And all that banging and stomping?\u00a0 He\u2019d be getting his sensory needs met while having a blast.\u00a0 His maniacal laugh, his big, big over-the-top personality?\u00a0 Rock and roll, baby!\u00a0 I\u2019m smelling a win-win here.  \n \n Next step: get him a drum set.\u00a0 And pray the neighbors are deaf, understanding or better yet, both. \n \n My son, the rock star. I could live with that. \n \n \n \n (For those of you living in NYC who are about to call me out at the \u201cbrilliant sunshine\u201d reference on this gray and stormy day {Brooklyn Tornado!}, I hereby confess that the actual \u201ctoday\u201d of this post was yesterday, Wednesday.

This will certainty be her last, and we tried not to drown in bittersweetness as we lit candles, blessed challah, and kissed her very gently. \n \n \nThe next day we were off to a post-services lunch in New Jersey, a small gathering that included 60 or so of Danny's relatives.\u00a0 Did I ever mention my husband comes from a LARGE close-knit family?\u00a0 Did I mention we affectionately refer to them as \"The Borg Collective\"?

{"date": "Monday, September 6, 2010", "body": "\n    \nThis photograph of my son Jacob on  summer vacation  is the first lovely, natural photo of him smiling that has been taken in some time. I treasure it, and it will surely grace my computer screen and wallet for some time to come.\u00a0\u00a0 \n For you see, Jacob is on the autism spectrum, and his interpretation of what to do when a camera is pointed at him, like so much about him, is aimed at, but quite clearly missing the mark for normal, like this:  \n \n \n He tries too hard. Waaaay too hard. So he ends up with a strange wide eyed or squinty grimace, yelling \"Cheeeese!\" at the top of his lungs, to boot.\u00a0 \n Jake used to have a warm, natural smile,  \n \n \u00a0then he started getting spacey in photos,\u00a0 \n \u00a0  and now this, \n \n \n the balls-to-the-walls all out attempt at normalcy that looks like lunacy in it's current manifestation.\u00a0 And I am glad I know (on most days, when I am having perspective) that's what this is, just the current station stop on the long haul from here to there.\u00a0 \n \nRight now Jake is so much better nearly every day in every way, and I feel awful, an ungrateful wretch for complaining about him.  I feel guilty, very  guilty at not feeling grateful every minute of every day for what a gift  Jacob is, and how far he has come. But on that path from here to there, where Jacob is right NOW makes him so much harder to be around than back in the bad old days, when he was spacey and happy to live in his own little world. \u00a0 \n Because right now, Jacob, unlike so many other of his autistic brethren wants to interact ALL THE TIME. But he is still so inept at it, is still deep into the steep uphill climb on his learning curve, that an hour with Jake is more work than an hour at the gym, with the volume turned up to eleven. Because to have a meaningful conversation with Jake, you still have to carry 90% of the load.\u00a0  \n Jacob\u2019s thoughts and intentions, his imagination and his humor are so much more sophisticated, so ahead of his language capabilities, there is constant correcting and interpreting to do. And then there is the answering over and over and over again of the thousand questions. \n \nRemember three year-olds? That's Jake right now.\u00a0 But he's a 75 pound, 4 foot 6 inch three year-old who will reach up to your face and try to make your mouth talk to him if you dare try ignoring him for a moment. And Ethan, Jacob's twin brother?\u00a0 Really  hates and resents  having a three year-old for a twin. \n There are parents with non-verbal kids who would give their right arms to have the problems we are having right now, I know that.\u00a0 Believe me, I know that and try to remind myself of it every day when he is truly driving me around the bend.\u00a0 \n \nBecause this year, due to the vagaries of the calendar and NYS in its infinite wisdom interpreting a 12 month program to equal a mere 6 weeks of summer school, Jacob has had a month, a full month of no school, no camp, no schedule, all-mom-all-the-time.\u00a0 For a month, August 13th to September 13th, he has been, is, will continue to be mine, all mine.\u00a0 And Jacob?\u00a0 Right now?\u00a0 WILL. NOT. SHUT. UP.\u00a0 Really.  \n And that old mainstay of lazy parenting, television?\u00a0 No go, there. Watching TV is not a quiet, passive activity for Jake, it is an invitation to engage in non-stop commentary and inquiry about what he sees on the screen:\u00a0 \n \"Is that a baby?\u2026 it's a baby!.. What's his name?... What's the baby doing, Mommy?... is he sleeping?... the baby is sleeping...\u00a0 SNOOOOORE (loud snorting snoring sounds here)... the baby is sleeping, mommy, he's sleeping... (laughing hysterically now)\u2026 WAKE UP, BABY!\" (shouted loud enough to wake the upstairs neighbors probably sleeping-no-longer baby.) \n I love my son, love him to pieces.\u00a0 He is full of joy and light and love. He is the happiest autistic person I know.\u00a0 He will skip down the sidewalk, because really, why walk when you can skip?\u00a0 He slips his hand into mine, gazes into my eyes and kisses me ten times in a row, just because he can. He melts my heart on an hourly basis.\u00a0 \n \nBut he also asks me every five minutes, all day long, every day, if we can ride the subway train to McDonalds and ToysRUs today.\u00a0 Because we did it once, at the start of break, and he so loves Times Square.  \n Like a toddler, he doesn't know how to take no for an answer.\u00a0 Actually, Jake doesn't even know how to take yes for an answer, so impatient is he in his anticipations that he will keep asking if he can do something I have agreed to, until he is in the middle of doing it. And then three minutes after it is over, he will ask to do it again. \n He will grow, he will learn, he will be able to hold a thought in his head without giving it (loud) voice.\u00a0 But right now this is where we are, neither here nor there, visiting station after station on our ride together.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n Next week Jacob will go back to school.\u00a0 Next week my home will be much quieter, cleaner, and I will be able to get things done. Next week I will miss him all day long.\u00a0 Because, you know, I do love cheese. \n \u00a0  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TIRJgN5rPhI/AAAAAAAAAGg/Ielly1Ak_0U/s1600/Jake+kayaking+1.jpg", "http://thesquashedbologna.blogspot.com/2010/08/always.html", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TIWenwwQBqI/AAAAAAAAAHU/WBXINoouquA/s1600/DSC07039.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TIRMU36RcWI/AAAAAAAAAG8/_1K-KTFcHkc/s1600/Jake+and+mommy.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TIRLfXM7bnI/AAAAAAAAAGs/e9YTLlFZDoI/s1600/Jake+MS+1.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TIWd3zR_6lI/AAAAAAAAAHI/dxrQk6tVVNU/s1600/DSC06733.jpg", "http://thesquashedbologna.blogspot.com/2010/07/mourning-in-morning.html", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TIWeHIaZXLI/AAAAAAAAAHM/cU9NnGhzB1Y/s1600/DSC06811.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/09/hold-cheese.html", "title": "\nHold the Cheese\n"},

The same (see picture above.) \n And now, of course I feel like such a parenting fail for not doing this sooner, and vow to try to replicate this throughout his life when I find myself doing things for him that a typical eight year old boy (is there such a thing?) should be doing for himself.\u00a0 \n \nI will of course fail miserably at this vow, but at least I can remind myself of it from time to time. \n OK, he still doesn't get the \"straps go under the booster arm\" concept, but that's the small stuff.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n And that, I'm not wasting sweat on. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/THnEG5B2t0I/AAAAAAAAAFI/kEj5JWTa9CU/s1600/46351_1590542844706_1269915654_31665618_6334104_n.jpg", "http://thesquashedbologna.blogspot.com/2010/08/cruel-to-be-kind.html"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/08/no-sweat.html", "title": "\nNo Sweat\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 27, 2010", "body": "\n    The past few days have found me alone in a big house in the Berkshires with my two eight year old boys. There is a lovely pool out back, a big TV with a thousand channels of cable in the den, and not much else in the way of entertainment.\u00a0 \n \n And I have a pair of twins who, due to the nature of Autism's intrusion in family dynamics, have tremendous trouble playing together in even the best of circumstances. The few families we know who are sometimes here are now not, and did I mention that after a thoroughly hot sunny summer here in the northeast its been rainy and/or unusually cool since we got here?\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n So yes, we have more time on our hands than is usual, and while in many ways the mildest word I would use for that is \"challenging\", in some other ways it's good. Useful even.\u00a0 Because there's a bunch of stuff that Jacob needs to learn to do on his own, that he has suckered me into doing for him for years, and to turn that stuff around we need time, something of precious little abundance in our regular life. \n \n In our  hurly burly life back home when there are schedules to keep, busses to  catch, and two kids to get out the door to two different destinations  every morning, I often choose expediency over fostering self reliance.\u00a0 \n \n I know it's wrong, but if making Jake put on his own shoes means missing the school bus, I'll slap them on his feet. It's not that he can't do it, it's just that it can take up to 5 minutes, when I can do it in 30 seconds.\u00a0 And I have to stand next to him the whole time, doing nothing else while it's going on, which means lunch is not being packed.\u00a0 \n \n  Some days I have the time, some days he's fast and amazing, and some days I grab the shoes out of his hands and do it for him (wince.) \n \n We normally live in New York City, Manhattan even, so car culture is not our culture. But here to go anywhere, do anything, it's in the car, out of the car, in the car, out of the car.\u00a0 \n \n So I've decided this is the perfect time to stop doing Jacob's seat belt buckling, and make him learn to do it himself.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Jake has stealth helpless down to a science.\u00a0 He will beg \"help me, please, I can't do it Mommy\" about things he is, actually, perfectly capable of doing.\u00a0 \n \n But they take effort, they take concentration, and they take more time if he does them himself, MUCH more time, so he is quite happy to have me do them for him.\u00a0 Happy to have me do, and much annoyed and hurt when I don't. And that's where the cruel part comes in. \n \n Even though he gets mad at me, even though I know it hurts his feelings as I sit next to him and watch him struggle with his socks, even though it feels  cruel to hold back and watch his frustration grow as he fails and flails at tasks, it is actually the larger kindness to do so. \n \nWhen I do FOR my son, I rob him of his chance for growth, competence and maturity. And that seeming kindness is the true cruelty. The fact that he doesn't understand why I refuse to be helpful mommy, why I seem callous and indifferent to his suffering makes it so much the harder.\u00a0\u00a0 \nAnd while I say he's wily about these things, that's not really all of it. I can see he feels bad when he's not being so dexterous, about how long it can take him to get things right. When he feels like he's failing, he's genuinely distressed. \n \nHis self esteem is fragile and struggling over a task of self care Ethan easily handles makes him feel bad about himself... which makes me feel even more cruel when I insist he go through it. But through is the only way to the other side, to competency and success.\u00a0\u00a0 \n I make sure to be upbeat and encouraging throughout it all. I tell him over and over that he needs to learn to do things himself, that he CAN do them and that it doesn't matter how many tries it takes before he gets it right.\u00a0 I tell him I am helping when I coach him, that I will talk him through every little step, demonstrate it; but the hands, the muscles, the physical effort have to be his. \n \nAnd even though he doesn't get it today, still looks at me like a scolded puppy when I make him bumble through, I hope in the future he will look back on these times and know that it was as painful for me as for him. That it took every fiber of resistance in my being, every time I was able to not jump in and rescue my miserable, frustrated son.\u00a0 \n Today I found the fortitude to squat beside him, while he sat in the car, next to him but not leaning in; to recite, to demonstrate, over and over, how to pull the belt across, remind him to tuck it under the booster arm: \n \n\"Use two hands, two hands, two hands, like this (hand over hand), look at the buckle, yes look at it, pay attention Jake, hold the catch steady, two hands, Jake, yes, you can do it, you can. \n \nJake look at me, look into my eyes, I believe in you Jake, I'm your Mom and I know you can do this. \n \nOK now look back at the buckle, line it up, push, do it, push harder, push harder, no, look at what you're doing, line it up before you push, yes like that, two hands Jake, yes, listen for the snap... did it snap?\u00a0 \n \nYES, you did it, you did it, Jake, all by yourself! I'm so proud of you, my big boy.\"\u00a0  \n Tomorrow's goal: getting it under 5 minutes. \n \n(And guess what?  He DID IT !) \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/08/cruel-to-be-kind.html", "title": "\nCruel to be Kind\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010", "body": "\n    ...because I am about to try something new here.\u00a0 I am about to become a regular blogger. \n \n I have realized that I put way too much pressure on myself to come up with impressive and \"important\" posts.\u00a0 Maybe it's because I started blogging as my father was dying and the words just tumbled out of me all intense and poetic as I was facing the first big death in my life, like  here .

{"date": "Saturday, August 21, 2010", "body": "\n    OK, I\u2019ve done it again. Let a post I \u201chave\u201d to write sit and simmer inside me, getting written and re-written over and over in my head and not feeling like I can move on and write anything else until it comes out. \n \nAnd I have so many other short, sweet posts jammed up behind it that would have been timely \u201cthis happened today\u201d moments but by the time they can flow, the \u201ctoday\u201d is no longer today and then it all feels weird turning the present into the past, losing the immediacy. See, this is how I tie myself up in unnecessary knots.  \n This is why I am such a damn slow blogger. I haven\u2019t gotten the hang of it: letting the magic just be. This is the supposed beauty of blogging, letting what bubbles up, bubble up; shape it a bit and then let it go float out into the world: here it is, look at its beauty\u2026pop\u2026move on. \n \nMaybe I am too old, old school, too tied to the idea that my words will live forever in the inter-ether. Maybe I\u2019m too linear. I really felt like I had to get my BlogHer wrap-up post out (2 weeks ago!!!) before anything else can come. Kind of like\u2026 well\u2026 if you\u2019ve ever had kids, and they\u2019ve ever eaten too many bananas\u2026. I don\u2019t need to elucidate the analogy, but let\u2019s just say it will feel good to get this out and move along. \n So, unfinished, raw, barely still relevant: Here is my BlogHer10 Post-mortem-wrap-up post.  For those of you with no interest in this world, I once again beg your forgiveness for this navel-gazing blog post about bloggers and blogging and my experience at the weird, wild, wonderful thing that is the BlogHer Conference. \n \nIt\u2019s over, and after this post I will seal my lips, never to speak of it again\u2026 until next summer that is (but that\u2019s a really long time away, honest) and it will be safe to come back and read me after this, really.  \n Let\u2019s start off saying that the reason it has taken so long to get this thing off the ground is that I had an odd, strange, mixed bag of an experience at BlogHer. I had some amazing moments. I didn't mope. I had a generally great time.  I don\u2019t really know what more I was expecting, magic, maybe? And it didn\u2019t quite happen for me. And  I know for a fact that it wasn\u2019t the conference, it was me. \n I managed  to be in the right place at the right time, much of the time, like here,  in the women\u2019s room outside the People\u2019s Party on Thursday night.   \n I walked  in, introduced myself to  Jenny, The Bloggess  (helps that I am no longer  shy) hugged her, and hung out while  Annissa  and a few dozen others  slowly filled the room.  It was awesome, and yet\u2026 \n \n I met up with some amazing women that I had only known online before, like Sandie, aka  UrbanMama  (who also blogs about grief, although we mostly gossiped about movies) and many, many more\u2026  \n I  met some amazing women I had no idea existed until I met them at the  conference, like  Christine Moers  who became fast friends with my new  friend  Sandra , the kind of connection I have always made at conferences,  but not this time\u2026 \n The  beyond lovely and talented Karen of  Chookooloonks  wrote on my arm:  \u201cEvolving\u201d because I was definitely a verb, not a noun, in a thorough  state of flux \u2026 \n The  special needs parenting community was fierce, starting with the  \u201c Blogging Autism \u201d panel, the first morning. Meeting and connecting with  BlogHer special needs parenting editor  Shannon Des Roches Rosa  of   Squidalicious , and  Stimey , and  Ellen , and  Julia , and... (too many  amazing women to name here, see Shannon\u2019s  post ) was a definite higher  than high point\u2026 \u00a0  \nSuddenly,   Neil  was there, and I was shocked, knowing that he had gotten the call  that his father-in-law had died just as he was about to board his plane  from LA a few days earlier.  He looked a little shell-shocked himself,  and has written his own \u201c there and not there \u201d post about the conference.  Reading it, I realized that even though it\u2019s been almost six months  since my father has passed, maybe I had still not been quite ready for  the big noisy happy... \n \nI went to a lot of parties. I had fun. I danced. But not with wild abandon, not like I meant it\u2026 \n \n \n \n \nI was standing next to  Jory , 4 feet away from Greyson Chance as he charmingly sang his heart out\u2026. \n \n \n \nIt was an AMAZING conference, and I am so glad I went. But I was not completely inhabiting myself. I have never felt so present and remote at the same time. It was like this photo: \n \n There, but with something between me and what\u2019s right in front of me, and a bit out of focus, to boot. \n \nI have been worrying at this tangled mess ever since, picking at threads, trying to figure out why.  Part of it was that going home to my own bed and family every night left me out of that \u201cbeing out of place and time\u201d magic, kept me too tethered to my real life: lunches to pack, children to kiss and cling to me, husband anticipating me home at a certain hour. \n \nAnd the Sunday after, when the city was everyone\u2019s playground: my kids owned me lock, stock, & cranky mommy barrel. \n But that can\u2019t be the whole answer.  \n I don\u2019t know if I bring all of myself to anything these days. Part of me is still in that  little room holding my father\u2019s hand , watching him die a little more each day.   \n \nPart of me is still sitting in the little room where they first tested Jacob six years ago, where the psychologist asked if I noticed that he climbed on me like I was furniture, that he didn\u2019t seen to care when we called his name, that in spite of the obvious joy that suffused him, that\u2019s not the same thing as relatedness; the room where I was told that my happy, loving boy was not just speech delayed, not just \u201cdreamy\u201d as a rather useless speech therapist had reassured me, but was actually Autistic.  \n I leave parts of me behind in so many places, and silly me, I forgot to pick them back up again, finding myself rather less than my full self for some time now.  And it took BlogHer to make me see it.  \n \nAnd I could blame it on the ADD, but that\u2019s too easy. And I know, now, I need to gather those pieces up and stitch myself back together.  I\u2019ll need a few patches. \n \nThere\u2019s going to be some hot glue involved. Maybe even a little wholesale reinvention. But that\u2019s what they made the internet for, now, isn\u2019t it.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-wigcoCpI/AAAAAAAAAEg/_PGfqsk_jG0/s1600/Me+&+Jenny.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-yFW27eKI/AAAAAAAAAEs/hBqBpQmDFK8/s1600/Jenny+&+Annissa+&+gang.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-x1meFghI/AAAAAAAAAEo/B4W5DYfzCfY/s1600/getting+crowded.JPG", "http://thebloggess.com/", "http://freeanissa.com/", "http://spa.typepad.com/mamas/", "http://www.welcometomybrain.net/2010/08/my-little-corner-of-blogher10.html", "http://twitter.com/Dopeysmom", "http://www.chookooloonks.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-2bImT12I/AAAAAAAAAEw/4Pj0fEWnp4c/s1600/DSC07806.jpg", "http://www.blogher.com/official-blogher-10-liveblog-personal-blogging-autism-shattering-myths-opening-eyes-and-finding-your", "http://www.blogher.com/user/119/posts", "http://www.squidalicious.com/", "http://www.stimeyland.com/", "http://lovethatmax.blogspot.com/", "http://kidneysandeyes.com/", "http://www.squidalicious.com/2010/08/blogher10-friday.html", "http://twitter.com/Neilochka", "http://www.citizenofthemonth.com/2010/08/11/blogher-10/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-xR4z_PjI/AAAAAAAAAEk/TTfhRM4wtso/s1600/CheeseBurgHer.JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-3qbwjHLI/AAAAAAAAAE0/yVwqX09nFDU/s1600/DSC07809.JPG", "http://www.jorydesjardins.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TG-34nIiDCI/AAAAAAAAAE4/E1XZ371Qwbo/s1600/DSC07816.JPG", "http://thesquashedbologna.blogspot.com/2010/02/raging-against-dying.html"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/08/blogher10-reflections-of-very-slow.html", "title": "\nThe BlogHer10 reflections of a very. slow. newbie. blogger.\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2010", "body": "\n    Here it is, finally, my (obligatory)  BlogHer Conference  post. (It seems like everyone is doing one and I hate to be left out.)\u00a0 \n \nIf you\u2019re not a blogger and are just reading me because you\u2019re my friend, or you really care about Autism or you are caring for old/dying people, you might want to skip the rest of this as it will probably bore you to tears. (Then again I might tell the tale of nearly puking in  James Caan \u2019s lap, so maybe you'll skim through looking for the juicy parts instead.) \n \nIf you want my best post about Autism go  here , saying goodbye to my dying father go  here . If you\u2019re up for a ramble through my mind as I ponder the upcoming BlogHer 10 conference, being held right here in my hometown (NYC), then stay on board.  \n \nFirst let me say that this is not a \u201chow to\u201d for BlogHer. This is my first BlogHer conference, and while I\u2019m a terrible know it all, capable of spouting off expertise like an expert when I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface, that would be even too much hubris for me.\u00a0 \n \nHell, I\u2019ve only been Blogging for 6 months making me a complete newbie about this in every sense of the word except, well, except that I have been writing my whole life, even if sometimes just in my head, like my friend Kirsten from  Nilsen Life  has been recently.\u00a0  \n \nAnd that other type of BlogHer post about anticipatory anxiety, well I\u2019m not there, either. Much. I\u2019ve been thinking about why I\u2019m so calm when others quake and realize it\u2019s for a number of reasons. \n \nFirst is that this has been such a crap year with my father dying and all, (and my mother such a wreck, and needing to find a new special ed school for Jacob) that I just can\u2019t take the small stuff seriously right now.\u00a0 And while I\u2019m not downplaying social anxiety, know it can be horribly debilitating for some (and perhaps for a disproportional percentage of bloggers, who have been known to spend more time with their computers than with their friends), Death is a big wake up call, as it were, sorting the wheat from the chaff in my life in so many ways.\u00a0  \n \nAlso, while this may be my first BlogHer, I am not new to conferences, having spent years attending them or working them behind the scenes. Once you\u2019ve been on the other side and hung out with the man behind the curtain, when you\u2019re the puppetmaster putting on the big head and flames  show , there\u2019s not much there to angst about.\u00a0 \n \nIt\u2019s going to be a bunch of people, mostly, but not all, women. Some I will know for real, others I know via their words. Some I have such an intense connection to from our reading each other\u2019s blogs, tweets, emails and back and forth, comments on each others posts that I consider them my friends and feel it is astonishing that I will be seeing them in real life, hearing the timbre of their voices, finding out they are taller shorter, rounder, scrawnier than I had pictured, for the first time, this week. \n \nI am so sad, devastated really, that Kirsten won\u2019t be able to be there (you can read about her fatal scheduling fail  here ) because her words and spirit move me so. \n \nI\u2019m sure there will be \u201cfamous\u201d bloggers I sit next to and talk with and fail to recognize, gabbing away at them, possible even name dropping in a completely embarrassing manner (because that is one of my glaring flaws, in fact I can promise that I will shamelessly name drop at least once in this post, just keep reading) only to afterward look them up and realize I should have known who they were, should have listened more and talked less (another personality flaw.) \n \nAnd yes this has already happened at a pre-BlogHer meet up. Should have paid attention to clues like, oh, that she\u2019s speaking at the conference even though she\u2019s not primarily a blogger (just a media uber-professional, a verbose & funny social satirist tweeter, and oh, called a \u201cwell connected\u201d member of NYC\u2019s cultural elite in this week\u2019s New York Magazine.) Doh! \n \nMy years of painful gaffes at  Sundance ,  SXSW , The  Toronto  Film Festival, and the  Edinburgh Theater Festival  should have either cured or inured me to these embarrassing moments, but I am sure they will come again and again. Like the time I nearly puked in James Caan\u2019s lap. But more on that later (will I stop at nothing to tease my readers and keep them reading? No, it seems, not at all.) \n \nI am also remembering the magic that can happen at conferences when you meet strangers and become instant compadres, tumbling together into all sorts of adventures and misadventures because, well, why not?\u00a0 \n \nAll this from my pre-children glory days of course, when I was up until dawn many nights, something I just don\u2019t do anymore, unless it\u2019s  momsomnia  or I am up at dawn with an early waking child. And my tales have a long ago and far away feel to them, even to me who was there (was I really? It barely seems possible now that my world has contracted so.) \n \nMy last conference before this was Sundance in 2002, and I gotta tell you, 3 months pregnant with twins at 7,000 feet was perhaps not my most brilliant decision.\u00a0 \n \nI went with my husband for the very first time because I thought I might need a caretaker. Um, that would be yes. He held my hair back as I puked into a garbage can at JFK airport, mouthing \u201cpregnant\u201d to the security guards so they wouldn\u2019t think \u201cdrunk and disorderly\u201d in their immediately post 9/11 jitteryness.\u00a0 \n \nI mostly kept it together in Park City, moving slowly, forgoing late, late nights, but there was one evening at a fancy restaurant when my delicious scallops suddenly decided they were on a round trip trajectory. \n \nJames Caan was seated at a table directly between me and the rather distant ladies room. He looked up and smiled at me as I lurched by, will never know how close his lap came to being the repository for my violently rejected dinner.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nAlso at this last Sundance I finally had the good fortune to have a personal connection at one of those \u201cguest list\u201d only sponsored\u00a0 chalets: a restauranteur friend of mine was the private chef at \u201cReebok House.\u201d\u00a0 I could really have cared less about the prime swag or the shoulder rubbing with medium size celebrities, it had all a pregnant woman in her second trimester needed: a peaceful atmosphere and abundant healthy food that didn\u2019t nauseate me. \n \nI did however, have one encounter that tickled my fancy:  Julie Benz  (who I knew as Darla, the pregnant vampire on the TV series Angel) chatting me up about babies and rubbing my pregnant belly for good luck. And yes, she was very polite and asked first.  \n \nIf I can squeeze in one more name dropping story, before I hit the bitter end here: one night at the Toronto Film Festival I somehow got myself invited to one of the tonier sunset cocktail parties at a lovely outdoor caf\u00e9. I found myself plopped down next to legendary French film director  Agnes Varda , whose film \u201cThe Gleaners and I\u201d was premiering there.\u00a0 \n \nI speak no French, and she not much English but a friend at the table was happy to translate so we could carry on a delightful conversation about how my first name was the same as her last name, a situation neither of us had ever encountered before. I told her that the evening I had met my husband, upon being introduced to me he had quipped \u201cNot the filmmaker Agnes Varda?\u201d\u00a0 \n \nThis probably sealed my fate: witty and knowledgeable of French independent film \u2013 perfect for each other (little did I know he was semi serious; he knew her name vaguely, but not her work, had no idea she was a French woman of some years.) \n \nBut I digress\u2026 Agnes told me her father was a Jew from Greece, and I told her my name meant \u201cwild rose\u201d in Hebrew. We talked a while about this and that, and I am sure I was swept from her mind five minutes after she passed on to another conversation.

{"date": "Thursday, July 29, 2010", "body": "\n    To my twin sons on their 8th Birthday: \nEight years ago today, right now, at 5:30 in the morning, on July 29th, I was waking up after a short fitful night\u2019s sleep more excited than I have ever been in my entire life, because this was the day I was finally going to meet you, for real, and hold you in my arms, and I just. couldn\u2019t. wait. \n \nIt was a hot, hot summer, kind of like this one, which has been making me think a lot of that one. At 6:30 AM when your Dad eased me into the taxi as we headed out to the hospital, it was already 89 degrees and the air was thick, promising a miserable day to come. \n \nBut I was deliriously happy, and ready to burst open with my love for you, gulping in the vibrant soupy air that would soon be traded for hospital cool.\u00a0  \n \nHospitals are strange places, white and clean and cold, and full of their own very particular ways of doing things.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of \u201churry up and wait\u201d and we just rode it out with infinite patience, because we knew that soon, soon, soon, you would be coming out into the world, and our lives would change forever. \n \nWe were about to cross that crevasse, the dividing line between parents-to-be and parents, never to look back, always to move forward, so a few more minutes at the threshold wasn\u2019t going to hurt.\u00a0  \n \nImagining it for so long, it is actually unimaginable when it finally comes: holding you in my arms, seeing your tiny faces, so perfect, so\u2026.. you! \n \nThey handed each of you to me so briefly, just to snatch you away again and do hospitally things with you -- big healthy boys, they needn\u2019t have done that!\u00a0 But in that moment, I looked into each of your eyes, and it was love at first sight. \n \nThere was recognition: yes, this is my son; and knowledge: I will love you for the rest of my life and much as I love you now; and fierce, fierce protectiveness: I will kill or die to keep you safe without a moment\u2019s hesitation. \n \nAnd it came so instantly and so fully on that it nearly took my breath away. I had waited my whole life to meet you, and there we were, finally, face to face.  \n \nAnd eight years later, it\u2019s all still there. I love you each with all my heart, in spite of your constantly trying to get me to declare I love you more, Ethan. Because that\u2019s the wonderful, amazing thing about hearts: they defy physics. We each have only one, yet their capacity for love is infinite. \n \nI can love you, Ethan with my whole heart, with every fiber in my being, and I can love you, Jacob with my whole heart, too, with every atom in my body. \n \nAnd yet there is fully room there for your father, and for grandma and grandpa, too. (Yes, we do still love people even when they have died, that is where they live on, in our hearts.) \n \nAnd yet more room still, in that little organ, for all the many others I love and will come to love: dear friends and hopefully, someday, grandchildren (but not too soon, OK?) \n \nSo Happy, Happy Birthday my boys, this marvelous journey continues \u2026\u2026 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TFip3UKAU2I/AAAAAAAAAEY/ikBdYWiNP-A/s1600/img009_2.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TFio1doWAdI/AAAAAAAAAEI/6FGkHEC4qTI/s1600/img006_3.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/07/good-day-to-be-born.html", "title": "\nA Good Day to Be Born\n"},
{"date": "Monday, July 26, 2010", "body": "\n    This morning the sound of Ethan happily playing with his sleepover friend, Sage, would have brought me much happiness, except, except\u2026. it made me cry. Made me cry because I almost never hear this in the morning in spite of Ethan having a twin brother. Because of Autism.\u00a0 \n \n Ethan is an 8 year old boy: they talk with their friends, play games that involve a lot of conversations, pretending and planning and even their battles are all words. \u201cI am using water smite on you now\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n And Jacob, he screeches like a monster and throws toys.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that he\u2019s non-verbal, he talks a lot (actually all the time, but that\u2019s another long post to come), but doesn\u2019t have the ability to keep up with the rapid flow of thoughts and ideas exchanged in typical play.\u00a0 He can carry on a conversation, IF it\u2019s on his terms, his topic, and Ethan has just not signed up for that job. \n \n Most mornings start like this\u2026 Jacob: \u201cEthan wake up, are you awake, Ethan? Eeeeeethan? Are you a robot? Ethan, are you a robot? Wake up, Ethan! Are you a robot?\u201d Ethan: \u201cSHUT UP JACOB!!!!!\u00a0 Mom, Jacob is bothering me, make him stop, make him shut up, he is the stupidest most annoying meanest brother in the world!!!!!\u00a0 Moooooom!\u201d \n \n And some days I am sanguine, take it in stride, separate them (as much as I can in a small apartment), get them (separately) busy, feed them (different breakfasts), get them ready for (their separate) schools or camp and summer school and their (separate) busy days. \n \n And other days it\u2019s hard.\u00a0 The woulda-been, coulda-been, shoulda-beens bite me in the ass and I mourn the family we are NOT, the family time we just can\u2019t have, the ease of two kids the same gender and age that I see taking place in the families of twins we know and hang out with.  \n \n This morning hearing Ethan so happy playing with his friend brings it all back, the dashed expectations: My sons will not be lonely they will have each other. Instead, today Ethan is happy and Jacob is lonely.\u00a0 Most days they are both lonely, Ethan bothered, angry and Jacob hurt, rejected. And I can\u2019t fix it, I just don\u2019t know how, I feel like a failure as a mother.\u00a0 \n \n Maybe if I got up at 5 am to get everything ready so in the mornings I didn\u2019t have to be busy, I could just facilitate and scaffold their interactions with each other. But what even then? Ethan would still want to play games whose sophistication is so beyond Jacob, and Jake would still be too loud, too physical, too repetitive for his nimble minded brother, so what then?\u00a0 They could play successfully for 10 minutes, with me sculpting every moment, maybe, on the good days, and then, back to business as usual for the rest of the morning? And I got up at 5 freaking AM for that? Um, no thanks.\u00a0  \n \n I read a lot of true and fictional accounts of families with siblings both on & off the autism spectrum, trying to feel not so alone, trying to get into Ethan\u2019s head, figure out how I can help make it easier. And you know what?\u00a0 They all suck.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Not because they are not wonderful, they are, especially this one:  Rules  by Cynthia Lord (who obviously has a kid on the spectrum herself). But because all those boys and girls (and for some reason it\u2019s usually girls) while they may have difficult moments, when push comes to shove, they are unfailingly loyal to their Autistic brothers. Their parents describe them as their kid\u2019s best therapist. And that is so far from happening in our house, I end up feeling worse rather than comforted, and no more clued in to what I can do to turn things around than before.  \n \n So, the sounds of happy morning playtime in my house are so rare. They do happen from time to time, when Ethan is feeling generous and happy and Jacob is being calm, his sweet funny self flying free, not frustrated by Ethan\u2019s rejections.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n A few weeks back, on a lazy Sunday morning, they took all their stuffed Pokemon  dolls  -- I mean SOFT ACTION FIGURES (don\u2019t want to trample boy egos here) -- and brought them up to Jacob\u2019s top bunk, put them to bed and woke them up (Jacob\u2019s oldest and most beloved pretend-play scenario) and had a whopping good Pokemon battle.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I held my breath, tiptoeing, smiling, puttering quietly around the house so as not to break the magic yet.\u00a0 Like an amateur juggler holding too many balls, I knew they were going to start dropping soon, but for just a moment they were all gloriously in the air, and all was right with the world. \n \n NOTE: This was actually written 2 weeks ago on July 11th, so that\u2019s the \u201ctoday\u201d of the post, not to confuse anyone who might have been at my boys birthday party today, actually, and be going \u201chuh?\u201d\u00a0 I am just so overwhelmed these days, I wrote & then lost this until now, searching for something to throw up quickly to not be completely lame having gone a month without actually posting anything. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cynthialord.com/rules.htm"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/07/mourning-in-morning.html", "title": "\nMourning in the Morning\n"},

{"date": "Friday, June 25, 2010", "body": "\n    The other day a miraculous thing came in the mail: a letter addressed to my son Jacob, the one on the Autism Spectrum who has no real friends of his own yet, and never gets mail. The letter came from the Admissions Director of the new school Jake will be attending in the fall.\u00a0  \n \n Those who have been aware of my struggles to find a school for my son for next year will read these words and know the tonnage of the weight that has now been lifted from my heart.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Jacob has not been an easy child to find a school for.\u00a0 Too related for the Autism schools and too Autistic for the LD (Learning Disabled) schools - and also with too large a language disorder for the wonderful Aspergers program that shockingly does exist in our NYC public schools (the  ASD Nest program ) - he is a classic \u201cfalls though the cracks\u201d kind of kid.\u00a0 Not that we would let that happen to him, but still, this has not been a fun year.\u00a0  \n \n Let me say that again, because I like the saying of it: my son Jacob now has a school to attend next fall. And not just any school, a wonderful one that felt so right from the moment I walked in the door, and stayed that way through every interaction I have had with every staff member of the school.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I have felt there to be an overriding (and sadly rare) combination of warmth, caring, intelligence and respect that I did not know was exactly what I was looking for until I encountered it, and then it left nearly every other school sadly wanting.\u00a0 This school, though private, is neither fancy or shmantzy, but it is perfect for Jake right now, and so I sigh the deepest sigh of relief a parent has ever exhaled. \n \n But I am digressing again (I do that, I have ADD, remember?) and I want to come back to this letter.\u00a0 A few simple paragraphs. Nothing fancy, or shmantzy, but it made me cry.\u00a0 Read it here (with a few specifying details fudged) and you will know why:\u00a0  \n \n Dear Mr. Jacob F. Congratulations!\u00a0 We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to the Level II class at the XYZ School at (address) for the 2010-2011 school year.  Within the next week, your family should expect to receive an envelope with enrollment materials.\u00a0 They will also receive a phone call from our main office, asking to set up an appointment for an enrollment meeting. I am delighted to welcome you and your family to the XYZ School.\u00a0 We look forward to a successful year and a long partnership. Sincerely,  B.E.  Director of Admissions\u00a0 \n \n If you haven\u2019t figured out why this made me cry, here it is: the Director of Admissions sent this letter directly to my Autistic almost 8 year old son. To HIM, not to me.\u00a0 What that simple act communicates is a world of import, summed up in a simple/not simple word: RESPECT.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Jacob is being treated like a person, a person to be talked to, not just talked about.\u00a0 He is not \u201cbeing placed\u201d, he is being welcomed into a community.\u00a0 And this makes all the difference in the universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n I sent an email to the Admissions Director, telling him his letter had made me cry, and also telling him:  \n \n \u201cI want you to know that your short, simple, warm letter so elegantly communicated a level of respect for your students as people and members of a community.\u00a0 I have not experienced this anywhere else in his education to date, and now that I know it is possible, from this point on I will expect no less for him, ever.\u00a0 Thank you.\u201d \n \n And this is what I want to pass on, to say to all of us, parents of children with special and with ordinary needs (no, calm down, I\u2019m not calling your kids ordinary, yes, they are all special) of children with and without  IEPs  (although to quote a friend \u201cisn\u2019t every child an individual, and shouldn\u2019t all Individuals have their own Education Plan?\u201d)\u2026. \n \n I say this:\u00a0  R-E-S-P-E-C-T (nods to  Aretha) \u00a0 Expect and demand no less for our children, ever! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/SpecialEducation/SchoolImprovement/Projects/OtherProjects/About_ASD.htm", "http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/iep.index.htm"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/06/little-respect.html", "title": "\nA Little Respect\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 2, 2010", "body": "\n    NOTE: This post originally appeared on the sadly closed NYC Moms Blog. \n \n This  Saturday I ignored dire predictions of afternoon thunderstorms and took  the boys off to that tiny jewel of an amusement park that wings in to  perch in  Central Park \u2019s Wollman Rink for the summer\u00a0  (Memorial Day through mid September):  Victorian Gardens .\u00a0 We\u2019ve been taking the boys there a  few times a summer since they were three, and though they are nearly  too old, too big for the pint sized thrills therein to be found, we\u2019re  squeezing one, maybe two more summers out of the place, because there\u2019s  some sort of magic there for the boys and I\u2019m not ready to let it go  yet. \n \n I remember  the first time we went, it was the whole family, all four of us: me, my  husband, and the boys.\u00a0 They were still tiny, not yet quite three, and  we rode all the rides with them, grown ups with our bent knees  approaching our ears. They loved being on the really little kiddie  rides, which were just right sized droplets of thrill for them.\u00a0 By the  next summer, at four, our services were only required for some, not all  rides (just the \"really scary\" ones), and my husband and I stood by in  trepidation as Ethan took charge of his twin brother Jacob, making sure  he stayed safety belted and didn\u2019t try to climb out mid-ride.\u00a0 For you  see, Jacob is on the Autism Spectrum, and at four was still very  un-awake to the rules of the world, needed a minder at all times.  \n \n This was my husband\u2019s last  foray with us there, however, because while they may be named \u201cGardens\u201d,  it\u2019s mostly a misnomer.\u00a0 But really, who would come to \u201cVictorian  Hottest-shadeless-circular-patch-of-sun-blasted-cement-in-the-city\u201d?\u00a0  Oh, yeah, it\u2019s surrounded by Central Park lush, but inside:  bake-a-rama.\u00a0 And my husband, well, he melts in the heat. Hates heat.  His idea of perfect weather: Seattle. In winter.\u00a0 So we no longer  torture him by making him come drip with us. Because no matter what the  forecast, and this Saturday it was \u201ccloudy and cooler with a strong  chance of thunderstorms\u201d, it\u2019s ALWAYS hot and humid when we go.\u00a0 The  kids don\u2019t care and I just sweat and bear it because they always have  such a wonderful time.\u00a0  But  the whirling fun, while terrific, isn\u2019t the magic, it\u2019s the  co-operation. Because you see, my boys don\u2019t always get along, and  lately it\u2019s been like oil and water.\u00a0 And that\u2019s on the calm days.\u00a0 On  the bloody ones, it\u2019s more like oil and flame thrower.\u00a0 The full history  is too long and complicated to go into here, but let\u2019s just say that  having a twin on the autism spectrum is really hard.\u00a0 And being the  autistic twin of a brother you love, who currently wants very little to  do with you is really hard, too.\u00a0 Yet somehow, at Victorian Gardens  magic things happen.\u00a0 The boys don\u2019t fight.\u00a0 They ride rides together,  laughing.\u00a0 Every year Jacob needs less and less help, by now just little  bits, here and there, and here, at Victorian Gardens, Ethan is willing  to provide it, patiently.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually something approaching a  miracle.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Thinking about writing this post  in praise of our little magic patch of amusement, I stumbled upon  something I had written last summer about this very phenomenon. Here it  is:\u00a0 \n \n I am absurdly  happy watching my sons be happy today on the flying swings.\u00a0 Ethan does  not hate his brother today.\u00a0 When I go in to help Jacob onto the  apparatus, Ethan shoos me away saying \u201cI can help him, I want to help  him, I can do it\u201d so I back off, let him be the big, helpful brother to  his twin.\u00a0 Something I never envisioned 7 years ago when, large as an  overripe fruit, I lay about waiting to bust open and birth the twins.\u00a0  An only child\u2019s fervent fantasy: my children will never know loneliness,  they will always have each other.\u00a0 They will not spend countless  childhood hours in front of the mirror practicing funny faces, creating a  playmate, an other, out of the reflected self.\u00a0 I never counted on  Autism, on this: that Ethan and Jacob are and are not twins.\u00a0 Womb  shared, room sharing they are.\u00a0 But partners and age mates not now, not  yet, questionably ever, though I\u2019ll never say never. \n \n I still tell the story, though it  would horrify him now, of Ethan and I in the car when he was 4.\u00a0 We had  dropped off Jake and I was driving the 10 blocks to Ethan\u2019s pre-school.\u00a0  He was in the back seat, when he said \u201cMom, I wish that Jake and I both  had had Autism or we both didn\u2019t have Autism.\u201d Tears jump out of my  eyes \u201cWhy honey?\u201d \u201cSo we could be the same and go to the same school.\u201d\u00a0  Glad he\u2019s facing the back of my head so he doesn\u2019t catch the tears  streaming down my face now.\u00a0 So understanding and compassionate at 4.\u00a0  Jump ahead 3 years to the fighting, hitting, screaming \u201cI hate you\u201d \u2013  where is that sweet boy?\u00a0 Buried under years of longing and  disappointment turned bitter and angry.\u00a0 Bitter and angry at 7 \u2013 how did  it come to this?\u00a0 Too big a burden to be a twin but older brother, yet I  ask him to shoulder that load every day.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n   \n And so it continues this year: we  have a day of (mostly) peace and fun, stay out till late, watch the  first fireflies come out in Central Park as the boys scramble up and  down rock \"mountains\" on the long walk home.

When he wants to engage another child and can\u2019t think of what to say, Jake will go up to him and purposefully belch in his face in and then laugh.\u00a0 It would completely delight him if somebody, someday would just burp him back. \n \nBut back to the CDC playdate gone bad.\u00a0 It was one of those rare early spring days winking a big hint of summery heat to come.\u00a0 I had not known how long we would be out, and had canceled the rest of Jacob\u2019s appointments for the day.\u00a0 At the time his days were full of various therapies, all the time, all day long.\u00a0 Jake had a schedule that had to kept on the computer, adjusted and printed up weekly, posted on the wall and distributed to all, so he could make every appointment.\u00a0 40+ hours a week of ABA, Speech, OT, PT, Counseling, SEIT: Jacob had, and was, a full time job.\u00a0 But this day was cleared, free, a total rarity. A gift.\u00a0 And I decided to revel in it.\u00a0  \n \nThe CDC was on 57th Street, right by the southern edge of Central Park, so there we headed. Crossing 59th Street we encountered the many horse drawn carriages that tourists engage to whirl through the park and I thought \u201cwhat the hell\u201d, told Jacob to pick a horse.\u00a0 Our driver wore a worn thin \u201cSt. Paddy\u2019s Day Pub Crawl\u201d t-shirt instead of the fine coachman livery of some others, but he seemed pleasant to Jake so we climbed aboard.\u00a0 I knew money was tight, as ever, and I certainly could have found a \u201cmore appropriate\u201d way to spend 35 dollars, but I wanted to indulge Jake for once in a regular kid special thing.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t therapy, it was fun, and he, we, needed it. \n \nAfter a long slow pleasant clopping meander through the southern reaches of Central Park, we were left off on the East side, and I decided to just wander together through the park vaguely West, since that was the direction home. \n \nWe are walking slowly, no agenda, no hurry, through the lower edge of the park, when we skirt by the Wollman Rink which is currently neither beast nor fowl, post skating season, but not yet transformed into the Victorian Gardens amusement park (which I recently wrote about in this  post for the NYC Moms blog ).\u00a0 Work is being done and there are some single bricks laying about, castoffs from some project or other nearby. Jacob sees one and picks it up.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see the harm, so I let him. \n \nIt becomes his favorite toy, his new best friend.\u00a0 He carries it throughout the park, won\u2019t let me take it back from him.\u00a0 And then he puts it down on the edge of the path, half on the pavement, half on the grass, and flings himself down to lie flat, gaze at the brick up close and view the world around him through the lens of: brick foreground, Central Park splendors behind.\u00a0 He picks the brick up, carries it a few feet to a new vista and repeats.  \n \nAnd I am struck by how engaged in this project he is.\u00a0 He is seeing the world through this unique filter and he is so enthralled by it.\u00a0 And it bowls me over, how intense is his love affair with this seeming ordinary workaday object: a brick.\u00a0 How basic, solid, utilitarian, we see them every day with nary a second glance, and yet to him it has become a thing of beauty, special and precious.\u00a0 \n \nAnd then I think: Isn\u2019t this what artists do? Take things we pass by, think nothing of and hold them up, say \u201clook at the wonderfulness here, the splendor you didn\u2019t notice\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s what my father did as a photographer, made you look at that  man  working on the street, that  lovely junk  on a junk man\u2019s table,  debris  discarded on a city street, and see the extraordinary beauty there in the ordinary. \n \nI think of the  Dadaists , who specifically chose pedestrian objects and held them up claiming \u201cit\u2019s art if I say it is\u201d; Duchamp\u2019s  urinal  the most widely recognized example of this oft scorned and vilified movement -- but we still remember and talk about it, it\u2019s influence carrying on thorough the generations, giving birth to new art forms and bad music videos alike. \n \nAnd I wonder: what is the wall, the membrane, the line in the sand that represents the magic threshold that Jake would have to step over to cross from Autist to Artist? Because if this intense attachment to everyday objects, having a unique vision of them, even carrying that over to obsession, if this all is a hallmark of the Autistic and the Artist alike, what separates them?\u00a0  \n \nI think of many artists becoming obsessed with a particular image or object; story or subject and painting, sculpting, re-creating that over and over in different ways, repetition with variation but still, holding onto the thing until its meaning has been wrung out, exhausted, and still going back to that well again: Monet's  water lilies , Frida Kahlo's  self portraits , Rothko\u2019s  rectangles . \n \nWhen an autistic kid re-creates the same thing over and over we call it rigidity and try to break him of it, but when a great artist paints the same thing over and over, we call that her signature subject and marvel at her ability to see things  new again whilst stumping along a worn and familiar path. \n \nIt is interesting to note that the very first of Marcel Duchamp\u2019s found object creations (which he called \"Readymades\") was a  bicycle wheel , which he mounted upside down onto a stool in his studio. He would spin it occasionally just to watch it, claiming \"I enjoyed looking at it, just as I enjoy looking at the flames dancing in the fireplace.\" Hmm, sound like anyone else we know? \n \nAnd the answer is, of course, communicative intent.\u00a0 For an Artist, no mater how narcissistic, wrapped up in himself, withdrawn and solitary, the creative impulse is still connected to communication, the desire to share one\u2019s uniquely warped vision of the world with the world, or at least one other individual in it. The Autist, on the other hand, is most usually happy to lose himself in the objects of his fascination, to commune rapturously alone with their beauty.\u00a0  \n \nThe interesting thing is that Jacob has changed so much in this, now.\u00a0 He is straddling that fence that separates the autist from the artist, he has bucketfuls of communicative intent. Were this to have happened today he would not want to be alone with his lovely brick but he would be taking me by the hand, dragging me down to belly up to the pavement with him, close one eye then the other to see how the brick relates to the background.\u00a0 \u201cLook, Mommy!\u201d he would say, as he does so often now, pointing out his world to me, wanting me to see and marvel with him at what has caught his fancy.\u00a0 That \u201cwith him\u201d part is the big brass ring, and I am over the moon that Jacob now has it firmly in his grasp.\u00a0  \n \nIt\u2019s called \u201cshared attention\u201d, and if your child is developing typically you don\u2019t even notice it as it kicks in around 9 months, certainly by a year.\u00a0 You point to a bird and your baby cues in to your gaze, his eyes follow the direction of your finger and he looks where you\u2019re looking, smiles when he finds the birdie.\u00a0 Your toddler picks up a pretty rock and brings it to you, proudly sharing her treasure. \n \nJacob did none of these things at that tender age. But he\u2019s here now, sharing attention in spades, and I bow down to kiss the feet of the goddess of neuro-emotional development that has allowed Jacob to walk this path, step by step, from Autist toward Artist. \n \n \n \n Photo Credit: Jim Steinhardt\u00a0 \"Girl with Balloon at Central Park Zoo\" 1963  \n (yes, that's me) \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TAUEZuMyPaI/AAAAAAAAACQ/MFrlfzWxp-4/s1600/zoo.jpg", "http://www.nycmomsblog.com/2010/06/the-magic-of-victorian-gardens.html", "http://www.skjstudio.com/steinhardt/s_cement.html", "http://www.skjstudio.com/steinhardt/s_princess.html", "http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/photographs/street_debris_new_york_jim_steinhardt/objectview.aspx?collID=19&OID=190038637", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada", "http://www.beatmuseum.org/duchamp/fountain.html", "http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80220", "http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80220", "http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=78333", "http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80566", "http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=81631"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/05/from-autist-to-artist.html", "title": "\nFrom Autist to Artist\n"},

Yes, you heard that right, it is now  MID-MAY and I have no idea where he is going to school, nor how it will  be paid for.\u00a0 We are transitioning in the middle of elementary school,  which is none too easy.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Friends ask \u201cCan\u2019t he just stay where he is?\u201d  and I want to bang my head into the wall (wait, who\u2019s autistic now?)\u00a0  Hindsight is always 20-20.\u00a0 No, he can\u2019t, he\u2019s in a school that only  goes K to 2,  forcing a  change at this  point.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n We had been  hoping that he\u2019d be ready now to go to his twin brother\u2019s public  elementary school, which has wonderful  CTT  classes  (for the laymen: Collaborative Team Teaching by a Special Ed  and regular teacher, kids w/ IEPs integrated into the regular  classroom), but no such luck.\u00a0 He still needs more support and a less  chaotic environment. So here we are in limbo.                 \n \n The  school  we really, really want  for him, which would really be a great fit, has absolutely no spots for a  3rd grader next year.\u00a0 Were a space to open up (it could happen) we\u2019d  be jockeying with about 50 other kids for that one spot. And if any of  them are girls, forget-about-it, they\u2019re in, we\u2019re toast (since so many  more boys than girls are on the spectrum, schools need girls to keep the  classrooms balanced).\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n And at the point this past fall and winter when I  should have been blitzing every Special Ed school in a 50 mile radius  and putting on a full court press I was coordinating my father\u2019s  palliative care and holding my mother while she sobbed and cabbing cross  town at 2 AM to pick my Dad up off the floor, again, and \u2026. well, you  know.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n I wasn\u2019t a total slacker, I went on tours, I filled out  applications, but the competition is so fierce and getting the right  school for my son is such a tricky business, it needed my full on, laser  beam attention, and that just wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0 So now I am playing  catch-up and calling in all callable favors, and praying a lot to the  gods of Autism (whoever you are) that this work out for Jacob, because  he is an amazing, bright, sweet boy who will sink or swim next year  depending on finding a school and teacher who \u201cget\u201d him.\u00a0  \n \n And let\u2019s not talk about the mess  that is my apartment (I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re giving the  Collyer brothers   a run for their money, but it\u2019s getting close) or my other son\u2019s issues  with homework (DO NOT GET ME STARTED) or the  15  lost pounds  I regained this winter (why did I think it a good idea  to give away all my summer fat clothes?) or ... I could go on, but I\u2019ll  spare you. \n \n Momsomnia,  it\u2019s a bitch.\u00a0 So someone please get my son into a great school, throw  out all my piles of crap, and come cook healthy food for me and make me  run 5 miles to get it.\u00a0 Then I can get some sleep. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_279/isitspecial.html", "http://www.learningspring.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collyer_brothers", "http://www.weightwatchers.com/templates/marketing/Landing_1col_nonav.aspx?PageId=1163821"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/05/momsomnia-strikes-again.html", "title": "\nMomsomnia strikes again\n"},

Time, which seemed to slow down to a trickle and crawl while my father was busy disintegrating and dying had now sped up scarily such that I am blinking away whole days.  I breathe in and out and a week has passed \u2013 how can that be?  I have done nothing, not even a mere tenth of my endless Sisyphean to-do list has gotten done, yet still I\u2019m busy, breathless, spinning and spinning, not ever still, except to sleep, and that not near enough (for more on that see my NYC Moms blog post \u201c Momsomnia \u201d).  But while my whirling dervish act seems to be moving me no closer to my goals, it\u2019s keeping me from slipping back into the abyss.\u00a0 So I\u2019m spinning on, whirlpooling all the needs swirling around me: Jacob needs a new school; Ethan needs lots and lots of attention; my husband needs a wife (hey, so do I);  my apartment needs cleaning and de-cluttering; my mother needs everything; and I need to get seriously un-stuck. \n \nI\u2019m in limbo, but it\u2019s a busy, noisy limbo: I have (god help me) joined Twitter and am figuring out where I belong in all that.  My twitter handle (\u201chandle\u201d I am tickled by the retro 80\u2019s CB trucker feel of that) is @ squashedmom , if you must know, and I may or may not continue to travel there much. When you have an obsessive personality like mine (yeah, I\u2019ve finally figured that out about myself) it\u2019s either all or nothing, and I\u2019m not sure I need to get lost in the chatter all day long.  What drove me to this is that I\u2019ve recently joined the NYC Moms blog group. Through them, I have been plunged into the \u201cmom blogger\u201d universe which is vast and interesting and full of awesome women, and an incredible potential time suck.  I don\u2019t quite fit in and don\u2019t quite not fit in.  The autism and the whole dead father thing make me a bit of a drag, the pouty girl at the party. I want people to like me, but I\u2019m never going to be an \u201cit\u201d mom, whatever that is.  \n \nI still have all these half written posts crowding my brain space, just dangling in the computer, but I haven\u2019t been able to finish anything.  I have nothing ready to send out, yet strongly feel the need to fill some space, keep this blog thing going, mark my territory, say \u201cI am here\u201d.  So here is my first post about nothing.  Nothing but my feelings, which are, I suppose, something, but I don\u2019t assume enough to hold anyone\u2019s attention for long, so I think I should stop before I begin to bore even myself.  A little navel gazing, I suppose, is not a terrible thing, but I promise it will be followed up by something about something, soon.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nycmomsblog.com/2010/05/momsomnia-strikes-again.html", "http://twitter.com/squashedmom"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/05/little-navel-gazing-goes-long-way.html", "title": "\nA little navel gazing (goes a long way)\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 9, 2010", "body": "\n    There is a subtle war going on in my house over those green things on the plate.  You know: vegetables.  When you have children, even if you\u2019re all modern and psychological minded, it\u2019s still hard to not somehow expect them to be little carbon copies of you.  Well, in my case carbon copies plus a y chromosome here and there, since I have two boys. \n \nI was a child with wide and adventurous tastes in food.  I loved vegetables.  Asked to name my favorite foods, alongside the requisite M & Ms, burgers and peanut butter, I would have put artichoke, avocado and asparagus on my list.  And that\u2019s just the top of the alphabet. \n \nMy twin 7 year old sons, however are another matter.  Food is a complicated issue in our house.  Before they were born, (OK everyone groan now, we all remember the things we swore we would NEVER do that we find ourselves doing on a daily basis for survival) I just knew I was going to feed my children only healthy foods: lots of vegetables and fruit, no sugar or chemicals, etc. etc.  Not quite a member of the anti-junk militia, lets just say that I\u2019m no stranger to the organic section at Fairway, and my local little health food store is near and dear to my heart, and wallet. \n \nWhen they were babies and I could control every bite that went into their mouths (the occasional purple crayon notwithstanding), it was 90% organic and all good: lots of veggies, low sugar, low sodium, no artificial anything, yadda, yadda, yadda.  Though it was clear that one twin, Ethan, had a sweet tooth, greatly preferring the fruits to the vegetables, the sweet to the savory, they still pretty much ate what was offered, hungrily and happily. \n \nBut then life happened.  They became two year-olds.  With opinions. \n \nThen Jacob was diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum, and at three went on a special diet that made a huge difference in his physical and mental health, but created a royal pain in the ass in the kitchen.  Because Jacob\u2019s diet was now gluten and casein free, which to civilians out there means no dairy, no wheat or other gluten containing grains (like almost all other \u201cnormal\u201d grains - oats, barley, rye), he needed special foods bought and prepared for him.  And everywhere we went I had to carry a ton of food with, because you never know what\u2019s out there and Jake is a hungry guy.  Pizza, that birthday party staple: pure poison. \n \nSome families go all gluten/casein free (GF/CF) when one child needs to, but besides the fact that I love blue cheese too much to do that, Ethan would have starved to death.  Because he is, you see, a classic \u201cpicky eater\u201d who thinks vegetables are evil and would live on beige food, if at all possible. \n \nEthan once turned his nose up with disgust at a wonderful meal I had prepared, and delivered his judgment \u201cThat\u2019s not kid food!\u201d with a precise mix of disdain and dismissal that was so precociously teenagery, I almost dropped the bowl. \n \nWhere he got the notion that there is a specific entity out there - \u201ckid food\u201d - and that he has the right to demand being fed that and only that, all the time, I will never know.  It consists of things like chicken nuggets, french fries, bologna, hot dogs, bagels, string cheese, goldfish crackers, chocolate milk ... you\u2019re getting the picture.  All those things I\u2019d sworn would never cross his lips, let alone become the mainstay of his diet. \n \nI promise the processed meats he eats are all organic and nitrate free. At home. Just pretend you\u2019ve never seen me buy my hungry kid an occasional hot dog from a vendor in Central Park, OK? \n \nI thank my stars that Ethan really likes fruit.  Well, some fruit.  OK, apples, peaches and grapes.  OK, Granny Smith apples - peeled; yellow peaches - when they are in season and really ripe and only with the skin ON; and green grapes with absolutely no seeds.  Did I mention he\u2019s a picky eater? \n \nJacob, after happily devouring whatever we put in front of him for the longest time (did I mention that for a kid on the Autism Spectrum he is amazingly flexible, easy going and compliant, it\u2019s my \u201ctypical\u201d one who is more high maintenance), then started to have opinions about what he would and would not eat at about three and a half.  When he would so clearly say to us \u201cI don\u2019t like that\u201d about a food, how could we not positively reinforce such great communication by honoring his request and removing the offending item from his food repertoire?  Unfortunately, almost all vegetables soon fell into this category. \n \nLately, though a miraculous thing has been happening: veggies are back in!  It started last year when he was obsessed with the Wonder Pets. They ate celery \u2013 so Jake ate celery.  And now, thanks to a cute little PBS web video he watches over and over, Jacob has been asking for broccoli and carrots every day.  It makes me so happy to steam his broccoli for him, I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next on the vegetable agenda. \n \nEthan at this point is still a hopeless cause.  I take heart from what a friend with grown children told me.  Her three boys were all kid food aficionados and vegetable avoiders like Ethan when young, but they grew up and discovered girls. Sophisticated New York City girls who were not impressed by Neanderthal males who would not eat salads and dissed all things green.  By the time those boys came home from college they were chastising their mother for not stocking their favorite vegetables in the house. \n \nSo therein lies my hope for the future.  To think that Ethan might one day yell at me for not providing him with swiss chard\u2026 well, a mom can dream, can\u2019t she. \n \n NOTE: This post originally  appeared on the sadly closed SVMG NYC Moms Blog. \u00a0  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/05/bring-on-broccoli.html", "title": "\nBring on the Broccoli\n"},

Not a big throw-up kind of hurting, but bothering him, nonetheless.\u00a0 I explained how sometimes we feel our feelings with our bodies, and that his sadness about his grandpa dying had gone to his stomach.\u00a0 That made a lot of sense to him, and he then told a friend at school that his stomach was missing his grandfather.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nHe\u2019s also been drawing on the dead grandfather currency, trying to use \u201cI\u2019m just feeling too sad about Grandpa\u201d as a way to ward off undesired homework, or accountability for bad behavior.\u00a0 He gets mad when I don\u2019t buy it, but as I said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not too sad to play Pokemon on the DS with Evan for hours, you\u2019re not too sad to do your writing work.\u201d \n \nWhich is not to say his feelings aren\u2019t there, it\u2019s just that they are somewhat diffuse; like me, he had been internally preparing for this day for some time. Although of course, you can never really be prepared to come aground on grief\u2019s shoals. \n \nOne place Ethan\u2019s feelings have come out, though, is as an increased overall sensitivity, and thus, I\u2019m afraid, a decreasing tolerance for his autistic twin brother, Jacob.\u00a0 \n \nJacob was driving Ethan around the bend this morning.\u00a0 He was in a terrible cheerful mood, talking and singing constantly with great abandon and Ethan was making himself hoarse with bellowing \u201cMo-omm, make him go away!\u201d \n \nAnd I was being a bad mommy and blithely ignoring it this morning, having one of those days when I just can\u2019t deal, can\u2019t insert myself into the fray. \n \n\u201cWhen someone says stop, you have to stop\u201d I ineffectively remind Jacob for the thousandth time. \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way your brother is, don\u2019t take it personally\u201d I re-remind Ethan, who, like his father, is even capable of taking the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t take it personally\u201d quite personally. \n \n\u201cHe\u2019s just doing it to drive me crazy\u201d says Ethan, again for the umpteenth time (this being a familiar show tune in our house) to which this morning I reply \u201cReally? Because if that\u2019s true that would be wonderful, that would mean he understood that he was being annoying, and he was being purposeful about it.\u201d \n \nOne thing that drives Ethan completely bonkers is Jacob\u2019s inability to parse gender.\u00a0 To Jacob \u201cshe\u201d and \u201che\u201d are interchangeable labels, to be used when referencing people, animals or talking trains.\u00a0 \u201cShe\u2019s scared\u201d Jacob will say looking at a favorite picture in his book of Thomas the Tank Engine about to crash through a window.\u00a0 Besides the fact that Jacob still likes the intolerably baby-ish Thomas, this last bit really sets Ethan off \u2013 \u201cThomas is a boy \u2013 a boy!!!! You say HE, not SHE! HE! HE!\u201d \n \nThe bigger issue, of course, is that Jacob will refer to Ethan as \u201cshe\u201d and you just don\u2019t do that to a seven year old boy, unless you\u2019re picking a fight. Which, of course, is the farthest thing from Jacob\u2019s mind. \n \nI guess one of the wonderful qualities of kids like Jacob is their complete incapacity for prejudice, since they do not really notice and place people into groups by surface difference.\u00a0 Jacob takes each person as that person, he doesn\u2019t immediately start to shuffle them into categories when he meets them and thus shape and limit his expectations of them. \n \nI do, we neuro-typicals all do, can\u2019t help it: \u201cmale\u201d \u201cfemale\u201d \u201cmy race\u201d \u201canother race\u201d \u201cmy kids\u2019 age\u201d \u201cmy mother\u2019s age\u201d \u201cyounger than me\u201d older than me\u201d \u201colder than me, but looks younger (damn!)\u201d.\u00a0 Everyone neatly plopped into their slots, subconsciously, at first glance. We only drill down to their specificity as we get to know them, if we get to know them. \n \nFor Jake it\u2019s all specifics, and he will ask a homeless man on the street the same question he would a King, were he ever to meet one.\u00a0 Which is not to say he doesn\u2019t see or notice differences, he just doesn\u2019t base any expectations upon them.  \n \nSomeday this will probably change as he becomes more like the rest of us, and I will then find myself missing his sweet autistic innocence.\u00a0 But then if he doesn\u2019t change, that is the more troublesome worry. \n \nHe is currently so incapable of deliberate meanness, I fear for him in the rough and tumble world of male adolescence he will all too soon find himself thrust into.\u00a0 We all want to protect our children from the world\u2019s dangers, but children with special needs, how much more fragile, vulnerable they are freezes your heart if you let yourself think too much about it.\u00a0  \n \nSo I go about my days right now trying skip lightly across the surface, not to dwell in the deeper places where the whirlpools lie.\u00a0 Until of course, Ethan asks his next killer question, then I\u2019ll just take a big breath and dive.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/04/from-birth-to-death-and-messy-stuff-in.html", "title": "\nFrom Birth To Death (and the messy stuff in the middle)\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 28, 2010", "body": "\n    Today, Sunday March 28th, we held a memorial service for my father, Jim Steinhardt, who died two weeks ago.\u00a0 We celebrated his life of nearly 93 years, and we said goodbye. Family members gathered, some who hadn\u2019t seen each other in eons, since childhood or a landmark event long ago, when we were all younger and skinnier. \n \nMy many mommy friends came to offer support, bear witness; and so did my Mother\u2019s last few remaining ones: tough old birds and goats who, like my folks, had lived long and had the white hair and softly leathered faces to prove it.\u00a0 Anyone who wished to share a memory of Jim was invited to speak.\u00a0 First I read an abbreviated version of my blog post, \" Nearly Finished Business \" written in early March, when it was clear it was near the end of Dad's life.\u00a0 And then I read this eulogy: \n \n \nWell, Dad, you broke your word: you always told us that you were going to live forever.\u00a0 You had too much to do, no time for this dying stuff.\u00a0 Like Woody Allen you preferred to achieve immortality through not dying, but barring that, you certainly wanted to do it through your work living on. And it will.  \n \nWhat a body of work it is.\u00a0 My father had quite an eye, and wasn\u2019t afraid to use it.\u00a0 He thought his taste was better than anyone else\u2019s and he was usually right.\u00a0 He was an artist through and through: a painter, a sculptor, but most of all a photographer; he used his camera to show us the world we looked at every day, but never saw.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nMy father was a loving and generous, though not perfect man. I know that the father of my childhood was a very different one than my sister Lois and my brother Bruce had, and then the father of my adult years was different still: more present, more connected.\u00a0 In the same way, he was a very different husband to my mother than to his first wife, Janet, those many years ago. \n \nMy parents had a love match that lasted fifty one years. I can only hope to be so lucky.\u00a0 They met in summer, at a resort in the Berkshires called The Music Inn, each having recently come out of a relationship; my Dad a marriage, my Mom\u2026 not quite a marriage (they were shacking up). \n \nThey liked each other fierce and found out they lived mere blocks away in Greenwich Village.\u00a0 Vowing to play it cool and go slow, they then proceeded to see each other every day, becoming inseparable as soon as they got home to the city.\u00a0  \n \nMy father knew that my mother\u2019s previous boyfriend had asked her to marry him many, many times, and she had held off, knowing he just wasn\u2019t quite the right one.\u00a0 Hopelessly smitten and hoping that he WAS the right one, my father soon proposed, saying\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m only going to ask you to marry me three times, and this is the first.\u201d\u00a0 She said yes, of course, (who could resist such a handsome and charming man) and the rest, as they say, is history. \n \nOne thing my parents had in common, was that they had both spent many years in and out of psychoanalytic psychotherapy.\u00a0 A therapist Dad went to late in life spoke to me with amazement that a man in his 80\u2019s was looking to change and grow, become a better self.\u00a0 And that was my Dad: wanting to do more, go further, an explorer to the end, his openness to transformation one of his most admirable qualities. \n \nMy father struggled with feelings of worthlessness, mixed, of course, with an overblown sense of entitlement, a not uncommon brew.\u00a0 As a child, he had felt inferior to other boys who had present fathers, when he did not. His own father was barely there, sporadically coming and mostly going, leaving Dad a lost boy, fatherless.\u00a0 At 92 he still felt the sting, still cried at the memories.\u00a0  \n \nHe told me the exception to this was at camp where all the boys were temporarily fatherless, like him.\u00a0 Shy and receding at school, at camp he excelled, becoming captain of the basketball team, a lead actor in plays -- directed by the camp\u2019s drama counselor Julie Garfinkel, known to the world as John Garfield.\u00a0\u00a0 Later in life Dad grew more and more into this, his camp self, and that was more the man I knew, confident in his decisions; a man who knew what he wanted and made things happen. \n \nSo, Dad was not one of those silent, cipher type fathers.\u00a0 He was a great story teller, self reflexive; the stories he told - of childhood, his first marriage, his working life - were not just descriptions of who, what, where.\u00a0 He told his stories from the inside, sharing thoughts and feelings, analyzing the ways past events had cascaded down through his life shaping and shading the present. \n \nSo I can say that I truly knew my father. And while nothing makes the pain of his loss disappear, it does lessen it, because I have all these stories living on fully inside me.\u00a0  \n \nOne of the stories he told me was of a pivotal moment, one of those junctures which mark a sharp \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d forever on our personal timelines.\u00a0 This moment came to him while folk dancing.\u00a0 And Dad came to dance through my mother.\u00a0 She had been an International Folk Dancer in her youth, and was she ever graceful, (still is). \n \nAfter I had left home for college, and my parents had their evenings once again to themselves, my mother found a regular folk dance group nearby, and since they were that kind of couple, she took Dad with her.\u00a0 Not a natural joiner, he came along a little reluctantly at first, and then with blooming enthusiasm.\u00a0  \n \nDad told me that back in his earlier days, he had always felt very separate from other people, more of an observer than a participant.\u00a0 He confessed that he had in fact, been somewhat of a snob.\u00a0 Considering himself an intellectual, he felt different, superior to the common folk of middle America (his passion for football notwithstanding).\u00a0\u00a0 He would resist engaging in conversation with strangers, thinking, \u201cwhat could I possibly have to say to them, or they to me that would be of interest\u201d.\u00a0  \n \nThen one day when he was beginning to dance regularly with my mother, he stepped into the circle to begin a dance.\u00a0 As he took the hands of his fellow dancers on either side and began to follow the steps, he felt something new: he felt himself move out beyond the borders of his skin, to flow into the person on his right and his left and then he felt them all becoming one circle; the dancers becoming the dance. \n \nIt felt like community, that thing he had never known: a joining with others vastly different, yet the differences not mattering as he danced in step with these other humans.\u00a0 He suddenly knew that what connected him to other people was larger than what separated him from them. This was a visceral and completely spontaneous moment of revelation for him.\u00a0 And he said it changed him forever.  \n \nThis wonderfully coincided with the beginning of my parents\u2019 period of grand travels.\u00a0 For twenty years, they explored the world together. Mom and Dad took trips to Greece, Hungary, Italy, Turkey, Alaska, Mexico, Trinidad, and Israel, to name a few places on their expansive itinerary. \n \nAnd these were not your standard touristy tours of national monuments.\u00a0 Because my father was a photographer and because my parents were now both people-engagers, which my mother had ever been, they went deep into the hearts of these places, seeking out the spots the locals frequented, letting themselves enter into the \u201cis-ness\u201d of a place.  \n \nDad photographed seine hauling fishermen on a beach in Grenada bringing in the catch, and then grabbed the rope to help pull.\u00a0 My parents wandered into a village, deep in the upcountry hills of Bali, where preparations for a wedding were taking place, and they stayed the day, joined the wedding party, and Dad spontaneously became their wedding photographer. \n \nEven when they took tours, these were folk dance tours, and they involved going to small villages, learning the local dances from the people who lived there, then joining hands and joyously dancing together with them.\u00a0  \n \nWhat afforded them these wonderful trips was that the business Dad had owned since he quit advertising photography in 1963, the Steinhardt Gallery, had finally become an incredibly successful gallery, mostly of American and International Handcrafts (that international part allowing them to most conveniently - and truthfully - write off most of their trips as business expenses.)\u00a0 My father and mother ran it together by then, and the 1975 move from Westbury to Huntington was perfectly timed to coincide with the resurgence of Huntington\u2019s downtown. \n \nWhile Dad had never set out to become a businessman, he ended up as a happily successful one.\u00a0 And a big part of this is that he ran the business like a family, in a good way. Everyone who worked there, and all the artisans they dealt with were treated with fairness and respect, and, always, warmth and humor.  \n \nThere was this feeling growing up that the gallery was another entity, the fourth member of our nuclear family.\u00a0 I was in on it since the beginning, as a young girl spending Saturdays there with Mom and Dad, crayon coloring on matte board scraps. \n \nBy the time I went off to college I was a full time staff member: sales clerk, assistant buyer, gift wrap specialist (I was good with the odd shapes).\u00a0 Working with my father brought a collegial familiarity that anyone who hasn\u2019t grown up in a \u201cmom and pop\u201d shop doesn\u2019t quite get.\u00a0 And I\u2019m so glad that I got to have that.  \n \nSome time after my parents sold the gallery and retired to Florida, a private collector of photography found my father and bought a body of his work, a big fan.\u00a0 And this reawakened in Dad a burning desire to have his photographs not be forgotten. \n \nMy father often told me that he never became a famous photographer because of a nearly Shakespearean series of bad, unlucky breaks combined with a retiring personality.\u00a0 He said \u201cI wasn\u2019t good at self promotion, something always held me back.\u201d\u00a0  \n \nAnyone who has spent time with him in these last years of life knows he has now made up for that.\u00a0 He became fond of telling anyone and everyone in earshot what a great photographer he was.\u00a0 And he was not wrong, his best photographs  are  astonishing. \n \nWe who have lived with these images for many years have maybe developed an over familiarity with them and are used to their beauty and lyric vision, that amazing eye Dad had.\u00a0 But looking over his work recently, preparing for this memorial, I was again stunned by their power.\u00a0 He does belong in that pantheon with the \u201cgreats\u201d and it is my one regret that I could not muster an all out campaign to bring him to an even larger audience in his lifetime.\u00a0  \n \nAnd in his later years he so enjoyed the recognition, basked in the spots of bright light that came his way as he was being rediscovered by the photography community.\u00a0 B&W Magazine, a high end, high gloss, fine art photography magazine did a lovely four page \u201cspotlight\u201d feature on him. \n \nHis work now sits on the walls, and in the vaults of some major players: The Jewish Museum, The Brooklyn Museum of Art, The De Young Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, Eastman House, The International Center for Photography, The Museum of the City of New York, and I could go on. \n \nJust last year, The National Art Gallery in Washington, D.C. acquired a body of his work for their permanent collection, and it made Dad very happy to be considered a national treasure. \n \nIn 2006, a photograph of his from the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s permanent collection was chosen to hang in the wonderful Susan Sontag tribute show \u201cOn Photography\u201d, illustrating a paragraph of text about finding beauty in the mundane, the discarded.\u00a0\u00a0 We didn\u2019t find out about this until the very end of the show\u2019s run, as the curator had only my parents old Florida address and it took months for her letter to wend its way North to the senior residence on the Riverdale / Yonkers border where my folks were then living.\u00a0 But as soon as we knew, I rushed my parents into the city to meet the curator and see the show, just in time. \n \nDad\u2019s health was in a bit of a downturn at that moment, so he was frail and needed to use a loaner wheel chair to visit with his photograph in a gallery on an upper floor.\u00a0 Still, seated in front of it, he had the singular pleasure of looking at a photograph of his hanging on the wall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \n \nAs he sat there, some young European tourists approached him and asked if he were not indeed the photographer, Jim Steinhardt.\u00a0 It turns out they were German photography students, had studied his work at University, and were thrilled and honored to meet him.\u00a0\u00a0 Dad glowed like the sun that day, in spite of his infirmity. \n \nAnd throughout all the ups and downs the roller coaster of his health has taken in the years since, one thing has remained constant: whenever, however he could, Jim would work; planning books on his themes: children at play, men in the street, the abstract beauties of ordinary objects. \n \nLooking over his photos, he was visiting with old friends: the cement worker, shirtless, sporting six pack abs \u2013 that always sells well in his San Francisco gallery; 4 year old Bruce enduring a haircut; Lois, a living doll far cuter than the windowful behind her; a man\u2019s crooked arm, hand clutching cigar, dangling pearls; inside the protective embrace of a giant stone eagle, a woman reads a book, absorbed; a faded doyenne seated at a sidewalk caf\u00e9, contemplates the abyss; a bespectacled Santa reading the paper, sips a cup of java. \n \nDad went through his old negatives again, finding hidden gems, wondering \u201dwhy the hell didn\u2019t I print this the first time?\u201d\u00a0  \n \nAnd there was, of course, that other constant in my father\u2019s life, my mother, Sylvia Heimer Steinhardt, whose love and support made all Dad\u2019s work possible.\u00a0 And then, at the end, when even the work had finally drifted away, there was still my mother, their love. \n \nWhen he still had words, he would tell her over and over how glad he was to have her, how much her love meant to him. It was not easy to care for him in these last, plummeting, months, when he would senselessly rage, as well as praise. But Mom made sure to only curse him out when her back was turned to him so that, deaf, he would have no idea.\u00a0  \n \nAt the very, very end, he hated to be parted from her for even a minute, knowing that she was all that he needed. And there was my mother, holding Dad\u2019s hand, softly rubbing his back; his beacon against the coming darkness. \n \nThrough the magic time machine of Facebook, I have recently reconnected with a number of childhood friends that I had not spoken with for decades.\u00a0 As I had posted a notice of my father\u2019s passing, a number of these friends have reached out to me, and it has been wonderful to hear from people who knew my Dad in his prime. \n \nHe has been slowly fading for so long now, that most of my current friends have only ever seen the shadow father, deaf and weakened with only occasional sparkle. I\u2019d like to read a note here, from Alice who was a friend from 3rd grade on through high school. \n \n\u201cDear Varda, \nJoan sent me the message about your father\u2019s upcoming memorial service. I wish to extend to you my deepest condolences for your loss. I always remember both of your parents with fondness. Your father was warm and funny and your mother always open and loving. Your mother called me \u2018Alley Cat\u2019; it made me feel special that she had a nickname for me. What I remember most about your father was his free, artistic spirit, which made me think anything in life is possible. \nWith best wishes, Alice\u201d \n \nDad I like to think that you have passed on your \u201cfree, artistic spirit\u201d to your children, your grandchildren and all whose lives you have touched, if ever so tangentially, like those German students at the Met. \n \nI remember when I was a teen and you were teaching photography at a college \u2013 a feat you were so proud of, having never made it beyond high school yourself - you had gotten your feedback evaluations and it made you so happy that your students had loved you, had written glowing reports of how encouraging and inspiring you had been to them.\u00a0 It was important to you to feel that you were passing on, handing down to the next generations something of import; you couldn\u2019t give your students your incredible eye, but you could help them to open up their own and teach them to see like photographers.\u00a0  \n \nIt is a legacy to be proud of.\u00a0 You were a father I could be, and have been, proud of.\u00a0 You will live on, both as a person in the hearts and minds of those who have known and loved you, and as an artist: the beauty and depth of your work astounding and inspiring a multitude more.\u00a0 Goodbye, Dad.\u00a0 I love you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thesquashedbologna.blogspot.com/2010/03/nearly-finished-business.html"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/03/goodbye-goodbye-goodbye-jim-steinhardts.html", "title": "\nGoodbye, Goodbye, Goodbye: Jim Steinhardt\u2019s Eulogy\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "body": "\n    My father has been dead three weeks and three days and I have not yet had a chance to fully mourn him.\u00a0 All has conspired against me: I\u2019ve had a constant housefull of people, my mother-in-law landed in the hospital, my husband flew up to Rochester to attend his friend\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral, and I could go on. There was all the intensive planning of, and then producing Dad\u2019s memorial, pretty much completely on my own.\u00a0 And then the very day after that, Spring Break: ten glorious straight days with my children.\u00a0 And then there's being there as much as I can to support my train wreck of a mother, who needs so much more than I can ever give.\u00a0  \n \nMy mother needs a husband, a partner, all that I can not be.\u00a0 Her sadness is bottomless, and there is nothing I can say, but sit there and hold her hand, rest her head on my shoulder and murmur \u201cI know\u201d while she softly cries and wails her continual lament \u201che\u2019s gone, he\u2019s not there\u201d.\u00a0 But, of course, I don\u2019t really know, for I still have my husband, my children here beside me, binding me to the world (though I am ghosting through my days right now.) She has lost it all in one fell swoop. They had one of those close marriages, a couple-y couple, the seam between their bodies zipped up full, partners in work and home for fifty-one years.\u00a0 She was his best friend and partner, then his caretaker, and now who is she?\u00a0 My mother has to forge a new identity at 87, and widow is not an easy one.\u00a0 We are trying to pry her from his side, bring her back to life.\u00a0 He is now ashes and I need to lift her ashen face back to the sun, but who am I to do that, fatherless and wrung out from his hellish drawn out demise? \n \nSo I am walking around half here and half\u2026where? Not sure where the there is, but it\u2019s certainly not here, in my skull, my skin. I am scooped hollow, lightly tethered.\u00a0 I am not nearly present enough for my children, and for that I am sorry.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t have it in me, finding spring vacation week hellish, with my kids still young enough to want all mommy all the time. When they are teenagers, all eye-rolls and hugely embarrassed by maternal affection, I will chastise myself for taking this for granted, for not wringing every drop of pleasure out of their still greedy and physical love. \n \nA friend says she thinks I\u2019m processing my grief well: my writing, pouring over photo albums, showing Dad\u2019s work to anyone I can buttonhole for five minutes is all mourning in a healthy way, but that\u2019s only half right.\u00a0 I know there is still a solid core that has yet to release; the fissionable nucleus, holding on, holding out, waiting for me to have the luxury of time without the pull of a child\u2019s hand or my mother\u2019s sorrow to find my own. \n \nThe night my father died, a tremendous storm \u2013 \u201cworst in 30 years\u201d \u2013 descended upon New York where it howled for three days straight, much like my mother, grieving mightily. A huge shaggy swirling near monsoon, winds downed trees, tore off roofs, and de-powered a multitude. Rivers swelled and breached, and somehow this seemed fitting: the right weather to accompany the passing of an outsized man.\u00a0 \u201cGod is crying, too\u201d said my atheist/agnostic, nearly animist mother. And that sounded about right.\u00a0 Sunshine and blue-skied beauty would have been unbearable while we were being drenched in sadness.\u00a0  \n \nAnd again, the day of his memorial service: yet another storm, begun in drizzly mist then whipping up into a full Nor\u2019easter umbrella killer, a days long flooding fury.\u00a0 This was as it should be, the incongruity of death and sunny days avoided, watching the world sob along with us was strangely satisfying, I would have scowled again at sunshine.  \n \nAnd now spring has come on full in a violent burst, the trees exploding: magnolias, cherries, apples all a-blossom. The forsythias seemed to jump up yellow, on to spring green overnight, and I am dazed and unprepared for it all, my heart still wintry and bare.\u00a0 But the children are out and prancing and I cannot stay home with shades drawn, because life, it goes on; and with each step forward, I draw away from my father, from the winter of his slowly dying bit by bit.\u00a0 And so we thaw together, the earth and I, and I hold my children tight and kiss their shaggy sweet smelling heads and smile as they clamber all over me, knowing this too shall end. \n \nAnd so I count the days until spring break is over and I can have a moment to myself, to mourn, to sleep, to drink my cup of tea while it is still hot, and perhaps to miss my children as they pass their days at school and creep ever so slowly away from my bosom.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/04/griefs-half-life.html", "title": "\nGrief\u2019s Half Life\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 18, 2010", "body": "\n    An old Pete Seeger children\u2019s song* has taken up residence in my head. It goes: \u201cWhy, oh why, oh why, oh; why, oh why, oh why? Because, because, because, because. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.\u201d \n \nThis is the perfect personal funeral dirge for my father for oh so many reasons, not the least of which is that my father in his older years bears an uncanny resemblance to Pete Seeger. They are both of them old men of an age, with oversize glasses, thinning white hair, slightly scruffy white beards, significant noses, intense blue eyes, and weathered faces of good humor. And it\u2019s not just their faces, it\u2019s body type, and even more, an overall physicality, the way they hold themselves, gestures, nearly unnerving in similarity at times.  \n \nAnd then there\u2019s more than just the physical, it\u2019s the spirit: strong willed, iconoclastic, full on artist down to the bones.\u00a0 A resemblance so strong that when I met Pete in person, I almost called him Dad, that when Ethan peeked over my shoulder at Pete on the computer he said \u201cLet me see that cool picture of Grandpa.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 I know that when next that lovely  Pete Seeger documentary  comes on PBS, I\u2019m going to bawl my eyes out, seeing Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. \n \nSo it\u2019s all there in that song -- the ultimate question, the ultimate answer, and the ultimate. Why? Because. Goodbye.\u00a0 Do I even need to say more?\u00a0 Obviously I do, because I am going to.\u00a0 My husband, Danny, calls it \u201clong form\u201d when describing why a conversation with someone went on for hours, and yes, obviously, I\u2019m prone to it. \n \nSo this is my refrain now: \u201cWhy, oh why?\u201d and it\u2019s nothing to do with why he had to die.\u00a0 That\u2019s my poor mother\u2019s broken lament; bereaved and bereft, she has had half her heart torn asunder.\u00a0 I know how old and worn his heart had become, the unfair gift of living beyond the years our bodies were originally engineered for; the parts are past warranty and sometimes they just go. Ninety-three is a goodly long time and I would feel greedy for wanting more, a fact often pointed out to me by my husband who lost his father as a teen, never to see him grow painfully old. \n \nSo my big \u201cwhy?\u201d is not to the universe, it\u2019s internal; for me, to me: Why did I get on a plane to Vermont on Friday morning when I knew there was a 50/50 chance my father wouldn\u2019t make it till my return Sunday night?\u00a0 And any answer I can come up with for that is dicey. It reeks of the clear vision of hindsight. \n \nThe full on truth is that I do not know what propelled me to continue with my plans for the Vermont trip, whose significance will be spelled out in a bit.\u00a0 After I went and then returned in a hair raising, white knuckle airplane ride on Saturday through a huge nor\u2019easter, my friends all comforted me with the common wisdom that while parents will often wait for an absent child to return before they die, they will also often wait for a present and care-giving child to leave before they feel it\u2019s OK to go.  \n \nWe can\u2019t know what Dad\u2019s process was in all this, his thinking folded under the veil of his infirmity.\u00a0 But I do know this: on Thursday night my sister Lois, Dad\u2019s other daughter, was coming up to New York to be with him.\u00a0 Before I left I stood beside his bed, took his huge, gnarled, but amazingly still strong hand in mine, put my face inches from his and looked deep into the blue blue of his eyes.\u00a0 I knew he was lost in there often, but for that moment he swam up to meet me, not quite at the surface, but close enough that I knew he knew I was there. \n \nI told him I was leaving and Lois was coming, that I would be back in two days.\u00a0 I told him my brother Bruce, his son, was coming on Saturday.\u00a0 I told him that I loved him, that I knew he loved me. I thanked him for always believing in me and always supporting me.\u00a0 I told him he was the best father a girl could ever have.\u00a0 Even if not 100% true, and my 20 year-old self would have howled at all this, it was enough true that at this point I could say it and mean it and give that to him.\u00a0 \n \nI asked him to wait for me, but told him that if he couldn\u2019t, if he had to go before I came back, that I understood.\u00a0 And I kissed him, and I kissed him again, and I left.\u00a0 This was the last time I saw my father alive.  \n \nMy cousin Jessie says that among her many friends who were at her gathering in Vermont, when she told the tale of my absence, she heard many similar stories: of parents who would not die, who clung to wracked, wrecked, pain filled bodies beyond all sense, until their children signaled it was OK to let go by taking leave for a bit.\u00a0 The theory is that by telling my Dad I was going, I gave him permission to die. \n \nI\u2019d like to think this is true, that after all the being there, clear eyed, for every gruesome thing on this journey, I hadn\u2019t just bounced into a bubble of denial.\u00a0 Because when I left on Friday morning, after calling the hospice to see how his night had gone, to see how he was doing, I really thought he was going to wait for me, that he would still be there Monday morning when I would waltz back into his room.\u00a0 There were, actually, some reasons to believe this.\u00a0  \n \nHe had arrived at the hospice terribly dehydrated, having not taken much of anything in for two days prior.\u00a0 And besides the fluids flowing into his veins through the IV, he was actually eating and drinking a bit now, too. A half cup of juice here, a few slurps of soup there, even a whole bowl full of applesauce, twice.\u00a0 And he did indeed have a good day on Friday: he recognized my sister, Lois and kissed her. Three times.\u00a0 He recognized my mother and opened his arms and hugged her.\u00a0 He ate a bowl of soup with gusto.\u00a0 But it was not to last.\u00a0 We have been calling it, half jokingly, the New England Clam Chowder of Death, because not long after dinner Dad had a crisis that turned the tide, and then by midnight, gone. \n \nAll this was relayed to me by phone, Vermont not the getaway that it was supposed to be, but instead a series of phone calls, intercut with a few moments of rest, food and family.\u00a0 But in those few moments I was loved and nurtured in a way that allowed me to come home and do all the rest, the sad and ongoing tasks of cleaning up after a life lived.  \n \nAnd now, the \u201cWhy?\u201d of the Vermont trip: this is the year I turn fifty, the big 5-0, half a century, officially middle aged (if I\u2019m planning to live to a hundred).\u00a0 My cousin Jessie turns all our ages 4 months before me, my personal herald, paving my way into the next year.\u00a0 And since so many of her friends also turn 50 this year, she wanted to make her birthday special, planned a weekend party for just us fiftyish females at a winter lodge up the mountain: a Saturday afternoon of cross country skiing and snowshoeing, then an amazing potluck dinner followed by a giant slumber party at the lodge and brunch the next morning.\u00a0 Heaven.  \n \nThere is not room, nor is this the place, to go into why my cousin Jessie is so special and important to me, why my bond with her, in spite of our sometimes not connecting for busy busy months on end, is spider silk strong and permanent. Our lives are intertwined, her children dear to my heart, mine to hers.\u00a0 I have come to stay with her often enough that I know her friends, and to spend this time together would have been deeply significant to me.\u00a0  \n \nThe other leg of this thing is that this was going to be the first time since the boys were born that I had gone away alone.\u00a0 In all these years I have never had more than a few hours to myself, have never taken even a train ride, no less an airplane trip by myself.\u00a0 For 48 hours I was not going to have to take care of anyone.\u00a0 I had been looking forward to it as if my life depended on it, feeling that it did, telling everyone I was finally getting away. Big mistake.  \n \nWhen Jessie told me date of her party in January, a chill went up my spine, but I ignored it.\u00a0 I joked about it: \u201cWhat do you want to bet that Dad decides to pack it in that weekend and there goes my trip?\u201d\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t think it was actually going to happen, what were the odds?\u00a0 But really, when I booked the flight I should have just picked up a pen and written in that square on my calendar \u201cJim Steinhardt to die today\u201d.  \n \nIt\u2019s like my boys\u2019 birth date.\u00a0 One pregnant morning in January, when I knew I was having twins, but not yet the gender, and when I certainly had an accurate due date, their being conception known down to the nanosecond IVF twins, I awoke with a vision. Well, that\u2019s not exactly the right term, since there was no startling image involved.\u00a0 It was more like this, these words bubbled up into my consciousness as if read from a book: \u201cThe twins will be born on July 29th.\u201d\u00a0 And I then went about the rest of my pregnancy with that date stuck in my head, announced it to anyone who asked, even planned my parents\u2019 trip up from Florida with it in mind.\u00a0  \n \nBy mid June, heaving my torpedo shaped belly onto the sofa to splay under the air conditioning, a beached whale, I thought \u201cThis is insane, I\u2019m never going to make it to July 29th, that\u2019s 39 weeks, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m lasting more than another month like this!\u201d\u00a0 But read my boys\u2019 birth certificate: July 29th.\u00a0  \n \nSo even though I never thought Dad would last this long, and even though I simultaneously and conversely thought he was holding out for his 93rd birthday on March 25th, there was this nagging feeling that March 13th was the day, painted like a nasty red target, because on that date was scheduled the one thing big I was going to do, entirely for myself, in seven and a half years. \n \nAnd so, why? Why, oh why, oh why, oh why; why, oh why, oh why?\u00a0 The only answer: \u201cBecause,\u201d and then, well, \u201cgoodbye.\u201d \n \n \n*NOTE: \nThis song was actually written by Woody Guthrie, and if you want to Google it and hear it, you\u2019re probably going to get Woody's version. It\u2019s lovely, but the one in my head is Pete\u2019s from his 1964 Prague concert album from my childhood.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/03/why-oh-why.html", "title": "\nWhy, Oh Why?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 21, 2010", "body": "\n Ed, the wonderful VNS Hospice nurse didn\u2019t want to tell me, but on Tuesday when he\u2019d visited my father he thought he wouldn\u2019t last the night.\u00a0 Dad had been slipping for the past 2 weeks and was looking very ragged: sleeping all the time, no appetite, being confused and foggy when we did wake him up, his life lacking all coherence, now confined to a room. \n \nActually a few square feet of a room: his side of the bed, and the view out the window - a cityscape, vaguely west, their breathtakingly sweeping Hudson river panorama having been given up, along with their nominal independence when my folks left their west side apartment last May for the comforts of assisted living. \n \nSo imagine Ed\u2019s surprise when he came on Friday to find Dad sitting up, slurping his soup with gusto and loudly longing for a beer to accompany it.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a lot stronger today\u201d he told me with amazement in his voice.\u00a0 Much experienced in the ways of the dying, he\u2019s mostly seen people trundle off in one direction only. \n \nThat\u2019s when he confessed that when he\u2019d told me on Tuesday \u201cHe\u2019s not doing so well.\u201d He\u2019d meant REALLY not doing so well. But, as I\u2019ve said before, Dad is most decidedly not going gentle into that good night; he is going kicking and screaming and crying and dragging both feet, even if he ends up a few toes shy of ten by the end. He is, indeed, burning and raving at close of day. \n \nHe is being kept alive not by machines or miracles of medicine or any other state-of-the-art artificial means.\u00a0 He is being kept alive by his own hugely strong ego, his spirit, his body\u2019s memory of life and liveliness.\u00a0 He is weak as a kitten: this formerly 6 foot, now 5 foot 10 frame gaunt and skeletal, his hands appearing like huge knobby mitts stuck onto stick arms: my Dad the snowman.\u00a0  \n \nI had once again taken the boys to see to see Dad \u201cone last time\u201d, because I knew my Mother was missing them and needed to see her grandchildren, the future.\u00a0 Knowing the end is near, she will barely leave my father\u2019s side, although all she does is cry and cry and she truly needs all the distraction we can muster for her. \n \nSo even though I had said we were done with all that, last Saturday found the three of us trekking across town.\u00a0 We walk in the door, Ethan peeks into the bedroom where Dad has taken up final residence, and, never one to mince words, announces: \u201cGrandpa looks dead\u201d, refusing to go into the room. \n \nJacob on the other hand, autistic obliviousness on his side, bounds into the bedroom, and after a cheery \u201cHi, Grandpa!\u201d proceeds to take over grandpa\u2019s dry erase white board to draw happy smiling green suns.\u00a0 We had been using that board to communicate with my deaf father, back when he could still decode written words. \n \nFor the past 2 weeks, however, he has squinted, looked at the writing like its hieroglyphics and waggled the back of his hand at it in the universal gesture of \u201ctake that away, it\u2019s not for me\u201d, so we have given up on communication beyond smiles, hugs, and gentle strokes. \n \nJacob then settles into bed next to my father, not noticing that his grandpa has no idea who he is, and pats him on the back saying \u201cclose your eyes Grandpa, go to sleep Grandpa\u201d and \u201cfeel better, Grandpa.\u201d \n \nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s making me cry more, Ethan\u2019s blunt truth, Jacob\u2019s sweet, cheerful care or my own deep, deep sadness that my father often does not recognize me, is losing his connection to us who are still his earthly tether. \n \nAnd then on Thursday, when he\u2019s \u201cup\u201d again an old friend, Gloria, comes to visit.\u00a0 I had sent out an \u201cIf you want to see him to say good-bye, come SOON\u201d e-mail to their few remaining friends, and Gloria had answered the call.\u00a0 \n \nDad just lit up when she came into the room, clearly recognizing her, and so delighted she\u2019d come.\u00a0 He was able to stay awake long enough for them to spend time together, and she also had a long wonderfully distracting visit with my Mom. \n \nGloria had been Dad\u2019s agent when he was an advertising photographer, and also his girlfriend for a while, before my Mom.\u00a0 After she left, Mom suggested: \u201cThis has cheered him up so much, maybe we should find all of Jim\u2019s old lovers and get them to come visit.\u201d\u00a0  \n \nOnce again, in spite it all, Mom\u2019s sense of humor is still intact.\u00a0 When that goes I\u2019ll start to really worry about her.\u00a0  \n \nAnd because I\u2019ve quoted it here, and it\u2019s wonderful and relevant for me right now, here\u2019s that Dylan Thomas poem, written in 1940 as his father was going blind: \n \n \n Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night \n \nDo not go gentle into that good night, \nOld age should burn and rave at close of day; \nRage, rage against the dying of the light. \n \nThough wise men at their end know dark is right, \nBecause their words had forked no lightning they \nDo not go gentle into that good night. \n \nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright \nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light. \n \nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, \nAnd learn, too late, they grieve it on its way, \nDo not go gentle into that good night. \n \nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight \nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, \nRage, rage against the dying of the light. \n \nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height, \nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. \nDo not go gentle into that good night. \nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/02/raging-against-dying.html", "title": "\nRaging against the dying\n"},

Then, yesterday, finally able to dredge around in his mind to find one true word: \u201cHelp!\u201d  \n \nAnd yes, now it\u2019s a lot like caring for a pre-verbal infant.\u00a0 A while ago, after my father\u2019s first big collapse, on December 17th, 2007 our family\u2019s personal day of infamy, when he fell apart in my apartment, unable to breathe, drowning in heart failure, and 911 came in the nick of time, he had a rather awful hospitalization. \n \nThis was the day of my parents move back to Manhattan from the wilds of Riverdale.\u00a0 Six blocks from my house, so I could keep a closer eye on them, so they could have a grocery store and diner and drug store mere feet from their front door, no longer confined to manicured grounds, dependent upon the whims of occasional aides and cabdrivers or the available time of their daughter to venture into the world.\u00a0  \n \nWhat I had not calculated was that the ambulance would feel it necessary to bring my father to the closest hospital where he had no connections.\u00a0 All my father\u2019s doctors at that time were still up North, but I was told that even though the EMTs had stabilized him with lasix and nitro, time was of the essence.\u00a0 \n \nIf I had had a moment to think things through I would have pointed out that Mt. Sinai was really just as close, as the trip through Central Park is such a quick one, but I was clearly not thinking clearly, in the rush of my first brush with \u201coh, my God my Dad just almost died\u201d. \n \nAnd while they might have decent cardiac care in the ER, the ward my father was put into was just terrible.\u00a0 Since he was stable, he did not go into the ICU, and because of his age, he was placed on a geriatric unit, where the nurses really didn\u2019t give two shits and didn\u2019t want to be bothered with an angry old man in pain. \n \nSo when the narcotic pain killers they gave him caused him terrible constipation and they just didn\u2019t care, when they handed me a pair of gloves and told me they wouldn\u2019t be able to get around to removing his impacted stool until some time tomorrow but I could have a go at it if I wished, what could I do but dig in. \n \nThis was my first bout with cringe inducing, dignity stripping physical care of my father and it was a doozy.\u00a0 My big revelation after that was that while cleaning the poop off your baby\u2019s bottom is a loving act full of joy and promise, cleaning the poop out of your father\u2019s bottom is a loving act full of sorrow and pain. \n \nSo my father is in a post-verbal state, which is like and so unlike my children when they were pre-verbal; situationally parallel, but oh so emotionally disparate.\u00a0 You always remember your developing child\u2019s first words, but what about your deteriorating parent\u2019s last? \u00a0 How can you know that you\u2019ve heard it, and that there truly are\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 more\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 words\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 come? \n \nWhen Jacob was a little babe, he had all the earmarks of becoming a language learner: he cooed, he babbled, he goo-gooed on time, he could and would mimic words with perfect diction. One time he reached up to grab my hand while I was changing him; \u201cCareful\u201d I said and he repeated it back to me, clear as a bell.\u00a0 But then it didn\u2019t happen, he froze there, he wasn\u2019t talking. \n \nAs he got older and the specificity of his issues were becoming apparent, I realized how un-hooked speech is from language.\u00a0 Language in all its human-making glory, requires communicative intent and Jacob had absolutely none.\u00a0  \n \nAs time went on he could label like a champ. Hold up a cup he said \"cup\", show him a running faucet and he said \"water', but when he was thirsty he would just cry and cry.\u00a0 The parts of his brain that needed to engage to know that these wordy things could be used to communicate his needs, his wants, his feelings; those connections just hadn\u2019t been made yet.\u00a0 The first time Jake made a request, found words to be of use and not just a neat parlor trick for labeling stuff, I cried and cried in relief.  \n \nAsk anyone what makes us human, what separates us from our animal cousins, and one of the first things they\u2019ll say is language, the ability to communicate thoughts and feelings.\u00a0 As we learn more about animal communication and how they sometimes can do even that, the distinction is often further refined, drawing the human line at the concepts of abstraction and self reflection, our ability to ponder and pronounce upon the parameters of our existence.\u00a0 All this, my son Jacob eventually gained, and my father has now lost.\u00a0  \n \nHowever, this is all such a simplification, since my father, though stripped of his ability to communicate through words, though un-moored in time and space, is still quite thoroughly human.\u00a0 Those of us who have known and loved him when he was still who he was, can still see the Jim in him. \n \nThis is why we have struggled so hard to keep him home, with support from caregivers who knew him when.\u00a0 If we were to put him in a nursing home, all they would see, all they would know is the gibbering demented old man he has become, and it is much harder to give loving care when that\u2019s all there is.  \n \nMy sister Lois, who works in the field of elder care, has said that Dad is not ready to die yet, because he is still processing something, even though we can\u2019t know exactly what.\u00a0 We have to trust that he\u2019s there in his brain somewhere, doing just that, the final work of his life, getting ready to go.\u00a0  \n \nI also think of all the non-verbal Autistic children, communicating through their behaviors, communing with the infinitesimal and the infinite that we, too busy, often overlook.\u00a0 These children whose loving parents know how fully human they are, who hold unknown universes inside themselves, are so often treated so shabbily by the world, cast off because they have no words to trade.\u00a0  \n \nI think how thin the line is between Jacob and his non-verbal brethren; I think about the time before words, when we did not know if they would ever come, if he would ever understand us, or live \u201cself directed\u201d for the rest of his life. \n \nIt\u2019s called the autism spectrum because it stretches so far across many sometime divides, and connects us all.\u00a0 As parents of children on the spectrum our hearts stretch, too, take us to places we never imagined, never needed to imagine in the time before. \n \nAnd so I go about my daily life. I pick Ethan up at school, try to look like I understand as he proudly shares his latest Pokemon conquests.\u00a0 I gently correct Jacob yet again when he calls the female cat \u201che\u201d.\u00a0 I hold my father\u2019s hand as he mumbles and raves. \n \nI sit down to write about it all, using words like tiny lifesavers, keeping myself afloat, here in the choppy waters of my little pond, my wavelength of the spectrum, my slice of life.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/03/whats-word.html", "title": "\nWhat\u2019s the word?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 4, 2010", "body": "\n    I have been gnawing at the big thoughts again, wondering how we decide what is of value.\u00a0 I grew up in a family that emphatically valued experiences over things.\u00a0 Money was tight.\u00a0 We drove cars until they died, we re-covered an old sofa so many times I can date family photos by slipcover era: \u201coh, there\u2019s the green and blue abstract amoebas, it must be 1968 to 72.\u201d \n \nBut we went to the movies every week, museums constantly, theater and live music regularly, and took a modest vacation every year.\u00a0 It is easy enough to say that was good. \n \nAlthough the world we live in puts a premium on the material, no one would question that building memories is as important as building buildings.\u00a0 Memories may be ephemeral but count as real, and potentially more lasting than things themselves.\u00a0 The twin towers are gone, but who among us who have walked in their shadows cannot call them up at will? \n \nBut what happens when memory is gone? When the ability to lay down new memories erodes, and the mind sieves everything out every few hours so that all that remains is dust and ghosts, thin wisps of almost memory.\u00a0 This is the state my mother finds herself in, and it is breaking my heart.\u00a0  \n \nToday, we were visiting with my friend Elizabeth in her lovely sun filled apartment.\u00a0 My mother comes to her building weekly to see her therapist, who helps her hold the burden of her nearly unbearable sadness.\u00a0 I shepherd my mother to all her appointments these days, she cannot negotiate the city on her own.\u00a0 Too many moves in too few years with a memory deficient brain means she is constantly unmoored, needs steering.\u00a0  \n \nOne time this summer, when Dad was still going out, their lovely and loving aide, Mina, had taken them both to his doctor\u2019s appointment.\u00a0 Mom didn\u2019t want to go into the exam room with Dad that day, and chose to sit in the waiting room.\u00a0 Bored and hungry there, she decided to go out to find a nearby blueberry muffin and cup of hot cocoa.\u00a0 An hour later, Mina, canvassing every coffee shop, finally found her blocks away, wandering, wondering where it was she was getting back to. \n \nCan't you just see it: the irritated calls from the doctor\u2019s office about my increasingly agitated father left alone in the waiting room; Mina panicked, searching; me frantically hunting a sitter so I could come join the fracas, deciding if it was time to get the police involved yet. Oh that was a fun day, let me tell you. \n \nBut back to today: after my mother\u2019s appointment, we have a tradition of having a light bite together.\u00a0 Our regular haunt was the Hot & Crusty around the corner, common watering hole of old ladies and toddlers with nannies.\u00a0\u00a0 This suits my mother just fine, as she loves little kids and she is an old lady.\u00a0 But lately we have been going to visit with my friend Elizabeth and take our tea in her apartment. \n \nElizabeth is fond of my parents and has known them the best of all my newer, Mommy friends.\u00a0 Her own family is far, far away in Australia, and she is happy for grandmotherly company.\u00a0 When I ring her to ask if we can come by this week, she says yes and adds with a laugh \u201cAnd your mother can admire my apartment again and ask how many children I have and look at their pictures and tell me how lovely my family is again.\u201d \n \nI love Elizabeth because she takes lightly and in stride the fact that despite having met her dozens of times and spent hours in her company, my mother only vaguely remembers my friend, smiling politely at her on the street when they run into each other. \n \nMy mother\u2019s ability to record new memories is now so deeply compromised.\u00a0 Trying to give people a snapshot of what that\u2019s like, I resort to movie metaphors: \u201dIt\u2019s \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019\u201d I\u2019ll say.\u00a0 \u201dShe lives a whole day and when she wakes up in the morning, it\u2019s wiped clean, like it never happened.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 And no, not completely, not 100 percent, but close enough. \n \nTwo days home after my father\u2019s disastrous hospitalization that nearly consumed him and us, after spending countless hours with him in the intense and unhappy cardiac ICU, I make a reference to it and she asks: \u201cWhat operation?\u00a0 Was Jim in the hospital?\u201d \n \nAnd I suppose, in some ways, that works for her.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t have to remember our holding my father\u2019s arms down as he screams \u201cStop them, they\u2019re hurting me, make them stop!\u201d to keep him from clawing at the doctors and nurses who are saving his life by applying hard pressure to the pumping, spurting blood vessels in his groin that he had ruptured by standing up and trying to walk away from his bed with a tube still inserted.\u00a0 This is a precious memory I alone get to keep.  \n \nSo my mother and I are at Elizabeth\u2019s and although our visits usually coincide with nap-time, this time her two and a half year old daughter, Caroline, is awake.\u00a0 My mother finds nothing more delightful in the world than an engaged and engaging toddler, and so she is in Grandma heaven. \n \nSince all Caroline\u2019s actual grandparents live many oceans away, she, too, is delighted to have the complete attention of someone who is happy to play peek-a-boo games with her for a length of time that would make most people droop.\u00a0 My mother is completely in the moment, completely charmed by this adorable little girl, having the time of her life.\u00a0 When she gets home she will even tell Mina about her how much fun she had today. \n \nI feel very contented that I have provided Mom some most excellent distraction from the deep and abiding sadness that fills her life with my father now.\u00a0 But I know that next week she will ask Elizabeth if she has any children again, and this takes bites out of my happiness. \n \nThis is yet my corollary to those old zen questions; besides that tree in the silent forest, and the one clapping hand: did it mean anything to give my mother this happy moment if it does not become a memory, if it dissipates into synaptic dust? \n \nMy father, now curled up inside his mind, will not know, will not remember what we have done, are doing for him.\u00a0 But we will know.\u00a0 Ethan, at 5, observing me getting ready to go out on another parent related mission commented: \u201cAnd when you and Daddy get old I\u2019ll take care of you like you take care of Grandma and Grandpa.\u201d\u00a0 Yup, kid, you get it.\u00a0 And like the old saying goes, may we live long enough to become a burden to you. \n \nMy sister in law, Bern, went through all this a while ago, twice in rapid succession with both her parents.\u00a0 She recently wrote me a lovely note and shared this: \n \n\u201cOne day, during the time my mother was sick, I was helping her put on her shoes, kneeling at her feet. She looked down at me and said, \u2018One day you'll be glad you were here to help me.\u2019 I said, \u2018I'm glad now to be able to help you!\u2019 But I understand now what she meant. Because while you're going through it, you're feeling more pain than satisfaction. But one day, I did indeed come to feel how much that caring meant to my mother and thus to me.\u201c \n \nSo I guess that has to be the answer for me, that even though my mother will not remember it, I will remember that I gave her this bright, happy moment.\u00a0 And that will have to be enough.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/03/groundhog-day.html", "title": "\nGroundhog Day\n"},

Time marches our bodies physically in one direction only (science fiction speculations notwithstanding) and yet we retain all the ages we have ever been inside us.\u00a0  \n \nIt is a hoary old aphorism that in old age we recapitulate a second childhood, yet bearing witness to it renders it with fresh sad amazement.\u00a0 At least my children were out of diapers before my father moved into them.\u00a0 That much sandwich, I think even I couldn\u2019t take. \n \nMy father, as soon as he arrived home from the December hospital disaster, before we lost him into the folds of his mind, when he was clearly nearing the end, but still present with us, demanded that Bruce and Lois, my brother and sister, come to visit him, NOW.\u00a0 He summoned them.\u00a0 And was very clear he wanted them not just for a day, but for a considerable length of time, a real visit.\u00a0 He had a lot to say. \n \nNo one ever said it out loud, but we all knew he wanted to say goodbye while he was still himself.\u00a0 A wise move on his part.\u00a0  \n \nBecause the visit was over a weekend, their presence allowed me to spend some much needed time with my children, who had barely seen me during my father\u2019s intense hospital stay.\u00a0 So I was not there with them while Dad talked and talked, somehow knowing his time with words was coming to an end.\u00a0 Bruce told me that Dad had been dreaming vividly about his father and brother, dead these many years. \n \nAlthough there was love there, he had never been close with his older brother, Alan.\u00a0 Of vastly different temperaments and fortunes, they embodied the fork in my father\u2019s family: one tine made up of artist dreamers and the other all ambitious businessmen.\u00a0 My father the former, his brother the latter.\u00a0  \n \nHis thoughts of his father were, as always, complex and painful.\u00a0 His father had been rather a rat bastard, living with and supporting the family only sporadically, keeping another life, and presumably other women, in the city.\u00a0 The one time he took my father & his brother out with him, into the city, he warned them: \u201cI\u2019m your Uncle, not your Father. My city friends don\u2019t know I have kids, and I intend to keep it that way, so call me Uncle John.\u201d \n \nAt 92 my father still cries about how he felt abandoned by his father, how he always felt less than the other boys he knew, who had fathers at home every night.\u00a0 Whether those fathers kissed or beat those sons didn\u2019t matter, theirs were there, his was not.\u00a0  \n \nI have been turning out drawers looking for old photos of Dad, thinking I\u2019ll need them soon.\u00a0 I\u2019ve found quite few of the father I never knew \u2013 a dapper young man who wore suits with panache and a bowtie.\u00a0 The father of my youth was a middle aged hipster, and then an old hippie.\u00a0 I think he wore a suit once, to my first wedding, under protest.\u00a0 But it tickles me to see him with blond curls in short pants. \n \nI show the old pictures to Ethan and his brain can barely wrap around the concept: Grandpa was once a baby!\u00a0 It\u2019s hard enough for him to imagine his own parents as babies, children, teenagers themselves, in spite of the voluminous photographic evidence that supports such madness.\u00a0 But that old man to baby transformation is just too much for him.\u00a0  \n \nAge is one thing to the body, quite another to the brain.\u00a0 I remember my father saying to me, just a few years back, how amazed he is every time he looks into a mirror, to see an old man looking back at him, because in his own mind he still feels himself to be the same person he was at 20.\u00a0 How can the mind have such coherence when the body changes so?\u00a0  \n \nThe changes of age still baffle Ethan.\u00a0 Used to the dictates of childhood: older = bigger, he is confused by this idea of old people shrinking, or why his father\u2019s brother, his Uncle Jim, is shorter than his Father, even though Jim is older.\u00a0\u00a0 He thinks it hysterical that he will be taller than me and is counting the minutes till the magic moment. \n \n\u201cWill I be as tall as Daddy? he asks, hoping to cross that threshold of six feet.\u00a0 \u201cWho knows?\u201d I answer, thinking \u201cprobably not, you will probably always be shorter than your brother\u201d; thinking \u201clet him have that one advantage please, don\u2019t have to win everything.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Ethan is one minute older, but Jacob was, and will likely always be taller, larger.\u00a0 \u201cFair\u201d I\u2019d thought at their birth, \u201cthey each have one starting advantage.\u201d \n \nKnowing I was having fraternal twins I expected difference.\u00a0 Little did I know what was coming down the pike.\u00a0  \n \nJacob, too has a grasp of age and change.\u00a0 He will look at old photos of himself and his brother and say: \u201cThat\u2019s baby Ethan, that\u2019s baby Jacob\u201d\u00a0 However, the size = age corollary has an even stronger hold on Jacob.\u00a0 \u201cCocoa\u2019s a baby\u201d he keeps saying about our middle aged cat.\u00a0 Seven pounds sopping wet, the boys were about her weight when born.\u00a0 So he is right, she is baby sized.\u00a0 But two years older then the he is, imagine that. \n \nAs I search for a way to take the ribbon of this post and tie it up into a neat bow for a tidy ending, I see how very meandering it has been.\u00a0 Ruminative, I suppose, does not lend itself to tidy, and I guess that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to be today, with loose fringy ends all over the place. \n \nKind of like my life.\u00a0 Imagine that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/THDA4rBiY1I/AAAAAAAAAE8/YJMyRqKV0J4/s1600/Jim+as+baby+copy.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/02/imagine-that.html", "title": "\nImagine that\n"},

In reality, so I could take care of them, too.\u00a0 \n \n That was when I realized what it meant to be a part of that often cited \u201cSandwich Generation\u201d demographic.  I am especially so because I am an older parent who is also the daughter of older parents.  Common for my generation / locale / socioeconomic milieu.  Very uncommon for theirs.  Heard often at my suburban elementary school, when my parents came to an event: \u201dOh, your grandparents are here.\u201d \n \nI am calling this blog \u201cThe Squashed Bologna\u201d because that\u2019s what I started saying, at first laughingly, then later less so, as the responsibilities of intensive elder care bumped up against the all encompassing wonderful maelstrom that is the parenting of young children:  \u201cOh, this is \u2018the sandwich generation\u2019, that must be why I feel like the squashed meat in the middle all the time.\u201d \n \nI think what finally pushed me over the brink from thinking to actually writing is the fact that my father is actively, acutely dying right now.  It\u2019s a long, slow, painful, process.  For us, that is.  He\u2019s so out of it, I don\u2019t know quite what it is for him.  Very scary I think. He has gone from sleeping all the time (20 hours a day) to being awake and agitated almost all the time. \n \nEven heavily sedated, he will fall asleep, only to bolt awake after less than an hour (and on the bad days, every 5 minutes) sit upright, or even stand up \u2013 a feat his doctors claimed impossible for a man at his level of infirmity \u2013 and say something like \u201cI have to go, I have to get there!\u201d or \u201ctake me, come on let\u2019s go!\u201d   Some might say his mind is gone, but I think at a very essential level his inner psyche understands that he is dying, and all the almosts, the might-have-beens, the shoulda-coulda-wouldas of his life are tormenting him.\u00a0 \n \n  He has unfinished business and he knows the clock is about to run out. Hell, at nearly 93 he\u2019s already in double over time.  So he is compelled, driven to get going, get moving, get it finished, get it done, even if he can\u2019t for the life of him tell me where he wants to go and what he plans to do when he gets there. \n \nMy Mother is, needless to say, having a very hard time.  She says, so sadly \u201cThat\u2019s not Jim anymore, I don\u2019t have a husband anymore.\u201d  And she is right.  She has, we have, a giant, angry, needy baby; diapers and all. \n \nI got some good news about my Mom today:  her wonderful doctor called with the results of her blood work (I\u2019d taken her to the doctor earlier this week for a much needed check-up) and they were \u201cperfectly normal\u201d. Her cholesterol was 115, and heavy on the good stuff \u2013 all the more amazing as her main dietary staples are hot chocolate, blueberry muffins and ice cream. \n \nThere is so much more to say here, but it\u2019s a start.  Tomorrow (or whenever I can get back to this): more about that other slice of bread \u2013 my now seven and a half year old twin boys.  And did I mention that one of them is on the Autism Spectrum? \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/02/squashed-bologna-notes-from-front-line.html", "title": "\nThe Squashed Bologna: a slice of life in the sandwich generation\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 11, 2010", "body": "\n    Sick day + sick day + snow day = recycling day.\u00a0 I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I do want to keep this blog thing moving along, and haven\u2019t really had a chance to write anything much, what with my gut exploding for two days, then the city transforming into a lovely snowdome today, necessitating hours of sledding and a home full of hot-cocoa fueled children.\u00a0 I know me; if I let anything slide too long it just slips right off my plate and I will forget about it for an embarrassingly long period of time.\u00a0 The gift of my ADD brain.\u00a0 Did I mention that the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree?\u00a0 Scratch your kid with a developmental difference and you will see a familiar flea jumping off.\u00a0  \n \nOne of my favorite Autism books is  Not Even Wrong  by Paul Collins.\u00a0 He is a wonderful, wonderful writer; a historian who has a son that he is discovering is autistic as he is being inexplicably drawn to researching the story of Peter the wild boy, possibly the first documented Autistic in English history, for his next book.\u00a0 Talking with his mother he is reminded that he himself was once placed in special ed because of his preternaturally acute hearing which caused him to micro focus and/or tune out extraneous noise and/or tantrum when overwhelmed by the aural assaults of the world.\u00a0 Apple and tree, apple and tree.  \n \nBut once again, I am digressing. Oh, yes, today I am digging into the bowels of my computer, pawing through the snippets I\u2019ve written over the past few years, and pulling out something that I\u2019ve always been particularly fond of.\u00a0  \n \nThis was written when the boys were just three and Jacob was much more Autistic than he is now.\u00a0 My parents were living in an \u201cindependent senior residence\u201d at the North edge of Riverdale, and much more spry than they are now.\u00a0 Four years ago, but seems like a hundred: my children evolving, my parents devolving; I sometimes feel like the hub of an insanely spiraling merry go round. \n \nSo here is my \u201cBalloon Story\u201d written on September 10th, 2005, and posted on Urban Baby (remember THAT crazy site?) in response to a mother posting about a tough day w/ her Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) son: \n \nHang in there, we ALL have those days.\u00a0 I had one today myself:\u00a0 I went to visit my parents at their retirement community for \"family day\" with my 3 year-old twin sons. One is on the Autism Spectrum w/ a PDD-NOS diagnosis, the other is typically developing, even a bit precocious.\u00a0\u00a0 My PDD son was just having an \"off\" day - melting down over every little thing.\u00a0 Usually he LOVES the bounce house but they would not let him into it until he let go of the pointy metal toy in his hand, and when I took it away he just couldn\u2019t get over it. He kept crying & screaming \"I want Mommy\" even while I was holding him and I just lost it --\u00a0 hissed \"I am your fucking Mommy, now stop it\" in his ear (NOT my proudest Mommy moment.)\u00a0 OK, it turns out I was really pre-menstrual\u00a0 (I just got my period in middle of night, which is why I am up and typing at 3 AM - waiting for Motrin to kick in so I can get back to sleep) so I have, maybe, an itty bitty bit of an excuse for that.\u00a0  \n \nAnd then there was my typical son who was just having the time of his life - enjoying his Grandparents, the rides, the other kids, playing and conversing away and I had one of those awful moments when I let myself think what if.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat if they were both typically developing?\u201d And I knew that this would be such a FUN time in my and their lives. Because my typical kid, while also a lot of work and an occasional total pain in the ass (like all little kids) is a HELL of a lot of fun at this stage, talking and commenting on everything with a great sense of humor, interested in the whole world, and trying to figure out how he fits in it.\u00a0 And how much effort with so little reward EVERYTHING with my PDD kid is, just comes crashing down on me at those moments.\u00a0 And the truly awful thing is that, for an instant, hating Autism spills into hating my son. There, I've said it.\u00a0  \n \nAnd then, of course, everything gets better, and he eats lunch and gets in a better mood, & goes into the bounce house & has fun. And even though he's lying on the grass spacing out holding a toy between his eye and the sun while his twin brother is getting his face painted while chatting w/ his Grandma, it's OK. And I remember that 5 months ago I'd been begging God to please just let him say \"Mommy\".\u00a0 And at the end of the party we're the last family left, so my boys get ALL the helium balloons they've decorated the grounds with.\u00a0 And while my typical guy wants to hoard & hold onto his, my PDD guy is finding total joy in releasing them one by one to watch them sail away into the perfect blue sky.\u00a0 \"Kite, Kite\" he says and \"Bye, Bye, balloon\" and he even waves. And it's OK -- it's just MY family. \n \nOK, that\u2019s all for today.\u00a0 I know it was supposed to be Ethan\u2019s day, but he\u2019ll just have to wait, which he just hates to do. And did I mention he has a touch of ADD, too?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Not-Even-Wrong-Adventures-Autism/dp/1582343675"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/02/blast-from-my-past.html", "title": "\nA blast from my past\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 7, 2010", "body": "\n    I said I was going to talk about my children, but first (forgive this repeat, my Facebook friends) I just wanted to share this moment of levity from my Mom, who has otherwise been crying all week:\u00a0 A bedside commode chair for my Dad arrived the other day w/ a tag that said: \u201cChecked and working properly, and ready for use.\u201d Mom read it, paused, then said \u201cLet\u2019s hang that on Jim\u2019s penis.\u201d With everything that\u2019s going on, I\u2019m very glad she still has her sense of humor. \n \nOK, on to the kids.\u00a0 Actually, this exemplifies what\u2019s been going on at my house for some time: my kids getting the short end of the stick because my parents are just so damn needy right now.\u00a0\u00a0 For many people, when their parents hit this stage, their kids are older - teenagers or in college, maybe even young adults who can actually themselves be helpful and involved in their grandparents\u2019 care.\u00a0 Not so much over here, in the land of s t r e t c h e d out generations.\u00a0 My husband and I each have significantly older siblings and between us 6 nieces and nephews who range in age from 27 to 35.\u00a0 So our kids\u2019 first cousins are all old enough to be their parents.\u00a0 Hmmm. \n \nI sometimes feel a little sad about this, remembering the amazing cousin conventions of my childhood. My Mother\u2019s brother\u2019s family was the one we spent the most time with, and I was incredibly close with his two daughters: my cousin Jessie, exactly my age, and Annette, 2 years younger. They were the closest thing to sisters for me, and I cherished the time we spent together. \n \nBut I digress.\u00a0 Get comfortable with that phrase. If you\u2019re going to follow this blog, you\u2019re going to hear it a lot.\u00a0 Straightforward, I am not.\u00a0 But I do get there eventually, and isn\u2019t the journey supposed to be half the fun?\u00a0 My son, Ethan, told me I was crazy when I quoted this aphorism to him in an attempt to instill some serenity into a fraught moment.\u00a0 He is a child of pointed passions and limited patience. If he had the vocabulary (and thank god he doesn\u2019t, yet) his motto would be \u201cscrew the journey, let\u2019s get there!\u201d\u00a0  \n \nJacob, on the other hand, is deliriously happy to be distracted by the myriad bright and shiny objects along his path; especially if they\u2019re spinning. The journey is the whole point for him \u2026 was there a destination?\u00a0 Unless, of course, we are going to the movies, then: let\u2019s get the hell there and start eating some popcorn, please! \n \nMy boys are in 2nd grade, and I will be turning 50 this summer.\u00a0 I am not the oldest mother in the world, but sometimes I feel like it.\u00a0 And yes, they are IVF twins, and yes, it was my own eggs (for those of you who need to know).\u00a0 Anyone who has seen baby pictures of me and of Ethan would know to never question that last part.\u00a0 Jacob, on the other hand is the frighteningly spitting image of my husband at 7.\u00a0 Danny (the husband) has told me of passing by the living room and thinking \u201cwhat is my childhood self doing, sitting on that sofa watching TV\u201d before his brain fully processes that Jacob is in the house.  \n \nAnd now for the thing that makes my life especially juicy and complicated, the kicker that I dropped at the end of my first blog: Jacob is on the Autism Spectrum.\u00a0 I hate to micro-label, to classify, to reduce him to his DSM IV category, but in the interests of providing a snapshot of him and our life together I will clarify where \u201con the spectrum\u201d he falls: high functioning PDD-NOS.\u00a0 When I tell people that, they often ask \u201cAspergers?\u201d\u00a0 But, no - he is, in reality, the anti-Aspergers boy.\u00a0 \n \nHis big big big issue is language processing, and he is actually very related, very interested in socializing, talks ALL the time (like his brother Ethan -- we are NOT a quiet family) and would much rather be with people than not.\u00a0 He just has no clue as to social rules: in the \u201cguess what is normal vs. what is not\u201d competition he would come in dead last.\u00a0 He has long conversations with the cat and is stumped as to why she won\u2019t answer him, when we do.\u00a0  \n \nHe is also one of the happiest children I know.\u00a0 Watching the Temple Grandin Movie on HBO tonight brought up so many intense feelings, I\u2019m not ready to write about it yet, still need to process it all, but one thing really struck me: when asked how she was cured, she answered that she was still, and always will be, Autistic.\u00a0 She had just learned how to get along in the world, and how to use the wonderfully unique aspects of her brain to build a life, a career.\u00a0 She is who she is; to quote her mother \u201cdifferent, not less.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nIt reminded me of how I answer Ethan when he asks me if I wish that I could change Jacob and make him not Autistc anymore.\u00a0 I always answer carefully, that I love and value Jacob as he is, and if I could simply make it easier for him to communicate with us and for us to communicate with him, then I would do it in a heartbeat.\u00a0 But if it meant also substantially changing him, taking away his spark, his magic happiness, the \u2018who\u2019 of him, then no, I would not change him for all the world.  \n \nThere is so much more to say about Jacob, but there is more time for that down the road. Ethan will want his day, and that will be tomorrow. \n \n \n Family 1967 - My Father with all his kids: Bernice (sister in law), Bruce, me, Lois \nP.S.: \nPreparing to post, reading over this blog, I realize I need to clarify something, for those confused about my sibling status.\u00a0 I will refer to myself as an only child, and then I\u2019ll mention my brother or sister, and people will get that \u201cum, did I miss something\u201d look on their faces.\u00a0 So here it is:\u00a0 \n \nI am the only child of my parents\u2019 marriage.\u00a0 My father had had another wife, another life, and two children previously: my (half) brother, Bruce, and my (half) sister, Lois.\u00a0 By the time I was born, Bruce was 18 and heading off to college, and Lois at 15, living with her mother and stepfather, really had no use for a baby sister.\u00a0 \n \nSo during my childhood, while I technically had half-siblings, I saw them infrequently, once or twice a year, and they functioned more like a young Aunt or Uncle to me than a brother and sister.\u00a0 We never lived together, and I was raised, for all intents and purposes, an only child.\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nEngagement remained sporadic, fading in and out through my (self-finding, family-distancing) 20\u2019s.\u00a0 Then my 30\u2019s and early 40\u2019s we connected for all the things that gather scattered families: graduations, weddings, births, milestone birthdays, and occasionally just hanging out. \n \nI remember the first time I came to stay with my brother and sister-in-law for a solo visit: I was out with my brother and he introduced me to someone as \u201cmy sister, Varda\u201d and I got this strange, quivering feeling inside, because I was so unused to hearing myself called anyone\u2019s sister. I liked it. \n \nAnd then in the last few years with our father\u2019s failing health and increasing dependence, Bruce and Lois and I have really come together as a team to care for him and my mother.\u00a0 However, as neither of them live here in New York, and my mother is not their mother, I am out alone on the front line, doing all the physical care, the medical management, the one who gets called next after 911, who heads out at 3 AM to the Mt. Sinai ER and comes home 36 hours later to clingy children.  \n \nBruce lives in a Washington, DC suburb and Lois lives in North Carolina.\u00a0 When they came up last March for Dad\u2019s 92nd birthday / Mom & Dad\u2019s 50th anniversary celebration, we had a rare late blizzard.\u00a0 When they came up in mid-December to spend some (possibly last) time with him after his disastrous hospitalization, we had the one big snowstorm of winter.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nMy kids are dying to sled, having anticipated 6 inches of snow today and gotten bupkis.\u00a0 DC is buried under 2 feet plus and North Carolina got a foot last week.\u00a0 I think I need to make Bruce and Lois come back up North, just so my kids can get a little toboggan time in.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_n3i4JTbM2tA/TBHvzztZXJI/AAAAAAAAACw/vqeh0lIfGes/s1600/Jim+%26+kids+1967.jpg"], "link": "http://www.squashedmom.com/2010/02/next-slice.html", "title": "\nThe next slice\n"}
